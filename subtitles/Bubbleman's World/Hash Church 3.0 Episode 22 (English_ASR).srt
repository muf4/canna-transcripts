morning hell yeah hey Johnny

28
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:22,438
B so I'm moving slowly today because I

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:26,560
uh herniated my disc oh dude

30
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,118
yesterday Tuesday huh when did you do

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,118
that yeah that's what happens when you

32
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:31,680
actually

33
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:32,799
I think it was probably Tuesday or

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
Wednesday because I ended up in the

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,640
hospital we not live yet I ended up in

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,479
the hospital on Thursday and Friday and

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,399
I'm just like how did you dude I'm sorry

38
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,000
to

39
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,000
hear I went for a

40
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,319
walk keep in mind John has broken almost

41
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,438
every bone in his body when he fell 30

42
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,239
feet off the scissor lift that he was

43
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,398
working on some years ago shattered like

44
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,920
the side of his body ended up on all the

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,200
opioids you guys have all heard the

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
story so it makes sense that John could

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,759
go for a walk and absolutely herniate

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,598
his disc funny enough John yesterday I

49
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,400
was on my electric skateboard with my

50
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,959
son in swamishri it around and I got a

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,959
little confidence and I went up this big

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,680
bank and I was kind of like halfway

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,840
through I was like what am I doing I've

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,280
got my six-year-old son on the board

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,039
with me well I bailed pretty good too

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,959
and uh sprained my wrists so I'm just

57
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,560
kind of you know this is what happens

58
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,400
when we get older we get we get a lot

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,800
more FR out we have to slow down and

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,280
then you look at our like when we were

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,040
kids we're like yeah so you know the

62
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,719
idea is to when you go for a walk don't

63
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,239
try and walk for two

64
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:48,439
hours well I'll tell you this moxley's

65
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,599
Mr Moxley Sal Mr Moxy salves I think you

66
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,878
met these guys with me before this is a

67
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:54,839
good product I got to say I have like 20

68
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,719
salves at the house here and I was

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,479
rubbing them all over my wrist over the

70
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,560
course of the last two days including

71
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,518
this non-cannabis one from from SJ or

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,080
Sage whatever they're call ni I got this

73
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,719
is the the goods really good to get all

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,840
these creams and all the stuff they have

75
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,039
I actually have about six or seven in my

76
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,519
bathroom so I have one from Jerry James

77
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,679
I got MJM creams I got I got so many

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,640
different ones Buddha bars all these

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,159
different creams and bars and they all

80
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,798
have different uh ingredients so they

81
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,519
actually work different ways some got

82
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,319
that eucalyptus smell or they got

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,560
different fragrances and and just those

84
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,079
smells actually to right so uh I love

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,158
the creams when you need them they're

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,799
great

87
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,280
but Johnny B's get he's getting into the

88
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,799
sensory science of cannabis and that's

89
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,640
literally why I invited our two newest

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,200

91

99
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,959
ton of conversations went extremely deep

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,759

129
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,599
the triome Institute we're a cannabis

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,320
education company that likes

131
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,960
to uh do the best job we can to mitigate

132
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,120
the misinformation that is prolific in

133
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:25,638
our industry and teach people things

134
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,280
that we know to be real and true based

135
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,000
off of lots of hard work lots of

136
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,599
research

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,439
um and we have a a different approach to

138
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,160
cannabis in in a variety of different

139
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,800
ways um I'm not going to bore you with

140
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,880
all of our courses and classes online

141
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,400
and all the different stuff we do I'll

142
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,800
I'll tell you more about the sensory

143
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:49,719
stuff since this is kind of what that

144
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,600
show is is about um I started a program

145
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,440
called

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,360
interpreting and interpreting came out

147
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,879
uh first in

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,759
2014 and the idea of interpreting is a

149
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:07,120
an approach to cannabis from more than

150
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,598
an expert level uh simply because it's

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
uh pretty common that when we meet

152
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:14,360
cannabis experts they don't necessarily

153
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,800
even know um a lot of the anatomic

154
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,520
features of a cannabis flower how many

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,520
different types of tricomes the plant

156
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,598
grows different functions are um and so

157
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,598
many other things such as even what's

158
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,199
the proper name of those little pistols

159
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,399
uh many cannabis experts don't know

160
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,439
those things but further from an

161
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,239
expertise perspective and more than an

162
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:41,399
expertise from a somaler perspective how

163
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,960
can we intimately engage with cannabis

164
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:47,879
flour in a way so intelligent that we

165
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,879
can actually gauge where on the spectrum

166
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,399
of psycho Pharmacy between stimulating

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,360
to sedative any domesticated hybrid

168
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,000
plant type will fall Within by just

169
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,080
engaging it um with with our with

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,959
ourselves

171
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,038
so no strain name no lab testing what is

172
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,159
the quality of this flour what is the

173
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,639
quality of this product and how is this

174
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,840
product going to make you feel

175
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,360
psychotropic and how would you know that

176
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,560
um and so our program utilizes uh three

177
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,080
different cranial nerves and the one

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,000
that's kind of the coolest is our fifth

179
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,878
cranial nerve which is the trigeminal

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,879
nerve which is the largest aspect of

181
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,479
interpreting methodology which which is

182
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:37,639
our actual ability to

183
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:40,279
organize how and where tpen accumulate

184
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,879
in group within the totality of

185
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:47,399
themselves in in the flower and your

186
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:50,599
ability to actually feel their Quantum

187
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,799
mechanic vibrations that do vibrate in

188
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,598
certain in particular ways and we

189
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,840
actually instruct people how to sense

190
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:01,319
and feel when cannabis is vibrating in

191
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:04,679
more of a simulating pattern or more of

192
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,479
a sedative pattern um and and how to

193
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,759
kind of analyze the flower in other ways

194
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,318
to kind of put it on a spectrum of you

195
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,960
know what is this what is this hybrid

196
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,720
plant what are we working with um so

197
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,719
that's just kind of that's just a good

198
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,840
way to scratch the surface of of

199
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,159
interpreting and I would love to uh

200
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,638
answer any of your questions and and

201
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,519
dive deep into it if you'd

202
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,680
like dude I love the I love the sensory

203
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,319
science aspect of what you're doing and

204
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,918
I I never you know I I dug down it I

205
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,080
always found it very interesting we

206
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,918
communicated a little bit I I sent you

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,038
some pictures early on for one of your

208
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,399
books that you did and I just I love

209
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:43,958
what you're doing man I I think that um

210
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
I see more and more people sort of

211
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,759
taking this new approach and I you know

212
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,039
I think ganier is has started a sort of

213
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,240
somaler type course you've got yours

214
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,039
going like the more that we can get of

215
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,480
this and the more we can kind of figure

216
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,799
out like what is it going to be called

217
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,879
that cannabis somaler cuz it's going to

218
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,559
be a different term I think but it's the

219
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,639
one we use when we cuz we're just at the

220
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,119
start of of of this sort of road but I I

221
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,958
I literally have to pause take a quick

222
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,159
break and say what's up to my homie Rick

223
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,159
delisi who just came into the room I

224
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,559
haven't talked I haven't talked to this

225
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:24,600

father's situation and slowly but surely

244
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,879
I got to the people who were necessary

245
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,159
to get my father proper

246

get him uh up and running as as a

250
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,159
certain factor in the industry in some

sense kind of get a little sort of

252
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,879
restitution for him but everything seems

253
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,560
to be going well and I just got my head

254
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:32,958

I gave you and it might have been in

262
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,919
Barcelona or Amsterdam one day when we

263
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200

268
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,360
were remember I didn't believe it

269
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,399
because it had been so long

270
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,440
so many trials and tribulations I was

271
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,639
like I was like yeah that shit's easier

272
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,959
said than done but you know I didn't

273
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,079
give up and through the network of a

274
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,319
great few

275
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:19,719
people yeah he's he's free and he's now

276
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,000
um [ __ ] an emancipated human holy

277
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,399
Christ

278
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,240
dude got out sooner Rich except for that

279
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,039
was the problem exactly you know you

280
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,759
know the deal

281
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:36,278
absolutely so yeah on that note I'm

282
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,879
gonna have a dab um awesome yeah it's so

283
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,200
good to see you dude I've I wasn't sure

284
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,120
if you were going to have time or be

285
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,000
able to come out and whatnot and and I

286
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,078
I'll be honest dude like part of me was

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,480
kind of like I didn't want to um like

288
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,199
try to be one of those people that were

289
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,680
going to be like you know I always just

290
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,639
wanted to give you a place to to sort of

291
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,719
share the story but once he got you

292
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,399
don't have

293
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,399
to I I wanted to be more um receptive

294
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,559
but it's also like at a certain point I

295
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,240
was so hounded upon the release it was

296
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,919
like I think on the 15th day I just said

297
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,480
to my dad like dude I'm not answering

298
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,679
another news company I'm not answering

299
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
another press call because they were

300
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,958
like getting to the point that they

301
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,680
wanted to do like first they did my 21y

302
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:22,319
old daughter in a story then they wanted

303
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,759
my 12-y old I was like no after the 14th

304
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,440
day I said like look everybody's got to

305
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,919
leave my dad was like no we got two more

306
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,399
barbecues with every I said Dad I can't

307
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,919
take it anymore like it's been 14 days

308
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,159
of non-stop like but it it's all worth

309
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,799
it in good retrospect it's just like you

310
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,078
know I really appreciated just going

311

back this time and having that two weeks

312
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:44,599
with him alone that was groundbreaking

313
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,720
for

314
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,839

326
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,399
so it's [ __ ] cool bro it's like it's

327
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,838
weird you know you want to hear the

328
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,000
weirdest thing this is what and this

329
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,199
isn't a good thing but it it runs

330
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,679
through my head kind of shocking the

331
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:30,439
snitch is dead and my dad's

332
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,399
free w you know what I mean and my dad

333
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,680
is lightweight healthy and the snitch is

334
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,679
dead so it's like and he died of natural

335
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,879
causes we didn't have to do anything

336
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,239
it's just like and I'm not saying I'm

337
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,240
glad he's dead that's not what I'm

338
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,480
saying I'm just saying no dude I get you

339
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,720
I get you I get you it is well it's Play

340
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,759
It's it played out the way it was

341
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,399
supposed to I'll be uh hitting a bowl

342
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,159
with you as well later on Max I want to

343
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,799
get into a little bit of uh how you guys

344
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,679
look at the different methods of

345
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,000
inhaling and not just the different

346
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:04,078
methods but also off the different you

347
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,078
know whether you're inhaling off of say

348
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:10,239
silicone carbide whether you're inhaling

349
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,198
off of quartz whether you're inhaling

350
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,079
off

351
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:17,120
of sapphire you know all of these

352
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:18,799
different surfaces and I don't know how

353
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,639
deep you've gone into this Max but if

354
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,078
you haven't I suggest hooking you up

355
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,360
with Brian Schroeder from denail who

356
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:30,239
seems to be like all he focuses on is

357
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,759
the way the tpin are preserved or

358
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,919
destroyed based on how the surface area

359
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,039
holds retains and releases heat and it's

360
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,439
a whole other rabbit hole and I'm sure

361
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,879
you've done some experimenting for me I

362
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
got pretty lucky with with with blue

363
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:48,078
yeah the slurper I mean this is kind of

364
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,279
a slurper right here all those slurpers

365
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,399
are great because they have so much air

366
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,360
intake so the oxygen just pushes the

367
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,320
vapor through yeah I got that one too I

368
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,399
like that one a lot the blender yeah I

369
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,160
got the blender right right here that's

370
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,559
what's

371
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:06,078
up that's what's up so I got all the the

372
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,078
JP gave me this a long while ago and

373
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,120
I've never used this and now I'm having

374
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,198
a hard time using it CU someone told me

375
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,600
they sold for like $1,200 and I was like

376
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:19,240
$1,200 for a banger that seems uh that

377
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,600
seems fairly extreme e Ewok glass

378
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,799
shipped me out this one it was a custom

379
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,278
10 Millie for my little uh Dustin re

380
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,159
here dope dud love the re raindrop the

381
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:31,720
first time I smoke this little this

382
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,159
little Banger I just was like I'll just

383
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,800
hit a normal siiz dab dude I felt like I

384
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,600
was in grade eight I got so high I not

385
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,240
only wanted to run like just wherever I

386
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,839
wanted to run out of my skin it was that

387
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,959
intense and uh you guys know I puff a

388
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,399
lot my first slab my first slurpers did

389
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,719
the same to me it was like everybody was

390
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,278
like have you ever had a Tura I was like

391
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,240
yeah whatever bro I had big dabs come on

392
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,519
let's do it put a normal dab on it was

393
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,360
just like at the end I was just like

394
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:05,480
holy [ __ ] this is a whole other level

395
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,480
anyway true Innovation to

396
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,120
um thanks for welcoming to welcoming me

397
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,720
to has

398
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,879
church that's yeah did you want me to

399
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:21,120
answer some things while you're

400
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,120
loading hell yeah do that

401
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,000
yes um I I don't want to disappoint you

402
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,278
but uh interpreting in and of itself has

403
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,159
not yet moved into cash and concentrates

404
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,879
from an interpreting perspective and the

405
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,838
reason for that is the amount of work

406
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:45,000
that needs to be done and that we're

407
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:48,920
doing from a cannabis and uh somaler

408
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,759
perspective and so we're currently we're

409
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,278
we're still not done developing and

410
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:59,240
learning the the flower aspects of uh

411
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:02,919
cannabis appalation which is brand new

412
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,000
cannabis tawa is it real or not and who

413
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:09,519
says so and what is cannabis tawa and

414
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,078
how would you work with it in different

415
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,000
capacities and then within that what

416
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,678
about typicity and typicity is a term

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,038
that the Cannabis industry doesn't know

418
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:24,798
yet that's a term from ven culture where

419
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:28,359
certain wines have tastes that are of

420
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:31,160
typical that typical unique thing that

421
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:34,558
could only be that one certain thing so

422
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,679
the way that Durban Poison has a flavor

423
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,798
and an aroma that is unlike anything

424
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,360
else in the world there's no fruit

425
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,359
there's no flower there's no perfume

426
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,000
there's no plant there's nothing in the

427
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:49,839
world that smells like Durban Poison and

428
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,480
it has and retains that unique flavor

429
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:56,599
sense so much so that it's a unique

430
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,679
characteristic that's recognizable well

431
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,359
what is what how do you how do you call

432
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:07,200
that that what is that that is its

433
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:09,199
topicity um and so our ability to

434
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,519
certify OG

435
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,038
genetics J if if if you go to a

436
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,879
dispensary and you're selling Jack

437
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:20,158
herrer it better damn smell and be in

438
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,559
Jack herrer but how do you do that with

439
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,919
cannabis morphology and how do you do

440
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,558
that with a black market culture that

441
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:31,360
has said hey dude I got Jack herrer just

442
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:33,720
so that bu so bad right and so so this

443
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,879
is what we're working on is is actually

444
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,240
being able to certify the

445
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,000
topicity of these OG genetics and these

446
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,279
OG varietals to give them the truth in

447
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,679
the marketplace that they deserve and so

448
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:53,279
our our work with just flower alone is

449
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:57,559
megalithic right and we're also working

450
00:18:53,279 --> 00:19:00,558
on apps um to to do to basically build

451
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:02,599
what Leaf Le always wishes it was which

452
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,639
is an actual application where if you

453
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:08,158
said you know what I want to look for

454
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,000
cannabis in a way where I'm going to

455
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,360
shop for a particular feeling which

456
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,679
might not come from a strain name or a

457
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:19,158
lab test and so our ability to use

458
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,720
interpreting methodology and also

459
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,799
extremely

460
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,759
sophisticated um lab work we're

461
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,038
partnered with guys who actually built a

462
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,640
cannabis Aroma

463
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:32,558
supercomputer and they're visually

464
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:36,880
seeing in three-dimensional gas

465
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:40,200
chromatography the full scope of of tpen

466
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,159
well over a 100 tpine their alcohols and

467
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:49,200
their theol and their polyphenols that

468
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:51,440
contribute to this true complexity of

469
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
where Aroma is coming from like a lot of

470
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,960
people think that the gas note in

471
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,798
cannabis is a tpine and a lot of people

472
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,279
think that that tpine is terpinolene and

473
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:05,720
what we're finding is that gas is a

474
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,359
theol and so how do we work with theol

475
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,000
in in the way that you guys were just

476
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,119
saying so you're talking about using

477
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,119
different bangers for the purposes of

478
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,558
tpin and you're talking about going down

479
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,359
rabbit holes it's like all right well

480
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,759
here's a whole brand new world called

481
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,199
flavorant and how do we how do we

482
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,240
operate with the complexity of the

483
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,440
flavors and Aroma characteristics that

484
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,960
cannabis truly has to offer um and and

485
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,440
these are things that I'm still learning

486
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,480
about and I'm still exploring so um you

487
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,480
know uh that that's kind of where

488
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:42,079
interpreting is right now uh

489
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,279
but we also believe that interpreting

490
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,158
can and does and deserve to move into

491
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,240
the world of

492
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,159
concentrates um and that's where I would

493
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,240
want help from guys who know

494
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,679
concentrates way better than I do uh cuz

495
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,558
I'm I'm a flower dude just all day

496
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,840
backyard flowers just growing in

497
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:03,119
horseshit behind the house house just

498
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:06,519
raw stinky ganja cooking in the

499
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:10,079
sun that's my ja person realize that

500
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:11,879
Turpin were so important what's that

501
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,798
when did I realize that tpin were so

502
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:19,039
important

503
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:21,200
yes um you know I'm gonna I'm gonna

504
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,839
tell I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell

505
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,600
you the truth about this uh it was when

506
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,119
I was buying cannabis as a kid on the

507
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,079
black market before there was

508
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,479
dispensaries and when I would smoke

509
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,879
certain flowers they affected me so

510
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,319
dramatically in such different ways that

511
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,760
I was actually able to stop taking pain

512
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:47,639
medication for my uh crooked spine or uh

513
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:50,679
anxiety medication for for my anxiety or

514
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,120
stop taking Aderall as a child just to

515
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,440
pay attention in school because when I

516
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,599
started smoking Island sweet skunk and

517
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,558
Golden Goat I just realized I I can pay

518
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:05,678
attention because these herbs are

519
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:09,000
stimulants the way that Aderall is a

520
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:13,159
stimulant except when I take Aderall I

521
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,919
can't eat I can't sleep and I'm an

522
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,120
[ __ ] and that's what meth does to you

523
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,720
because it's it's meth Aderall is an

524
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:24,000
amphetamine salt Rin is meth Al

525
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,600
phenidate they give kids meth as

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,278
Scholastic performance enhancement it is

527
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:31,399
not medicating a debilitating condition

528
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:33,519
all right so I'm basically taking meth

529
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,880
pills as a kid just to do better in

530
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,558
school because I'm add and dyslexic up

531
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,159
until the point I smoke Golden Goat I'm

532
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,839
like oh my gosh I can pay attention when

533
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,640
I smoke goat or Island sweet skunk but

534
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,798
the the side effects are the opposite I

535
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,559
can eat I can sleep and I'm in a good

536
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,599
mood and so it changed my [ __ ] life

537
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:56,599
when I found cannabis and how I could

538
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,519
take care of myself and stop taking

539
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,599
these medications but only if I could

540
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,639
organize and

541
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,439
compartmentalize how different flower

542
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,840
types affect me in the different ways

543
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:14,080
that it does and so as a naturalist um

544
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:16,839
and as a a chronic Observer of all

545
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,119
things nature and as a dominant super

546
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:21,918
taster uh chemically and

547
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,158
genetically um I actually started paying

548
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,960
attention to and realizing how how and

549
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,720
where the Tarpin were felt in different

550
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:32,519
parts of the face way before I knew what

551
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,480
Tarpin were and also way before I knew

552
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,200
what the trigeminal nerve was that there

553
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,079
are actually nerve endings between your

554
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,120
Al phalic bulb and your maxillary gland

555
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:44,599
of the trigeminal nerve that is a

556
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:46,479
sensory perception uh cranial nerve I so

557
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,798
I didn't know any of that stuff until I

558
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,919
kept learning and kept going down the

559
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,158
rabbit hole and kept exploring what is

560
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,000
this what what do we have here because

561
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,400
we've got something here we can organize

562
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,480
cannabis and the organization Works

563
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,080
within the inflores essence of the cola

564
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,440
structure it's its shape context plus

565
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,759
its smell context and plus where you're

566
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,038
feeling the aroma of the smell in in

567
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,759
different parts of your face those are

568
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,119
three cranial nerves that we pull

569
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,839
together which is interpreting we're

570
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,839
interpreting the tpin of these flower

571
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,599
types to gauge them and put them on

572
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,319
these different spectrums um I don't

573
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,240
know if you guys have ever seen this but

574
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,918
this is a little cheat sheet I made and

575
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,759
uh we're actually switching out the

576
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,320
leaves for Buds and if you I can open up

577
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,480
the book and show you the book and

578
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,798
actually the weed wheel is kind of a

579
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,798
good example too so um so instead of

580
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:41,240
saying sativa because it's not what it

581
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:43,558
is is it is narrow leaf marijuana that's

582
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,038
what this is this is a narrow leaf

583
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,839
marijuana and where you feel the smell

584
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,440
what type of smell what The Flower

585
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,959
structure looks like that affects your

586
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,960
body in certain ways here's the gauge of

587
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,880
an nlm would physically affect you

588
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,679
energetically mental

589
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,159
it's stimulating your focus is

590
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,480
productive your mood is adventurous your

591
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,399
risk is paranoia and your activity could

592
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,200
be concerts or creative arts how

593
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,199
intoxicated you'll become is dependent

594
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,798
on your personal tolerance and then we

595
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,519
go through the spectrum of the five

596
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,798
effect types of flow um with this tool

597
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,639
and then simultaneously this is a tool

598
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,240
that organizes uh your flower types in

599
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,320
its different effect Spectrum similarly

600
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,440
and we we tell people that the or

601
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,839
original term or industry term is

602
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,720
indicia to

603
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:38,038
sativa uh but in reality you're talking

604
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,038
about subspecies and the subspeciation

605
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,200
of flower types within the broad to

606
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:46,000
narrow Leaf Spectrum within the category

607
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,319
of marijuana are uh generally indicia

608
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,839
subspecies and so this is really a

609
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:54,158
spectrum between sativa species

610
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:57,759
subspecies afghanica Inda a variety

611
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:01,360
afghanica to sativa species subspecies

612
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,720
indicia variety Indica um and so really

613
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:07,119
trying to teach people that it's not

614
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,798
indica or sativa the speciation

615
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,918
subspeciation and then the varietals

616
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:14,960
thereof um are more

617
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,480
complex um but anyways you can open this

618
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,600
card

619
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,079
up and we also teach you know the

620
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,759
quality uh poor quality characteristics

621
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,558
as well as all your positive quality

622
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,519
characteristics what you're smelling

623
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,119
from a tarpine perspective and how those

624
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,639
tpin inter act with you in your face so

625
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,359
this is just one of our fun little tools

626
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,960
that we used to part of our little

627
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,479
toolkit dud that's [ __ ] awesome yeah

628
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,079
that's what I just said that's that's

629
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:49,200
awesome yeah go ahead go ahead Sam I he

630
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:52,759
we years we tried to determine if people

631
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,519
could smell more than one or two Turpin

632
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:58,440
by smelling cannabis and uh everybody

633
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,200
failed

634
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,880
well you know I've got a good one for

635
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,558
you Sam the tpine

636
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,919
supercomputer that I I've friends with

637
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,278
now they called [ __ ] on interpreting

638
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,038
they're like there's no way that you can

639
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:15,640
just smell unlabeled cannabis and

640
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,319
categorize the chemistry effect type of

641
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,320
it and so they bought me an airplane

642
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,439
ticket flew me out to their lab in

643
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,558
California where they had previously lab

644
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,038
tested eight different types of cannabis

645
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,678
that could not have been more different

646
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:31,359
from each other one was harvested that

647
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,159
week another was over a year old some

648
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:37,678
were six months old they had hardcore uh

649
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,440
sativas hardcore indicas they had OG

650
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,080
types where you should have recognized

651
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,480
the typicity of of a classic genetic

652
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:47,359
they had just the whole spread and

653
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,798
they're all guys in white lab coats and

654
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:53,599
then they invited the dispensary owners

655
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:56,038
of lbca the Los Angeles um dispensary

656
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,719
organization so the the ogs who have

657
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:01,158
been having uh dispensaries in LA longer

658
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,440
than anybody else in the US to all watch

659
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,480
me do this to see like can this guy

660
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,399
actually go about in unlabeled jar of

661
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,919
cannabis and tell us all everything

662
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,479
about its quality what its plant shape

663
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,278
would have looked like and how its

664
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,360
chemical effect is going to be uh based

665
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:23,480
off of their lab analysis and jar after

666
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:26,240
jar I got seven out of about the Turing

667
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,960
contents all the other stuff it sounds

668
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,240
much more possible but tpin if if

669
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,000
because an average cannabis variety has

670
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:40,440
50 60 different tpin and uh most people

671
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,159
can name one or two from if it's really

672
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,558
loud and really dominant but they can't

673
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,200
name anymore because they it's just too

674
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,000
difficult for them or they don't have

675
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,960
the

676
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,519
experience yeah but now we're moving

677
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,360
into the future Sam see you're you're

678
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,038
you're like the [ __ ] base rung on the

679
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,839
ladder dude like we're all like without

680
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,200
you dude like none of us would be where

681
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:06,079
we are that's a fact but when I listen

682
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,960
to Max it sounds like he's right on the

683
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,480
[ __ ] money with [ __ ] that you've

684
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,600
already done in a more sort of

685
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,519
simplistic range and he's taking it to

686
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:18,199
this like futuristic like I'll just say

687
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,079
this I go with my gut and everything Max

688
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,159
just said [ __ ]

689
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:26,319
sounded proper I I'm interested I like

690
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,919
it yeah right

691
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,678
on is definitely something serious in

692
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,120
the wine industry so I always wondered

693
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,559
when it would become prevalent in the

694
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,719
Cannabis

695
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,200
industry yeah and after after Nick talks

696
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,759
because I want to hear from Nick as well

697
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:45,159
um if if you if you'd like Rick um

698
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:49,038
organizing cannabis as a

699
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:52,240
commodity in as in selling it and

700
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:55,640
operating at it from a wine in

701
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,319
viniculture perspective makes a thousand

702
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,480
times more sense than what we've been

703
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,240
doing in our mom's basement for the past

704
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,679
20 30 years U but that's what's kind of

705
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,519
happened in the past five years is that

706
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,278
there's become such a

707
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,359
fine um knowledge of the preference of

708
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,960
which tpin people want and so forth at

709
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,839
first it was like yo if I got some good

710
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,038
weed it's good weed boom we're good now

711
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,720
people want their certain like range of

712
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,679
what they want their gelados or their

713
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,159
ogs or their you know whatever cush

714
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,240
their their preference the cookies or

715
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,919
it's just funny to see but that's that

716
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,640
was that is the next step with um with

717
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,240
cannabis I I've been feeling it for a

718
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,960
while just wine was always respected

719
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,319
that way once it was brought into the

720
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,079
and even beer

721
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,398
ipas they're really respected in the

722
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,038
market of flavors you know so cannabis

723
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:49,879
is definitely but even

724
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,398
even even from a more basic perspective

725
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,720
because what you're talking about is is

726
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:56,879
truly complex but from a way more basic

727
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,919
perspective just just imagine this just

728
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,639
for a second

729
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,519
a sophisticated wine Shopper would never

730
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:06,678
walk into an alcohol store and ask for a

731
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,159
variety of grape at a percentage of

732
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,320
alcohol for for the bottle of wine that

733
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,480
they're looking for that's just [ __ ]

734
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:16,319
ridiculous people laugh at that idea

735
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,319
they're like yeah

736
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,440
that sense it's like exactly but that's

737
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,880
what we do with wheed and it doesn't

738
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,278
make sense whereas in wine if you walk

739
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,399
into a liquor store and tell the guy you

740
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:28,679
know red or white right a stimulating

741
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:33,158
type or a sedative type red

742
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:36,360
perfect what country USA what region

743
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:39,639
Northern California what type of uh what

744
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:42,079
type of variety Max Max you are ignoring

745
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:46,519
the madg 2020 customer

746
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:49,240
base and the uh the olding with 800

747
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:52,960
Cisco everybody who wants Cisco he's

748
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,960
like he's like what about Two Buck

749
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,038
Chuck you know what that's not the

750
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,440
that's not the type of customer you know

751
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,240
and like like if you're the kind of

752
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,759
customer that does not care you just

753
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,319
want to get high or you just want to get

754
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,158
drunk that's what Two Buck Chuck is for

755
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,398
and that's what like sacks a cheap

756
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,039
flower are for but that's not the kind

757
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:16,398
of guys we're hanging out with on hash

758
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:20,200
Church kind of guys that watch hash

759
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,038
church either so uh you know it's just

760
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,120
just a different breed but but the point

761
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:27,278
is is if we were to compartmentalize

762
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,119
cannabis like wine we're going to get to

763
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,759
a point where we say hey dude what are

764
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,879
you looking for like man I'm looking for

765
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,919
some skunky garlicky OG funk that's

766
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,039
going to lay me out but get me thinking

767
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:42,759
it's like okay I got something for you I

768
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,158
regardless of the lab test and

769
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:45,798
regardless of the strain name like I

770
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,880
don't give a [ __ ] what you call it I

771
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:50,480
know what you're looking for and I can

772
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,399
tell you how good it is what quality it

773
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,558
is when it was harvested how ripe it is

774
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,239
and how loud it is from a chemical

775
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,200
perspective and I can I can offer it to

776
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,519
you in a fun cool creative way and I can

777
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,440
also make it sound so [ __ ] sexy too I

778
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,679
mean you're talking about a OG varietal

779
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,798
from the Appalachians of the Emerald

780
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,080
Triangle within a unique tawa that

781
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,519
filters the oceanic air twice a day

782
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:20,119
through the pine trees giving fresh air

783
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,120
on the Cannabis types that sit in a fog

784
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,199
on top of the the mountain side called

785
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:27,359
alpen glow where the it's like in the

786
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,319
San Franciscan shell content that's

787
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,319
indigenous to the soil that the Cannabis

788
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:34,519
farmers are knowledgeable about and grow

789
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:37,558
towards FS

790
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:40,079
man GL this is what it means to be a

791
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:43,440
cannabis someone yay this is it this is

792
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:46,119
what we're doing you know that's

793
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,200
it awesome Ling this conversation I want

794
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:52,158
to jump in here for a minute um I came

795
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,639
aware of tpin and their importance of

796
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,278
from therapeutic point of view because

797
00:33:54,638 --> 00:34:01,839
uh trying to help uh Young people with

798
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:04,440
seizure disorders and uh really found

799
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:08,159
that uh early on of course I thought it

800
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,599
was uh conoids CBD particularly that

801
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,480
seemed to give this benefit that we were

802
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,960
seeking but uh I came to realize yeah

803
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,918
that turpen seemed to have an an

804
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,480
important role and I'm realizing

805
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,759
increasingly maybe I don't even know

806
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,039
that but I'm wondering Max in your

807
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,440
exploration on flowers you started off

808
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:28,519
describing your experience based on

809
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,079
therapeutic benefit you personally

810
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:33,119
experienced is what drove your

811
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,800
interest I I'd love to hear your

812
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,240
thoughts on um and again I'm mostly

813
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,440
talking concentrates because none of

814
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:45,319
these kids smoke joints or or uh hit on

815
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:48,280
their uh dab rig but um we've seen

816
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:52,000
really dramatic differences in benefit

817
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,560
for uh seizure disorder in certain kids

818
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,719
with this type of cannabis that has

819
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:00,039
similar

820
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:03,159
canono as this type of cannabis but

821
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:06,679
really different results based on canono

822
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:09,519
test results and yet we see dramatic

823
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,559
difference uh so I'm wondering have you

824
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,880
gone any further down that path and if

825
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:15,920
you haven't I'd really love to engage

826
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,440
with you some more on what little I've

827
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,519
learned over the years on that one and U

828
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,720
explore potential uh benefit for those

829
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,280
kids because there's still a lot of

830
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,039
people out there who sees on a regular

831
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,519
basis and it's always a drag that's all

832
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:35,519
this is way thanks from a seizure

833
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:39,440
perspective we do we I think we all know

834
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:43,320
that the the the key from Cannabis is

835
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,599
CBD you know hands down canaba dial time

836
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:50,039
andv specifically say

837
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:55,039
that so cbdv specifically in much

838
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:56,480
anure cbdv yeah and so maybe yeah so

839
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,239
maybe Nick would be able to tell you

840
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,318
more more about it than I would from

841
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,358
from a therapeutic perspective I just I

842
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:06,599
just know from aav perspective what's

843
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,239
that go ahead I have a little item Wade

844
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,000
I was just thinking about the moment

845
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,919
when I I believe you've worked with IDU

846
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,710
in the seizure disorder population down

847
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,280
there I there was a period of

848
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,519
[Music]

849
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,359
time

850
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,880
when first had been and when Harley Sue

851
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:26,440
showed up you know it changed everything

852
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,920
the efficacy went off the chart a lot of

853
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,720
the kids that were not receiving benefit

854
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,159
from ACDC were suddenly having you know

855
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:36,078
remarkable outcomes haryu is a

856
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,159
terpinolene dominant uh type 3 plant and

857
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,318
obviously early maturing beautiful

858
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:44,159
flowers remarkable floral intensity in

859
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:46,599
addition to the terpinolene intensity um

860
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,279
a very complicated Aroma profile there

861
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,039
was always speculation that that was

862
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,200
contributing some of the element but the

863
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,119
other notion was that that was the first

864
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:58,078
type three plant I ever saw in an

865
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,838
analytical testing result with cbdv it

866
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,160
had a small quantity and then I I've

867
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:05,880
seen that uh sort of substantiated that

868
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,118
the cbdv contribution had really

869
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,318
probably helped boost but one of the

870
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,720
things I think about in the sort of like

871
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:13,719
work that I'm really excited to hear

872
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:16,598
Nick talk more about is as we move

873
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:19,078
towards whole metabol kind of analysis

874
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,079
as we really talk comprehensively about

875
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,720
you know all of these analytes I think

876
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,280
the reality is when you have like about

877
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,239
a thousand bioactive compounds

878
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,720
interacting in constellations that are

879
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:31,559
you know so vastly complicated it's

880
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,199
going to be lifetimes before we can

881
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:37,078
tease out all of the variables from the

882
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,199
therapeutic effect basis and and I

883
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,160
actually I have just one small idea I'd

884
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,239
like to contribute which is the effect

885
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,920
Matrix you know I'm still seeing

886
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:48,000
companies who are trying to leverage

887
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,119
language like what Max is introducing uh

888
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,519
in a sort of early effort and marketing

889
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,280
that may in many cases sound actually a

890
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,440
little bit like deceiving in the sense

891
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,599
of being comprehensive or and to be

892
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,800
specific companies that are the most

893
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,640
owners the ones that are making products

894
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,519
that say this one makes you feel sleepy

895
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,239
this one makes you feel sexy this one

896
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:11,519
makes you feel stimulated whatever it's

897
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,519
this this is really clouding the

898
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,519
airwaves you know in in this like here

899
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,159
we are at the Advent of a new era of

900
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:22,039
unbelievable chemos scape diversity and

901
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,078
the possibility of a lot more

902
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:27,599
personalized effects and broad range of

903
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,680
therapeutic efficacy but now we have

904
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,519
this massive voice from the industry

905
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,118
coming in says no it's much more simple

906
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,960
it's just these few archetypes and it's

907
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,800
like here's the thing that moves units

908
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,318
that speaks to Consumers where they're

909
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,039
at and this whole [ __ ] and I'm just

910
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,599
like so excited to get to that next

911
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,599
level of consequence where we can deal

912
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,800
with the effect Matrix in a more

913
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,200
sophisticated way which deals with endoc

914
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,920
canabo system tone which is genetically

915
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:55,519
influenced by

916
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,440
diet and then we have the of course

917
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,960
phytochemical inor and then we have

918
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,440
mindset and setting but of all of these

919
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,440
and deliveries have to be added in

920
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:15,079
do most important in terms of the

921
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,200
overall on the path to like home metabim

922
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:21,079
research I gosh I think it's all about

923
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:23,719
titration and observation and journaling

924
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,640
and also counseling it's about having a

925
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:27,598
relationship in that therapeutic

926
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:29,039
practice and I'm just so excited talk

927
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,079
with you more about that wanted to just

928
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,559
say a few things there Jeremy that's a I

929
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,640
think that's a really good um series of

930
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:40,440
insights is my mic better guys you sound

931
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,920
great okay it was pretty echoey earlier

932
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,838
um

933
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,400
the um you're just talking about like uh

934
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:50,440
sort of the integrative approach um by

935
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:54,400
linking uh therapy as well as you know

936
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,000
close personal observation and um then

937
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,119
sharing that with uh providers or care

938
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,719
providers that's a huge shift in in how

939
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,680
Therapeutics are going now it's a lot of

940
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:05,199
experimental therapies that are using

941
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,679
not only cannabis but also some of the

942
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:12,039
more psychedelics like ketamine and or

943
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:15,159
psilocybin um are really going down this

944
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:17,599
whole person approach to dealing with

945
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:21,239
very complex uh mental health issues and

946
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,160
or physiological issues um and uh and I

947
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,358
can name some of the groups I mean

948
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,519
there's the maps Institute which doing

949
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:25,960
all the all the work for psychedelic

950
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:27,719
research they just secured a ton of

951
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,760
funding um but also the The ases

952
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,719
Institute in Seattle is one that I I I

953
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,720
work with and they're really really good

954
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:37,239
uh Dr seil um agarwall and Dr GS and Dr

955
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:39,799
gral and everybody else who works there

956
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:42,519
is working really really closely with um

957
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,000
uh cannabis and uh medical cannabis

958
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:46,679
specifically and they don't just give

959
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,480
you a card and send you on your way you

960
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,318
have to participate in this journaling

961
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,358
with Oz mind and and go through this

962
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:57,960
whole process to really figure out what

963
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:59,960
works for you and um what Max is talking

964
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,639
about I think is really interesting uh

965
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,960
one of the things that we have run into

966
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,679
in the past is uh the when you have

967
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,880
enough of a sample size you start to

968
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:15,719
realize that the effect Matrix is far

969
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:18,318
less dependent on

970
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:22,318
the

971
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,318
type of

972
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,519
but is maybe a feeling that's

973
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:34,199
stimulating and or um relaxing at the

974
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,318
same s s I guess I guess angiolytic but

975
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:37,439
it's the same time stimulating for

976
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:39,279
somebody might induce paranoia and

977
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,639
stress in another um and that's that's

978
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,240
much more of a a body issue than than

979
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,118
about than sort of the the chemo type

980
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,279
issue as you would say um and uh yeah

981
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,240
sorry about that so I should probably

982
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,240
introduce myself thanks Marcus

983
00:41:53,639 --> 00:42:00,960
so um my

984
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:03,480
[Laughter]

985
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,400
I have invited here but also to be sort

986
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:10,679
of upfront about it um I kind of sidled

987
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,519
into it mostly by working on um I

988
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:16,159
started out in in beer and in hop

989
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:18,280
research and so I have been uh working

990
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,159
on things that that Mark Max talked

991
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,960
about in different different Arenas so a

992
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,039
lot of sensory science and a lot of um

993
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,318
flavor analysis and development and and

994
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:31,679
modeling of very complex systems and the

995
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:33,920
interactions with people so how um a the

996
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,759
moyy of what happens in fermentation in

997
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,200
beer and when you dry hop and add all

998
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,880
those flavors how those things change

999
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,719
and how people experience them is is

1000
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,800
obviously a very big part of of being a

1001
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:46,719
brewer um but I've worked in Brew um on

1002
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,359
and off for about 20 years um and I

1003
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:49,799
recently moved or I guess not recently

1004
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:53,880
guess about three and a half years ago

1005
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,480
moved into hop research and um as many

1006
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,200
people will know Hops and and cannabis

1007
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,400
are two closest relatives of each other

1008
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,879
um in in the Brewing world we we

1009
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,480
laughingly discuss in hushed tones

1010
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,200
enjoying the cousin um it's sort of a

1011
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,719
running joke um and Jeremy can probably

1012
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,480
talk there's a couple podcasts that I

1013
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,239
that I used to to run with Justin at the

1014
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,519
Brewing Network we talk about a lot of

1015
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:20,199
this in detail um but really the thrust

1016
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:24,519
of of my work for the last uh five or so

1017
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:28,199
years has been trying to figure out what

1018
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:31,800
the relationship between the chemicals

1019
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:33,558
and the compounds in Hops and what how

1020
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,000
that translates into sensory

1021
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:38,359
perspectives and one of the things that

1022
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,880
we actually Marcus can I share my screen

1023
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:41,960
for a second I've got a couple of slides

1024
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,440
to show you all if that's okay yeah let

1025
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,559
me see if it's set up so that you can it

1026
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,480
should let me go into my Advanced oh no

1027
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,880
it says only host so now all

1028
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,280
participants can share who can danger

1029
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,280
danger all right here let me uh see if I

1030
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,359
can start this and uh how going do this

1031
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,000
let's see all right here so one of the

1032
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:06,920
where is it there we

1033
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,119
go let's see here so and I'm just going

1034
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,680
to okay does that look can you see the

1035
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,800
entire or can you see the presenter mode

1036
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:17,318
or just the uh the whole whole SL good

1037
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,760
okay so um one of the things to I'm just

1038
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:21,599
going to sort of back up back into this

1039
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,680
and that um hop character is something

1040
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,079
that has been discussed for um

1041
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,078
realistically hundreds of years but

1042
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,039
really has only started to advance and

1043
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:33,800
we we've sort

1044
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:36,279
of I have a bit of a reputation as a as

1045
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,318
a disruptor I I I tend to make people's

1046
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,680
lives a lot more difficult than they

1047
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:42,079
have to be by asking the wrong questions

1048
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:45,239
at the right time I think um so uh we

1049
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,119
came in to to Hops um and there was this

1050
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,279
Paradigm and if you if you all enjoy

1051
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,400
craft beer you probably understand this

1052
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,519
um from way back when when the Germans

1053
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,720
dominated the hot market and there were

1054
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:57,719
only there was only one thing they were

1055
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:59,078
worried about really and that was

1056
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,558
bitterness character and then they

1057
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:03,359
started thinking about um aromatics and

1058
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,480
they were talking about you know Noble

1059
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,719
aromatics versus non- Noble so there was

1060
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,838
just bittering Hops and you had Noble

1061
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:14,799
Hops and Noble Hops are like s and

1062
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:17,199
hooker and mfu and you know all these

1063
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,559
pretty um what we would consider now to

1064
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,598
be very subtle hops they don't have a

1065
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:25,559
lot of of of they don't have a lot of

1066
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:28,800
punch um if you compare uh as an example

1067
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:31,359
like say a cekas or early German sa it

1068
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,519
would be between two to 3% two to three

1069
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:38,639
and a half% alpha acids and it might be

1070
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:41,639
you know sub I mean it will be well well

1071
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,279
under 1% by mass total oil and that's

1072
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,838
all the all the all the all the aromatic

1073
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,960
fractions and hops we talk about things

1074
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:47,078
differently we we don't we talk about

1075
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,400
Oil we're only talking about the

1076
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:53,119
aromatic fraction um whereas if you look

1077
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,480
at say uh some more modern varieties

1078
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:58,400
like equinat or uh uh Talis that was

1079
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,559
just released this year they can be up

1080
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,519
to 4 or 5% oil and you know 18% alpha

1081
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:08,119
acid so that's it's like comparing the

1082
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,519
rocket fuel version of the hybrid

1083
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,559
strains that we get from the best

1084
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:17,759
Growers today like Mr Plum uh to

1085
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,359
um ditch weed that you had to go behind

1086
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,720
your uncle's house because the hemp

1087
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,318
Farmers let their seed go into the

1088
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,719
ditches in Kansas in you know

1089
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:27,400
1974 uh so a little bit of a different

1090
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:29,118
in terms of of of not only the the

1091
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,039
potency but the the overall character

1092
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,680
and all and so things have changed a

1093
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,318
lot relatively recently people I mean

1094
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,480
recently I mean in in the last 20 years

1095
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:39,800
and it's really started with kangar and

1096
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,358
Si Nevada and starting this you know

1097
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,480
this crazy thing called dry hopping

1098
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:44,679
which was actually invented you know

1099
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,880
many many many years ago but he was

1100
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:51,318
making this amazing beult

1101
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,280
here and that really for me kicked off

1102
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:56,239
the the the the craft breing uh

1103
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,680
Innovation and it was this shock to the

1104
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,159
system because people realized that beer

1105
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:04,639
could have different flavors and it

1106
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:06,199
could taste floral and fruity and piny

1107
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,078
and resonus and all these beautiful

1108
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:09,399
beautiful aromatics so they started

1109
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,680
thinking about hops in a different way

1110
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,000
and so if you look at this this um the

1111
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,679
diagram here on the right um they tried

1112
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,280
to I'm going to minimize this so you all

1113
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,399
can see this a little better um they

1114
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,800
minimiz or sorry they

1115
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,880
uh they started breaking apart the

1116
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,480
Aromas in the noble and the floral and

1117
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,079
stuff and started looking at spicy

1118
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,599
floral fruity citrus grassy earthy

1119
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,880
Evergreen so on so forth uh you also get

1120
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,800
Woody in there um and there's a lot more

1121
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,358
than this but when you look at this if

1122
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,200
you look carefully you see that all of

1123
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,159
these traditional hops are sort of

1124
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:44,239
generally in you know one one quadrant

1125
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:45,838
or one side of the of the diagram but

1126
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,719
then if you look at all of these

1127
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,480
superscripts you see it's also Flor it's

1128
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,358
also fruity it's also Citrus and so this

1129
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,199
two-dimensional approach to classifying

1130
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,719
hops in terms of a spider diagram or how

1131
00:47:53,199 --> 00:48:00,719
much it is just doesn't work because

1132
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:03,279
they're incredibly complicated um you

1133
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,439
have a couple of major fractions you've

1134
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,079
got the the polyphenol fraction which is

1135
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,480
in what I always I jokingly call the

1136
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,079
planty bits so like the bra the braal

1137
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,199
the petals the stems so on so forth and

1138
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:14,680
this is this all applies to cannabis um

1139
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,199
and you have you know the flavonol

1140
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:21,318
flavonols phenolic carbolic acids other

1141
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:23,719
other other polyphenols and these are um

1142
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:26,759
very important for the character of the

1143
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:28,879
whole flower but they will not necess

1144
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,480
neily carry through into the final

1145
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,318
product unless you have a long steeping

1146
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,639
time so if you're making a beverage with

1147
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:37,440
hops or cannabis um you can get some of

1148
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:40,400
these into uh into solution if however

1149
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,838
you're inhaling it this stuff doesn't it

1150
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,358
doesn't last it gets it gets broken

1151
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:47,480
apart and it gets destroyed um when you

1152
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:51,239
talk about the aromatics though you

1153
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,760
start seeing a huge amount of uh

1154
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:57,039
variation and and complexity that that

1155
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,640
starts to to Really dominate uh and Des

1156
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:02,199
what the character is so um this is a

1157
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:04,199
very incomplete list we have identified

1158
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:06,919
over

1159
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,480
1,400 active compounds in terms of

1160
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,798
flavor active and aromatically active

1161
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:17,159
compounds in Hops uh and the list is

1162
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:18,639
growing every year um but um one of the

1163
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:20,798
things that has has frustrated me for a

1164
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,239
while is that the Cannabis industry just

1165
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:25,838
talks about TPS and tpin and actually

1166
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:28,358
they're not the they are very important

1167
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,679
but they're not the endol and Beall Max

1168
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:32,960
mentioned thols and those are thols are

1169
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:36,318
sulfur containing compounds um in a

1170
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,519
particular or particular way um but uh

1171
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,798
when you talk about some of the things

1172
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:42,519
that are really really important ter for

1173
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:44,400
aromatics uh all of the dies like fuel

1174
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,679
characteristics and I Jeremy and I and I

1175
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,680
have talked about this um fuel is

1176
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:51,118
actually not a single compound it's

1177
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,639
actually a mix of some Esters um there's

1178
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,519
ethyl acetate in there there's some

1179
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,920
benzoate some Benzene compounds in there

1180
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:57,159
there's some of the methyl

1181
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,519
characteristics

1182
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,358
um but it also works with the pentene uh

1183
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:05,880
thides and I for the other hexine thid

1184
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:08,880
anyway it's not just thol but thoats and

1185
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,960
thioesters so thol are some of the

1186
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,440
things that uh lead to these tropical

1187
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,440
fruit characteristics and we've

1188
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,798
identified some compounds in uh our hops

1189
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:24,679
that uh you take two

1190
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:27,159
um two hops that on the surface have the

1191
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:28,558
almost identical uh turpine profile so

1192
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,039
they have the same level of mercine

1193
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,359
which is going to be about 65% of the

1194
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:36,798
total hop oil you've got lemine lenol

1195
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:39,239
geraniol humulene caropine Farine Farine

1196
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:40,480
is actually kind of rare um but those

1197
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,199
all those those those we call them the

1198
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,358
big seven but those big seven together

1199
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:47,519
are about 97 to

1200
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:49,960
99% by mass or of of the Hop oil

1201
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,239
fraction of the aromatic fraction

1202
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,679
however if you have two hops that are

1203
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,039
that that are identical on that on that

1204
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,759
sort of traditional profile and then you

1205
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:59,639
run them through more detailed analysis

1206
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,760
using some really fun to tools like a

1207
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:05,960
gas CH chromatograph with uh Quantified

1208
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,520
time of flight mass spectometry and uh

1209
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,838
sulfur CH chem luminesence you can start

1210
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:11,679
finding these other compounds these

1211
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,558
other Peaks that were are not labeled in

1212
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,199
the industry standard um we found one

1213
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,519
that was a differentiator between a hop

1214
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,798
called sabro and a hop called Mosaic and

1215
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,119
anybody in the industry would tell you

1216
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:24,480
those two things smell very very

1217
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:28,280
differently but when we uh did the

1218
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,039
analysis the big seven were you know for

1219
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,119
for all intents and

1220
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:35,358
purposes the same but they smelled

1221
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,039
completely different the one Peak that

1222
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,400
we found that was really really

1223
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:39,639
responsible for the difference in these

1224
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,599
things because they smell completely

1225
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:46,078
different was at

1226
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,640
0.01 parts per

1227
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,599
trillion so we're not even talking about

1228
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,358
percent we're not even talking about

1229
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,680
parts per million we're not talking

1230
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,960
about parts per billion we're talking

1231
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,199
about parts per

1232
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,199
quadrillion so it's tiny fractions that

1233
00:51:56,199 --> 00:52:01,798
make this huge difference in how you

1234
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:04,960
experience um the aroma of of the Hop

1235
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:07,039
and um that to me is really exciting

1236
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,280
because nobody else was really look

1237
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,480
nobody else bothered because they

1238
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,440
figured it can't it can't be that

1239
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,880
important but as as Max will probably

1240
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,159
tell you and a lot of you know is that

1241
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,318
very small uh tweaks to to the chemical

1242
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,078
balance makes things smell and taste

1243
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:21,358
very very different um so it's really

1244
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,760
exciting and we're we're really excited

1245
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:27,318
to be able to start digging into this um

1246
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,079
the problem is that our industry in in

1247
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:32,039
terms of Hops uh and I see this as well

1248
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,559
in cannabis has um a lot of baggage in

1249
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:35,239
terms of how people talk about things so

1250
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:38,079
there's a lot of the traditional ways of

1251
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:41,199
discussing flavors and aromatics and uh

1252
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:43,680
what ends up happening is that people

1253
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:46,679
try to fit what they're experiencing

1254
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:48,159
into pre-made boxes it's like the Ikea

1255
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:50,639
version of decorating an apartment it's

1256
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:53,239
cheap and easy but not always the best

1257
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:57,639
thing for for for your comfort and

1258
00:52:53,239 --> 00:53:00,000
quality um so what we've had to do is uh

1259
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:02,078
build and I've been very very lucky and

1260
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,039
very feel very privileged by by uh the

1261
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,359
board and the company giving me uh the

1262
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:10,880
resources and allow me to build a team

1263
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:13,639
to create a system where we um basically

1264
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,160
characterize our hops using sensory and

1265
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:18,239
uh create a sensory lexicon that we all

1266
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,920
agree to use uh and this is very very

1267
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:25,879
important so when we discuss things like

1268
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:29,000
citrusy or Woody or musty those are

1269
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,480
pretty broad Strokes um and they depend

1270
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,199
very much on your personal experience of

1271
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,480
those terms so for example if I say

1272
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:39,639
citrusy my experience is going to be

1273
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,119
different from from Rick's um he Rick

1274
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:45,039
you you live in Florida

1275
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,160
correct me I'm I'm living in Amsterdam

1276
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:49,759
oh you're living in Amsterdam okay um

1277
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:51,639
definitely Citrus got you I'm with you

1278
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,079
so someone definitely be different

1279
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:54,838
someone from Florida or Georgia is going

1280
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:56,079
to experience is when you say Citrus

1281
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:57,078
they're probably going to go straight to

1282
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,079
Orange

1283
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:04,000
oranges um you talk to somebody who is

1284
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,960
in the amalf coast of Italy or in

1285
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,280
Northern Spain they might start thinking

1286
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,159
about lemons you talk to somebody in the

1287
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,640
Philippines they're going to think uh

1288
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:13,598
kalamansi

1289
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:15,639
Oram if you think if you're in Japan

1290
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,440
they're going to go Yuzu and yes those

1291
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:18,879
are all citrusy but they are very very

1292
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,280
distinct aromatics and flavors and they

1293
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,920
all share a lot of overlap but there's

1294
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,440
very distinct things so when we start

1295
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:30,760
talking about uh sensory descriptions we

1296
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:32,639
need to agree on a term and say okay

1297
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,400
even though when you smell this this

1298
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,639
evokes memories of um pansit with gaman

1299
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,119
in the Philippines because you grew up

1300
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:42,879
there like I did

1301
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:44,880
um we're going to use this one term to

1302
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,280
call it that and so you have to convert

1303
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,960
your brain and

1304
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,280
remember what you're smelling and so

1305
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,000
that we're all using the same term and

1306
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,720
then we can assign a number to it to its

1307
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,440
intensity and its duration and so on so

1308
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:58,199
forth um creating a shared lexicon is is

1309
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,720
the first thing you need to do for for a

1310
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:03,239
good sensory program then you can start

1311
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:05,078
looking at taking notes on it and adding

1312
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:08,439
to that so when I say it's citrusy but I

1313
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:11,240
detect notes of Tangerine Mandarin and

1314
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:14,480
uh Naval oranges as opposed to say uh

1315
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:16,279
Yuzu um or grapefruit or what have you

1316
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,760
um you can you can add qualifiers to it

1317
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,559
and basically increase the resolution of

1318
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,119
your

1319
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:24,519
data I have it with Citrus a lot that

1320
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,640
sometimes it'll be like fresh Citrus or

1321
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:30,239
like a older Citrus yeah yeah so I

1322
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:31,920
citrus peel yeah and and you get dried

1323
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,759
dried citrus peel like a kurasa orange

1324
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,798
which is to me tastes like like like you

1325
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,760
know the wonderful sour Pez I love that

1326
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:41,280
stuff um or um a grapefruit for example

1327
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,799
if you if you break down the aroma of a

1328
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,039
grapefruit it is holistically it's

1329
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,559
grapefruit but it has notes of swon

1330
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:50,920
Blanc it has notes of lychi and it has

1331
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:53,079
black pepper in it um so if if you if

1332
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:56,480
you that when you get really experienced

1333
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:59,000
in sensory is I I find it fun like well

1334
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,318
I find it fun a lot of my uh housemates

1335
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,358
my wife now uh all think it's kind of

1336
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:05,358
obnoxious cuz I'm always just

1337
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:07,759
deconstructing smells um but it's really

1338
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,679
fun uh like I I remember we got this uh

1339
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,960
we got this we had the you know bread

1340
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,038
and cheese night or meat and cheese

1341
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,358
night a couple couple of months ago and

1342
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,640
uh there was this one cheese that had

1343
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:18,239
this really distinctive characteristic

1344
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,000
and she was like what is it it's it's

1345
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:21,078
like kind of musty but it's not bad and

1346
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,239
I was like oh yeah that's that's

1347
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:25,200
concrete seller and she was like how the

1348
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:26,598
hell do you do that like well it's my

1349
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:28,199
job you know like it's smells like a

1350
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:30,920
concrete Celler that's that's where it

1351
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:33,558
was aged in um anyway um I digress a

1352
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,639
little bit here so once you've got the

1353
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:38,960
shared lexicon you can start um I call

1354
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,798
it you know integer ising or or

1355
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,838
enumerating but you can turn terms into

1356
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:45,759
numbers and that way what you can do is

1357
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:48,119
you can measure the intensity you can

1358
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,240
measure the

1359
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:54,280
repeatability you can measure um uh just

1360
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,679
basically you can see the difference

1361
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:59,000
between between samples um and but at

1362
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,838
the same time it's very important to to

1363
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,440
not ignore the holistic approach which

1364
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:03,679
is you know this smells like this and I

1365
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,119
get this impression and it makes me feel

1366
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:07,919
this way that's hugely important

1367
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,880
particularly in cannabis um but then

1368
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,599
once you have numbers on it you can also

1369
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:15,519
take lab data and compare it to that and

1370
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:17,680
say okay every time it was above a five

1371
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,038
this ratio of compounds was present or

1372
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:22,038
these presents these compounds were

1373
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,559
present in these quantities and so a lot

1374
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,760
of people say like we want to move away

1375
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:28,119
from from just hardcore lab numbers or

1376
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,520
we want to full sensory one of the

1377
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:33,400
things that I've realized in my career

1378
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:36,000
is that um neither is the right way to

1379
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,480
do it you have to do both um because to

1380
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,519
really understand the differences

1381
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:44,280
between um hops or between cannabis

1382
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:46,038
strains or more importantly not even

1383
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,160
just strains but lots and this is where

1384
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:48,480
I'm going to get back to some of the

1385
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:51,879
stuff that Matt was Max was saying

1386
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:54,719
earlier um um that you'll see there's a

1387
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:57,039
tremendous amount of intr strain or

1388
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:00,919
intra cultivar

1389
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:03,400
variability and uh that's something that

1390
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,358
people need to realize because cannabis

1391
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,838
and hops well cannabis more so than hops

1392
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:11,038
because cannabis is an annual hops is a

1393
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:13,960
perennial um exhibits a extremely strong

1394
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,480
GB or genetics by environment response

1395
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,039
and so depending on how it's grown

1396
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,559
depending on what stressors are there

1397
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:23,039
depending on what's around the

1398
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:26,920
environment a the same a clone from from

1399
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:28,599
one mother will have um a serious

1400
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,318
potential for smelling and tasting

1401
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:32,680
completely different and then probably

1402
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,279
having different psychotropic effects uh

1403
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:35,838
and so it's really important to to to be

1404
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,319
able to try to measure that and and

1405
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:39,838
identify that

1406
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:40,759
so we look at I'm just going to go back

1407
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:42,599
through this list here is like we look

1408
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,319
at characterizing our hops by using

1409
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:47,880
sensory um and using lab data at the

1410
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:52,759
same time so we take the Hops we smell

1411
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:55,680
them goes into the lab um it then uh we

1412
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,559
run them through an ODP it's a it's a

1413
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:58,759
basically

1414
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,280
Factory Port where you can smell it as

1415
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,520
it's going to the GC so you can actually

1416
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,119
smell and write down what you smell

1417
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:05,519
while the GC is pulling out the Peaks

1418
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:07,160
which is I think is a really fun and

1419
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,400
cool tool it's it's you can only do it

1420
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:11,480
about once a day because it's pretty

1421
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,680
intensive like you know 60 Minutes of

1422
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,000
just sitting there sniffing really

1423
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,159
intently and you got to do it fast um

1424
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,639
but you start to build up things and

1425
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,480
we've discovered things by using this

1426
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:21,639
technique that like we figured out what

1427
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,760
uh the peach Esther is and that that

1428
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:27,679
makes that makes hops smell peachy and

1429
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,559
we it it was a uh a peak that did not

1430
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,679
show up on our regular GC so we had to

1431
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:31,960
run it through the qof to be able to

1432
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:35,000
figure out what it was but it's anyway

1433
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,000
that's that's fun um but what this does

1434
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,838
is it allows you to start seeing which

1435
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,880
compounds are responsible for which uh

1436
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,358
Aromas on their own but then also what

1437
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,160
other compounds are showing up at the

1438
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:50,598
same time that uh mix and interact with

1439
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:52,719
your sensome and your and those other

1440
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:54,599
compounds to give you a specific

1441
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,959
character so one of the things that

1442
00:59:54,599 --> 01:00:01,480
we've we've realized recently is is that

1443
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:04,358
um uh three merap hexanol it's a thol um

1444
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,838
it is very very flavor inactive on its

1445
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:09,719
own however when you combine it in the

1446
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:11,558
right ratio with geraniol linol and some

1447
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,118
other compounds it can give you this

1448
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:17,599
incredible burst of tropical fruit

1449
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:20,358
flavor um in a different ratio though it

1450
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:23,200
can give you grapefruit which is really

1451
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:25,119
interesting so a 2:3 ratio uh I forget

1452
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:27,879
what which which order it is will give

1453
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,480
you a swum Blanc ly character whereas a

1454
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,680
3:2 ratio will give you

1455
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,599
grapefruit and that's really interesting

1456
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,000
to me because it's not just the parts

1457
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,200
because the whole is greater than the

1458
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,079
sum of them and it it also depends very

1459
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:45,480
much on how it works with with your with

1460
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:49,160
your um with your experience and your

1461
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:51,400
your sensory skills and and how good

1462
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:53,199
your nose is then there's the other part

1463
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,318
of it which is that people are blind

1464
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:59,519
they get something called anosmia where

1465
01:00:55,318 --> 01:01:02,038
you just don't detect it so um I am for

1466
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:04,719
example I'm extremely sensitive to to

1467
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,720
certain aromatics um uh in the beer

1468
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,798
world it's dial I'm known for this it's

1469
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,118
obnoxious because I tend to pick it up

1470
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:13,798
when other people don't even realize

1471
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:17,400
it's there and I I hate it um on the

1472
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:19,318
other hand I cannot smell this there's

1473
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,400
this cooked onion characteristic uh and

1474
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:24,038
it's you know it's like fried fried

1475
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,960
onions um and or caramelized onions and

1476
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:27,200
to some people and that it is uh it's

1477
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,318
It's a combination of a couple different

1478
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,639
things a tho8 a thol and then I think an

1479
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:36,159
aliphatic alcohol

1480
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,519
um I can't detect it in beer it's like

1481
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,798
oh this is a pleasantly rounded beer

1482
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:40,038
other people are spitting it out saying

1483
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:43,559
this is disgusting how can you drink

1484
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:44,599
that and like well good for me um but

1485
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:48,920
it's really important to realize that

1486
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:52,599
people have different um blindnesses

1487
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,798
and sensitivities and so figuring out

1488
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:55,200
what individual sensitivities and

1489
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:56,480
blindnesses are is very very important

1490
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,719
when you're running a sing program so

1491
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,278
you need to be able to um have

1492
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:04,118
correction factors so if I say oh my God

1493
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:06,318
this is the worst smelling diasy beer

1494
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:08,000
ever probably take that with a grain of

1495
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,639
salt and compare it against how

1496
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,838
sensitive I what's my threshold for dial

1497
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,038
um whereas one of the one of the guys I

1498
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:15,960
work with if Tommy detects DMS because

1499
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:20,599
he's so insensitive to it and that's a

1500
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:24,079
DMS is the um Fritos uh or uh sort of

1501
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:27,200
cooked cream corn uh smell or or or

1502
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,960
cabbagey smell um if he detects it it's

1503
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:32,000
probably very very strong because he's

1504
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,679
very not sensitive to it um anyway

1505
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,119
that's it's it's very useful to to to

1506
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,558
bear in mind that your panelists and

1507
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,680
your sensory people um will have their

1508
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:42,400
own uh innate biases either from

1509
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:43,519
experience or just because if they have

1510
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,680
they have different anosmia and

1511
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,119
different sensitivities

1512
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:51,759
um there are compounds that work

1513
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:54,039
together uh to create a elevated sensory

1514
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,240
experience on a higher level of smell or

1515
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:57,559
a different smell uh and there are

1516
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,598
compounds that will work against each

1517
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:01,278
other so they either mute each other or

1518
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:03,519
cancel each other out or in the wrong

1519
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:05,838
combination will smell pretty disgusting

1520
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:08,519
so you can get uh one of my favorite

1521
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:11,639
examples is ethylate um it's an Esther

1522
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:13,639
um it at the right level it smells like

1523
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:15,159
beautiful tropical fruit however once

1524
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:18,118
you get over a certain level it start to

1525
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:19,920
smell like baby vomit and rotting fruit

1526
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:23,559
so it's it's a really delicate delicate

1527
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,838
balance um so one of the things that

1528
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:26,720
that I've been working on with my team

1529
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:28,159
and I've I'm you know incredibly

1530
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,558
grateful for the people that that that

1531
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:32,078
work with me um I've got this amazing

1532
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,760
organic chemist and I've got this

1533
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:37,000
amazing sensory head and sensory team um

1534
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,839
we're really trying to make sure that um

1535
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,039
we're capturing everything that makes up

1536
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:44,920
a hop uh and then also try to capture

1537
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,440
how people experience that and then

1538
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,798
trying to figure out what the numbers

1539
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,278
are what are the what are the actual

1540
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:52,239
compounds what are going on and how do

1541
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:57,239
those interact together to be able to

1542
01:03:52,239 --> 01:04:00,118
provide this sensory experience um it's

1543
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:00,959
a tremendous amount of work um but it's

1544
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:03,599
really

1545
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,920
really powerful in terms of of what it's

1546
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,798
going to be allow us to to to to do to

1547
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,480
describe these things and these are the

1548
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,880
same compounds that are in cannabis um

1549
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,639
Hops and they have the same hops genome

1550
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,400
is contained within the Cannabis genome

1551
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:20,038
which is fun um so we know that the

1552
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,480
those genes are going to be expressing

1553
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:24,400
uh and and they can lead to the same

1554
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:27,000
things um and

1555
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,838
so the exciting thing for me is that

1556
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,960
there's a lot of cross applicability of

1557
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:33,038
this um but one of the things that that

1558
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,440
uh so max one of the things that you

1559
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,400
were saying earlier that that I kind of

1560
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:41,318
was uh was interesting um but also a

1561
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:43,000
little concerned about is the the the

1562
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:44,558
industry's focus on potency which I

1563
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,559
think we all agree is is not what we

1564
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,559
really want to focus on um but it's also

1565
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,159
the sample size for the effects of these

1566
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,240
compounds so

1567
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,639
um when you talk about the experiential

1568
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:01,239
the the the nerves and stuff like that I

1569
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:03,440
don't I don't know anything about the

1570
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:05,639
human physiology of it but I do know how

1571
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,318
a lot of these aromatics work together

1572
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:11,639
to give a um aromatic experience to the

1573
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:14,199
consumer

1574
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:16,759
and I don't know I don't I haven't seen

1575
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:19,000
enough data on on what the impact of

1576
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,599
those compounds are far like sort of pH

1577
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,838
kinetically or or or psychosomatically

1578
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:27,480
or not psychosomatic what's the what I'm

1579
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:30,278
looking for um just the

1580
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,960
the psychotropic effects of these things

1581
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:35,079
or the or the therapeutic effects of

1582
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,760
these of these compounds um so I can't

1583
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:39,000
speak to that but I do know from our

1584
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,079
experience that there's an incredible

1585
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,440
amount of individual variety and and

1586
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:49,920
difference between people for the same

1587
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:52,400
uh same mix of compounds and so that's a

1588
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,200
um it's something that I think that as

1589
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:59,200
an industry we should uh really try to

1590
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,919
focus on to make sure that we are um

1591
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:03,798
making sensible recommendations but also

1592
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,400
to accept the fact that that people have

1593
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:06,880
different experience of these and I

1594
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,639
think it's exciting rather so again you

1595
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,480
know rather than this be a problem let's

1596
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:13,400
use it as a feature so one of the things

1597
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,358
that allowed our our group to to be one

1598
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,200
of the leading um sort of hop sensory

1599
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:20,639
groups and and hop providers in in in

1600
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:22,838
the industry was that we celebrated the

1601
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,278
variety between Lots rather than trying

1602
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:28,480
to blend them all together and make you

1603
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:30,798
know one true to type uh Citra or Tut

1604
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,960
type Mosaic or one one type of one lot

1605
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,199
of hops out of all of them so that was

1606
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,639
an average um we actually kept them

1607
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:37,000
separate and keep them separate and

1608
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:39,759
allow Brewers to pick and choose what

1609
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,199
they want because there's Beauty in the

1610
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,640
variety there's Beauty in the difference

1611
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,639
like celebrate the differences between

1612
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:51,239
things um at the same time we also have

1613
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,599
to be aware that in terms of quality and

1614
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:55,679
for for customer expectations that we do

1615
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,079
need to establish what you call typicity

1616
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,038
um and we call uh this true to type

1617
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,000
character so it's like okay this is an

1618
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:04,920
amazing lot of Citra but it's got 50%

1619
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,480
more oil than normal it's way less

1620
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,200
bitter than normal and it smells

1621
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,278
incredibly citrusy but it's so much it's

1622
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:14,239
a spike so much in One Direction

1623
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:17,000
aromatically that we don't feel that

1624
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:19,078
it's a good representation of of this

1625
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,358
hop now what's really fun is I have now

1626
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:21,680
have a field study program where we

1627
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:23,519
could say okay what the hell happened in

1628
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:24,598
that field cuz that's really cool and we

1629
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,838
can start of figure out sort of what's

1630
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,440
going on in the metabone what's going on

1631
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:29,679
to the to the impacts uh from the

1632
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,318
environment and farm practice to create

1633
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,719
those differences and we like to share

1634
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:34,358
we give that back to our to our Growers

1635
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:39,358
so that they can decide whether they

1636
01:07:34,358 --> 01:07:41,119
want to do that again um so I so do you

1637
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:45,078
mind if I comment no no

1638
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:48,559
please um so when I was giving the

1639
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:51,079
glorified example of uh the Cannabis

1640
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,359
somaler by describing cannabis types

1641
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:56,599
with an Appalachian a tewa all these

1642
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:59,519
things um and I think Jeremy got

1643
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:00,599
concerned by by that from a medical

1644
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:03,798
patient

1645
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:06,960
perspective uh I just want to you know

1646
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:10,519
be very clear

1647
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,039
that um we really have to

1648
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:16,640
compartmentalize how massive and how

1649
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,560
vast the Cannabis industry is and how

1650
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,000
there's so many different things and

1651
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,560
levels that we can and are talking about

1652
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,158
which all have crossover what I was

1653
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:29,719
describing in that sense was something

1654
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:32,719
that truly help the family farmers who

1655
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:35,319
practice Agro forestry and uh

1656
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,880
regenerative cannabis who are being

1657
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:40,000
threatened by big marijuana and it's

1658
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,838
their ability to prove how why their

1659
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,600
cannabis is special in very real ways

1660
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:50,318
similarly to Vin culture whereas where I

1661
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,520
live in Colorado right here right now

1662
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,520
there's no such thing as a cannabis

1663
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:58,759
appalachi and there's no way in hell you

1664
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,440
could even attempt cannabis tawa because

1665
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:03,399
in the state of Colorado you have to

1666
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:05,358
grow all of your flowers indoor by law

1667
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:09,920
it is against the law to grow cannabis

1668
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:11,520
outside in Colorado both retail and and

1669
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,679
uh medical the only cannabis you can

1670
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:17,159
legally grow outside is uh hemp and that

1671
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:19,520
even goes for medical marijuana patients

1672
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:21,198
themselves and now because I don't care

1673
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,799
too much about the law and I believe

1674
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,719
that my cannabis grows way better

1675
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:28,198
outside than it would inside I grow weed

1676
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:31,439
outside but um it's it's not lawful and

1677
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:34,479
so you don't have that here and so um

1678
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:37,599
the other thing that we don't have is

1679
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:40,919
the system of taking care of patients in

1680
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:44,120
such a legitimate and caring way that

1681
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,880
Jeremy described well that doesn't exist

1682
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:49,119
it's starting to though it is it is

1683
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:52,480
starting okay okay when all I'm saying

1684
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:54,880
is is you know in in California what

1685
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,238
Jeremy described sound like Aunt Zelda

1686
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,319
in her work

1687
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,718
if I had a medical patient a family

1688
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,679
member I would want them to not get

1689
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,399
advice from a bud tender in any just

1690
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:06,520
regular old dispensary I would want them

1691
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:08,639
in a program like what you're talking

1692
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,840
about because that's what they need

1693
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,560
people do need cannabis coaches to

1694
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:17,560
explain how vast and complex this stuff

1695
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:20,360
is for them and the reality is because

1696
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,880
uh being a bud tender does not require

1697
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:27,000
in most places training or

1698
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:29,840
certification you have have Stoners who

1699
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,920
are passionate about getting high in the

1700
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:35,520
position of a pharmacist helping medical

1701
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:38,440
patients select their cannabis as the

1702
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,360
majority of the situation so yes of

1703
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:43,519
course what Jeremy's talking about what

1704
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:46,960
Aunt Zelda does it does exist but on

1705
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,320
such a small small scale that how could

1706
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:53,039
I help the masses better understand the

1707
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:56,920
complexity of cannabis by overcoming The

1708
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:59,600
Strain name dilemma um so I did a little

1709
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,920
video it's on YouTube where I went uh

1710
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,960
secret shopping for blue dream in Denver

1711
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,279
Colorado and in an hour I bought six

1712
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,359
different types of Blue Dream from four

1713
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:12,039
different dispensaries brought them back

1714
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:14,679
to the office and I'm showing you that

1715
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:16,679
the inflorescence just the the phenotype

1716
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:18,920
alone you can just see this is not the

1717
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:20,279
same flower especially when you smell it

1718
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:22,960
and you're like okay these are two

1719
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:25,519
different flowers but we have medical

1720
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,960
patients coming in for medicine what

1721
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,360
they're being offered is things via

1722
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:33,000
strain name blue dream and they're not

1723
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:35,679
getting what they're needing and so

1724
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,039
patient just just to finish only

1725
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,880
place the the interpreting process and

1726
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:45,600
methodology is actually helping patients

1727
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:48,920
because moms who have

1728
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,520
to for cannabis for their kids who are

1729
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,639
done listening to untrained and

1730
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,239
uneducated uncertified Bud tenders who

1731
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:56,880
don't know what they're talking about

1732
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,238
can actually engage in their senses the

1733
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,400
nose knows what the body needs you are

1734
01:11:59,238 --> 01:12:03,638
physically attracted your physiology is

1735
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:05,279
attracted to the medicine that you need

1736
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:07,800
which is how and why we do teach the

1737
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,679
Cannabis experimentation phase by

1738
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,320
helping people first compartmentalize

1739
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,399
the fact that there are really

1740
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:15,039
stimulating types there really are more

1741
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:17,158
sedative types and there's also a

1742
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:20,079
spectrum of types in between those and

1743
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:22,920
so if we can help you understand how to

1744
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:24,800
intimately engage your flower even in a

1745
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,359
dispensary setting where there's no

1746
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,560
appal there's no tewa topicity doesn't

1747
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:32,198
even matter you just need to buy

1748
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:34,520
something that's going to work for you

1749
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:37,079
we're so proud that interpreting helps

1750
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,520
medical patients do that in in that way

1751
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,158
when they don't have the type of

1752
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,800
guidance that you're talking about that

1753
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:45,039
I wish everyone truly did have so um I I

1754
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,920
just wanted to make sure I just wanted

1755
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:49,920
to make that that clear and also say uh

1756
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,719
Nick you and I have to hang out dude I

1757
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,319
yeah well that's kind of where that's

1758
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:58,279
kind of where I was going with this is

1759
01:12:54,319 --> 01:13:00,599
that question for you Nick sure last one

1760
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:05,399
how many Turing are found in

1761
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:07,239
hops oh god um oh you don't know no I

1762
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:09,960
mean it's it's well we haven't

1763
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:11,839
identified them all um but but the ones

1764
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,639
that are identified is what we're

1765
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:17,639
talking about oh in the

1766
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:20,960
hundreds okay because cannabis only has

1767
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:22,440
156 have been identified that that's

1768
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,399
it's that have been identified but they

1769
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:26,399
also don't have access to our database

1770
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:29,359
um and that may be something that we can

1771
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:32,759
we can change um but it is

1772
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:35,319
uh cannabis will have more than 156 I I

1773
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:37,840
was working with Jadon Rouge and they

1774
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:39,880
were able to find two or three new ones

1775
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:44,360
that weren't in the Cannabis

1776
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:47,960
database uh they're sent in flavor folks

1777
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:50,759
my one other question is what kind of uh

1778
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:54,239
analysis were you doing to identify the

1779
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:56,719
head space of these turpins in hop so we

1780
01:13:54,238 --> 01:14:01,198
we we have a couple different tools um

1781
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:02,920
we have um a a pretty sensitive gcms

1782
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,479
that allows us to exclude certain

1783
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:06,079
sections of the chromatogram so we can

1784
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:07,959
uh zoom in so we don't get confounding

1785
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:09,840
effects from uh very high concentrations

1786
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:13,079
of compounds like U like mercine it's

1787
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:16,480
about 65% or 50 to 60% of the uh

1788
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:18,960
actually 50 to 80% of the oil profile of

1789
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:20,919
hops is mercine um but it's actually not

1790
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,079
very relevant for for beer because it

1791
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,840
doesn't make it through the process so

1792
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:26,238
uh we have to exclude that and so that

1793
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,760
gives us a bit more resolution so we

1794
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:32,599
could look at the remaining uh you know

1795
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:36,400
30 to 40% are you using GC FID Ms uh we

1796
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:38,440
use GC FID uh ecd for some of the visal

1797
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,238
D ketones and then we have some other

1798
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:42,039
sensors as well that are more than FID

1799
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:44,439
but yes that's one of the tools that we

1800
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:46,920
use I've got

1801
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:50,158
using we use spey as well yes so I've

1802
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:52,319
got spey FID ecd uh and then we've got

1803
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:54,679
the LC systems so liquid chromatography

1804
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:57,359
systems that we use for the polyphenols

1805
01:14:54,679 --> 01:15:00,480
and the canids yeah um we've been doing

1806
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:03,039
this for 30 years with cannabis so

1807
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:06,158
that's why I was familiar with these so

1808
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,960
yeah so so uh we're using the uh agilant

1809
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:12,439
uh

1810
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:15,359
73 something or other um and uh we have

1811
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:19,000
the uh it's a spey type system with the

1812
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:21,039
gerol Twister stir bars and uh so it's a

1813
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,639
it's a sorbent little stirb bar that you

1814
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,960
take the headspace and then we have a

1815
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:29,880
Quantified time of flight

1816
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:31,840
uh uh module on that as as well as a

1817
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,359
sulfur chemo Lumin luminesence detector

1818
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:37,440
on that one on that particular one so we

1819
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:39,719
can tell look up the uh thol th you guys

1820
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,279
are slightly more sophisticated than my

1821
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:45,039
lab was but I've been doing it for 30

1822
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:46,559
years today's Flex is brought to you by

1823
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:49,760
Nick

1824
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,880
zegler no it's it's a it's it's I do not

1825
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,560
intend this to be a flex it's more of a

1826
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,679
no no I know I know listen it was just

1827
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,960
that should on another level dude I'm

1828
01:15:56,679 --> 01:16:02,800
just we appreciate

1829
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:04,399
you question profoundly oh sorry may I

1830
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,320
very quickly make a comment there yeah

1831
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:08,638
go I just want to appreciate the range

1832
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:10,439
of instrumentation Nick just described

1833
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:12,400
and that you know ultimately when we're

1834
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:14,158
looking at compliance testing or the

1835
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,279
kinds of Aroma testing that we have in

1836
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:19,158
cannabis I want to point out the clear

1837
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:20,840
distinction between that level of rigor

1838
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,000
other than Sam what you have been

1839
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,119
involved with for so long and others but

1840
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,279
really quickly I just wanted to

1841
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:28,880
celebrate Nick being here um this

1842
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:30,519
actually comes through a chain of

1843
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,600
conversations which actually started

1844
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:36,080
with Rob Clark Rob and Mojave uh were

1845
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:39,120
talking passionately about hops long

1846
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:41,158
long time ago and we started reading all

1847
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:44,719
kinds of folks in the Hop space and and

1848
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:44,719
having these great conversations and

1849
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:50,879
then um there's this amazing man Nick

1850
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:52,678
who's showing up in all these podcasts

1851
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,920
and who has the most informed

1852
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:57,719
mindblowing absolutely precision

1853
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,079
oriented sensory at scale and it's just

1854
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:01,000
I I want to celebrate that anybody who

1855
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:02,639
hasn't had a chance to hear Nick and all

1856
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,399
of the other forums that he's been

1857
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:07,480
airing this kind of content it is just a

1858
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:09,559
series of epiphanies and trying to

1859
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:12,198
understand some of the Mysteries in the

1860
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:14,760
aroma conversation around cannabis um so

1861
01:17:12,198 --> 01:17:16,799
I just to me Marcus that you facilitated

1862
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,960
this today is just such an awesome deal

1863
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,279
like I literally think when you bring a

1864
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:25,600
nick into our space it's like the entire

1865
01:17:22,279 --> 01:17:27,479
space moves in a really healthy uh way

1866
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,600
much like Max in all of the efforts

1867
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:32,279
you've been doing to like really build a

1868
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,400
rigorous approach to sensory and then to

1869
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:36,359
and I apologize if earlier there was

1870
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,920
maybe a misunderstanding the one thing I

1871
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:41,238
really want to reject and push back on

1872
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:43,560
is this we get too codified about

1873
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:45,678
particular effects and the correlation

1874
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,719
to scent and of course like even if

1875
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:50,079
we're looking at monot turpins we know

1876
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:52,679
that sesat turpins have all kinds of

1877
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:54,920
truly valid therapeutic contributions as

1878
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:56,560
well as all of the things that we cannot

1879
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,719
smell and so while the nose knows

1880
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,320
certain things I just think there's a

1881
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,079
line where we when we're talking about

1882
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:04,960
therapeutic use and more personalized

1883
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:07,760
targeted effects I I personally am

1884
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,960
concerned about trying to link those at

1885
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,000
this juncture there's just so much

1886
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,760
research and evidence needed to support

1887
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,399
that kind of stuff and I think that

1888
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,360
there's actually a very simple approach

1889
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:19,079
to doing what you just said you know

1890
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,920
only exists out here and it's like it

1891
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:23,920
can happen anywhere cannabis flower

1892
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:25,880
exists with the correct education and

1893
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,600
meeting patients where they are with the

1894
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:30,719
flour that's available um there is a

1895
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,760
process by which to teach somebody about

1896
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:35,480
titration and dosage the different

1897
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:37,760
Delivery Systems a very initial sort of

1898
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:40,559
perspective about evidence-based

1899
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:43,440
pharmacology and then sort of really

1900
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,960
support through just gentle counseling

1901
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:48,479
and many intervals uh somebody who's

1902
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:50,279
cannabis naive a new and lifelong

1903
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:52,439
sustainable relationship with this plant

1904
01:18:50,279 --> 01:18:54,920
that we all love but not everybody has

1905
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:56,519
been able to access and that's one thing

1906
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,158
I am really passionate about but I will

1907
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,800
also say there's a bunch of evidence

1908
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:03,238
that's on the horizon right now uh Dr ad

1909
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,400
Ray is publishing this year the data

1910
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:07,519
from the last two years of cultivation

1911
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:09,960
classic we've talked about this once

1912
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,520
before but I I think one important part

1913
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:15,119
of that evidence is that we see um

1914
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,400
absolutely no correlation whatsoever in

1915
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:20,079
what is I believe the most rigorous ATS

1916
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:22,839
scale study of contemporary products in

1917
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:26,000
this market uh with a lot of scientists

1918
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,440
on the back end between specific tpine

1919
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,279
dominance and effects which is one thing

1920
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:32,599
that you know we we see a lot of people

1921
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:34,960
running with um of course I talked with

1922
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,639
Ethan frequently about these themes he

1923
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,079
actually has a new bit of research from

1924
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:41,119
John's Hopkins last year that was about

1925
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:43,039
lening dominance actually correlating

1926
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:45,039
with positive mood inducement and things

1927
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:48,039
but in any case it's almost that I just

1928
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:50,399
feel at right now it's enough to Simply

1929
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:52,519
move into a maturity around sensory

1930
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:54,719
science and the space and that's a

1931
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,520
massive contribution and just like a

1932
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,800
mindblowing set of implications and as

1933
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:00,520
you said max eloquently it's like you

1934
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,840
know there's no better way to support

1935
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,400
the craft farmer that I can find at this

1936
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,119
moment to truly differentiate the novel

1937
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:09,519
output of something that has like

1938
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,479
intricate and nuanced and special sort

1939
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,440
of Aroma contribution and Aroma

1940
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:17,238
therapeutic potential um but I I'm

1941
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:18,919
excited to kind of also simultaneously

1942
01:20:17,238 --> 01:20:21,079
with the kind of rigor that Nick is

1943
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,399
describing an analytical process and

1944
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:25,279
then that correlating with human health

1945
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:27,238
and sort of clinical research

1946
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:29,759
be able to advance that other side of

1947
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:31,638
the conversation in a mature way I I'm

1948
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,119
frustrated with the industry at this

1949
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:35,880
point because God it was seven years ago

1950
01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:37,960
I set up a similar system to what you

1951
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,560
described at Pharma with there was

1952
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:41,760
stimulating properties and there was

1953
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,120
sedative properties and I tell you I I

1954
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,360
don't buy it anymore I I just I've seen

1955
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:50,559
too many contrary examples it's too much

1956
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:53,000
individual uh basis uh that is involved

1957
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:55,159
to be able to extrapolate in that way

1958
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,399
despite the Elegance of of

1959
01:20:55,158 --> 01:21:01,519
and simplicity of that notion I just

1960
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:04,519
Jeremy I I I would like to say that when

1961
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:07,080
we did uh blind testing double blind

1962
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:09,400
testing with uh 12

1963
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:12,359
subjects they were all pretty much in

1964
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:16,359
agreement on what kind of an effect it

1965
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:21,079
was creating we were dosing pure 100%

1966
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:25,039
pure THC 25 milligrams with just a spike

1967
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:26,960
of a single monot turpine and uh they

1968
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:30,279
they everybody was in

1969
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:33,279
agreement but we were doing it strictly

1970
01:21:30,279 --> 01:21:36,399
recre we were not focused on medical at

1971
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:38,719
all and I I I also yeah we we've had

1972
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:40,559
hundreds of Judges with lots of flower

1973
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:43,279
samples and I think the process you just

1974
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:45,560
described as a way more refined and easy

1975
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:45,559
way

1976
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:50,279
to look at the effect of a particular

1977
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:51,920
compound but we just looked at the the

1978
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:53,399
products that in the market and gosh

1979
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,440
it's just amazing like we see a real

1980
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:58,000
incredible scatter plot and the kinds of

1981
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,960
effects described however one here's one

1982
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,359
very important data point the most

1983
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:04,439
important takeaway probably from a human

1984
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:06,679
enjoyment perspective when double

1985
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:09,719
blinded and you know going through this

1986
01:22:06,679 --> 01:22:12,679
sort of random uh experience uh which

1987
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:15,439
ad0 led for years was that actually

1988
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:19,560
Aroma intensity was the single greatest

1989
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:21,519
factor for user enjoyment and so Aroma

1990
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,719
diversity and Aroma intensity must be

1991
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,440
characterized it's just such a vital

1992
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:27,119
task so I'm just truly grateful to

1993
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,799
everybody working on that and Sam God

1994
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,198
knows we wouldn't be working on that

1995
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,279
without you and and also without Ethan

1996
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:35,359
and Rob and Mojave who have postulated

1997
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,279
some new work also in a recent cannabis

1998
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:41,279
business Times article about archetypal

1999
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:43,759
Aroma therapeutic categories and but I I

2000
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,439
truly think I I just hope that uh we're

2001
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:48,159
all getting to celebrate a bit and the

2002
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:49,359
riches that gets to spill out from an

2003
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:51,879
ecosystem with the kind of

2004
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:54,079
instrumentation Nick has and the real

2005
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:56,400
possibilities for us to really shine

2006
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:58,800
light on what we all know to be like the

2007
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:01,039
most precious expressions of this and

2008
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,719
not let the commodity pressure and

2009
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:06,760
immature early stage crazy capitalist

2010
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:09,359
scaling of the industry you know totally

2011
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:11,199
muddy what is actually you know this

2012
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:14,719
like amazing lineage and tradition of

2013
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:17,559
craft output in any case I've said I

2014
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,439
love medical cannabis I'm glad to help

2015
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:23,320
with it

2016
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:26,559
but recreational is my interest that's

2017
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:29,960
close to my heart I want to know how can

2018
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:32,480
I create all the different effects and

2019
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:36,800
how can I increase their potency really

2020
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:41,119
to be honest so and Jeremy um I I

2021
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:43,159
also hope that um or or maybe I'll I'll

2022
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:47,479
try to explain it in this

2023
01:23:43,158 --> 01:23:50,879
way we do not teach that if you smell

2024
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:53,319
this smell it will have this effect we

2025
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:56,560
we we don't teach that and a lot of

2026
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:58,920
people actually think that we that a

2027
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:01,400
large premise of interpreting is that we

2028
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:04,319
teach people how to smell for particular

2029
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:07,198
tpine types and then based off of those

2030
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:08,960
smells assume what the effect will be

2031
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:13,238
based off of the research based on those

2032
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:15,800
tpin and we actually in our in our book

2033
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:18,000
um we Explain how and why that doesn't

2034
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,119
work and it can't work that way and that

2035
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,600
it's way more complex than that and an

2036
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,679
idea I want to give you is how awesome

2037
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,000
it is that turpening works for people

2038
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,480
who actually have anosmia which is

2039
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,399
something that Nick was talking about

2040
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:34,559
which is the inability to smell and so

2041
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:37,559
people who have lost their first cranial

2042
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:43,080
nerve and who cannot even smell these

2043
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:47,039
tpin they're still accurately able to

2044
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:51,039
categorize the generality of cannabis

2045
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:53,880
and so in a general sense you

2046
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:57,560
know have you noticed that when you have

2047
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:59,520
a heavy head cold that you don't get as

2048
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:02,080
high from your

2049
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,199
cannabis no but I have noticed that I

2050
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:07,198
don't get as high for my cannabis if I'm

2051
01:25:04,198 --> 01:25:09,599
experiencing fear or being

2052
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:11,759
cold if it's snowing outside and I'm

2053
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,840
smoking a joint it is really hard for me

2054
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:18,760
to feel feel that but um both Rob and I

2055
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:21,119
found that and many of my friends when

2056
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,199
I've questioned them have told me that

2057
01:25:21,118 --> 01:25:25,799
if they have a heavy head cold and they

2058
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:29,039
can't really smell cannabis they don't

2059
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:31,719
get as high I don't know too much about

2060
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:34,359
that but um just finishing this quick

2061
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:37,198
example that I wanted to for Jeremy you

2062
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:39,920
know in general it's really incredible

2063
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:44,799
that there's types of cannabis that are

2064
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:46,920
really dense from a cic perspective and

2065
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:51,480
that for whatever reason these really

2066
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:54,039
dense flower types have fewer pistols in

2067
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:57,678
both the amount of them and the length

2068
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:58,719
of them so we call it petite pistolet so

2069
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:02,639
these

2070
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:05,600
petite inflorescences that are dense

2071
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:07,719
that you feel at the maxillary gland

2072
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:11,239
when you smell it you feel the smell

2073
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:13,679
here not here and that if you have the

2074
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:16,759
ability to smell without picking out

2075
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:19,760
certain tpin it kind of smells like

2076
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:22,280
Leathers or chocolates tobaccos or

2077
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:25,000
mushrooms so when you have these deep

2078
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:28,359
dense Rich smell t

2079
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:31,880
with these deep dense Rich flowers that

2080
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:35,439
are really dense with petite pistolet in

2081
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:37,840
general those herbs affect mostly nine

2082
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:40,839
out of 10 nine out of 10 people

2083
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:44,279
generally as kind of a sedative Stony

2084
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:47,480
effect and so max I hear you that you're

2085
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:50,399
connecting physical

2086
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:51,959
morphology again to effect in a way that

2087
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:53,638
I personally am uncomfortable with I

2088
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,760
totally hear you I also wasn't sure if

2089
01:26:53,639 --> 01:26:58,159
you meant br act or CX but I I really do

2090
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,760
feel that when you start to make this

2091
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,799
leap between physical morphology and

2092
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,000
human clinical perspective there's just

2093
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,320
this it's a bridge too far that's

2094
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,920
literally my push back if you can

2095
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:12,198
illustrate through incredible evidence

2096
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,158
and and substantiate that sort of notion

2097
01:27:12,198 --> 01:27:16,319
at skill that would be miraculous but

2098
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:18,799
I've seen evidence to the contrary and

2099
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:21,439
feel like it's it's a mistake to follow

2100
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,679
that uh that path there's too much

2101
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:26,678
chemical inventory and too many diverse

2102
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:28,880
features in the ECS tone of individuals

2103
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:31,000
yeah and you know there's there's Parts

2104
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:35,440
in here where we actually show and

2105
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:37,840
explain how and why this method um on

2106
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:41,399
occasion doesn't

2107
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:44,880
work but if we did have the opportunity

2108
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:46,960
for uh me to hang out with Nick and you

2109
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,159
Jeremy and actually the rest of you if

2110
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:52,399
you guys want to come to this party I

2111
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:55,839
would love to set up the this

2112
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:56,719
demonstration where I would allow you to

2113
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,880
to

2114
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:03,480
connect um the

2115
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:06,880
minuteness of an inflorescent pattern

2116
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:08,359
that flowers that have larger spacing

2117
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,600
just in the cola they're just a little

2118
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:13,118
bit more fluffy that have a little bit

2119
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:16,719
longer pistolet and a little bit more of

2120
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:18,759
it that generally have citrusy or gassy

2121
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:20,439
tones that you generally feel in the

2122
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:23,119
higher part of the trigeminal nerve the

2123
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:24,719
alaer bulb are generally stimulating

2124
01:28:23,118 --> 01:28:26,799
herb types

2125
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,639
and for people who are really lost in

2126
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,560
cannabis who are going by strain name or

2127
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:34,319
lab test that won't tell you an effect

2128
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:36,520
type or aren't privileged enough to be

2129
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:39,519
in a network like you who can guide

2130
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:41,679
patients that it is a system that on a

2131
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,480
daily basis people from around the world

2132
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:45,679
when they learn it say this changed my

2133
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:48,919
life because I now have so much more

2134
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:51,480
control over my ability to shop for what

2135
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,679
I'm looking for and actually get it

2136
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:57,718
versus going to a dispensary and saying

2137
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:59,359
I'm looking for Blue Dream 23% THC and

2138
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:02,359
and and and not getting what they're

2139
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:05,238
looking for and so it's it's a fluidity

2140
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:07,158
method and I can understand if you

2141
01:29:05,238 --> 01:29:09,839
haven't experienced it firsthand if you

2142
01:29:07,158 --> 01:29:12,319
haven't had an opportunity to engage it

2143
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,880
and bear witness to it and actually try

2144
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:17,198
it that um I could really see where

2145
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,840
you're coming from that so max if I may

2146
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:20,799
I just it's a funny thing so you know

2147
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:23,159
I'm a cultivator and I've been directing

2148
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,920
for this last 5ye period a facility

2149
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:27,158
called proof cultiv

2150
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,679
I have done a continuous process of

2151
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:32,198
cultivar discovery whenever I'm able to

2152
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:34,359
and you we just go through tremendous

2153
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:36,279
amounts of diversity here's one of the G

2154
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:38,000
timez interactions that I'm fascinated

2155
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:40,319
with that kind of throws a little wrench

2156
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,158
into this personally it's if you take

2157
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:45,960
say a classic Afghani and you have a

2158
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:48,920
room full of that you're going to see a

2159
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:51,480
more likely stable Aroma profile in that

2160
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,960
room however there is something that's

2161
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:55,279
occurring in a kind of chemical

2162
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,079
resonance similar to to like say root

2163
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:59,279
exudates or chemical signaling in the

2164
01:29:57,079 --> 01:30:01,118
root Zone we have chemical signaling in

2165
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,559
the aerial tissue and what we're seeing

2166
01:30:01,118 --> 01:30:05,839
is if I bring a terpinolene dominant

2167
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:07,600
variety into that room of afghanis

2168
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:10,199
suddenly the afghanis are starting to

2169
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,280
express terpinolene recently so the

2170
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:14,158
facility has gone in these waves I've

2171
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:15,960
been bringing in plants that have a a

2172
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:18,279
high amount of linol there's one plant

2173
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:20,880
in particular called peppermint Agave

2174
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:22,399
suddenly Lino is showing up in all of

2175
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,560
these other varieties that are grown

2176
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:27,238
adjacent to that variety

2177
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,920
um this kind of like just that's like

2178
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:32,118
one of thousands and thousands in the

2179
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:35,199
transcriptome of the kinds of Dynamics

2180
01:30:32,118 --> 01:30:37,519
driving really exotic and unique

2181
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:40,198
expressions of chemistry and what is a

2182
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,960
consistent morphological presentation

2183
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:43,519
like I can show you flowers that look

2184
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:45,399
very very similar that have an

2185
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,440
incredible range when we're looking at

2186
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:50,920
analytical R&amp;D results and so it's just

2187
01:30:48,439 --> 01:30:54,039
again it's that I I'm uncomfortable with

2188
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:56,079
the notion that physical morphology

2189
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:58,439
is going to be substantiated by strong

2190
01:30:56,079 --> 01:31:01,000
evidence in terms of human effect that

2191
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:03,000
is literally there's almost nothing that

2192
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,840
could be said short of really strong

2193
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
evidence at this point in my career

2194
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:10,279
after 30 years of cultivation and really

2195
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,359
using my own efforts to have sensory uh

2196
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:14,000
very immature early and now thankfully

2197
01:31:12,359 --> 01:31:16,399
being exposed to people like you and

2198
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,639
Nick and many others um really Lauren

2199
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,599
Salazar and New Belgium program was

2200
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:23,359
hugely influential uh these are the

2201
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,920
people that are now helping to open the

2202
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:28,439
door to a evaluation but again I I just

2203
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,760
think sensory is its own element which

2204
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:35,599
is amazing and remarkable but but that

2205
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:38,360
leap is heroic um Jer Jeremy does the

2206
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:42,079
does the Afghan have the synthes to

2207
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:45,799
produce to toine or whatever whatever I

2208
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:45,800
forget the compound you said

2209
01:31:47,238 --> 01:31:52,479
the plants have to possess the syas

2210
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:54,000
otherwise they can't just make it out

2211
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:56,118
exactly so clearly they have that

2212
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,960
potential but it's so amazing Sam I tell

2213
01:31:56,118 --> 01:32:00,960
you I've grown so many different kinds

2214
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:04,039
of aan over my life we all have I'm sure

2215
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:06,520
I I have never seen terpinolene in

2216
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:09,319
anything but a tiny tiny amount a tiny

2217
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,719
tighter in in a classic afghanica we're

2218
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:13,719
talking like a really squat compact

2219
01:32:11,719 --> 01:32:16,880
early maturing heavy yielding gorgeous

2220
01:32:13,719 --> 01:32:19,198
plant uh but so clearly the potential in

2221
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:21,039
the synthesis is there but then through

2222
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,079
chemical signaling is being evoked and

2223
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,039
obviously a lot of controls need to be

2224
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:27,198
employed to describe that interaction I

2225
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:29,079
do not have that data in place but

2226
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:31,638
through observation of our chemical

2227
01:32:29,079 --> 01:32:34,158
analytical output it's been remarkable

2228
01:32:31,639 --> 01:32:36,679
to see varieties I've cultivated for

2229
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:38,638
years completely changing of course I'm

2230
01:32:36,679 --> 01:32:40,560
also doing a lot of agronomy trials

2231
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,118
currently at proof we have a room with

2232
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,000
four different kinds of sort of inputs

2233
01:32:43,118 --> 01:32:48,279
for fertilizer and media we have lots of

2234
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
different photobiology projects underway

2235
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:51,960
you know obviously light Spectra and

2236
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,639
intensity is actually as large of a

2237
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,399
variable as any but Max something you

2238
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:57,118
said said earlier too you know I reject

2239
01:32:55,399 --> 01:32:59,439
also this notion that Tera is not

2240
01:32:57,118 --> 01:33:02,198
indoors I understand if we take the

2241
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:04,319
classical French Tera and we're speaking

2242
01:33:02,198 --> 01:33:06,198
really about minerality in the kind of

2243
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:09,319
median substrate the plants are growing

2244
01:33:06,198 --> 01:33:10,479
in and environmental effects and stress

2245
01:33:09,319 --> 01:33:11,920
that the environmental effects and

2246
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:15,879
stress

2247
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:18,319
even Noble Rot and buritis is influence

2248
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:20,239
in the progression of particular Aroma

2249
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:22,238
at the end of the day I'm absolutely

2250
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:24,559
manipulating I have 16 different

2251
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:26,279
environments where I can really create

2252
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,760
different kind media types different

2253
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:30,519
mineral inputs different biology inputs

2254
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:32,960
and different structure as well as

2255
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:35,800
different irrigation practices different

2256
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:38,118
VPD uh points different sort of gas

2257
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:40,639
exchange points and overall controlled

2258
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:43,519
environment strategy that very much can

2259
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:45,800
evoke a range of gtimes Z and or I like

2260
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,520
this other word phenotypic plasticity

2261
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:50,159
you know that the Cannabis is so

2262
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,600
remarkably plastic in the sense that

2263
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:54,839
these tiny tiny changes result in

2264
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:57,679
significant difference in the chemical

2265
01:33:54,840 --> 01:34:00,079
inventory um it was really like almost

2266
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:02,239
nine years ago now when I first gave a

2267
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:04,000
the exact same cutting to for growers in

2268
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:05,599
Portland and this is way before the grow

2269
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,560
off and way before I think these

2270
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,600
conversations were going on we saw one

2271
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:12,880
sample with 28 milligrams per gram of

2272
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:14,520
beta mirene another with a zero the same

2273
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,400
variety and those are really different

2274
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:19,520
effect types and and they looked I would

2275
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:21,559
say morphologically pretty tight similar

2276
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,800
to when you see grow off data you know

2277
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,760
Jake and Sam have published images of

2278
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:28,279
the flowers and there's range in that

2279
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,119
morphology but in terms of the effect

2280
01:34:28,279 --> 01:34:33,359
type you would see a far greater range

2281
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:35,198
in the chemistry and that's that's still

2282
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:37,079
a fascinating piece to me so you know

2283
01:34:35,198 --> 01:34:39,118
and I have seen a really just mountains

2284
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:40,600
of data now we have so much chemical

2285
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:41,920
analytic data but the problem is we

2286
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,639
don't have it at the level that Nick

2287
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,760
does and then we don't have mature

2288
01:34:43,639 --> 01:34:48,520
sensory to sort of connect the dots

2289
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:50,360
there's this giant Gap that I think you

2290
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,760
guys are actually working to make happen

2291
01:34:50,359 --> 01:34:53,880
right now Colin you were interrupted

2292
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,560
earlier brother sorry to so I just

2293
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:57,480
wanted to to jump in and just say you

2294
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,639
know um a lot of the thing you know the

2295
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:00,799
crop steering techniques you're

2296
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:03,319
mentioning and the suggested

2297
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,440
biotransformations of the targeted you

2298
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:07,759
know tpin that you're trying to to

2299
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:10,198
either you know you know you're after so

2300
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,560
to speak or the the the suggested uh

2301
01:35:10,198 --> 01:35:14,519
influence uh through different varietals

2302
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,039
in the same room in the environment do

2303
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,800
you think um you know just in general

2304
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:21,920
the a lot of the controls play a major

2305
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,920
role just environmentally also zo I'm

2306
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,960
finding root Zone uh temperature are

2307
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:28,840
playing a major role in how expressions

2308
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:31,359
are really truly coming out and that's a

2309
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:33,319
that's a an area that that was really

2310
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:36,000
kind of just not talked about for for

2311
01:35:33,319 --> 01:35:38,158
the longest time in in our in our world

2312
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,800
um but you know going back to what Nick

2313
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:44,039
was touching on it's so important to

2314
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:47,440
touch on every you know little bit of of

2315
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:50,279
of flavor and and intent here um and you

2316
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:53,238
know it's I I agree with you Jeremy I

2317
01:35:50,279 --> 01:35:55,519
think that we're um we've gone really

2318
01:35:53,238 --> 01:35:57,000
far and to try to try to humanize all of

2319
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,679
this and we're like yeah we got to put

2320
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,079
our thumb on that and understand it um

2321
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,399
but there are certain things we have to

2322
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:06,880
remind ourselves it gets dangerous and

2323
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:10,238
and we have to find great ways to

2324
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:13,319
articulate the mass of hexagon and

2325
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:15,000
rubius you know that this actually is

2326
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:16,719
and all the different touch points that

2327
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,639
we you know Nick you know you

2328
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,679
beautifully said this and and I think

2329
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,840
you know Jeremy I don't want to go

2330
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,560
harping on it again but you eloquently

2331
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:27,639
kind of explained how important the

2332
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:29,639
information uh truly is at Mass like we

2333
01:36:27,639 --> 01:36:32,199
we talk about very compartmentalized

2334
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:34,440
things in terms of the flavor and effect

2335
01:36:32,198 --> 01:36:36,158
and um you know we're we're in a you

2336
01:36:34,439 --> 01:36:38,158
know we're in that that sweet spot where

2337
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:40,759
we have people like Nick I'm doing

2338
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:43,158
similar research as Nick right now and I

2339
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:46,000
have been for quite some time so I find

2340
01:36:43,158 --> 01:36:46,799
his work you know I want to spend a day

2341
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,359
with

2342
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:53,679
you a weekend if we can and just talk

2343
01:36:50,359 --> 01:36:55,039
you know and and um you know it's it's

2344
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,600
what I'm trying to say is I think that

2345
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:58,560
it's really great that we're able to

2346
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:01,880
talk about these things I think Max you

2347
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:04,800
have an incredible perspective on on

2348
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:06,840
education um you know Jeremy's got a a

2349
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,960
different angle and a different eye for

2350
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:11,079
Science and and cultivation so I think

2351
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,960
together you know talking about this

2352
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:15,840
dialogue is really you know what's

2353
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,319
needed but um you know the the

2354
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,039
articulation of all this is really

2355
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:21,079
important right now and and that's

2356
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:24,238
that's the most important thing is just

2357
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:26,118
laying it on the table so yeah

2358
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:27,638
I I really love what you're doing man

2359
01:37:26,118 --> 01:37:30,279
and I love what you're doing Nick and I

2360
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:33,279
love everyone in this room so I think

2361
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:36,158
it's it's just it's exciting you know I

2362
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:38,960
I don't get enough of this conversation

2363
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:41,960
and and always thanks to Marcus right so

2364
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:43,679
uh that I I appreciate that and I

2365
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:47,198
appreciate this really awesome dialogue

2366
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:50,760
as well um this is really

2367
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:53,519
fantastic um Jeremy my analogy for what

2368
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,639
you were describing I call it uh middle

2369
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,679
school girl

2370
01:37:54,639 --> 01:38:00,639
syndrome like I don't know why they all

2371
01:37:56,679 --> 01:38:03,800
want to be the same but but if you take

2372
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:06,079
one uh you know new girl she goes to a

2373
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,880
new school right so you just take one

2374
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:12,039
cultivar type and put her in a room full

2375
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:15,079
of other cultivar types how and why they

2376
01:38:12,039 --> 01:38:16,840
seem to assimilate and try to strive to

2377
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:19,960
be like each other and share each

2378
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:23,520
other's characteristics is a very real

2379
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:25,760
and true bizarre fantastic and complex

2380
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,560
cannabis thing that deserves uh

2381
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,639
celebration right it's not it's not it's

2382
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,159
not it's not restricted to cannabis at

2383
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:35,960
all so it happens in bacteria it's

2384
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:38,679
called Quorum sensing and Quorum sensing

2385
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:40,359
is now known to happen in Plants as well

2386
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:42,639
and so that means that plants can

2387
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:45,479
basically sense their environment and

2388
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:48,039
why wouldn't they uh sense the presence

2389
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:51,079
of other phytochemicals especially when

2390
01:38:48,039 --> 01:38:54,399
those are the things that attract uh

2391
01:38:51,079 --> 01:38:56,719
pollinators right and and so um Quorum

2392
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:59,079
sensing happens in bacteria it happens

2393
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,520
in yeast happens in cellular organisms

2394
01:38:59,079 --> 01:39:02,639
there's no reason to think why it

2395
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:04,679
doesn't happen in plants too and I think

2396
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:07,118
that's that's a manifestation of this

2397
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:09,199
this is called quum sensing Mark

2398
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:11,198
certainly happens in people that's

2399
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:13,399
that's definitely been proven in in

2400
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:14,638
trees particularly old growth forests uh

2401
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:17,079
relatively recently guess about within

2402
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,118
the last five years or so correct um but

2403
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:19,599
will you just you just hit on something

2404
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:23,719
I think is really important when we talk

2405
01:39:19,599 --> 01:39:25,199
about um the uh the variance and EXP ex

2406
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:26,599
of these of these things you mentioned

2407
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:29,279
earlier that you know it's it's all they

2408
01:39:26,599 --> 01:39:31,239
all have the genes for for these uh for

2409
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:34,559
these Turpin for these these compounds

2410
01:39:31,238 --> 01:39:37,279
um it's because of the the I put a link

2411
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:40,400
to a paper earlier on about the um uh

2412
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:43,399
how the variation phic variation is is

2413
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:46,920
actually not reflected in the genotype

2414
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:49,118
of cannabis um and what's interesting is

2415
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:51,599
that they do not have deletes they're

2416
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:53,598
not missing these genes in fact the I

2417
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:56,520
believe the genome is copied over four

2418
01:39:53,599 --> 01:39:58,639
times um in in cannabis if that's uh I

2419
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:01,400
maybe misspeaking here um but it's it's

2420
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:03,840
there's a tremendous amount of of uh

2421
01:40:01,399 --> 01:40:06,759
sort of doubling up or tripling up of of

2422
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,800
these genes so they've been very very

2423
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:11,079
conserved and it's very at that point

2424
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,639
it's extremely difficult to get rid of

2425
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:14,198
them because they're conserved so many

2426
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,400
times unless you're doing some sort of

2427
01:40:14,198 --> 01:40:18,319
uh editing using crisper or the recently

2428
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:20,279
just discovered Retron methodology by

2429
01:40:18,319 --> 01:40:21,719
Harvard um but what you're were talking

2430
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:24,039
about earlier about sort of the

2431
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:26,279
phytochemical signaling what's really

2432
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:27,719
interesting to me and that we we've seen

2433
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:30,238
um I've seen this in cannabis I've also

2434
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:32,439
seen this to some extent in hops um is

2435
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:34,598
it's not just the the for for

2436
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:37,559
pollinators but stress response is a

2437
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:40,239
huge one so if you see wind damage you

2438
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,000
typically see a different uh aromatic

2439
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:43,799
profile and cannabinoid profile after

2440
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,920
that if you get uh so this this last

2441
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,039
year gave us some really interesting

2442
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:50,760
data from the wildfires um so all that

2443
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:52,679
smoke um and so we we eliminated any

2444
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:57,840
sort of deposition from the smoke but

2445
01:40:52,679 --> 01:41:00,719
what we saw was that um the THC levels

2446
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,960
dropped and CD CBD levels that ratio

2447
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:05,399
changed so we were actually able to get

2448
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,599
you know less destroyed or plants

2449
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:10,279
destroyed uh because of uh

2450
01:41:07,599 --> 01:41:13,000
non-compliance and hemp um but we did

2451
01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:14,840
see that there was a market change and

2452
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,520
the only difference from from the

2453
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,760
cultivation from the year prior because

2454
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:19,679
we have all the data on the farm

2455
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,520
management on irrigation on the water

2456
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:27,319
profile and fertilization fertigation uh

2457
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:28,480
uh and PP pbfd um I don't have a

2458
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:30,399
pressure deficit but that's because

2459
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:33,919
we're out they were outdoor um but we

2460
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:35,399
saw that the the wildfires and the the

2461
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,960
it was either the the haze or

2462
01:41:35,399 --> 01:41:39,000
potentially uh any sort of the air

2463
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,679
pollutants led to a substantial

2464
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,118
difference in expression and we when we

2465
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:46,239
did account for any pollution of the of

2466
01:41:44,118 --> 01:41:46,238
of

2467
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:53,639
the Smoke on the planet um we've seen in

2468
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,880
hops that uh when if a given bind gets

2469
01:41:53,639 --> 01:41:58,000
attacked by spidermites the rest of the

2470
01:41:55,880 --> 01:42:00,719
field freaks out and it bumps up its

2471
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,639
beta acid production because they

2472
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:04,880
recognize what those are um I really

2473
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,840
want to see some work on whether whether

2474
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,960
it's insect feromon themselves uh

2475
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,840
there's some some new startups doing

2476
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:13,279
some really cool work on this in the Bay

2477
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:15,599
Area um or if uh like if you see if it's

2478
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:17,719
a stambor or a piercing or sucking

2479
01:42:15,599 --> 01:42:19,199
insect that attacks the plant and it's a

2480
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:21,399
physiological response because we see

2481
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:24,359
damage we see similar stress responses

2482
01:42:21,399 --> 01:42:25,679
from wind damage and some and haale so

2483
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:27,079
it's not great for the crops they don't

2484
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:29,639
look very good but man do they smell

2485
01:42:27,079 --> 01:42:31,399
freaking amazing after that um and so

2486
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:35,000
what's interesting is is whether it's a

2487
01:42:31,399 --> 01:42:36,719
a physical response or uh a simple you

2488
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,238
know phytochemical signaling response I

2489
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:43,079
think be really interesting um Nick are

2490
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:45,439
are are hops wind pollinated or insect

2491
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:48,719
pollinated uh they are insect

2492
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:50,960
pollinated oh because canv is wind wind

2493
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,679
pollinated well they no I mean you can

2494
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:55,439
you can get wind pollination for for

2495
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:56,960
hops but primarily um I mean so the

2496
01:42:55,439 --> 01:43:00,439
pollen gets carried away but the way the

2497
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:02,359
Hop cones are um all of the uh the bra

2498
01:43:00,439 --> 01:43:04,319
and and and all that they cover and the

2499
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:06,118
pedals they cover up the glands and they

2500
01:43:04,319 --> 01:43:07,158
cover up the pistols those actually

2501
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:08,279
don't come out from underneath it so

2502
01:43:07,158 --> 01:43:10,598
this looks like a pine cone that hasn't

2503
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:13,118
really fully opened yet I I don't I

2504
01:43:10,599 --> 01:43:15,520
don't know about that I grow a wide

2505
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:17,719
variety of hops I grow a ton of tobacco

2506
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:20,639
I also specialize in psychedelic and

2507
01:43:17,719 --> 01:43:24,399
psychoactive cacti types have hundreds

2508
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:26,118
of yeah um ATS for cactus tons of Po I

2509
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:28,319
mean yeah I don't know if you can see

2510
01:43:26,118 --> 01:43:30,479
what we got going on over here but all

2511
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:32,399
sorts of stuff but um lots of poison

2512
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:34,799
path herbs and here's the deal like um I

2513
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:37,439
got little videos on my Instagram uh not

2514
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:41,760
triome Institute Instagram Max montro

2515
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:43,960
Instagram where I show you the flowering

2516
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:46,880
structures of my cannabis plants growing

2517
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:50,198
next to my hot plants and when that

2518
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:53,599
pistolet is receiving pollen it does so

2519
01:43:50,198 --> 01:43:55,759
in a in an anemy way because they are

2520
01:43:53,599 --> 01:44:00,639
wind pollinated and you know that

2521
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:06,520
because the male hop plant U they are uh

2522
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:08,719
diosas um its flowers open up downward

2523
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:11,960
the same way cannabis does and that's to

2524
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:13,800
dump pollen from the wind down onto the

2525
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:17,960
pistolet especially allowing the wind to

2526
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:20,639
blow it off um and in and generally like

2527
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:22,639
when I've grown my hops there's no cone

2528
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:25,239
when it's receiving pollen it looks

2529
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:26,760
identic to cannabis in the sense that

2530
01:44:25,238 --> 01:44:28,118
there's okay yeah that's a that's a

2531
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,079
that's a fair point you were completely

2532
01:44:28,118 --> 01:44:32,719
correct I misspoke on that um we do have

2533
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:34,039
we do have some there are some

2534
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:36,039
pollinators but you're right from that

2535
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:38,800
perspective it is it is primarily wind

2536
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:41,198
pollinator um the other reason you would

2537
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:43,920
also know that it's not a wind uh that

2538
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:47,759
why it is a wind pollinated species um

2539
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,880
is because both cannabis and hops from a

2540
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,119
flower perspective the reason why they

2541
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:54,359
don't grow petals why they're not

2542
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:57,519
colorful is because they're not

2543
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:59,479
attracting birds or bees from from that

2544
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,199
level for the sake of pollination

2545
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:03,879
because they are wind pollinators they

2546
01:45:01,198 --> 01:45:03,879
are they are an

2547
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:10,440
neople

2548
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,880
um something interesting that you said

2549
01:45:10,439 --> 01:45:15,559
Jeremy that I think would be a fun

2550
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:18,239
conversation is the idea of indoor

2551
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:21,400
tewa um and I think what you were

2552
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:23,039
talking about I have to agree with

2553
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:25,118
because what you're talking about is how

2554
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:27,399
the environment plays a role on the

2555
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:29,118
outcome of the plant well of course

2556
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:32,079
that's going to happen in an indoor or

2557
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:34,598
outdoor setting period cheat Rock tpin

2558
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:38,238
no questions asked right like I think we

2559
01:45:34,599 --> 01:45:40,000
could agree on that one right but is

2560
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:43,000
that

2561
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
tawa

2562
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:48,639
and I want to jump in on this one so

2563
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,039
I'll let you finish and then yeah I'll

2564
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:52,118
I'll I'm gonna throw one out there and

2565
01:45:50,039 --> 01:45:53,880
then I expect this to be a a groovy

2566
01:45:52,118 --> 01:45:58,118
conversation

2567
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:03,480
um so when it comes to

2568
01:45:58,118 --> 01:46:07,238
tawa um for example cabernet

2569
01:46:03,479 --> 01:46:09,839
saong from the Russian River of

2570
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:13,439
California Sonoma

2571
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:17,079
region has a distinctive

2572
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:21,399
typicity so the taste that is of typical

2573
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:24,118
from a Sonoma cab is due

2574
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:26,879
exclusively to its

2575
01:46:24,118 --> 01:46:30,399
environment so whatever

2576
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:33,520
reason that whatever the uh mineral

2577
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:35,479
content is whatever the rock content is

2578
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:39,360
however that soil is

2579
01:46:35,479 --> 01:46:44,359
composed that particular region of the

2580
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:46,639
world causes an environmental effect on

2581
01:46:44,359 --> 01:46:46,639
the

2582
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:54,238
out come of the wine that you can taste

2583
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:58,359
that's distinctive from all other

2584
01:46:54,238 --> 01:47:01,799
geographies so it's a geographic reason

2585
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:03,920
why the outcome of the flavor from that

2586
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,920
type of grape tastes different when you

2587
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:09,639
grow the same type of grape somewhere

2588
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:12,039
else and there are in the world of wine

2589
01:47:09,639 --> 01:47:15,520
there are two types of

2590
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:17,319
appalation one is called trips and the

2591
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:20,760
other is called

2592
01:47:17,319 --> 01:47:22,960
lisbin and the trips agreement to me

2593
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:25,280
makes the most sense for cannabis

2594
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,639
because it's exclusively based off of

2595
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:29,399
describing the cannabis's

2596
01:47:27,639 --> 01:47:31,359
quality

2597
01:47:29,399 --> 01:47:33,719
characteristic and

2598
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:35,479
reputation all of which you can easily

2599
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:39,359
describe a particular type from

2600
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:42,718
someone's Farm but the Lisbon agreement

2601
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:45,598
is a quality or

2602
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:49,319
characteristic that is due

2603
01:47:45,599 --> 01:47:51,079
exclusively and essentially to its

2604
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:55,880
Geographic

2605
01:47:51,079 --> 01:47:57,479
origin and so from that

2606
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,440
perspective

2607
01:47:57,479 --> 01:48:02,718
um when you grow grapes outside you have

2608
01:48:00,439 --> 01:48:06,919
a vintage you have the flavor of the

2609
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:10,039
environment that year and when you grow

2610
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:12,199
when you produce um alcohol in a

2611
01:48:10,039 --> 01:48:16,039
warehouse and it's

2612
01:48:12,198 --> 01:48:19,079
distilled it's a process that you have

2613
01:48:16,039 --> 01:48:20,880
indoors that isn't affected by the

2614
01:48:19,079 --> 01:48:23,000
environment okay I'm going to have to

2615
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,520
jump in here Max

2616
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,520
thank you so that's that's factually

2617
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:30,080
incorrect um so uh I'm I'm I'll go

2618
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:33,080
backwards uh through the distillation

2619
01:48:30,079 --> 01:48:34,439
argument is that um Barrel aging if if

2620
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:37,439
you're doing Barrel aging that's that is

2621
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:40,238
tremendously uh impacted by the local

2622
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:46,118
weather um and uh it's tremendously

2623
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:47,839
impacted by um how the uh Oak that used

2624
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:49,799
in the barrels was grown and where it

2625
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,039
came from and what sort of stressors

2626
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,599
what sort of lignocellulose levels It

2627
01:48:52,039 --> 01:48:55,760
produced because that'll to the amount

2628
01:48:53,599 --> 01:48:57,400
of vanillin that's comes out of it and

2629
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,159
some of the oak lactones so there's

2630
01:48:57,399 --> 01:49:00,238
there's a tremendous impact of this and

2631
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:05,638
so when I when I when I start

2632
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:08,238
criticizing ter Tera um Terror terer uh

2633
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:11,319
if I'm Gonna Be American about it uh is

2634
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:15,439
I don't um I do not dispute at all and I

2635
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:17,799
completely support and and and uh agree

2636
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:21,198
that environment and geography have a

2637
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:23,360
tremendous impact on uh the

2638
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:25,960
characteristics so so the the secondary

2639
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:28,839
tertiary metabolite profiles of of these

2640
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:33,319
crops um that's not a question

2641
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:36,039
um however the classic French opinion of

2642
01:49:33,319 --> 01:49:39,599
terar

2643
01:49:36,039 --> 01:49:42,880
is a shitty horis it's a it's a model

2644
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:44,440
that is incomplete and um it's uh from

2645
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:46,440
my perspective with the modern

2646
01:49:44,439 --> 01:49:49,000
analytical tools that we have it's kind

2647
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:52,238
of a lazy approach it's it's it's it

2648
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,238
works but it works and because it

2649
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:56,718
ignores so many different things we can

2650
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:58,000
explain it better now um so if you look

2651
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:59,760
at when you talk about the the Russian

2652
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,118
River which you know shout out to Vinnie

2653
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:04,199
and his crew down there and and all of

2654
01:50:01,118 --> 01:50:05,839
the all the lovely wines um that's

2655
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:09,158
there's absolutely a difference between

2656
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:12,279
the Yakama Valley and W Wala cab cabern

2657
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:15,000
from from Russian River however is it

2658
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:16,399
purely due to the environment the

2659
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,399
natural environment excuse me the

2660
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:21,118
geography and the meteorological

2661
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:23,158
environment that that they're in or

2662
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:24,479
might there be some differences because

2663
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:26,238
the farmers in order to get the best

2664
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:29,079
yields and the best character have to

2665
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:31,039
grow it in a specific way because of

2666
01:50:29,079 --> 01:50:33,198
those things so if you look at Bordeaux

2667
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:35,198
right as an definitely a part of tawa

2668
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:37,719
it's not exclusively to the environment

2669
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:39,198
it's how the environment and the farmer

2670
01:50:37,719 --> 01:50:41,960
work

2671
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:42,839
together is recognizable yeah far the

2672
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:44,679
farm

2673
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,920
management the the farm management

2674
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:49,399
aspect of it is something that has been

2675
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:52,520
historically ignored and and the the the

2676
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:54,439
uh Somas and wios I mean um wine Geeks

2677
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:55,440
uh uh T I work with a couple guys we

2678
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,559
always get into arguments about this

2679
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:59,158
over beer it's great uh but um like if

2680
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,480
you look at Bordeaux for example or some

2681
01:50:59,158 --> 01:51:02,960
of the other some of the other classic

2682
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:05,399
French reasons there is no appreciable

2683
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,679
difference in soil types um in drainage

2684
01:51:05,399 --> 01:51:08,279
and in that region but there's

2685
01:51:06,679 --> 01:51:10,440
tremendous variability between the North

2686
01:51:08,279 --> 01:51:12,158
End of the south end or how the Growers

2687
01:51:10,439 --> 01:51:13,799
grow it and uh that's and that's that's

2688
01:51:12,158 --> 01:51:15,598
what leads to the distinction between

2689
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:17,279
those those things and so what they've

2690
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:19,560
done is they've they've basically set of

2691
01:51:17,279 --> 01:51:22,238
a if it's from this region you can call

2692
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:23,480
it a Bordeaux right that's you know so

2693
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:26,000
you know

2694
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:30,000
denom of origin you know whatever Doms

2695
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:33,000
or however you want to say it um but

2696
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,760
they've also established upper limits

2697
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:39,439
and lower limits for the various

2698
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:42,239
characteristics that those wines exhibit

2699
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:43,359
to to the consumer um they've got

2700
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:44,799
they've been doing it for so long they

2701
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:46,639
know they're not going to be well well

2702
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:49,239
out of out out of range but there is a

2703
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:52,039
range and when we talk about sort of uh

2704
01:51:49,238 --> 01:51:54,118
uh cannabis variation your blue dream

2705
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:56,078
examples is fantastic one ignoring for

2706
01:51:54,118 --> 01:51:58,960
the moment the fact that it's very

2707
01:51:56,078 --> 01:52:01,039
likely that people got different sources

2708
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:05,239
or different cuts or different clones or

2709
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:09,238
different seeds um ignoring that even if

2710
01:52:05,238 --> 01:52:12,598
they were all from a blue dream mother

2711
01:52:09,238 --> 01:52:15,519
or something like that we should be

2712
01:52:12,599 --> 01:52:16,760
working to establish this truda type um

2713
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,639
this trudat type characteristic of this

2714
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:23,079
typicity and the way you do that is you

2715
01:52:19,639 --> 01:52:25,560
say okay here is the average aage

2716
01:52:23,078 --> 01:52:28,118
results or here here are the results of

2717
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:31,360
all the blue dream we could find um this

2718
01:52:28,118 --> 01:52:33,198
is the upper limit for these uh tpin and

2719
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:34,639
stuff that we that we discovered this is

2720
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:36,719
the lower limit for these Turpin this is

2721
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:38,920
the upper limit for THC and and and the

2722
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:42,039
other cannabinoids this is the lower

2723
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:44,000
limit and if it falls within this range

2724
01:52:42,039 --> 01:52:46,359
within so we typically take the the

2725
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,719
median value or the mean value so it's

2726
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:50,238
the it's the it's the really the median

2727
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:52,639
value and then we will go up to two

2728
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:57,359
standard deviations outside of that

2729
01:52:52,639 --> 01:53:00,239
anymore is too far outside of type to be

2730
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:02,118
considered that that variety and so we

2731
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:04,359
use that in hops um if you were to look

2732
01:53:02,118 --> 01:53:07,399
at doing that with with cannabis I think

2733
01:53:04,359 --> 01:53:09,359
that it could be done similarly um or

2734
01:53:07,399 --> 01:53:10,759
the alternative is you don't worry about

2735
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:13,719
that trud to type say here's the blue

2736
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:15,840
here's the Blue Dream core but this is a

2737
01:53:13,719 --> 01:53:17,439
piny expression of it this is a citrusy

2738
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:19,440
expression of it this is a TR fruit

2739
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:21,960
expression this is a TP terpinolene and

2740
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:23,319
aamine heavy expression of it however

2741
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,560
you want to do that but I think it's

2742
01:53:23,319 --> 01:53:29,319
totally possible for us

2743
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:31,880
to create the the error bars or or the

2744
01:53:29,319 --> 01:53:34,439
the upper limits for that trudot type

2745
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:36,960
characteristic while also celebrating a

2746
01:53:34,439 --> 01:53:38,719
variation within it and like Jeremy was

2747
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:43,000
talking about end up with the indoor

2748
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:44,679
terar or farm management based character

2749
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,800
paths character development for for for

2750
01:53:44,679 --> 01:53:51,520
individual cultivars and I think that's

2751
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:53,239
let let me ask a question yeah so um and

2752
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:57,440
to help help the framework of where I'm

2753
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:59,279
coming from so uh using alpen glow Farms

2754
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:00,919
which by the way I I they're in my book

2755
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:02,599
they're in my online course I use them

2756
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:04,440
as the example because I love Craig

2757
01:54:02,599 --> 01:54:07,199
Johnson and his family in the way they

2758
01:54:04,439 --> 01:54:10,118
grow up with cannabis I just it's the

2759
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:12,559
best um they're so true to the Earth

2760
01:54:10,118 --> 01:54:15,519
they care about sequestering carbon I

2761
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:18,159
mean the way that Craig is passionate

2762
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:20,480
about his soil when he touches it and

2763
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:22,439
smells it and shares it with you and

2764
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:26,238
make sure that that's the Cannabis he's

2765
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:29,000
growing in not some Fox Farm bag of

2766
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:32,039
stuff you could get right so in the

2767
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,920
sense of vulture in the sense of growing

2768
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:36,359
plants

2769
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:39,920
outside think about that

2770
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:42,679
outside in the sun in a region in

2771
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,719
southern humble with a farmer who

2772
01:54:42,679 --> 01:54:47,679
understands his tawa and grows towards

2773
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:49,399
it when he produces a variety of

2774
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:52,000
cannabis that he came up with called

2775
01:54:49,399 --> 01:54:54,439
Coyote Blue and he grows Coyote Blue in

2776
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,359
this region in this way with these

2777
01:54:54,439 --> 01:55:00,158
environment and keeps that consistency

2778
01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:01,719
that's the true to true to strain uh

2779
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:05,158
type that I I believe you're talking

2780
01:55:01,719 --> 01:55:08,000
about and to me that's cannabis and it's

2781
01:55:05,158 --> 01:55:10,198
cannabis with anapoli with tewa with

2782
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,479
topicity it's recognizable and it

2783
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:15,158
deserves a whole hell of a lot of Praise

2784
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:19,439
compared to where I live because if you

2785
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:22,319
take a clone of Craigs uh Coyote Blue

2786
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:24,439
and you give it to a standard dispens

2787
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:27,078
ens operation in the state of

2788
01:55:24,439 --> 01:55:30,000
Colorado they will turn it into a mother

2789
01:55:27,078 --> 01:55:33,238
they'll clone it out and maybe this

2790
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:38,560
month they'll use a mixture of cocoa

2791
01:55:33,238 --> 01:55:40,559
core uh with um vermiculite and peite

2792
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,280
and all this other stuff and then just

2793
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,880
feed it synthetic

2794
01:55:42,279 --> 01:55:49,158
nutrients and that's it's the same

2795
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:52,520
strain right it's it's Coyote Blue and

2796
01:55:49,158 --> 01:55:56,719
Coyote Blue is being grown uh in aare

2797
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:59,520
house and not as an agriculture but as a

2798
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:00,800
commodity um and so obviously when you

2799
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,920
compare the difference of those two

2800
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:05,960
flowers They're going to be quite

2801
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:09,000
different uh but from a tewa perspective

2802
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:11,840
and what tewa is and means I believe

2803
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:14,359
Craig Johnson has tewa and I believe the

2804
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:16,560
way he's growing cannabis is in within a

2805
01:56:14,359 --> 01:56:18,880
tewa and I think he can express what

2806
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:21,320
that tawa is I think he can explain it

2807
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:24,000
to people um and I think that's what can

2808
01:56:21,319 --> 01:56:25,840
help make his cannabis special and

2809
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,319
preserve what he's doing and keep his

2810
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:31,039
family farm strong and and doing what

2811
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:33,679
he's doing whereas the kote blue that I

2812
01:56:31,039 --> 01:56:37,519
would get at the dispensary that's just

2813
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:40,118
I mean factory made Warehouse weed in

2814
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:43,199
Colorado it's hard for me to say oh yeah

2815
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:45,519
that's got a tewa to it too I'm like no

2816
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:50,118
it was grown in a certain way and that

2817
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:53,560
certain way does have an output on it on

2818
01:56:50,118 --> 01:56:56,359
on the final product but is that what

2819
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:57,920
teat isn't means when teat traditionally

2820
01:56:56,359 --> 01:57:00,439
in the French term and how it affects

2821
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:03,399
ven culture is really particularly based

2822
01:57:00,439 --> 01:57:07,319
on how the natural native environment

2823
01:57:03,399 --> 01:57:10,638
plays a vintage role on the plant types

2824
01:57:07,319 --> 01:57:12,960
versus some so max I'm gonna jump here

2825
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:15,400
too I because I love I think you've done

2826
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,719
a really great service to the classicist

2827
01:57:15,399 --> 01:57:20,319
definition of Tera and this is a really

2828
01:57:17,719 --> 01:57:22,198
important idea that we have orbited in

2829
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:24,279
the Cannabis space for a long time and I

2830
01:57:22,198 --> 01:57:27,439
I think you've really done that idea

2831
01:57:24,279 --> 01:57:29,359
service I like Nick said earlier I I do

2832
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:31,960
agree that we're at a point where we

2833
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:34,238
have different tools and capabilities

2834
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:36,679
first off I don't want to be cast as I

2835
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:38,759
think Warehouse weed is good uh in

2836
01:57:36,679 --> 01:57:40,880
general I I just want to share with you

2837
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:42,920
that I I'm a passionate like actually

2838
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,000
the very first regenerative Farm award

2839
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:46,599
was at the cultivation classic that I

2840
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,439
founded and then it went to the emerald

2841
01:57:46,599 --> 01:57:51,880
cup and I've been working extensively

2842
01:57:48,439 --> 01:57:54,439
with Jesse do and others to support the

2843
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:56,719
most meaningful movement in um

2844
01:57:54,439 --> 01:57:58,919
Agriculture and outdoor field scale

2845
01:57:56,719 --> 01:58:01,279
Agriculture and really working with

2846
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:03,760
materials in the local region and just

2847
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:08,439
have a huge passion for that but I'm

2848
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:12,520
producing 550 well 45 to 50 harvests a

2849
01:58:08,439 --> 01:58:15,078
year in 16 environments with a huge

2850
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,920
amount of diverse variables this is not

2851
01:58:15,078 --> 01:58:18,238
at all like a warehouseing Colorado I'll

2852
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:20,800
just share you know that's a lot of

2853
01:58:18,238 --> 01:58:23,359
small spaces with different lighting

2854
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:26,119
technology different is

2855
01:58:23,359 --> 01:58:29,198
awesome my main focus right now is

2856
01:58:26,118 --> 01:58:31,519
mineral content in the media I am so

2857
01:58:29,198 --> 01:58:33,359
fascinated about the mineral balanced

2858
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:36,320
media and the correlation to the

2859
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:39,920
development of Aroma I I've seen that

2860
01:58:36,319 --> 01:58:39,920
for example I've been doing

2861
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:46,840
organic for very mineral balanced media

2862
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:48,920
is is just massive but there have not

2863
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:51,039
been sufficiency targets for the kinds

2864
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:53,560
of minerals that drive the best product

2865
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:55,238
quality in the space and that's really

2866
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:57,960
changing in these last couple of years

2867
01:58:55,238 --> 01:59:02,238
I'm sure you know soil doctor um Bryant

2868
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:04,399
is absolutely at the Vanguard of the uh

2869
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:06,919
understanding about mineral sufficiency

2870
01:59:04,399 --> 01:59:09,559
and cannabis Agronomy and has built an

2871
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:11,199
incredible uh basis of insight that I I

2872
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:13,159
would say at this point is about the

2873
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:15,519
most mature I've seen in any case

2874
01:59:13,158 --> 01:59:19,879
working with different kinds of mineral

2875
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:19,880
sufficiency Targets in organic

2876
01:59:20,078 --> 01:59:25,920
sub with different uh cultural practices

2877
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:28,239
Harvest timing light Spectra irrigation

2878
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,679
frequency all these elements I can

2879
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:33,439
produce what is the equivalent of like

2880
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:35,800
that Russian River P Noir in it is

2881
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:39,799
strawberry profile but then that

2882
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:42,480
willamet Valley P Noir very much a yeah

2883
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:45,199
Blackberry it's or cherry also cherry

2884
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:47,359
and blackberry kind of both you know

2885
01:59:45,198 --> 01:59:49,919
it's just that I can achieve all of

2886
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:51,319
those voices in a controlled environment

2887
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:52,399
and but one other thing I just want to

2888
01:59:51,319 --> 01:59:53,679
say about controlled envirment because

2889
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:55,319
we almost can't even talk about it

2890
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:57,440
without recognizing the research that

2891
01:59:55,319 --> 01:59:59,639
came up from University of Colorado only

2892
01:59:57,439 --> 02:00:02,238
a month ago that illustrates The

2893
01:59:59,639 --> 02:00:04,920
Unbelievable Reckless irresponsibility

2894
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:06,439
of carbon uh in this production

2895
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:08,118
environment that we're seeing you know

2896
02:00:06,439 --> 02:00:12,559
it's got a greater carbon footprint than

2897
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:12,559
coal in Colorado for indoor cannabis

2898
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:24,719
produ and you know this is a nightmare

2899
02:00:21,639 --> 02:00:26,118
this is on the past consistent yearround

2900
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:28,800
production environment completely

2901
02:00:26,118 --> 02:00:31,759
powered by Renewables and I'm hunting

2902
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:31,760
for resource

2903
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:36,960
use at the absolute

2904
02:00:47,479 --> 02:00:52,158
Peak I believe

2905
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:54,078
anybody I believe that plant Factory

2906
02:00:52,158 --> 02:00:56,479
with artificial lighting driven by

2907
02:00:54,078 --> 02:00:58,359
Renewables are a very significant part

2908
02:00:56,479 --> 02:00:59,959
of the Mosaic we need to move towards

2909
02:00:58,359 --> 02:01:01,639
but there's a little bit of like kind of

2910
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:03,480
knee-jerk well it's it's not working

2911
02:01:01,639 --> 02:01:05,480
well now but we're not at the Apex of

2912
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:07,598
our Evolution just like this sensory

2913
02:01:05,479 --> 02:01:09,678
conversation but thankfully we're moving

2914
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,920
in a way that's progressing there but

2915
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:14,719
back to being true to type what's

2916
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:17,480
exciting for me is that I I think that

2917
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:19,158
just like the beer brewer can achieve so

2918
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:21,359
many results in a short period of time

2919
02:01:19,158 --> 02:01:23,198
and therefore have this unbelievable

2920
02:01:21,359 --> 02:01:24,679
perversity of Aroma and flavor and I

2921
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:26,198
always look to the old wine drinkers

2922
02:01:24,679 --> 02:01:28,078
that I know who consume alcohol and

2923
02:01:26,198 --> 02:01:30,839
think God you're missing what's happened

2924
02:01:28,078 --> 02:01:33,158
in beer with the novel voices of barrels

2925
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:35,279
and Barrel age ales coming back and all

2926
02:01:33,158 --> 02:01:37,960
of the kind of hazies and these wild

2927
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:40,158
sort of diverse elements comparing to a

2928
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:42,760
a ventner you know who has a single

2929
02:01:40,158 --> 02:01:45,559
result a year and in their entire career

2930
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:48,480
May produce like 20 or 30 results at

2931
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:51,000
best it's like I just think that we need

2932
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:53,118
to be having this conversation between

2933
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,679
those polls because I can produce so

2934
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:58,679
many results and then probably discover

2935
02:01:56,679 --> 02:02:00,800
sooner than later what some of those

2936
02:01:58,679 --> 02:02:03,158
variables whether minerals in the media

2937
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:05,920
or other cultural practices it can help

2938
02:02:03,158 --> 02:02:08,839
to contribute uh to the overall base of

2939
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:11,480
knowledge as we're seeking to optimize

2940
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:14,199
ideal expressions of Aroma therapeutic

2941
02:02:11,479 --> 02:02:15,759
attributes and you know that's obviously

2942
02:02:14,198 --> 02:02:17,839
a vast Pursuit it will take tons and

2943
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:20,719
tons of us all talking and wrestling and

2944
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:23,039
arguing and having Jeremy we we call

2945
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:25,399
that job security uh in the Analytical

2946
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:27,439
in the analytical space uh but what you

2947
02:02:25,399 --> 02:02:29,359
you just mentioned in terms of the um

2948
02:02:27,439 --> 02:02:31,759
the the compounds and the minerality and

2949
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:33,799
and the the the you know the I call them

2950
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:38,079
the sort of metabolic precursors um and

2951
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:40,320
so looking at uh the soil chemistry uh

2952
02:02:38,078 --> 02:02:42,238
and the fertigation profiles uh for for

2953
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:45,319
any crop is is really fascinating

2954
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:47,718
because you can then apply metabolomics

2955
02:02:45,319 --> 02:02:49,238
and looking at uh the genes that are

2956
02:02:47,719 --> 02:02:53,000
being turned on and turned off in

2957
02:02:49,238 --> 02:02:54,598
response to what is present or absent

2958
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,520
because they they will they they have

2959
02:02:54,599 --> 02:02:58,279
different Pathways to produce the same

2960
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:01,599
result in case if if it's if it's

2961
02:02:58,279 --> 02:03:04,158
metabol met metabolically valuable um

2962
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:07,239
plants will synthesize the compound that

2963
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:09,759
they need um we do not understand why a

2964
02:03:07,238 --> 02:03:11,158
lot of these aromatic uh compounds are

2965
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:12,920
synthesized by the plant they are

2966
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:14,399
tertiary metabolites they're not primary

2967
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:17,158
metabolites they're not starch they're

2968
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:18,638
not a protein uh they're not they they

2969
02:03:17,158 --> 02:03:21,279
they have some function because they're

2970
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:24,159
expensive to produce some of them are

2971
02:03:21,279 --> 02:03:26,679
byproduct from other Cycles metabolic

2972
02:03:24,158 --> 02:03:29,839
Cycles or bi bio biosynthetic or bioch

2973
02:03:26,679 --> 02:03:32,679
biochemical Cycles some of them are uh

2974
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:35,440
seem to be an end result that

2975
02:03:32,679 --> 02:03:39,239
is quote unquote intentional like it's

2976
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:42,759
conserved for a reason um I would love

2977
02:03:39,238 --> 02:03:44,359
to find out more about what compounds or

2978
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:47,000
you know what what mineral profiles what

2979
02:03:44,359 --> 02:03:50,479
minerals are being used in what Manner

2980
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,118
to lead to the the synthesis of these of

2981
02:03:50,479 --> 02:03:54,399
these compounds um it's something that

2982
02:03:52,118 --> 02:03:56,118
I'm I'm working on in Hops and like the

2983
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:57,439
like the ventner we only get one Harvest

2984
02:03:56,118 --> 02:04:00,439
a year so it's going to take that's real

2985
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:02,078
job security um whereas uh with uh with

2986
02:04:00,439 --> 02:04:04,919
the work that you're doing and the the

2987
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:06,840
uh Recycling and it's just uh I mean not

2988
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:09,559
the recycling but the cycling through

2989
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:11,599
these many iterations is is what I would

2990
02:04:09,559 --> 02:04:14,679
love to be able to get into more detail

2991
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:17,719
with because I have the models um

2992
02:04:14,679 --> 02:04:20,359
roughly sketched out I have the the the

2993
02:04:17,719 --> 02:04:24,039
analytical tools um I just don't have

2994
02:04:20,359 --> 02:04:25,799
the data yet and I would just love to be

2995
02:04:24,039 --> 02:04:30,039
able to collaborate with anybody who's

2996
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:32,440
interested in this on creating a system

2997
02:04:30,039 --> 02:04:35,920
that if not you know sort of

2998
02:04:32,439 --> 02:04:37,879
governmentally regulated but at least

2999
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,880
you know voluntarily regulated in the

3000
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:42,039
industry so that we can you know we can

3001
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:43,400
raise the bar we can we can you know ra

3002
02:04:42,039 --> 02:04:45,880
let's raise let's raise the water level

3003
02:04:43,399 --> 02:04:48,679
let's float all the boats let's give

3004
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:52,599
people access

3005
02:04:48,679 --> 02:04:53,840
to data and and and reframe it in a way

3006
02:04:52,599 --> 02:04:55,440
so that they understand it so they can

3007
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:57,480
make choices that are good for them

3008
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:59,719
because of that individual variability

3009
02:04:57,479 --> 02:05:02,000
and response is that you know what this

3010
02:04:59,719 --> 02:05:03,078
is the profile this is we call this I'm

3011
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,960
going to use the Blue Dream example

3012
02:05:03,078 --> 02:05:07,519
again because I think it's a really good

3013
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:09,239
one um this is blue dream it can be up

3014
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,840
to this level or down to this level of

3015
02:05:09,238 --> 02:05:14,479
these compounds but you will have a

3016
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:16,599
expected level of of response you

3017
02:05:14,479 --> 02:05:19,000
personally within that range so you get

3018
02:05:16,599 --> 02:05:20,719
to pick I want a a terpinolene dominant

3019
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,439
version of Blue Dream because I like the

3020
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:24,279
canabo profile the can profiles are

3021
02:05:22,439 --> 02:05:26,960
actually pretty stable interestingly

3022
02:05:24,279 --> 02:05:26,960
enough that

3023
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:32,199
I uh within a within a within a variety

3024
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:34,360
the aromatic profile is going to be all

3025
02:05:32,198 --> 02:05:35,678
over the place um if you grow it using

3026
02:05:34,359 --> 02:05:38,158
the same inputs if you grow it in the

3027
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:39,279
same way in the same place treating it

3028
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:41,839
the same with expose it to the same

3029
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:44,519
stressors or same same uh deprivation of

3030
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,920
of of various nutrients or excess you're

3031
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:48,360
going to have pretty good repeatability

3032
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:50,480
not 100% but pretty good repeatability

3033
02:05:48,359 --> 02:05:52,639
um there's no way reason that we as a as

3034
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:54,558
a group or as an industry can can't come

3035
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:56,840
together to try to voluntarily create

3036
02:05:54,559 --> 02:05:58,239
this result um or you know this this

3037
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:00,400
database and this this information for

3038
02:05:58,238 --> 02:06:02,439
people I think uh empowering consumers

3039
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:03,759
is is something that I really believe in

3040
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:05,399
um as I like people to be able to make

3041
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:07,079
their own choice nobody knows what's

3042
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:09,118
what's better for them than the

3043
02:06:07,078 --> 02:06:11,920
individual themselves as you said

3044
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:14,839
earlier like you pick the medication

3045
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:16,599
that you are uh attracted to that or

3046
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:18,960
that you're you're drawn to because it

3047
02:06:16,599 --> 02:06:20,239
makes you feel better um let's let's

3048
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:24,960
just be honest that's why we do this

3049
02:06:20,238 --> 02:06:27,718
stuff um and it because of uh Aroma or

3050
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:31,000
cannabinoid profile um and it's for me

3051
02:06:27,719 --> 02:06:33,000
it's always both um like I would much

3052
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,719
rather consume something that is

3053
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:38,679
aromatically delicious um but maybe less

3054
02:06:35,719 --> 02:06:40,920
potent in some ways than uh have the

3055
02:06:38,679 --> 02:06:42,559
exact perfect balance of canabo with no

3056
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:44,440
character you know it's just that's just

3057
02:06:42,559 --> 02:06:45,760
not how it works for me and I recognize

3058
02:06:44,439 --> 02:06:47,519
that I think that there is something

3059
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:49,119
there I don't have it Quantified I have

3060
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:51,159
not seen the data that does quantify it

3061
02:06:49,118 --> 02:06:53,719
but there is definitely uh an

3062
02:06:51,158 --> 02:06:54,960
interaction between those things and you

3063
02:06:53,719 --> 02:06:56,239
Max when you were saying earlier like

3064
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,480
looking at the at the flower structure I

3065
02:06:56,238 --> 02:06:59,879
completely agree with Jeremy that I

3066
02:06:57,479 --> 02:07:02,198
think that's an extremely large leap to

3067
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:05,520
make in terms of the phac kinetics based

3068
02:07:02,198 --> 02:07:08,399
on flower structure however I also think

3069
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:10,880
that people looking at a really dense

3070
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:13,920
Bud might

3071
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:16,000
expect a different level of of response

3072
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:17,158
or characteristics from from that so

3073
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,800
they're they're they're sort of

3074
02:07:17,158 --> 02:07:21,238
preempting themselves there's a it's a

3075
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,520
it's the the in some way it might be you

3076
02:07:21,238 --> 02:07:23,558
you could link it to the placebo effect

3077
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:25,199
but it really is is that there's a

3078
02:07:23,559 --> 02:07:27,239
there's a bias of expectation towards

3079
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:29,519
something when I see a really dense nug

3080
02:07:27,238 --> 02:07:32,118
that's really well trimmed and clearly

3081
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:33,320
lovingly handled I get excited by that

3082
02:07:32,118 --> 02:07:35,759
because I'm pretty sure that it's going

3083
02:07:33,319 --> 02:07:38,519
to be it's it's high quality flower in

3084
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:40,679
that in that perspective um difficult to

3085
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:42,199
do with hash unless you can tell you can

3086
02:07:40,679 --> 02:07:43,800
actually tell that it's been uh it's

3087
02:07:42,198 --> 02:07:45,558
been properly sifted and cleaned and

3088
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:47,159
it's you know it's a really good good

3089
02:07:45,559 --> 02:07:49,079
mix and it presses well and you can you

3090
02:07:47,158 --> 02:07:52,078
can you can enjoy it for me for me hash

3091
02:07:49,078 --> 02:07:54,558
is far more far less Visual and far more

3092
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:56,238
um you know on the intake like once I've

3093
02:07:54,559 --> 02:07:58,880
once I've once I've vaporized it and

3094
02:07:56,238 --> 02:08:01,359
inhaled it then I have the experience of

3095
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,960
it whereas flower I mean like we we we

3096
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:04,920
in the Brewing industry we say that the

3097
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:07,239
the first sip is with your eyes you know

3098
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:11,118
so so so physical representation and on

3099
02:08:07,238 --> 02:08:12,799
a side note hazy ipas man they're can be

3100
02:08:11,118 --> 02:08:15,479
great flavor-wise they can also be

3101
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,679
really muddy but I spent you know 18

3102
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:18,638
years of my life trying to figure out

3103
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:20,440
how to make hoppy beer clear and then

3104
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:21,639
you know get it all flipped on its head

3105
02:08:20,439 --> 02:08:22,960
and now everybody wants anything hey

3106
02:08:21,639 --> 02:08:25,159
it's the same thing with with with flow

3107
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:27,158
is that when when you you know you can

3108
02:08:25,158 --> 02:08:28,879
get loose Airy bud or you can like Dr

3109
02:08:27,158 --> 02:08:30,638
grinspoon which is actually a fantastic

3110
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:32,359
aromatic and cannaboid profile but it's

3111
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:34,639
just crappy flower structure or

3112
02:08:32,359 --> 02:08:36,719
interesting at least um then you also

3113
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:40,800
end up with uh or or you can get this

3114
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:42,078
like really super dense nugs um that

3115
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:43,719
because the farmer grew them that way or

3116
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:45,399
the grower grew them that way and and

3117
02:08:43,719 --> 02:08:48,800
and managed them and really took care on

3118
02:08:45,399 --> 02:08:51,879
the trim and the Cure um it's really

3119
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:53,599
like I love that I love that variability

3120
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:56,880
you know or or the old Mexican brick

3121
02:08:53,599 --> 02:09:00,520
weed back from from from way back when

3122
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:04,440
um but I think it's uh it's it's worth

3123
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:06,199
considering those aspects of of how we

3124
02:09:04,439 --> 02:09:08,839
interact with what's in front of us and

3125
02:09:06,198 --> 02:09:12,399
it's not just Aroma and smell but it is

3126
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:13,319
also uh Visual and and I think it's you

3127
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:15,638
know if if you're talking about a

3128
02:09:13,319 --> 02:09:18,319
holistic assessment of how people react

3129
02:09:15,639 --> 02:09:21,960
to uh a crop I think that's that's worth

3130
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:23,399
doing so can I time in just uh had a

3131
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:27,118
little bit different perspective than a

3132
02:09:23,399 --> 02:09:31,719
lot of people here welcome Debbie hey

3133
02:09:27,118 --> 02:09:34,639
good to see you guys whoop whoop oh

3134
02:09:31,719 --> 02:09:36,319
man um so much I want to say about this

3135
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:37,800
but uh I've learned a lot wow that's

3136
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:39,439
trippy that the plants start taking on

3137
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:41,880
the characteristic of the plant next to

3138
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:45,078
them it makes total sense and that that

3139
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:47,440
goes all through like the human genome

3140
02:09:45,078 --> 02:09:49,158
the plant genome the planet probably you

3141
02:09:47,439 --> 02:09:51,839
know we're all like replicating to this

3142
02:09:49,158 --> 02:09:53,558
kind of stable place

3143
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,000
um and it makes me think like spending

3144
02:09:53,559 --> 02:09:57,079
all this time listening to the drill

3145
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,198
down I'm a retailer I have I've been

3146
02:09:57,078 --> 02:10:01,759
street level retailing almost 25 years

3147
02:09:59,198 --> 02:10:03,479
now so I know the consumer I mean you

3148
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,639
start talking to this the consumer about

3149
02:10:03,479 --> 02:10:06,839
this stuff and their eyes are going to

3150
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:11,440
glaze over and it's kind of that rule of

3151
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:13,960
three uh is it is it a hot mild medium

3152
02:10:11,439 --> 02:10:16,519
you know what's the salsa flavor is it

3153
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:18,599
small medium large um that's how the

3154
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:20,280
consumer is thinking and and so while

3155
02:10:18,599 --> 02:10:21,960
we're talking about capturing the micro

3156
02:10:20,279 --> 02:10:24,000
language I think we should

3157
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:27,800
also talk about capturing the macro

3158
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,880
language what are those three

3159
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:32,320
categories that are small medium and

3160
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:34,118
large in the industry you know are there

3161
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:35,719
three right I put extra large down there

3162
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:36,920
too but I you know I really think that

3163
02:10:35,719 --> 02:10:41,559
most of my clients are thinking in

3164
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:46,078
threes indicia sativa hybrid uh potent

3165
02:10:41,559 --> 02:10:48,840
mild medium um the Sleepy uh hyped up or

3166
02:10:46,078 --> 02:10:52,519
somewhere in between so I just want to

3167
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:55,239
put my two cents in um yeah what is that

3168
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:57,119
uh what's the Simplicity of the macro

3169
02:10:55,238 --> 02:10:58,519
that the the clients are looking for and

3170
02:10:57,118 --> 02:11:01,039
then when I think about the micro I

3171
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:02,960
think it's super interesting because I

3172
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:04,158
think that's where the medicine is and I

3173
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,118
think that's what we do with the with

3174
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:07,279
the

3175
02:11:05,118 --> 02:11:09,039
micro we really gota we're trying to

3176
02:11:07,279 --> 02:11:10,599
cure some diseases right and we need to

3177
02:11:09,039 --> 02:11:12,000
really get micro to figure out what's

3178
02:11:10,599 --> 02:11:15,039
going to really get in there and bust

3179
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,118
that stuff apart so so I love that idea

3180
02:11:15,039 --> 02:11:18,238
and then this whole time I've been

3181
02:11:16,118 --> 02:11:19,719
thinking about with all these talking

3182
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:21,959
about all these stuff about beer I think

3183
02:11:19,719 --> 02:11:24,158
about the beer um

3184
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:26,078
cooler at the store which is always so

3185
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:28,118
cool but there's really only a couple

3186
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:30,158
categories right is it dark beer is it

3187
02:11:28,118 --> 02:11:32,039
IPA is it you know they've kind of

3188
02:11:30,158 --> 02:11:33,879
categorized it and then within there

3189
02:11:32,039 --> 02:11:36,039
there's a lot of Genius in there but the

3190
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:37,840
clients are still going for those take

3191
02:11:36,039 --> 02:11:40,840
me to the category that I like that's

3192
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:43,039
simple for my brain as a consumer so we

3193
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:45,279
are we are categorical thinkers so we

3194
02:11:43,039 --> 02:11:47,158
like to make it easy I would love to I

3195
02:11:45,279 --> 02:11:49,559
would really love to answer Debbie on

3196
02:11:47,158 --> 02:11:52,039
this because um this is my bread and

3197
02:11:49,559 --> 02:11:55,079
butter is educating

3198
02:11:52,039 --> 02:11:59,198
uh dispensary staff to teach their

3199
02:11:55,078 --> 02:12:01,479
consumers what's available to them by

3200
02:11:59,198 --> 02:12:05,279
getting around things that are not real

3201
02:12:01,479 --> 02:12:09,279
and true such as Inda or sativa and how

3202
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:13,319
do we do that um because um all of these

3203
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:16,599
domesticated hybrids are so vast that

3204
02:12:13,319 --> 02:12:18,679
they're no longer an indicia or or a

3205
02:12:16,599 --> 02:12:21,800
sativa um and when it comes to

3206
02:12:18,679 --> 02:12:23,679
speciation we're finding that um

3207
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:26,360
anyways like that can get too complex

3208
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:27,960
I'm just going to share this with you um

3209
02:12:26,359 --> 02:12:30,319
a lot of guys on here are familiar with

3210
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:32,000
Rob Clark's work and I think it was

3211
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:33,880
brilliant when Rob Clark was

3212
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:38,198
compartmentalizing different cannabis

3213
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:42,319
types um in acronyms and so he would say

3214
02:12:38,198 --> 02:12:45,399
uh blh for broadleaf hemp which would be

3215
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:48,319
uh sativa species subspecies indicia

3216
02:12:45,399 --> 02:12:51,439
variety chinensis it's a broad leaf hemp

3217
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:54,279
type and within the broad to narrow

3218
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:56,638
Spectrum you have a broad to narrow Leaf

3219
02:12:54,279 --> 02:12:59,960
Spectrum within marijuana types and

3220
02:12:56,639 --> 02:13:03,078
within hemp types um and what we cannot

3221
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:06,319
do for the sake of of

3222
02:13:03,078 --> 02:13:08,840
Jeremy and reality is you can't

3223
02:13:06,319 --> 02:13:10,920
distinguish a type based on what it

3224
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:13,599
looks like which we do not do we don't

3225
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:16,118
say a a narrow leaf type is going to

3226
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:18,279
affect you this way and we don't say a a

3227
02:13:16,118 --> 02:13:20,920
bud that is shaped this way will affect

3228
02:13:18,279 --> 02:13:22,599
you in that way it's truly a blend and

3229
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:24,559
how they kind of characterize each other

3230
02:13:22,599 --> 02:13:26,159
together which is too complex to go over

3231
02:13:24,559 --> 02:13:27,960
right now I'm not going to sit here and

3232
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:30,000
teach you the complexity of interpreting

3233
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:32,880
methodology I just wanted to let you

3234
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,800
guys know that that's not what we do um

3235
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:38,760
but what we have done is we've we've

3236
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:41,840
gently separated Rob Clark's work by

3237
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:44,039
instead of calling it a drug type

3238
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:47,639
because he was separating a drug type

3239
02:13:44,039 --> 02:13:51,439
from hemp types but his work came out

3240
02:13:47,639 --> 02:13:54,359
the year before hemp had Federal

3241
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:57,399
legislation that opened up hemp farming

3242
02:13:54,359 --> 02:14:00,359
for farming it for drug types and so out

3243
02:13:57,399 --> 02:14:04,000
here in Colorado people Farm hemp

3244
02:14:00,359 --> 02:14:05,679
specifically for CBD or they Farm hemp

3245
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:10,479
specifically for

3246
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:12,760
CBG and those are drugs drugs are

3247
02:14:10,479 --> 02:14:14,319
medicines medicines and drugs are

3248
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:17,599
interchangeable that's why you get

3249
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:21,960
medicin from drugstore and so you can't

3250
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:24,679
call the one that gets you high uh drug

3251
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:26,840
compared to hemp that you're farming for

3252
02:14:24,679 --> 02:14:29,440
drug purposes for for a variety of

3253
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:32,880
different reasons um and after we

3254
02:14:29,439 --> 02:14:35,759
learned the 500y old atmology of the

3255
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:38,840
word marijuana and how and why it is a

3256
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:40,639
cool beautiful in righteous word not

3257
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:44,719
what we thought it was and where it just

3258
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:47,199
comes from from the 1930s perspective um

3259
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:49,158
that we really just compartmentalized

3260
02:14:47,198 --> 02:14:51,759
that there's a difference between hemp

3261
02:14:49,158 --> 02:14:54,879
types and hemp variety

3262
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:57,280
and marijuana types and in the world of

3263
02:14:54,880 --> 02:15:00,440
marijuana cannabis we have broadleaf

3264
02:14:57,279 --> 02:15:01,880
types so we have broadleaf marijuana

3265
02:15:00,439 --> 02:15:05,558
that we call

3266
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:07,840
BLM and uh because it's not just

3267
02:15:05,559 --> 02:15:09,679
sedative there's sedative but there's

3268
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:12,760
also types that are a little bit less

3269
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:15,880
sedative we just call it blmd broadleaf

3270
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:17,440
marijuana dominant medium leaf marijuana

3271
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:20,559
is the type that's kind of that's in

3272
02:15:17,439 --> 02:15:23,919
between nlmd is Nar leaf marijuana

3273
02:15:20,559 --> 02:15:29,920
dominant and then nlm is narrowleaf

3274
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:33,039
marijuana and what we have found is in

3275
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:36,199
general if you have marijuana types that

3276
02:15:33,039 --> 02:15:38,920
have very narrow leaves that generally

3277
02:15:36,198 --> 02:15:41,399
has a a plant shape and that plant shape

3278
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:43,158
has longer spaces in between the nodes

3279
02:15:41,399 --> 02:15:44,719
and that longer nodal structure allows

3280
02:15:43,158 --> 02:15:46,439
the colas to grow out a little bit

3281
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:49,039
longer and become a little bit more

3282
02:15:46,439 --> 02:15:51,638
fluffy and less dense and that plants

3283
02:15:49,039 --> 02:15:54,238
that look like that then also so

3284
02:15:51,639 --> 02:15:56,960
depending on the aroma perspect

3285
02:15:54,238 --> 02:16:00,678
perspective and its chemotype you can

3286
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:04,359
start to compartmentalize

3287
02:16:00,679 --> 02:16:06,480
that in general nlms narrow leaf

3288
02:16:04,359 --> 02:16:08,839
marijuana types for the most part are

3289
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:10,959
generally stimulating types of cannabis

3290
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:12,719
and so you're not calling it a sativa

3291
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,800
because there's like you can't really

3292
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:17,319
say well there's a a hardcore sativa and

3293
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:20,000
a little bit less of a sativa so we just

3294
02:16:17,319 --> 02:16:23,399
respect the fact that cannabis is on a

3295
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:25,800
spectrum of effect type and we just use

3296
02:16:23,399 --> 02:16:28,439
uh acronyms to compartmentalize them and

3297
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:30,679
we use acronyms to separate marijuana

3298
02:16:28,439 --> 02:16:33,638
types from hemp types as both of those

3299
02:16:30,679 --> 02:16:36,239
cannabis types have broad to narrow Leaf

3300
02:16:33,638 --> 02:16:39,398
spectrums ma are you familiar with the

3301
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:42,840
work by Carl

3302
02:16:39,398 --> 02:16:45,718
hle uh yes I mean I I know quite uh I've

3303
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:49,120
read his papers before okay because

3304
02:16:45,718 --> 02:16:52,678
that's where Rob got the narrow leap and

3305
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:55,639
Broad leap was from

3306
02:16:52,679 --> 02:16:58,558
interesting I did not know that yeah

3307
02:16:55,638 --> 02:17:00,398
absolutely true Carl and Rob are very

3308
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:02,679
close friends of

3309
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:04,318
mine I think for the consumer we can

3310
02:17:02,679 --> 02:17:05,719
just even drill down further that

3311
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:08,879
they're probably only gonna want to know

3312
02:17:05,718 --> 02:17:11,199
six things six factors uh is it lightly

3313
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:15,119
potent mildly potent super potent does

3314
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:18,000
it make me sleepy uh in between or uh

3315
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:19,719
like is it like coffee and I think those

3316
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,159
are the consumer categories I don't know

3317
02:17:19,718 --> 02:17:22,558
what else they I mean other than they

3318
02:17:21,159 --> 02:17:24,679
want to drill into those particular

3319
02:17:22,558 --> 02:17:27,199
categories once they find their

3320
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:28,679
Crossroad but all right so so Debbie SP

3321
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:31,200
spin the wheel which way do you want it

3322
02:17:28,679 --> 02:17:34,200
to turn left right and how many turns do

3323
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:36,599
you want no I get it I'm just saying it

3324
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:39,079
still is a little bit confusing

3325
02:17:36,599 --> 02:17:41,840
but just kind of putting a big topic on

3326
02:17:39,079 --> 02:17:44,239
the a big picture topic not you know not

3327
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:45,599
of broad interest but the consumer I

3328
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:47,119
think is going to want something more

3329
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:49,558
simplified they already use something

3330
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:51,599
more simplified you make a super good

3331
02:17:49,558 --> 02:17:52,718
point Debbie actually and and this is

3332
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:54,478
you know this is something we're not

3333
02:17:52,718 --> 02:17:56,879
thinking about cuz we go deep down the

3334
02:17:54,478 --> 02:18:00,398
rabbit hole but it's if you ever stood

3335
02:17:56,879 --> 02:18:03,638
behind a dispensary and just made sales

3336
02:18:00,398 --> 02:18:05,318
all day and if you did it for 25 years

3337
02:18:03,638 --> 02:18:07,959
the way Debbie did it you would have

3338
02:18:05,318 --> 02:18:11,840
like a very unique perspective based on

3339
02:18:07,959 --> 02:18:13,959
the reality of the customer the end user

3340
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:15,799
nothing else and I'm with you Max I'm

3341
02:18:13,959 --> 02:18:17,518
all about like no but let's like because

3342
02:18:15,799 --> 02:18:20,039
I'm I geek out on this stuff I want

3343
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:22,800
everyone to learn this stuff but when I

3344
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:25,040
also go do my PK sessions at Canadian

3345
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:27,358
dispensaries for my own company's

3346
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:28,920
products um you know the the the people

3347
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:30,719
who are working there they they're like

3348
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,840
oh yeah I want all this stuff I want to

3349
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:35,119
learn all this stuff but in reality when

3350
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:37,799
I talk to them they're like dude I have

3351
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:39,760
like 48 seconds with each customer

3352
02:18:37,799 --> 02:18:41,438
sometimes two and a half minutes they

3353
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:44,120
don't want to hear as much of what I've

3354
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:48,120
been saying as I as I thought they might

3355
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:50,000
and this a unique go ahead so Marcus and

3356
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:51,399
Debbie you're both 100% correct in this

3357
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,079
and that's that's something that that

3358
02:18:51,398 --> 02:18:55,000
what we're going to the rabbit hole I

3359
02:18:53,079 --> 02:18:57,599
think that Debb's uh you know let's

3360
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,558
let's make it simple like this is

3361
02:18:57,599 --> 02:19:00,920
generally stimulating or generally

3362
02:18:59,558 --> 02:19:02,679
sedating this is sort of middle of the

3363
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:06,040
range you know based on the canab

3364
02:19:02,679 --> 02:19:07,679
profile um I think that it also one the

3365
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:10,160
other thing the consumers do is like oh

3366
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:12,120
I want a diesel smelling one or I want a

3367
02:19:10,159 --> 02:19:14,760
citrusy smelling one or I want a you

3368
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:17,639
know tropical fruity smelling one um

3369
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:19,519
those I think being able to to to to

3370
02:19:17,638 --> 02:19:21,438
give those labels is really really

3371
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:23,960
important and if you can assign a simple

3372
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:26,280
number like this is you know uh it's a 5

3373
02:19:23,959 --> 02:19:29,159
out of 10 fruity it's a 7 out of 10

3374
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:31,280
citrusy specifically and so on so forth

3375
02:19:29,159 --> 02:19:33,200
is is a really easy way to do it as you

3376
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,079
know I was ranting on about hortic are a

3377
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,399
problem earlier but I I use them all the

3378
02:19:35,079 --> 02:19:38,000
time and that's how we explain a lot of

3379
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:40,039
things in the hop world and in the beer

3380
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,558
world and it works for people and like

3381
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:46,040
you said like you know the

3382
02:19:41,558 --> 02:19:48,639
classifications you've seen the phoa yes

3383
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:51,319
yeah that's pretty

3384
02:19:48,639 --> 02:19:53,239
good yeah and so I I think I think we

3385
02:19:51,318 --> 02:19:55,639
we're we're we're heading towards these

3386
02:19:53,239 --> 02:19:57,359
directions as an industry from a bunch

3387
02:19:55,639 --> 02:19:59,398
of different sides and if we all kind of

3388
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:00,960
came together it's pretty use it would

3389
02:19:59,398 --> 02:20:03,279
be useful for for people to to be able

3390
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:05,478
to see these things and and give them a

3391
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:07,680
a simple tool that we could sort of at

3392
02:20:05,478 --> 02:20:09,438
least anchor the conversation around and

3393
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:12,239
like here in Washington for example we

3394
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:13,439
have uh this the move towards the actual

3395
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:15,719
like you know the dominant turpine

3396
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:17,120
profiles and and all of the cannabinoids

3397
02:20:15,719 --> 02:20:18,840
that are that are have been detected

3398
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:22,200
depending on the methodology and forget

3399
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:24,799
about lab interlab variant we've seen um

3400
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:27,760
but those are really useful tools for me

3401
02:20:24,799 --> 02:20:27,759
personally I'm like oh

3402
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:33,040
I smell but this one doesn't actually

3403
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:34,479
make me feel that good and try to

3404
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:36,600
understand and sort of arm the consumer

3405
02:20:34,478 --> 02:20:39,318
with you know give give the retailers

3406
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:41,559
and and the the novice consumer access

3407
02:20:39,318 --> 02:20:42,920
to simple categories to discuss these

3408
02:20:41,559 --> 02:20:44,879
these things and sort frame the

3409
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:46,200
conversation but then as they get more

3410
02:20:44,879 --> 02:20:48,000
interested or they notice specific

3411
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:49,359
effects they might at least have access

3412
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,439
to information that allows them to drill

3413
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:53,640
a little bit deeper and this like when

3414
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:55,040
you're talking about uh terms of flower

3415
02:20:53,639 --> 02:20:56,159
uh you know all all the flower

3416
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:58,080
characteristics I think that's that's

3417
02:20:56,159 --> 02:20:59,799
fantastic but you know this is a hash

3418
02:20:58,079 --> 02:21:02,200
Church uh discussion right I mean how

3419
02:20:59,799 --> 02:21:05,119
does that apply to to hash and and and

3420
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:07,520
extracts and that's those are those are

3421
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:10,160
increasingly popular methods of

3422
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:13,239
consumption it's actually a sin to to

3423
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:15,039
smoke marijuana in this church you can

3424
02:21:13,239 --> 02:21:19,559
only smoke cash

3425
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:22,040
each actually actually fact in

3426
02:21:19,559 --> 02:21:24,478
fact no matter what you smoke you're

3427
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:28,319
smoking hashish when you smoke flour

3428
02:21:24,478 --> 02:21:31,000
you're just smoking hashish diluted on

3429
02:21:28,318 --> 02:21:33,159
flour it's been diluted by the plant

3430
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,920
it's all hashes we don't discriminate

3431
02:21:33,159 --> 02:21:38,280
here

3432
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:41,200
volcano Sam strips it right off the

3433
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:44,439
volcano for example you you put a butt

3434
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:47,680
in there and it liberates the resin

3435
02:21:44,439 --> 02:21:51,520
heads the tricomes everything else is

3436
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:51,520
left alone really

3437
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:57,600
it's true what a great conversation I'm

3438
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:59,960
glad uh I I was loving how deep we were

3439
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:02,640
getting into it and I just also loved

3440
02:21:59,959 --> 02:22:05,599
Debbie just coming in being like Oh hey

3441
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:07,318
uh just uh you know over here in reality

3442
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:10,559
uh just had a couple

3443
02:22:07,318 --> 02:22:11,359
perspec it was good Debbie really it was

3444
02:22:10,559 --> 02:22:14,719
thank

3445
02:22:11,359 --> 02:22:16,520
you I like the idea of really doing the

3446
02:22:14,719 --> 02:22:18,318
science it's incredible all the work we

3447
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:20,040
can do it's offensive when we think

3448
02:22:18,318 --> 02:22:21,680
about Prohibition and I mean we maybe

3449
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,479
could have cured Cancer all these

3450
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:23,920
different things that could have

3451
02:22:22,478 --> 02:22:25,760
happened with cannabis had we been able

3452
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:27,079
to do the research so thank goodness you

3453
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:28,680
guys are doing that let's keep drilling

3454
02:22:27,079 --> 02:22:31,120
down and figuring out what these

3455
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:36,000
specific molecular makeups can do to

3456
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:39,439
help humans you know so well uh

3457
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:43,200
JY you you can lead a customer to

3458
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:43,200
knowledge but you can't make him

3459
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:48,359
think I like that a lot of people are

3460
02:22:46,639 --> 02:22:49,719
coming into the dispensaries to so they

3461
02:22:48,359 --> 02:22:51,520
don't have to right they're trying to

3462
02:22:49,719 --> 02:22:53,199
let go of all the complication in life

3463
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:55,319
so even when I go in a dispensary I got

3464
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:56,399
two questions what's the most potent and

3465
02:22:55,318 --> 02:22:58,000
what's going to make me feel like I'm

3466
02:22:56,398 --> 02:22:59,920
going downhill on the roller coaster

3467
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,959
like ah you know just guide me right to

3468
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:04,079
it I don't want the anything else you

3469
02:23:01,959 --> 02:23:05,879
know I'm connoisseur level so I like the

3470
02:23:04,079 --> 02:23:10,200
fact I can just be like Zam take me

3471
02:23:05,879 --> 02:23:11,759
right there so Debbie I I oh if I may

3472
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:13,560
there was a wonderful series of

3473
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:15,520
experiences when uh we still have

3474
02:23:13,559 --> 02:23:18,398
medical in Oregon where there was very

3475
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:20,040
low throughput in the retail experience

3476
02:23:18,398 --> 02:23:20,959
and that was a really special time

3477
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:22,760
because

3478
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:25,959
every individual that came through the

3479
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:27,960
door there would be like an hour minimum

3480
02:23:25,959 --> 02:23:30,239
conversation engagement because very

3481
02:23:27,959 --> 02:23:31,759
often people would present exactly the

3482
02:23:30,239 --> 02:23:33,279
kind of narrative you said it's like

3483
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:36,200
which one makes me feel like I'm going

3484
02:23:33,279 --> 02:23:38,159
down the roller coaster Etc and really

3485
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:40,560
inevitably it was like well let's talk

3486
02:23:38,159 --> 02:23:43,318
about the effect Matrix let's talk about

3487
02:23:40,559 --> 02:23:44,879
phytochemistry and dosage and titration

3488
02:23:43,318 --> 02:23:47,559
these different Delivery Systems and

3489
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:49,799
then look at all of these novel exciting

3490
02:23:47,559 --> 02:23:51,840
products now to like induct the

3491
02:23:49,799 --> 02:23:54,559
individual into to the adventure of

3492
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:56,960
exploring the nuanced Altered States Of

3493
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:59,318
Consciousness and the therapeutic

3494
02:23:56,959 --> 02:24:01,559
effects that can arise and to really

3495
02:23:59,318 --> 02:24:03,680
Empower them I think also requires this

3496
02:24:01,559 --> 02:24:05,079
other set of knowledge we're not talking

3497
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:07,318
about which is

3498
02:24:05,079 --> 02:24:09,879
psychopharmacology there really is this

3499
02:24:07,318 --> 02:24:12,959
amazing set of data that illustrates say

3500
02:24:09,879 --> 02:24:15,719
you prescribe somebody ssris for their

3501
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:18,398
anti-depression effects if you simply

3502
02:24:15,719 --> 02:24:20,760
give them the drugs the drugs actually

3503
02:24:18,398 --> 02:24:23,079
over time for most people are not going

3504
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:25,478
to do much for them it's actually going

3505
02:24:23,079 --> 02:24:27,920
to generally work to be that you'll see

3506
02:24:25,478 --> 02:24:30,079
decreased quality of life Over time

3507
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:33,079
however if you combine those drugs for a

3508
02:24:30,079 --> 02:24:36,079
brief period of time with counseling and

3509
02:24:33,079 --> 02:24:37,760
have a little bit of a human interaction

3510
02:24:36,079 --> 02:24:40,639
then all of a sudden you're engaging in

3511
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:43,200
this incredible sort of effect boosting

3512
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:44,719
potentiating result that we see strong

3513
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:46,840
evidence to support in the

3514
02:24:44,719 --> 02:24:48,599
psychopharmacology world so there's this

3515
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:50,559
fascinating sense that I think one of

3516
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:52,880
the things that we're missing is we have

3517
02:24:50,559 --> 02:24:55,439
you know this perspective of give me the

3518
02:24:52,879 --> 02:24:57,879
thing that does this and now we actually

3519
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:59,840
need the well it's not it doesn't work

3520
02:24:57,879 --> 02:25:01,959
like that but here's this range of

3521
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:03,239
things and dose is going to matter

3522
02:25:01,959 --> 02:25:05,679
tremendously so we want you to start

3523
02:25:03,239 --> 02:25:08,039
with this tiny increment so you can get

3524
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:10,479
to know what that is at different times

3525
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:12,120
in the day at different levels of stress

3526
02:25:10,478 --> 02:25:15,000
that you're experiencing Etc come to

3527
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:17,240
know this one element and then gradually

3528
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,879
build that until you hit undesirable

3529
02:25:17,239 --> 02:25:21,279
side effects and then you know the

3530
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:22,879
Threshold at least for now based on your

3531
02:25:21,279 --> 02:25:25,439
current tolerance and then you back off

3532
02:25:22,879 --> 02:25:27,000
a bit but that sense of like a mature

3533
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:29,318
titration

3534
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:33,478
process

3535
02:25:29,318 --> 02:25:35,719
and sense of adventure it's this other

3536
02:25:33,478 --> 02:25:37,438
human element that I I don't think it's

3537
02:25:35,719 --> 02:25:39,719
rocket science I think it's a bit of

3538
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:41,840
empathetic attuning and it's actually

3539
02:25:39,719 --> 02:25:44,438
just the sense of being heard as a

3540
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:45,760
consumer and then also being supported

3541
02:25:44,439 --> 02:25:47,398
that there's something about that

3542
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:49,318
interaction that's such a wonderful

3543
02:25:47,398 --> 02:25:52,239
opportunity which largely as we went

3544
02:25:49,318 --> 02:25:54,760
from Medical to adult use went away

3545
02:25:52,239 --> 02:25:56,439
because of massive you know volume of

3546
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:58,880
transactions and this kind of high

3547
02:25:56,439 --> 02:26:00,559
throughput model and then a lot of Savvy

3548
02:25:58,879 --> 02:26:03,239
marketing campaigns saying this product

3549
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:05,079
does this this one does that and then

3550
02:26:03,239 --> 02:26:07,600
really this kind of giant cloud of

3551
02:26:05,079 --> 02:26:10,520
confusion over what has been a movement

3552
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:12,680
for decades you know from the bay on to

3553
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:15,000
really help people to actually improve

3554
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:16,520
their quality of life to have a lifelong

3555
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:19,398
sustainable relationship with these

3556
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:21,319
products whether it is Hash or hash and

3557
02:26:19,398 --> 02:26:23,719
flower form which actually was my

3558
02:26:21,318 --> 02:26:26,920
favorite comment of the whole show today

3559
02:26:23,719 --> 02:26:29,119
except anyways I I just think that we we

3560
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:32,239
have so far to go and unfortunately if

3561
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:35,279
we go too soon to the overarching

3562
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:37,398
categories we lose a lot on the other

3563
02:26:35,279 --> 02:26:40,399
hand if we spend too long spinning in

3564
02:26:37,398 --> 02:26:43,318
infinite diversity uh we also lose a lot

3565
02:26:40,398 --> 02:26:45,000
of Engagement and so it's of course both

3566
02:26:43,318 --> 02:26:47,639
are so important and I just really love

3567
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,680
the pragmatism of your comment and also

3568
02:26:47,639 --> 02:26:52,079
have wrestled that a lot I think almost

3569
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:54,559
I'm the worst person to answer what

3570
02:26:52,079 --> 02:26:56,318
those absolutely essential archetypal

3571
02:26:54,559 --> 02:26:59,159
categories are going to be or what they

3572
02:26:56,318 --> 02:27:01,879
look like because everything I'm doing

3573
02:26:59,159 --> 02:27:03,680
in my inquiry just illustrates greater

3574
02:27:01,879 --> 02:27:05,039
range in diversity than I could have

3575
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:06,880
imagined possible and then you bring

3576
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,920
Nick into the conversation and we're

3577
02:27:06,879 --> 02:27:11,679
looking at a level of phytochemical

3578
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:13,239
invent inventory that so far surpasses

3579
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:15,520
what we've conventionally been talking

3580
02:27:13,239 --> 02:27:18,600
about and you know including aldah

3581
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:20,760
Esters flavonoids all these other

3582
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:22,279
compounds that are clearly contrib

3583
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:24,478
and you know they connect with Dr David

3584
02:27:22,279 --> 02:27:26,239
Marie's work that Illustrated that in

3585
02:27:24,478 --> 02:27:28,519
fact cannaboids were not the key

3586
02:27:26,239 --> 02:27:30,920
variable and why the autistic kids

3587
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:33,079
started having incredibly heightened

3588
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:35,120
aggression and you know a child throwing

3589
02:27:33,079 --> 02:27:38,200
his mother through a plate glass window

3590
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:40,720
when dose a which was a one: one ratio

3591
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:43,399
then gets replaced with dose B also a

3592
02:27:40,719 --> 02:27:45,119
one: one ratio and radically different

3593
02:27:43,398 --> 02:27:47,680
effects and you know there's just so

3594
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:49,600
much mystery about the effect itself but

3595
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:51,439
I think there are ways to study that and

3596
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:53,359
I don't think that's neatly connecting

3597
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:55,398
the dots with phytochemistry at this

3598
02:27:53,359 --> 02:27:57,279
point we're we're immature there

3599
02:27:55,398 --> 02:27:59,519
clinically we just simply don't have

3600
02:27:57,279 --> 02:28:01,520
that maturity I see the camps that are

3601
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:04,560
doing it and D David is certainly out in

3602
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:06,680
front or Dei uh but I think there's

3603
02:28:04,559 --> 02:28:09,079
another approach which Dr ad Ray I wish

3604
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:12,279
she was on this call because the reality

3605
02:28:09,079 --> 02:28:15,079
is she has a really wonderful summation

3606
02:28:12,279 --> 02:28:18,439
of how to approach that human connection

3607
02:28:15,079 --> 02:28:20,760
to effect and experience based on a

3608
02:28:18,439 --> 02:28:22,720
really rigorous scientific approach

3609
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:24,760
and I just think that voice isn't at the

3610
02:28:22,719 --> 02:28:28,159
table that would be a really fun

3611
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:29,559
additional uh tense and fantastic

3612
02:28:28,159 --> 02:28:32,039
Dynamic to bring

3613
02:28:29,559 --> 02:28:33,879
forward yeah I'm loving the conversation

3614
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:36,359
go ahead Debbie sorry I was just sitting

3615
02:28:33,879 --> 02:28:37,679
here thinking okay people come into the

3616
02:28:36,359 --> 02:28:39,680
shop and this is what they want to do

3617
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:41,600
they've got a health condition they want

3618
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:43,920
to transform they feel one way they want

3619
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:46,399
to ingest cannabis and then they want to

3620
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,680
feel a different way right better or

3621
02:28:46,398 --> 02:28:50,599
they're coming into the shop because

3622
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:52,040
they're like I'm going to do something I

3623
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:53,479
want to go hiking and what's going to be

3624
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:54,800
the best I'm going to study what's going

3625
02:28:53,478 --> 02:28:56,719
to be the best I want to sleep what's

3626
02:28:54,799 --> 02:28:58,358
going to be the best it's it's an actual

3627
02:28:56,719 --> 02:29:00,318
experiential thing that they're asking

3628
02:28:58,359 --> 02:29:01,760
us about they're not asking us about the

3629
02:29:00,318 --> 02:29:03,559
chemicals they're like what's best for

3630
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:05,520
swimming you know what's gonna be best

3631
02:29:03,559 --> 02:29:08,199
for watching a movie what you know I

3632
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:10,920
want to connect with my partner best for

3633
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:13,319
swimming I don't know God where did that

3634
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:14,760
even come from I have no idea for real

3635
02:29:13,318 --> 02:29:16,159
they are literally asking what's best

3636
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:19,639
for swimming I've had those same

3637
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:22,159
comments I always talk molecules but how

3638
02:29:19,639 --> 02:29:23,879
do we classify for the consumer like

3639
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:25,639
this is the one for Swift I don't know

3640
02:29:23,879 --> 02:29:27,398
I'm just saying it's interesting it's a

3641
02:29:25,639 --> 02:29:29,439
there's a molecular conversation and the

3642
02:29:27,398 --> 02:29:31,119
fact is the consumer is looking for a

3643
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:33,120
sensory experience that's

3644
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:35,040
transformational I feel like this and I

3645
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:37,200
want to do this and where do the two

3646
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:38,720
connect and and and like and we could

3647
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:40,000
talk for hours of course and figure out

3648
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:41,639
all these different classification

3649
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,120
systems but I think we agreed there's

3650
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:46,920
not one yet either on the macro or the

3651
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:48,240
micro and and and it is a mature Market

3652
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:50,600
already I mean we've been retailing

3653
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:54,000
legally me and ATN since the '90s

3654
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:57,079
and are you know it's it's uh it is a

3655
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,520
mature market right now right now

3656
02:29:57,079 --> 02:30:02,079
Cannabis sativa indicia and hybrid are

3657
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:04,800
used by our buyers and our

3658
02:30:02,079 --> 02:30:06,559
staff uh as a classification for

3659
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:08,840
experience it's not so much with the

3660
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:10,318
real what the real plant is if we call

3661
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:12,439
it indicia because we think that's going

3662
02:30:10,318 --> 02:30:14,119
to be more of a couchy type of cannabis

3663
02:30:12,439 --> 02:30:16,200
if we call it sativa we think it's going

3664
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:18,200
to be more uplifting you know anyway I'm

3665
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:20,040
just saying with I totally understand

3666
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:21,800
that Debbie people do that the problem

3667
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:23,920
is it just doesn't work and I really

3668
02:30:21,799 --> 02:30:28,039
mean that you know I get that we've all

3669
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:28,040
defaulted to a kind of jargon that

3670
02:30:29,359 --> 02:30:33,000
isting but the problem is it doesn't

3671
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:34,479
work so I think there is a ways to go

3672
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,719
every time I have the chance just to

3673
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:38,559
make it really really simple I simply

3674
02:30:36,719 --> 02:30:40,199
start with you know it just doesn't work

3675
02:30:38,559 --> 02:30:41,439
like that there's like over a thousand

3676
02:30:40,200 --> 02:30:43,159
bioactive compounds and unique

3677
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:44,479
constellations in each one of these lots

3678
02:30:43,159 --> 02:30:46,119
and even if you get the same product

3679
02:30:44,478 --> 02:30:48,478
from the same producer you're probably

3680
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:50,279
not going to see bedan like trait

3681
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:51,719
stability in the chem of our EXP russan

3682
02:30:50,279 --> 02:30:54,239
you're actually going to experience a

3683
02:30:51,719 --> 02:30:56,438
range of things so embrace the adventure

3684
02:30:54,239 --> 02:30:58,680
here's some tools for the ride you need

3685
02:30:56,439 --> 02:31:00,559
to understand titration with all of this

3686
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:01,960
Explorer and the great news is unless a

3687
02:31:00,559 --> 02:31:03,680
bail of it falls on your head it's

3688
02:31:01,959 --> 02:31:05,039
probably not going to do harm although

3689
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:07,120
now we actually have to deal with

3690
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:09,359
cannaboid Hyper ammus syndrome which

3691
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:11,800
I've just had my second experience with

3692
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:14,040
in the last month and it is absolutely

3693
02:31:11,799 --> 02:31:17,318
horrifying to see what people go through

3694
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:20,040
it is actually a psychosis that preempts

3695
02:31:17,318 --> 02:31:22,318
that is before the cyclical vomiting

3696
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:24,279
which is like it's a really wild

3697
02:31:22,318 --> 02:31:27,079
experience that is actually legitimately

3698
02:31:24,279 --> 02:31:28,600
happening to a now significant

3699
02:31:27,079 --> 02:31:30,159
population of people consuming outside

3700
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:32,479
of that the bail of it needs to [ __ ]

3701
02:31:30,159 --> 02:31:35,119
fall in your head so it's safe and

3702
02:31:32,478 --> 02:31:39,000
therefore enjoy the adventure like let's

3703
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:42,240
not actually project immature systems

3704
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:44,040
onto the infinite amazing layers and

3705
02:31:42,239 --> 02:31:45,959
vicissitudes of this relationship

3706
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:49,000
between people and plant let's rather

3707
02:31:45,959 --> 02:31:50,599
encourage a passionate exploration and

3708
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:53,279
resource with the best science and

3709
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:55,040
evidence that we have in a limited way

3710
02:31:53,279 --> 02:32:00,000
you know that sort of thing I always get

3711
02:31:55,040 --> 02:32:02,760
off on so so when I was a bud tender um

3712
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,680
and someone would come in asking for an

3713
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:07,439
Inda or sativa or what would help them

3714
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:09,159
swim I I would do exactly what Jeremy's

3715
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:10,800
doing I would say but it doesn't work

3716
02:32:09,159 --> 02:32:13,039
like that and I would try to explain to

3717
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:14,679
them the complexity of the effect Matrix

3718
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:16,319
and all these things and then I'd get

3719
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:20,639
yelled at by my

3720
02:32:16,318 --> 02:32:22,840
boss because he's like dude I love the

3721
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:25,920
fact that you just want to educate each

3722
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:29,840
and every individual customer that comes

3723
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:32,719
in each time but you are slowing down my

3724
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:35,760
entire operation I have a line out the

3725
02:32:32,719 --> 02:32:37,959
door these people are you can't even

3726
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:39,800
understand half the [ __ ] you're saying

3727
02:32:37,959 --> 02:32:42,559
your their eyes are rolling in the back

3728
02:32:39,799 --> 02:32:45,559
of their head there's got to be a

3729
02:32:42,559 --> 02:32:48,239
meeting in the middle point where all of

3730
02:32:45,559 --> 02:32:51,559
the stuff that Jeremy's saying which is

3731
02:32:48,239 --> 02:32:53,359
100% real and true that the consumer

3732
02:32:51,559 --> 02:32:55,719
doesn't know what they don't know they

3733
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:58,040
don't know what to ask and sometimes

3734
02:32:55,719 --> 02:32:59,959
they don't have the time of day to get

3735
02:32:58,040 --> 02:33:01,479
the type of education that we're so

3736
02:32:59,959 --> 02:33:05,719
passionate about and want to offer to

3737
02:33:01,478 --> 02:33:08,519
them um and so uh that's the reason why

3738
02:33:05,719 --> 02:33:12,920
I'm trying to develop this app with this

3739
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:14,800
Aroma um science company that uh does

3740
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:16,879
cannabis Aroma the way that I think Nick

3741
02:33:14,799 --> 02:33:19,519
is doing hop Aroma in probably very

3742
02:33:16,879 --> 02:33:21,398
similar ways and and wrapping that in

3743
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:23,200
with just a little bit of interpreting

3744
02:33:21,398 --> 02:33:25,879
methodology but also for the first time

3745
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:28,640
grading cannabis how good is this weed

3746
02:33:25,879 --> 02:33:31,079
am I buying good weed or bad weed what

3747
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:33,439
is good weed who sets the line for what

3748
02:33:31,079 --> 02:33:35,680
good is and how do you measure that so

3749
02:33:33,439 --> 02:33:37,559
at the end of the day hopefully what

3750
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:39,880
will be able to do is if you either are

3751
02:33:37,559 --> 02:33:41,318
searching for something particular or

3752
02:33:39,879 --> 02:33:44,199
you can go into a dispensary that

3753
02:33:41,318 --> 02:33:46,398
doesn't offer deli style anymore which

3754
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:48,159
is horrible prepackaged cannabis you're

3755
02:33:46,398 --> 02:33:50,559
not allowed to see if your body is

3756
02:33:48,159 --> 02:33:52,159
attracted to this plant or not hopefully

3757
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:54,359
you'll be able to scan it with your cell

3758
02:33:52,159 --> 02:33:56,318
phone and it's just going to have one

3759
02:33:54,359 --> 02:33:58,520
page of information that will tell you

3760
02:33:56,318 --> 02:34:00,879
on a scale of good to bad this is how

3761
02:33:58,520 --> 02:34:03,359
good this product has been graded and on

3762
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:05,799
a scale from stimulating to sedative

3763
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:08,640
this is where a computer based off of

3764
02:34:05,799 --> 02:34:11,799
Aroma profiles have found it to be which

3765
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:13,559
has been collaborated with enterpreneur

3766
02:34:11,799 --> 02:34:15,679
people who are really passionate about

3767
02:34:13,559 --> 02:34:18,199
the flavor the aroma the effect type of

3768
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:20,800
cannabis all together so that at the end

3769
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:23,600
of the day a consumer doesn't have to

3770
02:34:20,799 --> 02:34:25,840
know and understand the details of this

3771
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:28,479
complexity they just have to scan a jar

3772
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:30,760
of flower and see okay these really

3773
02:34:28,478 --> 02:34:32,799
smart guys who are super passionate

3774
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:34,840
cracked the code of what this varietal

3775
02:34:32,799 --> 02:34:37,920
is and they just programmed it in a

3776
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:41,520
quick information space for me to say oh

3777
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:44,359
this is a a a 9

3778
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:47,600
1.26% so this is an A minus grade

3779
02:34:44,359 --> 02:34:50,079
cannabis that has uh really gassy and

3780
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:52,079
fruity tones which generally is going to

3781
02:34:50,079 --> 02:34:55,799
equate to this type of an effect for

3782
02:34:52,079 --> 02:34:57,520
nine out of 10 people um and also if you

3783
02:34:55,799 --> 02:34:59,559
want to go even crazier you can slide

3784
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:01,760
over and be like where's its Appalachian

3785
02:34:59,559 --> 02:35:03,559
what's its tewa what's the grower story

3786
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:06,279
what's the history and try to you know

3787
02:35:03,559 --> 02:35:08,760
offer cannabis in that way but um before

3788
02:35:06,279 --> 02:35:11,040
I I have to jet and get out of here uh

3789
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:14,040
Jeremy I think did a good job of

3790
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:17,760
celebrating Nick and all of the work

3791
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:20,120
that Nick is doing and after slightly

3792
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:21,680
embarrassingly but but very much thanks

3793
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:23,079
and and I'm I'm actually humbled to be

3794
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:24,960
invited to to speak with all of you all

3795
02:35:23,079 --> 02:35:29,200
this has been fantastic well I I just

3796
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:32,199
wanted to celebrate what Jeremy's doing

3797
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:35,000
uh um I think you're uh when you

3798
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:38,279
described the way that you're going

3799
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,760
about your version of growing cannabis

3800
02:35:38,279 --> 02:35:42,000
in a controlled environment with

3801
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:43,880
different environments indoors that's

3802
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,520
replicatable I believe what you're

3803
02:35:43,879 --> 02:35:50,799
talking about can and and would have a

3804
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:54,479
tawa and so I'm gonna make that leap

3805
02:35:50,799 --> 02:35:56,959
from you can't have indoor tawa to if

3806
02:35:54,478 --> 02:36:00,719
you're doing it the way Jeremy is well

3807
02:35:56,959 --> 02:36:04,079
then yes you could definitely apply the

3808
02:36:00,719 --> 02:36:06,318
ideology of of tawa in that way and

3809
02:36:04,079 --> 02:36:08,959
you're also pushing a boundary too every

3810
02:36:06,318 --> 02:36:12,760
French person is just yelling at the

3811
02:36:08,959 --> 02:36:15,759
computer right now no you can't do this

3812
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:18,159
like what like this is It's to the Earth

3813
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:19,639
and oh my God and like like Frenchie

3814
02:36:18,159 --> 02:36:22,398
canoli is like screaming in the

3815
02:36:19,639 --> 02:36:26,278
background no you can't do it

3816
02:36:22,398 --> 02:36:27,959
indoors but I think s blue I think you I

3817
02:36:26,279 --> 02:36:31,359
think I think because you're you're

3818
02:36:27,959 --> 02:36:34,799
you're going about it in such a

3819
02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:37,439
passionately intelligent way and the

3820
02:36:34,799 --> 02:36:40,398
term that you keep referring back to

3821
02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:44,079
maturity I think there you're bringing a

3822
02:36:40,398 --> 02:36:46,278
maturity to the idea of how growing

3823
02:36:44,079 --> 02:36:50,000
indoor and consistent cannabis could and

3824
02:36:46,279 --> 02:36:51,439
should be done and uh in my geogy and

3825
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:54,000
where I come

3826
02:36:51,439 --> 02:36:55,880
from those guys just aren't there yet

3827
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,359
man they're just trying to pump money

3828
02:36:55,879 --> 02:36:59,478
right they're just shooting pounds how

3829
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:01,000
many what kind of light lumens can I get

3830
02:36:59,478 --> 02:37:03,599
for how many pounds because at the end

3831
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:06,318
of the day my goal is to make millions

3832
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:08,159
of dollars and retire on this weed thing

3833
02:37:06,318 --> 02:37:11,199
that I've been that I love since high

3834
02:37:08,159 --> 02:37:12,959
school that's it it's it's not the same

3835
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,920
amount of care it's not the same amount

3836
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:17,559
of passion and it's not the same amount

3837
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:19,159
of maturity so I just wanted to share

3838
02:37:17,559 --> 02:37:20,439
with you that I'm proud of the work that

3839
02:37:19,159 --> 02:37:22,279
you're doing doing and I'm very

3840
02:37:20,439 --> 02:37:25,920
appreciative of it and that I would I'd

3841
02:37:22,279 --> 02:37:29,000
like to learn a lot more about it if

3842
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:31,359
yeah I can speak to that as well um I I

3843
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:34,200
was super impressed by Jeremy the first

3844
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:35,520
time I met him and that has only grown

3845
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:37,760
uh and actually getting to see the

3846
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:39,239
facility and sample some of the the

3847
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:42,600
product that you have you have created

3848
02:37:39,239 --> 02:37:44,079
was just a pleasure and uh I got to come

3849
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:46,920
back next time in Portland dude that was

3850
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:49,559
uh that was fantastic well I I'm honored

3851
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:51,318
and and sincerely a lot of my passion

3852
02:37:49,559 --> 02:37:53,359
has been informed by other people

3853
02:37:51,318 --> 02:37:55,920
present on the church right now and I

3854
02:37:53,359 --> 02:37:57,520
just I again want to thank Marcus for

3855
02:37:55,920 --> 02:38:00,398
facilitating a conversation that

3856
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:02,600
includes as many diverse perspectives

3857
02:38:00,398 --> 02:38:05,559
and Colin to constantly big up and

3858
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:07,200
support that process and Sam to inspire

3859
02:38:05,559 --> 02:38:09,760
all of us to be at the foundation Debbie

3860
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:11,680
to keep it real etan to lay down the

3861
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:13,880
foundation for the Barry activist

3862
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:15,960
anyways all these great humans the

3863
02:38:13,879 --> 02:38:18,278
reality is I I just am also grateful to

3864
02:38:15,959 --> 02:38:21,318
you Max for all of that feedback and for

3865
02:38:18,279 --> 02:38:23,359
the Bold effort that you've made to

3866
02:38:21,318 --> 02:38:25,519
essentially you know really really take

3867
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:27,840
a point position and leading sensory

3868
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:29,840
forward in our space knowing how

3869
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:31,318
absolutely vital this is to the

3870
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:33,760
especially the producers I care about

3871
02:38:31,318 --> 02:38:36,039
the most who often the people who can

3872
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:38,359
show you their soil and how much love

3873
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:40,000
and concern that they've put into that

3874
02:38:38,359 --> 02:38:42,600
it's like they're not able to get any

3875
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:45,000
kind of value at wholesale level and

3876
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:47,159
most of the high throughput retail

3877
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,920
locations right now and until sensory

3878
02:38:47,159 --> 02:38:51,318
comes in and validates that until a

3879
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:54,000
critical momentum is achieved where we

3880
02:38:51,318 --> 02:38:55,959
can actually recognize that all cannabis

3881
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:58,559
is not being produced on an equal level

3882
02:38:55,959 --> 02:39:00,398
there's tremendous Varian in Quality

3883
02:38:58,559 --> 02:39:02,639
quality is yet to be identified in a

3884
02:39:00,398 --> 02:39:04,599
mature way and this is grinding up

3885
02:39:02,639 --> 02:39:07,239
people who have been multi-generational

3886
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:09,840
farmers who are the very best A at this

3887
02:39:07,239 --> 02:39:11,600
craft and I'm just so excited to see

3888
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:13,639
that reality start to turn and I think

3889
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:15,680
everybody's contributing to that in this

3890
02:39:13,639 --> 02:39:17,840
discourse but anyways just such an

3891
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:21,120
awesome honor to be in hash church again

3892
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:22,600
and here uh with family working on

3893
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:25,479
challenging issues that will probably

3894
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:27,800
outlive us and that I hope we all get to

3895
02:39:25,478 --> 02:39:30,079
somehow uh support and breath more life

3896
02:39:27,799 --> 02:39:31,239
into because uh gosh we have a long ways

3897
02:39:30,079 --> 02:39:33,279
to

3898
02:39:31,239 --> 02:39:35,398
go well I have no doubt these

3899
02:39:33,279 --> 02:39:37,120
conversations are incredibly important

3900
02:39:35,398 --> 02:39:39,000
and I didn't really know it when I first

3901
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:40,920
started hash church and even after a

3902
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:42,920
couple years and then I looked back four

3903
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:44,439
or five years later and I had taken some

3904
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:46,478
big breaks and I was like oh wow that

3905
02:39:44,439 --> 02:39:48,398
was really important conversation and

3906
02:39:46,478 --> 02:39:50,239
it's it's how I feel now again that

3907
02:39:48,398 --> 02:39:52,199
these conversations are incredibly

3908
02:39:50,239 --> 02:39:53,760
important it's great that we're having

3909
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:57,399
them and I'm I thank all of you for

3910
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:59,318
showing up and uh yeah engaging in these

3911
02:39:57,398 --> 02:40:02,959
dialogues it's

3921
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:28,520
scary place oh man like uh and I can't

3922
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:28,520
wait to tell you guys about the

3923
02:40:28,879 --> 02:40:35,398
Cannabis in Hops uh new species that's

3924
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:36,398
been hybridized together at an F7 that I

3925
02:40:35,398 --> 02:40:37,799
I'm writing about in the new

3926
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:39,519
interpreting book that's coming out this

3927
02:40:37,799 --> 02:40:41,799
year

3928
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:44,079
really wait

3929
02:40:41,799 --> 02:40:46,799
minut like how can you start something

3930
02:40:44,079 --> 02:40:50,719
like that and then bail

3931
02:40:46,799 --> 02:40:52,759
it's hey Marcus different how about next

3932
02:40:50,719 --> 02:40:55,799
hash Church we're going to get into all

3933
02:40:52,760 --> 02:40:58,600
the funky types of cannabis like uh uh

3934
02:40:55,799 --> 02:41:01,119
you know that duot ABC and did you know

3935
02:40:58,600 --> 02:41:03,720
that ducksfoot was first scientifically

3936
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:06,600
described in the 1920s I've got white

3937
02:41:03,719 --> 02:41:07,760
papers on duckfoot oh no I've I've got

3938
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:11,159
them from the

3939
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:13,000
1800s yeah exactly like this is like I

3940
02:41:11,159 --> 02:41:16,200
think we you know what Marcus next hash

3941
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:18,639
church will be the most unique and

3942
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:20,720
bizarre cannabis varietals and even

3943
02:41:18,639 --> 02:41:23,439
types that are pushing the boundary of

3944
02:41:20,719 --> 02:41:26,799
being cannabis and are now moving into

3945
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:27,880
humulus cannabis humulus um definitely

3946
02:41:26,799 --> 02:41:31,039
feeling a

3947
02:41:27,879 --> 02:41:35,719
continuation Rob and I tried to

3948
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:39,560
hybridize Hops with cannabis we we tried

3949
02:41:35,719 --> 02:41:42,438
every hop species we could find and we

3950
02:41:39,559 --> 02:41:45,799
crossed it with cannabis and we did the

3951
02:41:42,439 --> 02:41:48,079
vice versa we never got any

3952
02:41:45,799 --> 02:41:51,239
cross-pollination fertilization

3953
02:41:48,079 --> 02:41:51,239
whatsoever and

3954
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:55,240
because there's a trick up someone's

3955
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:58,520
sleeve the guy who did it and who

3956
02:41:55,239 --> 02:42:01,439
figured it out there's a trick to it so

3957
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:03,439
uh and and you've confirmed that it

3958
02:42:01,439 --> 02:42:05,880
contains both

3959
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:07,040
genomes oh yeah there's a bit of a

3960
02:42:05,879 --> 02:42:08,358
problem with that because the genome's

3961
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:12,120
already contained within the cannabis

3962
02:42:08,359 --> 02:42:14,159
plant right so anyway till next has

3963
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:17,040
church this would be this would be a

3964
02:42:14,159 --> 02:42:19,000
whole another three hour uh haul uh I'm

3965
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:20,680
going to I'm going to uh go take care of

3966
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:23,760
my go bro what are you talking about we

3967
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:26,439
do 5our all the time I'm just joking

3968
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:30,880
we'll do it next Sunday I'm I'm telling

3969
02:42:26,439 --> 02:42:34,520
you Max we tried so hard to do that I'm

3970
02:42:30,879 --> 02:42:37,039
not saying it's impossible but uh I've

3971
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:38,640
never never seen it I've heard at least

3972
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:42,439
a hundred different people say they

3973
02:42:38,639 --> 02:42:45,119
could do it so I I'll tell you very very

3974
02:42:42,439 --> 02:42:47,760
curious the trick is to use a species of

3975
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:49,279
hops that nobody uses to produce beer

3976
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:53,079
with

3977
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:55,439
yeah but we we we use a species of hops

3978
02:42:53,079 --> 02:42:59,520
a species of hops hops is polytypic the

3979
02:42:55,439 --> 02:43:00,520
way cannabis is not yeah uh okay well I

3980
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:01,359
definitely need to connect with you on

3981
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:03,200
this because this would be really

3982
02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:07,079
interesting for for me from a variety of

3983
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:09,200
reasons uh so yeah and I mean um you

3984
02:43:07,079 --> 02:43:12,079
know uh you know we also discovered

3985
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:14,279
glandular tricomes that have never been

3986
02:43:12,079 --> 02:43:15,920
scientifically um looked at before so

3987
02:43:14,279 --> 02:43:18,239
I've got a contract with two different

3988
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:21,239
universities who have confirmed both in

3989
02:43:18,239 --> 02:43:23,279
South Korea and in Colorado that

3990
02:43:21,239 --> 02:43:25,719
cannabis glandular tricomes that we have

3991
02:43:23,279 --> 02:43:28,520
found that look unlike any other triome

3992
02:43:25,719 --> 02:43:30,959
type are definitely novel and what

3993
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:32,760
they'll uh uh this year when I flower

3994
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:37,599
these plants out they're actually going

3995
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:40,318
to um dissect the anatomy of the

3996
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:41,880
glandular tricomes as they're alive in

3997
02:43:40,318 --> 02:43:45,680
their living state which is why they

3998
02:43:41,879 --> 02:43:49,239
have to do done many times Max with

3999
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:52,960
lasers that's already already been done

4000
02:43:49,239 --> 02:43:55,439
not done to no novel tricomes he's

4001
02:43:52,959 --> 02:43:58,438
talking about there you go there brand

4002
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:00,479
new Tricom types buty Marcus I think

4003
02:43:58,439 --> 02:44:02,680

4020
02:44:40,079 --> 02:44:45,279
you asked for volunteers to help create

4021
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:47,760
a standard for I it sounds like we're

4022
02:44:45,279 --> 02:44:50,399
trying to create something like uh ibus

4023
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:51,840
in in beer but for for cannabis in a

4024
02:44:50,398 --> 02:44:53,439
variety of different ways anyways I I

4025
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:55,559
would love to be on that team in that

4026
02:44:53,439 --> 02:44:59,079
project and and explore those ideas

4027
02:44:55,559 --> 02:45:01,799
sounds great yeah Nick that sounds like

4028
02:44:59,079 --> 02:45:04,039

4029
02:45:01,799 --> 02:45:06,438
take I will bring I actually have a ton

handful of them um and and you'll you'll

4034
02:45:12,318 --> 02:45:18,000

4035
02:45:14,318 --> 02:45:20,119
that is a hop plant growing THC and CBD

4036
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:23,318
rich

4037
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:25,920
cones and uh and vice versa really

4038
02:45:23,318 --> 02:45:28,199
interesting have you tested the Hops

4039
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:28,200
with

4040
02:45:29,159 --> 02:45:33,799
analysis see what the canabo content

4041
02:45:31,959 --> 02:45:35,559
work yes the yes we have done canabo

4042
02:45:33,799 --> 02:45:37,879
analysises the thing that we haven't

4043
02:45:35,559 --> 02:45:40,639
done yet is genealogy so uh genome

4044
02:45:37,879 --> 02:45:40,639
testing is coming

4045
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:48,160

4060
02:46:21,478 --> 02:46:24,920
good one like today was a good one it's

4061
02:46:23,239 --> 02:46:27,279
going to this one's going to be popular

4062
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:28,960
in the podcast form I suspect so for

4063
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:32,120
those that don't feel like watching

4064
02:46:28,959 --> 02:46:34,519
YouTube this shows up on like um Android

4065
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:36,600
and Google and apple and Spotify and

4066
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:38,920
Pandora and all those sorts of things uh

4067
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:40,760
just under hash Church 3.0 and I'll be

4068
02:46:38,920 --> 02:46:43,719
uploading it today at the end of this

4069
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:45,318
episode which I suspect I'll yeah let it

4070
02:46:43,719 --> 02:46:48,119
go for another 12 minutes we can keep

4071
02:46:45,318 --> 02:46:55,278
chatting a little bit maybe one more rip

4072
02:46:48,120 --> 02:46:59,479
uh C hops are uh hetero zot correct

4073
02:46:55,279 --> 02:47:01,880
uh dious hetas yeah I think so uh yeah

4074
02:46:59,478 --> 02:47:03,039
sorry I think so I'm just I haven't

4075
02:47:01,879 --> 02:47:09,119
eaten breakfast yet my brain's a little

4076
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:09,120
bit slow sorry all canist as as I got

4077
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:18,920
yeah I'm just trying to understand how

4078
02:47:14,398 --> 02:47:21,039
hops can cross with cannabis I mean I

4079
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:23,680
did the same thing Rob and I spent

4080
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:26,960
several years trying to do it we got

4081
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:29,520
every species of hops there was in the

4082
02:47:26,959 --> 02:47:32,039
entire world the rarest ones were from

4083
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:35,159
China but we could never get them to

4084
02:47:32,040 --> 02:47:38,200
hybridize the unus has actually been uh

4085
02:47:35,159 --> 02:47:40,478
disproven as a species um we're pretty

4086
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:42,040
sure that that's we got it anyway yeah

4087
02:47:40,478 --> 02:47:44,920
the uh you probably got the chingal

4088
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:47,479
flower uh yeah so yeah hops are are

4089
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:49,398
they've got a high level of hetero

4090
02:47:47,478 --> 02:47:52,278
zygosity um

4091
02:47:49,398 --> 02:47:55,318
and yeah a lot of repeats as well so but

4092
02:47:52,279 --> 02:47:57,439
it's a it's interesting the people have

4093
02:47:55,318 --> 02:48:00,119
tried people have have had limited

4094
02:47:57,439 --> 02:48:03,880
success and uh they've been able to to

4095
02:48:00,120 --> 02:48:06,920
cross them and then they tend to die uh

4096
02:48:03,879 --> 02:48:09,159
before like the fourth inter node starts

4097
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:11,559
I've seen people graft them I grafted

4098
02:48:09,159 --> 02:48:13,039
them no no no I mean the the grafting

4099
02:48:11,559 --> 02:48:14,600
works but then actually even even

4100
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:16,680
hybridizing them they they have been

4101
02:48:14,600 --> 02:48:20,559
able to get stick and then it dies

4102
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:23,600
quickly yeah we could not get any set

4103
02:48:20,559 --> 02:48:26,159
seed yeah either on the Hops or on the

4104
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:28,399
Cannabis vice versa because we did it

4105
02:48:26,159 --> 02:48:28,398
both

4106
02:48:28,559 --> 02:48:33,000
ways what one totally different idea

4107
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:35,560
here that's parallel I'm sure you're

4108
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:37,359
aware of a type five cannabis variety so

4109
02:48:35,559 --> 02:48:39,799
now we have a knockout that's in the

4110
02:48:37,359 --> 02:48:43,040
synthesis resulting in cannaboid null

4111
02:48:39,799 --> 02:48:45,438
profile these aromar cannabis products

4112
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:48,399
being used for dry hop Edition or dry

4113
02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:51,200
hemp Edition uh strikes me as offering a

4114
02:48:48,398 --> 02:48:54,159
whole novel array of you know Aroma

4115
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:56,079
contributions on the ale side uh on the

4116
02:48:54,159 --> 02:48:58,039
Cannabis side a little bit Yeah

4117
02:48:56,079 --> 02:49:00,760
different but interesting I have yet to

4118
02:48:58,040 --> 02:49:03,359
see type five plants actually being used

4119
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:06,239
in that way but it sure seems like a

4120
02:49:03,359 --> 02:49:06,239
novel and fun

4121
02:49:06,639 --> 02:49:13,000
application those were described by Dr

4122
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,000
de

4123
02:49:13,478 --> 02:49:18,959
right that was our

4124
02:49:15,639 --> 02:49:20,959
work I I recall thank you for reminding

4125
02:49:18,959 --> 02:49:22,839
me some that was amazing work and

4126
02:49:20,959 --> 02:49:24,639
ultimately I can't wait till I get to

4127
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:27,159
play with some of those type five plants

4128
02:49:24,639 --> 02:49:29,599
I've never ever found one in any of the

4129
02:49:27,159 --> 02:49:30,840
sessions I've hunted and always hoped

4130
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:34,159
that somewhere in a type three

4131
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:36,799
population i' i' run into that but um Le

4132
02:49:34,159 --> 02:49:42,000
we have lots of type fours now oh sorry

4133
02:49:36,799 --> 02:49:42,000
what was that it's a mutation

4134
02:49:42,680 --> 02:49:47,479
yes a natural mutation

4135
02:49:49,238 --> 02:49:53,879
