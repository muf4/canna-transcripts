21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,640

00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:39,579
gonna sign in and say good morning how

46
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:41,379
is karma cup hallmark the karma cup is

47
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:45,250
going very well

48
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:47,639
I was busy day lots of people lots of

49
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:52,509
many people I heard had done 10 and

50
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:54,609
$15,000 in sales us included lots lots

51
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:56,649
of great people are lots of happy

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,330
however this morning I was out front

53
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,959
waiting for my uber to come pick up the

54
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,800
to go do past church and I saw Josh and

55
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,349
he was coming out

56
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,250
this is people police and I was like

57
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,259
what you guys are worried about the

58
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,680
police and he said yeah they just

59
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:16,039
announced yesterday that the police have

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,750
240 million new dog oh and legal

61
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:21,199
cannabis things in the City of Toronto

62
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,129
so there was about five or six cops up

63
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,129
the road but I think

64
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:29,710
passing the karmic up I think this is

65
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:33,819
more about the business of dispensaries

66
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:37,420
versus somehow controlled you know I

67
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:40,000
guess Ontario announced the doing like

68
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,009
LC like liquor type stores but for

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,479
cannabis and they're gonna do like a

70
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:48,310
hundred and fifty of them province

71
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,209
anything like this as you can imagine

72
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:55,860
the majority of people were not overly

73
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,860
happy about it all

74
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,320
ich hair if they open a hundred and

75
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:04,419
fifty shops to sell weed to people what

76
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,959
you care about is being able to have

77
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:10,149
a dispenser in 50 new access points

78
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,830
because hey the more the merrier in my

79
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,810
opinion there is not enough places to

80
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,780
buy great weed

81
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:21,250
hopefully out of these 150 there might

82
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:25,839
be where you had Johnny be I'm I'm on

83
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,009
the malahat right now Ashley yeah we're

84
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,560
just kind of hang it over here and

85
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,699
alright going over the stuff and it's

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,930
interesting to say where you're saying

87
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,459
that mark and what they're gonna be

88
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,560
doing and and I remember I listened to

89
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:37,269
the whole like 45 minute kind of little

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,680
presentation they were talking about on

91
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:40,620
the crackdowns and how they're gonna

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,629
start implementing a whole new system

93
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,189
when they say by 2020 they'll have 20

94
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,110
stores available within the first year

95
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:49,959
or two I don't know how they plan on

96
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,189
putting in 150 stores overnight and how

97
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,039
that problem is gonna happen

98
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:55,509
I mean what's what's gonna happen I mean

99
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,689
how many stores are gonna go you don't

100
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:00,459
know well that's an interesting way that

101
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:02,410
they're going about it seems almost like

102
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,819
they're going about it the route of in

103
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,880
the states here we have with things

104
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:10,089
called ABC stores which before you had

105
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,519
individual stores selling liquor they

106
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:15,189
had which basically a state store which

107
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,529
is basically owned by the state as only

108
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:20,288
holds you know mMmmm

109
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:22,769
State hours you know something like nine

110
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:26,168
till like 7:00 or something like that

111
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:28,418
where it's just not an only place you

112
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:30,459
could buy liquor back in the day until

113
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:33,339
they actually had distribution and

114
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:36,159
things like that in fact it just changed

115
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:38,199
in Pennsylvania you couldn't you

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,090
couldn't buy a six-pack of beer I'm just

117
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,219
giving call you know just a causality

118
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:45,189
sort of situation there you couldn't buy

119
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,500
beer on a Sunday in a store you would

120
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:49,660
have to go to a bar to actually get it

121
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,160
and you could you wouldn't you pay for

122
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,229
an individual beer if you bought a

123
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,700
six-pack you wouldn't buy you know just

124
00:05:53,228 --> 00:06:00,418
a regular six-pack that you buy

125
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:03,159
currently in a store anywhere so I see

126
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:05,168
why they're doing something like that

127
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,050
that's a tried-and-true model that has

128
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:10,000
worked with alcohol so I can see why

129
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,189
they're they're pushing in that round

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,788
but what negative effects is that going

131
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:21,209
to what immediate negative things do you

132
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:23,229
see the negative well

133
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,639
well I guess the negative effects that

134
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,860
we're looking at right now are going to

135
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,509
be the people like that our friends that

136
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,910
are open up dispensaries have spent

137
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:33,310
their lives fighting for this plant and

138
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,020
then educating the bud tenders and the

139
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,730
knowledge behind the people that they're

140
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,639
helping the patients that are being

141
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,900
helped in these countries that we have

142
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,000
when they've establish relationships

143
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:45,250
with the bud tenders as the way all

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,569
these patients that have been relying on

145
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,670
these compassionate Cubs who are

146
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,800
compassion do you help me do give back

147
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,340
who do follow the events who do you

148
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,560
support

149
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:56,349
other people in the industry who do give

150
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,819
that I think they don't do they like the

151
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,189
liquor stores didn't they they give away

152
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,680
free alcohol they support groups or they

153
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,180
put on big events and stuff like that

154
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,769
it's a different industry with the

155
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,500
cannabis industry is more supportive

156
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:12,310
work and alcohol industry is more about

157
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,470
money just looking at comparative

158
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,589
industries and how they're actually I

159
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,770
don't want to please no one take this as

160
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:22,029
anyway is alcohol in the same line as

161
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:24,549
cannabis I'm just looking at

162
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:26,619
distribution models and how they've gone

163
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,960
and I agree it's very frustrating land

164
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,730
they've taken this large overwhelming

165
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,399
model which of course is better for

166
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,140
consumers however it leaves out all

167
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,509
those that have been spending decades

168
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,419
busting their ass and risking their

169
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:43,029
freedoms and challenging local City as

170
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,980
well as you know those federal laws

171
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,949
there in Canada I mean you love for LPS

172
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,780
it's it's rather surprising they're

173
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,610
going in this direction as opposed to

174
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,779
letting the free market because they're

175
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,490
allowing the free market actually

176
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,359
produced cannabis it's surprising

177
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,220
they're not going to allow the free

178
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,009
market to actually distribute it to

179
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:04,900
Canadians can add something to this

180
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:07,949
conversation always you know there if

181
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:10,929
there's the there's the line of um the

182
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,389
government's trying to move in and like

183
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,160
johnny was saying and take the jobs ever

184
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,930
that have been given to people that are

185
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,150
actually caring about people and and

186
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,189
showing the Compassion's and everything

187
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:23,439
like that that is all needed and the

188
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:25,209
support groups and you know all the

189
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,879
support that is that is that these

190
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:29,139
compassion centers with the bud tenders

191
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,670
with people behind the desk with the

192
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:34,778
people that are supplying those centers

193
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:37,959
now the now once once we've got

194
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:39,309
once every all of that is in place we

195
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,568
don't have any of those bud tenders or

196
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,809
any of those people putting any of those

197
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:46,088
special time special needs into anybody

198
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,309
else and it's just simply go to the

199
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:52,029
[ __ ] thing grab your bottle your bag

200
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:54,099
go to the counter pay for it leave now

201
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,899
once that factor is taken away in that

202
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,930
personal factors been taken away from

203
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,578
everybody not just guys that are

204
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:02,799
drinking booze or anything like that or

205
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:04,239
shooting drugs I think but everybody is

206
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,969
gonna it's not gonna have that

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,039
compassion or that level of human being

208
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,920
effect that really makes a difference

209
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,099
people go into clubs and just talking to

210
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,969
somebody about what they've been smoking

211
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,199
because it's not the right thing for

212
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,420
them to be smoking because it's an

213
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:21,399
indica it's it's a tea nerves or if it's

214
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:24,370
an indica sativa hybrid dominance

215
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,809
whatever they're smoking the wrong stuff

216
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,759
they're not getting the right right the

217
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:29,229
right treatment so what do they do then

218
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,568
they go back and to the internet

219
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,350
research it off or go to the black

220
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:39,458
market place that has maybe just room in

221
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,129
the back it's a head shop it's a it's a

222
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:44,469
hangout Center whatever it's a it's an

223
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:45,459
arcade they're gonna think oh then

224
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,439
they're trying to bring this black

225
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,750
market factor out of it but this black

226
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:51,818
market is actually the market that is

227
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,620
helping everybody that is you know I'm

228
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:55,719
not saying the LPS are helping people

229
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,629
there I've got nothing against anybody

230
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,819
but this [ __ ] of everybody that's

231
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:03,339
been doing this industry and part of

232
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:05,828
this industry and helping people and

233
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,300
crying with people about the good things

234
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:09,818
that are happening and the bad things

235
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,919
that are happening now now we're gonna

236
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:14,078
have that whole factor eliminated and

237
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,269
then where do we go from there and what

238
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,099
happens to the patients then what do the

239
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:22,089
peso speak up and so we want that back

240
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,250
or what well why do you guys think

241
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,990
Canada has gone in this direction as

242
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,629
opposed to stated before letting the

243
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,579
free market as as it its created from

244
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:33,629
the free market the you know the whole

245
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:35,888
you know dispensary seeing as it is so

246
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:38,558
why do you think they've gone in this

247
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:39,850
direction I don't know Johnny can you

248
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:42,308
answer anything like that

249
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,990
oh well pretty much what you're looking

250
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,240
at is you're looking at a system so

251
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,769
they're trying to legalize cannabis and

252
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,579
the biggest thing about Justin Trudeau

253
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,149
is talking about

254
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:54,548
how they getting rid of the black market

255
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,589
so by them putting him all of these

256
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:58,688
stores they got an open up distribution

257
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,459
center so if I go into other places and

258
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:02,048
other friends that have like say

259
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,388
multiple stores they have distribution

260
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:05,980
centers to supply those stores so now

261
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,019
we're gonna start seeing these models as

262
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,970
it's like I was talking with Darren it's

263
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,980
like when I go to like a grocery store

264
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,259
they have it's like a distribution

265
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,569
center for all the supplies or if I go

266
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,419
to if no matter where we go we're always

267
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,828
will get more than one or two products

268
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:22,599
back in the days you know we're not go

269
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:24,368
see my buddy he have one type of wheel

270
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,379
with dispensaries we have ten different

271
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:27,999
types of weed I think the government is

272
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:29,289
taking a look at the Spencer II model I

273
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,720
think they're gonna put in that type of

274
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,789
a system how they gonna start hiring

275
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,259
around that will be interesting I mean

276
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:37,629
there's no schooling for this there's no

277
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:40,329
education on how to cope cannabis and

278
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:42,749
diggities pharmacist there's so many

279
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:47,099
different things with us now as inform

280
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:49,119
the people the people have the voice and

281
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,269
and I really see it like with

282
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,399
prohibition we we had we had there was

283
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:56,259
harsh like laws that were enforced in

284
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,089
beginning in as times grew we started

285
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,829
getting more craft kind of breweries and

286
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:02,110
stuff like that we're not the same with

287
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:03,909
marijuana I'm gonna see more of like the

288
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,438
independent grower who's got that

289
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:07,149
certain strain or they're gonna have

290
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:09,219
that certain rosin or there'll be

291
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,989
something they'll be Teke about every

292
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,660
individual that has their own little

293
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:15,639
thing I think as the system changes I

294
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:17,110
think that we tikis will fight hard

295
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,659
enough in courts and because this will

296
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,949
turn into a court battle huge and we

297
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:22,509
already know that Daniel Larson's

298
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,248
posting on it Jason there's a lot of

299
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,709
people ready talking about what things

300
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:29,290
that we have to do as patients as people

301
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:32,018
and as Canadians to be able to be able

302
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:34,899
to ensure we get safe access and at the

303
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:36,730
same time start a new industry and we're

304
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,759
gonna we defy and I'm all about access

305
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,319
so for me 150 stores in Ontario when I

306
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,259
get off the plane and I can walk into a

307
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:48,099
place and get what I need because I need

308
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:50,619
it now that's access that's what we can

309
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,959
fighting for can you clarify more about

310
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:56,619
what Dana Larson is saying that patients

311
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,359
can do to get involved oh you know just

312
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,798
reading some stuff he's putting on this

313
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,329
morning what was going on here the

314
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:02,549
government wants to clothe expenses and

315
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:04,919
all black market is

316
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:07,139
just make legal cannabis higher quality

317
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,000
and lower price than the dispensaries

318
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,039
with a wider selection of high quality

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,500
and lower price extracts and edibles

320
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,879
that's really Galatian the government is

321
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,620
going to rely on the race to shut down

322
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,360
the current market they will fail just

323
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,860
like they failed for the past century of

324
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,610
prohibition and that's what dan Larson

325
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:27,060
says 51 men's go on his Facebook page so

326
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:29,009

329
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,078
more because you know I know there's

330
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,940
quite a few Canadians who must be

331
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,309
concerned at least you know hearing this

332
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,890
sort of situation that especially those

333
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:42,419
that actively run or dealing with

334
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,708
dispensaries I mean it's always

335
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,620
nerve-racking to hear that your

336
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:48,119
distribution access point could be you

337
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,459
know shut down completely and that

338
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:55,500
causes a great deal of anxiety to people

339
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:58,588
you know locally so it's very

340
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,730
interesting situation there that the you

341
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,730
know Canada's gone in that direction

342
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:14,250
it's really just in the state of Ontario

343
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:16,949
right yes that's the state of Ontario

344
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,320
yeah are they looking to go national

345
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,870
with it as like the Ontario they're

346
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:27,839
they're sort of the incubation point for

347
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:29,730
this situation I'm not sure Johnny are

348
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,180
you listening to that I think Johnny

349
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:35,039
froze up on us so that's just where

350
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,349
we're what do you think about this Sam

351
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:41,699
have you heard about this going on in

352
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:45,149
Canada before well I'm what I'm for is

353
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,790
that individuals should be able to grow

354
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:51,690
it as much as they want for their own

355
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:56,250
use and family use for if they sell it I

356
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:59,190
am then somewhere I'd like it to be

357
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:04,440
taxed regulated and needed like an entry

358
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:08,100
if it's passed want to sell it Epis one

359
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:13,140
so if individuals want to sell it it's

360
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:16,300
it's it clean and my mind I think acts

361
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:18,549
are regulated if we really want the

362
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:21,609
wanna Prohibition to be gone dead and

363
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:29,949
buried then we have to pay our part just

364
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:31,480
like any other industry well this is the

365
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,670
reality that we're seeing we've taken it

366
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,350
past that idea of that what we always

367
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:38,199
said you know we want it legal or we

368
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,360
want it tax well this is part of those

369
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,310
realities that transpires that you know

370
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,570
we didn't I mean it get some of us have

371
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:46,029
thought about but you know the

372
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,610
government's taken further it's very

373
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:51,339
interesting to see you know Canada go

374
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,259
this direction for really thought they

375
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,230
would go the dispensary model for some

376
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:58,919
reason allowing individuals so do you

377
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:03,550
think this will be like a tweed canopy

378
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:05,049
distribution centers or at the Canadian

379
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:12,659
distribution centers what do you think

380
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:15,599
it will be not a clue well you know what

381
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:19,689
then I think we should do a bomber it

382
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,490
absolutely welcome dr. Tsao down hey

383
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,530
everybody how's everyone doing today

384
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,480
we're doing good we're have a little

385
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,579
technical difficulty unfortunately with

386
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,769
bubble man so we're kind of running the

387
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,290
show a bit here today we were talking

388
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:35,289
about the new distribution centers in

389
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:38,049
Canada and I was kind of curious about

390
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:39,399
pants so lucky how's it going they're in

391
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:43,569
pencil talkie I know their harvest

392
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:45,429
didn't happen they're working on yeah

393
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,370
working on your growing distribution

394
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:53,979
centers there what's the status yeah I

395
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:58,409
think there's there's a so again the

396
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:00,970
Hamptons is a only experimental research

397
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:05,500
plot so I think they're only allowed to

398
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:08,860
grow somewhere between 3 to 5 acres and

399
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:13,269
I asked a couple of the people who are

400
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:15,429
involved to maybe be panelists on a

401
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:19,059
coming hashed Church so they can give us

402
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:22,500
a little bit of you know poop on what's

403
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:25,149
going on but there's also medical

404
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,549
licenses for grower processors that have

405
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,209
been awarded in Pennsylvania as well so

406
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,418
there's

407
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:35,139
you know groundbreaking ceremonies to

408
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:40,600
open facilities and facilities you know

409
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:42,248
coming online and popping in in a

410
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:47,408
neighboring state of Maryland too as

411
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:49,589
well so yeah I mean there's a every day

412
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:52,139
every week there's more and more

413
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:55,829
progress being made on establishing

414
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:58,418
programs in these states so it's good

415
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:00,189
it's a positive movement movement

416
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:02,350
forward you know that's what we all want

417
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,389
to see and you know it's one thing to

418
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:06,248
hear you know states move saying they're

419
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:08,740
gonna do something it's another thing

420
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:11,019
that actually transpired so I mean it's

421
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,990
very positive for Pennsylvania do you

422
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:15,970
know them when you walk approximately

423
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,829
when Pennsylvanians look at having

424
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:24,100
actual distribution centers to go

425
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:27,999
purchase cannabis at is there yeah I see

426
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:30,519
yeah so the facilities are just you know

427
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:32,829
in the process is starting up right now

428
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,159
doctors are being trained because they

429
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:38,788
have to go through some mandatory

430
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,980
training in order to be able to have the

431
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:46,450
the ability to prescribe and they're

432
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,610
trying to again increase the education

433
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,369
of medical professionals so they can

434
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:54,308
understand what are the right conditions

435
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:58,480
that they should you know look for to

436
00:18:54,308 --> 00:19:02,378
prescribe medical cannabis and yeah

437
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,808
there's clinical applicants as well so

438
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:07,118
these are applicants that are associated

439
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:11,200
with large research universities that

440
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:12,849
have hospitals and I'm associated with a

441
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,139
group that's working with the Thomas

442
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:19,898
Jefferson University in Philadelphia and

443
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:21,278
this is again I guess the notion is that

444
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:24,248
they're going to do a lot of sort of

445
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:27,118
outpatient open-ended clinical type

446
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:29,769
research to try to develop some type of

447
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:35,288
understanding of clinical efficacy

448
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:38,808
amongst patient population groups by by

449
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:40,398
volunteering you know so just

450
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:43,269
a patient that would have a particular

451
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:47,298
medical condition would basically

452
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:50,240
volunteer some information through a

453
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:53,749
medical questionnaire on how effective a

454
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,259
particular strain or product or oil or

455
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:59,808
take sure is and be able to develop you

456
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,690
know information and databases based on

457
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:05,928
you know real patient experience with

458
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:08,120
the medicine do you have patients lined

459
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:10,490
up or is there a way that no I think

460
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:15,558
that's getting involved if they want you

461
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:17,450
yeah this is you know you know building

462
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,878
the plane while you're flying it this is

463
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,879
all happening while it's that I think

464
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:25,158
the legislation is new everything is new

465
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:28,939
about it that you know universities

466
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:32,659
haven't done this yet so yeah it's a

467
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,869
it's a big new unknown thing so no not

468
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:37,999
yet are the universities embracing it or

469
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:40,878
are they still kind of at arms-length

470
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:43,850
with it well it's interesting because

471
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:45,949
the Pennsylvania Medical Society is now

472
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,980
you know sort of looking at it and it's

473
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:54,798
established like best practices and

474
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:57,499
rules and as is the Pennsylvania Bar

475
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:02,990
Association again giving guidance to

476
00:20:57,499 --> 00:21:05,079
attorneys because if it's you know if

477
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,490
something's federally against the law

478
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,609
theoretically an attorney can't give you

479
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:14,388
any information to help you you know

480
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:16,519
break federal law so that's always been

481
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:20,928
sort of a quandary for attorneys because

482
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:24,769
they can't advise you know and play the

483
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:26,749
necessary of roles that legal folks and

484
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:29,778
attorneys play in the startup of new

485
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:33,440
businesses and be able to give clients

486
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:35,808
advice in the cannabis business world

487
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,249
has been always a tricky thing for

488
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:44,388
attorneys because they're they can be

489
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:47,778
disbarred for giving information that

490
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:50,689
can lead to their clients breaking the

491
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:54,049
law and so if you read that

492
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:57,650
as that they can't give help to anyone

493
00:21:54,049 --> 00:22:00,859
in the cannabis industry it's useful for

494
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,350
the Pennsylvania Bar Association and all

495
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:05,359
the other State Bar Association's to

496
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:08,990
establish a set of rules and guidelines

497
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,699
that attorneys can follow well the

498
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,920
Pennsylvania Medical Association has

499
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,259
done the same thing for physicians and

500
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:20,600
so again it's giving the legitimate

501
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:23,629
legitimacy of having a set of standards

502
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,990
and a set of code of ethics that this is

503
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:30,680
how you apply this for for this patient

504
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,650
population or in case of attorneys for

505
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,670
you know all the aspects that they

506
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,640
interact on you know business

507
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:40,279
development and securing contracts and

508
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,890
everything that attorneys need to do to

509
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,889
be able to you know see this industry

510
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,630
you know become established and that's a

511
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,180
huge step in the direction of allowing

512
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,250
you know the market to you know to reign

513
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,460
you know it's key that they're allowing

514
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,230
this type of discussion at those points

515
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,309
because those are key any of the type of

516
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,259
business people are gonna need

517
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:02,359
counseling and you know you're in the

518
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:04,129
Commonwealth so you know Pennsylvania

519
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:08,750
has the Commonwealth it's interesting to

520
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:10,730
see how that shall all shake out for ya

521
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,250
in a Commonwealth I don't think we can

522
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:16,009
pass stuff by referendum so like you

523
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,650
know Colorado and Oregon like a lot of

524
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:20,359
these states that have voted in things

525
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,670
that's been voted in by public

526
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:27,289
referendum and I think for some reason

527
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:29,570
goes back to the 1600s or William Penn

528
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:32,509
days and a Commonwealth you can't vote

529
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:35,359
in stuff by referendum you have to you

530
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:39,079
know I guess the the legislators know

531
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,579
best you know well that's just it it's

532
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,109
how it is it's what's happening here in

533
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:43,789
California you know we passed our laws

534
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:45,559
but no they get a hold of it because

535
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:50,750
they now have to regulate it so I

536
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:54,349
totally get that but I wonder how long

537
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,630
before we'll see the ltp tax on cannabis

538
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:59,179
because it's gonna come in time you know

539
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,340
people don't know every can of soda and

540
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,350
anything that goes through Pennsylvania

541
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:04,359
once state you know I guess interstate

542
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:07,509
commerce is a

543
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:10,178
that will finally take place but I know

544
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:12,129
that you know Pennsylvania does well off

545
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:14,559
that taxation off of thing yeah well

546
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:17,530
there's a lot of there's been a lot of

547
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:20,109
talk about the privatization of that of

548
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:23,470
that state-run liquor authority and and

549
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:26,048
and actually I think like in Washington

550
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,870
State for example it's sometimes it's

551
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:32,289
the Liquor Control Board that ends up

552
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:35,079
taking the role of regulating cannabis

553
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:37,298
and the can in the new cannabis industry

554
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:39,939
and I guess they figured while these

555
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:42,369
people sold booze I guess or regulated

556
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,190
regulated the selling of booze then they

557
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:47,199
must be good at regulating the sell of

558
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,840
weed but if you think about it if the

559
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,150
state wanted to have dispensaries or

560
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,579
state-owned buildings of facilities

561
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,429
there they have a network and a

562
00:24:54,579 --> 00:25:00,308
distribution network within the state to

563
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:03,940
get a controlled dangerous substance to

564
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:05,740
a you know place for right I was talking

565
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,929
about that right before you came on the

566
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,460
agency stores because what I was in in

567
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:11,259
Louisiana when I grew up but they didn't

568
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,900
have ABC stores I could go to a 7-eleven

569
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:16,660
and pick up a pint or up to a fifth of

570
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,669
Jack Daniels or beer etc etc whereas

571
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,470
when I went to West Virginia I learned

572
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:22,840
that they and in Pennsylvania back in

573
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,940
the day they had state stores so yes you

574
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,189
already have that distribution so that's

575
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:31,630
actually happening in Canada and Darren

576
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:34,269
and and the other Canadians were making

577
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,000
us aware of what's actually transpiring

578
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:40,089
up there so it made me immediately think

579
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,429
of Pennsylvania because in you know and

580
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:44,678
West Virginia because it was such a

581
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:48,460
foreign idea to me but now as a

582
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:51,490
distribution set up for the state I get

583
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,490
it and understand why it is that it is

584
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,349
but that model of course seems to have

585
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,509
become outdated over time and they've

586
00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:00,879
allowed the free market to finally you

587
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:02,710
know reign but I mean how long did it

588
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,720
take for Pennsylvania to come around I

589
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,090
mean only what last year did it pass

590
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,730
regarding buying a six-pack on a Sunday

591
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:13,000
you know I'm saying at a bar

592
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:15,549
so I mean it's to take that long for

593
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,230
that type of change so it's interesting

594
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:21,259
to see what each state is going to do

595
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,558
I would rather surprise by Canada taking

596
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:27,019
this turn of going to that sort of ABC

597
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,710
set up as opposed to letting the free

598
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:32,779
market access or those that have spent

599
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,929
years as activists risking their

600
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:37,460
freedoms etc you know pushing things you

601
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,400
know pushing the agenda forward and

602
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,259
being allowed to be players in the you

603
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,360
know the new world as opposed to being

604
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:47,058
shut out and excluded that it looks to

605
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:50,240
Canada is doing do you think Canada is

606
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:51,589
gonna go in that direction or I mean

607
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,750
part of me do you think Pennsylvania is

608
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:56,720
going to go in that direction like the

609
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:01,250
ABC stores for initially or do you think

610
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,740
it will allow the free market no I mean

611
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,539
it sounds like it's gonna be free market

612
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,359
it sounds like that's the way they're

613
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:10,190
gonna go at first I mean again there's a

614
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:12,979
there's a large number of dispensaries

615
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,679
there's a lesser number of grower

616
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,450
processors so there's and some of those

617
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,630
grower processors have their own

618
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:23,330
dispensaries so there will be a

619
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:28,100
wholesale market between the grower

620
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:32,829
processors and the dispensers dispensers

621
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:37,129
are sort of the licenses were given out

622
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:40,099
according to population centers and

623
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,929
basically where people live so you know

624
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:44,529
in the Philadelphia region in the

625
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:47,390
Pittsburgh region and in Harrisburg

626
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:51,230
Scranton areas the areas where there's

627
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:54,290
heavy population they awarded more

628
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:57,048
licenses and in the area but the grower

629
00:27:54,289 --> 00:28:01,909
processors are distributed throughout

630
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:05,329
the state it's kind of like a six

631
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:08,870
sections divvied up state kind of thing

632
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:11,439
but um yeah we'll see because the

633
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:14,889
clinical applicants to the clinical

634
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:19,269
folks can also sell I think into the

635
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:22,400
wholesale market so the clinical

636
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:27,650
licenses are also going to be you know

637
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,000
valuable commercially as well excited to

638
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,900
see what happens they're finding that's

639
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,929
you you have a opportunity there to

640
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,240
really how the East Coast yeah the

641
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:40,778
one-wheel I guess advantage in

642
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,778
Pennsylvania is why won't say advantage

643
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:46,450
I mean it's kind of like a rare thing is

644
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:48,069
autism is a qualifying condition and you

645
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,740
know I don't know I've heard numbers

646
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:53,918
like 1 in 5 people are somewhere on the

647
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,620
autistic spectrum or autism spectrum so

648
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,110
the fact that autism is a qualifying

649
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:02,739
condition is pretty big I mean that

650
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:05,288
means the patient count for at least

651
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:11,970
that condition could potentially be you

652
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:15,038
know in the millions without a doubt so

653
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,460
yeah I'm you know again I've heard some

654
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:22,538
stories about the effectiveness of

655
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:25,090
cannabis with autism and you know things

656
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:27,398
like Asperger's or Tourette's

657
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:29,798
neurological disorders and I'm not

658
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:34,239
really sure that again there's a sort of

659
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:39,009
one-size-fits-all solution to how how

660
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:42,429
effective cannabis is for autism well I

661
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:44,829
I know it helps me focus whenever I'm in

662
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,630
situations or stressful situations where

663
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:49,269
other people were like alright you can

664
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,460
smoke cannabis and that helps me you

665
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:53,440
know in those types of situations but I

666
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,990
am one of those where were some of the

667
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,720
rare ones on here who can fully function

668
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,380
well you know hmm you know on cannabis

669
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,370
whereas we've all come across people who

670
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:08,230
can't unfortunately and that that's you

671
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:13,509
know just nor here nor there it just is

672
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:17,319
what it is pencil let's see there are

673
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:21,940
some stories and people I mean cannabis

674
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:25,148
bringing autistic patients alive I mean

675
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,519
completely like people talking for the

676
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:31,389
first time putting sentences together I

677
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:34,918
mean like they've lived in a very you

678
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:39,130
know different world before they started

679
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:41,288
being treated with cannabis and and you

680
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,909
know again I'm not exactly sure I think

681
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:46,118
autism is

682
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:48,940
kind of a manifestation of several

683
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:52,418
potential neurological conditions and

684
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,028
you they may not all be the same but

685
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:58,509
certainly given the prevalence of the

686
00:30:55,028 --> 00:31:01,450
cb1 receptor human brain you would think

687
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:07,210
that again cannabis would would have

688
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:09,669
some impact on on what it does and maybe

689
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,909
it's related to the same way that it

690
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:16,059
works with epilepsy but you'd think that

691
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:18,609
again there's there's some kind of magic

692
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:22,960
combination of using cannabis or being

693
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:25,449
able to their illness to give good end

694
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,548
up cannabinoid responses to maybe some

695
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,619
of these conditions lead to seizures and

696
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:32,138
whatnot well it's been known as the tree

697
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:34,988
of knowledge you know it brings you know

698
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:37,538
wisdom to those who imbibe in it correct

699
00:31:34,989 --> 00:31:40,108
Sam I've read that and history books

700
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:43,929
regarding hashish and cannabis

701
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:46,509
I'm sure lots of people consider it the

702
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:49,509
tree of knowledge and tree of wisdom and

703
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:52,679
tree of medicine and tree of money I

704
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:55,659
mean all different kinds of things

705
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,220
Touche but I'm talking through history

706
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:59,320
I've actually read you know manuscripts

707
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:03,879
and things like that that seem to

708
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:06,358
reference I agree with you so I

709
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:09,839
definitely dr. I definitely see there's

710
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:12,878
aspects of cannabis bringing you know

711
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,888
affecting you know but of course it also

712
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:16,628
depends on what string went genetic to

713
00:32:14,888 --> 00:32:20,408
that individual you know that's the

714
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:23,019
thing we also have to work on as well is

715
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:25,139
to find those those combinations that

716
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:27,669
work and yes you know it's

717
00:32:25,138 --> 00:32:32,319
individualistic you know it's very hard

718
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:36,549
to come up with a swath recommendation

719
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:39,220
Darius has started on Kepner writes for

720
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:42,638
the last couple decades but now we're

721
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:45,788
starting to focus on not only single or

722
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:48,608
combination cannabinoid Suites in the

723
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:51,489
particular profile but the terpenes that

724
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:56,139
goes on with it or terpenes I should say

725
00:32:51,489 --> 00:33:00,400
and that the amount of differ

726
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:06,550
profiles that can be presented from just

727
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:10,120
a hundred and fifty terpenes and some

728
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:12,190
hundred cannabinoids is already hundreds

729
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:16,109
of thousands but when you consider that

730
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:21,430
you can alter the profiles just by

731
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:24,939
increasing one of those terpenes or two

732
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:28,330
of them or there's an infinite variety

733
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:31,539
as as we all know from practical use of

734
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:35,079
cannabis for four decades you know each

735
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:39,430
cannabis that you get is a little bit

736
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:42,519
different and that's a fact it's mostly

737
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:45,580
just THC I'm talking about the past not

738
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,259
the future where we've got a lot of CBD

739
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:50,740
and we'll start to get other things out

740
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:52,569
there too yeah we're definitely looking

741
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,420
at you know new aspects of without a

742
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:57,460
doubt those of those ratios have you

743
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,950
know always altered and that's kind of

744
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,329
always been the frustration of some

745
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,580
patients when they finally find

746
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:05,949
something that works for them is that

747
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:07,240
works for that batch and then the next

748
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,668
batch that comes through it's either

749
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,260
slightly slightly altered in one way

750
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:13,809
shape or form and that's definitely you

751
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,200
know how it's grown how its maintained

752
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:19,329
how its harvested all those things and

753
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:21,759
consistency all the way through are one

754
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:24,309
of the most important things to do and

755
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,470
one of the reasons why bedrock an is so

756
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:29,230
successful with the Dutch government

757
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:33,129
because they just grow consistently and

758
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:36,460
they get consistent results which is not

759
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:39,760
only just better can't do that but once

760
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,730
they start flowering in the room have no

761
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,270
entrance by human beings it's untouched

762
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,190
by human hands that was one of the most

763
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:51,300
interesting things when I was there to

764
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:54,639
actually see one how far the lights were

765
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,200
from the canopy from when they put them

766
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,469
in because I saw a room that they just

767
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:02,259
put the plants in and I saw rooms with

768
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:04,989
full canopy of course to see the

769
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,790
evenness of the canopy was that was

770
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:09,819
interest it was nice to see I don't

771
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:12,039
usually see that but to see

772
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:16,090
that the rhone are completely sealed and

773
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:18,759
no one goes in once they're flowered was

774
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:21,190
something in a concept I have never

775
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,010
heard of much less seen in application

776
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:26,980
and to see it with doing it protecting

777
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,050
Everett patented it's called untouched

778
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:34,289
by human hands of course we did use

779
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:37,269
monkeys harvesting monkeys are yeah

780
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:40,900
special harvesting monkeys or beneficial

781
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:43,480
monkeys coconut monkeys that would twist

782
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:49,869
the coconuts but these guys twist the

783
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:57,340
bud job so are you training by monkey

784
00:35:49,869 --> 00:36:04,420
see monkey do you got it that's med

785
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:07,450
Vance Avery but that's the only that

786
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:11,800
I've ever seen I've ever seen as the

787
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:13,649
bedrick can do that I've not seen my

788
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,870
whole life

789
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,880
it was rather surprising and to see some

790
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:22,089
of the problems that happen in there on

791
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,550
the floor etc I photographed that and

792
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:27,880
then so what happens in the ceilings and

793
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:30,690
things like that yeah I was rather

794
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,690
surprised by that grow all together but

795
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:38,349
it it was fascinating to see that

796
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:41,349
yeah then walking that all in so I don't

797
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:43,559
recommend that people so don't lock your

798
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:48,369
things in a room and walk away yeah

799
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:51,699
which may or may not be beneficial some

800
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:54,839
people but I doubt for everybody is they

801
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:59,519
gamma ray nuke it and sterilize it and

802
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:03,010
that reduces the terpenes up to 30% and

803
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:09,099
we know after seeing that facility why

804
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:11,920
they do that I'll leave it at that to

805
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:13,849
get rid of the traces of robots at their

806
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,680
ease grow

807
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:22,159
I know they should transfer over to

808
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:24,500
monkeys apparently he'd probably well

809
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:29,750
there you go and that's not fair to the

810
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:33,469
monkeys yeah yes because I keep half

811
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:36,469
past they collected on their face Sam

812
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:38,359
did the the monkeys eat cannabis when

813
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:41,559
you were in D in India did you see them

814
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:47,510
eat or attack the plants or the hash I

815
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:49,340
never saw it but not that I know of you

816
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:53,540
know part of the reason might be that

817
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:55,640
when you eat a plant it's mostly THC a

818
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:57,789
and you're gonna have very little effect

819
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:02,559
right it'll just pass through the body

820
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:05,389
yes other animals yes I've heard of it

821
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,849
yeah I've seen a pair of birds and you

822
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:11,179
know other other animal animals I've had

823
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:14,989
deer eat plants in Pennsylvania that I

824
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:17,809
grew it back in the day so I mean I've

825
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:20,329
seen wood rats just strip the bark off

826
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:24,049
the plants because they wanted it for

827
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:27,110
nest oh they took all the so they

828
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:29,960
literally rented the plant alive yeah

829
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:32,950
that wasn't healthy for the plan no I

830
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:38,389
don't recommend that

831
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:40,579
hmm yeah I've early early growing it

832
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:42,529
always had to put mesh screens over the

833
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:45,619
plants to make sure rats or any small

834
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:49,400
rodents don't want to not much on the

835
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:53,179
little tender shoots but yeah deer yeah

836
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:59,660
I had literally 41 out of 42 plants

837
00:38:53,179 --> 00:39:02,629
eaten by deer so I yeah what was that

838
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:06,969
pre flowering or after flowering after

839
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:09,500
flowering really yeah

840
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:12,409
sometimes I'll eat the leaves and stuff

841
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,039
for the moisture because they can't find

842
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:16,219
water

843
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:19,969
they were the plants were destroyed they

844
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:21,289
were you could tell it was chewed is you

845
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:23,869
know they were still you know hanging on

846
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:25,670
the plants etc uh but they were lay

847
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:27,309
marks everywhere apparently they must

848
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,650
have come through his group

849
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:34,750
just got the game on and then crashed

850
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:38,230
then moved on but yeah there was lay

851
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:45,480
marks everywhere yeah so it was biker

852
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:47,320
gear yeah it was it was white tail is

853
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,750
Pennsylvania they have whitetail they

854
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,960
don't have mule deer like out here in

855
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:56,050
the West Coast well deer are serious

856
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,610
problem but I think wood rats might even

857
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:04,720
be worse and if you're in a civilized

858
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:07,780
area Gophers people been having problems

859
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:11,169
out here with sudden oak death attacking

860
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,360
cannabis plants and what just happens is

861
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:19,240
their plants just die and they can't

862
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:22,570
figure out why and I'm not your scene

863
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:26,559
problems with it so I can't really

864
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:29,650
comment it call causes the machinist of

865
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:34,329
the cellulose and it destroys any type

866
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:37,300
of movement of fluids so basically it

867
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:40,809
causes a machinist right as the the

868
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,480
roots and the stalk separate right in

869
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:48,150
there and the plank just literally

870
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:54,159
collapse it's under their own weight so

871
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:55,840
a friend of oil born seems to be

872
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,500
airborne I had a friend of mine who

873
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,530
grows in the Central Valley and he lost

874
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:06,519
last year he lost his entire crop in

875
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:11,050
greenhouse due to it so it's becoming a

876
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:12,789
yeah his entire greenhouse so actually

877
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,800
it was two years ago wasn't last year

878
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:20,610
because he got a successful project in

879
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,810
it identified yeah because he's a he's a

880
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,670
fourth-generation farmer in Central

881
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:29,650
Valley so he knows what he's doing and

882
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:32,320
has access to familiar with it and I

883
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:35,950
grew in the Central Valley for a decade

884
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,350
but yeah it's a recent phenomenon it's

885
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:40,000
it's a type of rod that is said know

886
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:40,989
death is kind of appeared in the last

887
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,090
five

888
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:45,250
- ten years and there it's a main

889
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:48,490
problem here in Auckland because there's

890
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,320
an Auckland oak and if they're trying to

891
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:53,379
preserve it as best as they can and

892
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,150
they've been susceptible to it I have an

893
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,920
Auckland oak in my backyard I have an

894
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,200
Oakland oak actually outside my window

895
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,909
in front of me here so I keep an eye on

896
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,889
them all the time and they've been you

897
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:07,750
know without any problem but it's been

898
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:11,190
unfortunately throughout the California

899
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:13,030
and moving up and around the west coast

900
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,039
that's a drag

901
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:18,130
I like coke priests because if you look

902
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:20,440
you can find chanterelles right I grew

903
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,780
up in Louisiana with huge live oaks I

904
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,490
used to play on you know live oaks the

905
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,680
size is almost the size of some of these

906
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:28,629
sequoias in diameter etcetera etcetera

907
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:31,149
so because these are you know there's

908
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,610
Evangeline Oaks etcetera it's so I've

909
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:36,220
always had a fondness for them and you

910
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:38,349
know how deep their roots are I was you

911
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:40,509
know rather surprised how shallow the

912
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:42,849
roots are of the Sequoias here in

913
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:46,869
California they're really well known for

914
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:49,630
having such however but says they make

915
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:52,480
for they make up for it in age and size

916
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,700
and girth well as well as being

917
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,340
fireproof I mean you know fire resistant

918
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:59,559
as well you know that's a lot of people

919
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,358
I know who use you know redwoods on

920
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,920
their houses out here in California for

921
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:11,259
but also insect resistant to the houses

922
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:13,869
the head as well net ski but yeah

923
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,520
there's a lot of problems right now out

924
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:18,400
here in California and throughout the

925
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,619
West because everything's on fire you

926
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,599
know up there daran up there BC and

927
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:25,390
stuff it's so you know the fires are

928
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,489
going and I know a lot of outdoor people

929
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:30,219
are you know upset because their crops

930
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:32,049
are being ash Don as well as you know

931
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:34,209
those particulates that are burning or

932
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,850
falling and you know getting into the

933
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,949
you know your crystals and everything on

934
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:41,500
your plants and you can't wash that sort

935
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:44,379
of thing off so it's causing a lot of

936
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:47,530
problems for people literally from

937
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,930
California to Missouri right now that

938
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,140
are growing outdoors so we feel for you

939
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:52,139
everybody

940
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:58,630
any suggestions a more what people could

941
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:01,089
do regarding if they're in fallout areas

942
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:04,450
of a fire as best as they can do to

943
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:06,760
protect them honestly I mean if you're

944
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:08,529
inside of a greenhouse or a building you

945
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,570
could try to filter the air that comes

946
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,090
in that your feet your supply and your

947
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,340
plants - so you're not spreading any

948
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:18,550
contaminants to them and that would

949
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,650
protect them if you can whereas in a

950
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:22,600
greenhouse it's it can be harder if

951
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:26,559
you're because most greenhouses have

952
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:29,549
open ventilation up on the roof so yeah

953
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:33,750
and outdoors what the hell can you do

954
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:38,860
yeah I honestly honestly don't know

955
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:43,210
maybe prayed the fires go away well

956
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:46,990
isn't it like any other natural disaster

957
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:49,990
areas it's basically [ __ ] taken as it

958
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:55,989
comes in if it's a [ __ ] up crop it's a

959
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:58,659
[ __ ] up crop I wonder if the yeah if

960
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:01,029
the hail comes or a flood comes or

961
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:03,399
hurricane comes you lose your crop and

962
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,300
you grow again next year yeah my buddy

963
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,090
up north

964
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,820
he had a hailstorm just tear through

965
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,769
parts of poo scoopy as the town called

966
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:15,150
there may be a thousand people living

967
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:19,090
there 500 please know how much a

968
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,680
hailstorm hits so hard that it caught it

969
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:24,820
killed my buddy's whole garden it

970
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:28,559
smashed it smashed Sun roofs out of

971
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:33,630
houses windows out of houses his 19 was

972
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:35,920
1977 GMC pickup mint-condition 70 pickup

973
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,289
smashed and dented all holding like

974
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,789
someone went over with golf balls golf

ball hammer and smashed everywhere on

976
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:44,920
the truck smashed windows wreaked havoc

977
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,929

00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,269
house smashed garden destroyed

979
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:52,469
everything it's a natural disaster while

980
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:55,170
nature was mad and she laid her [ __ ]

981
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:58,539
havoc across the lands that was that

982
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,400
pickup and move on that's the shitty

983
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:05,320
part but that's the reality of it and

984
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:08,380
that's the same with her and I'm sure in

985
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:11,860
Vancouver also it's true I mean there

986
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:14,769
was an before there was man nature had a

987
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:21,990
natural cycle but there would be a lot

988
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:21,989
of rain lightning would hit something

989
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:29,019
just repeated over and over and over

990
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:32,010
yeah they've just they've realized that

991
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:34,750
as I go to national parks all the time

992
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:37,330
they finally realized as opposed to

993
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,130
trying to control these fires that it's

994
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:40,779
best to just let them go because it's

995
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,150
they've realized after all these years

996
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,620
of conservation that it's really the

997
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,660
best thing that they can do is allow

998
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:48,429
nature to do what it does because that

999
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:52,920
type of burning clears the brush and

1000
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:56,379
clears all the Arts undergrowth right

1001
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,750
right but they've also realized to stop

1002
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,460
doing that so much in recent history and

1003
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:02,500
just allowing those houses to burn as

1004
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,050
opposed they still try to save them as

1005
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,809
they can but you know there's pine cones

1006
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,610
that you know are triggered by fires

1007
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:12,159
when they come through so they release

1008
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:15,640
you know their seeds there's the whole

1009
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:18,069
eco structure to you know these fires

1010
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:19,059
that they have now come down I was a

1011
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:23,320
villager

1012
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:27,099
after a fire there's new life that's

1013
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:29,860
right the fires created as well fire it

1014
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:31,269
would not be that's it those seeds

1015
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,010
wouldn't sprout or do anything without

1016
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:35,409
the fire for most pinecones

1017
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,140
that's what germinate summer activates

1018
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:39,759
and we're something I don't know it's

1019
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:41,829
also why you don't have those types of

1020
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,500
old-growth forests because you don't

1021
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:45,519
have that type of undergrowth as talking

1022
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,289
we were talking last week about

1023
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,570
old-growth forests and there's things

1024
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:52,329
about old-growth forests all the

1025
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:54,340
different layers of canopy and you know

1026
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:56,259
flora that are there that exists that

1027
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,420
you know they don't exist out here in

1028
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,310
the West because of fires and how they

1029
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,860
come through and they clear all that out

1030
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:04,630
and you know natural selection becomes

1031
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,849
the winner of the day out here in the

1032
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,880
Sierras you know all the way up into

1033
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:14,279
Canada you know those big areas up in

1034
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:16,650
California and where the Sequoias are

1035
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:21,330
they had small fires go through there

1036
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:24,119
every 10 20 50 whatever years but the

1037
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:27,920
squares were there for up a thousand and

1038
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,920
most of them did just fine

1039
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,050
it's very interesting to see out in the

1040
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:36,510
series right now because of the fires

1041
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,190
and we send our best of the lists that

1042
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,450
are out there doing that the dirty work

1043
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,250
and the fire jumpers and the

1044
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,899
firefighters that are protecting

1045
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:46,230
people's houses and everything right now

1046
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,030
because they're doing work that

1047
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,858
definitely needs to be done and we

1048
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,080
respect what they're doing and that

1049
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:54,210
stuff's crazy because I know a lot of

1050
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,730
people rely on their hard work and

1051
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:59,400
dedication so I'm gonna send a bong rip

1052
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:01,019
out to those hard-working individuals or

1053
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:06,480
just trying to save other people's lives

1054
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:16,320
selflessly so shout out to them hey can

1055
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:18,480
we get a bong rip they're down what are

1056
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,609
you smoking on Sam

1057
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,769
tangey you like it the tangi a lot

1058
00:49:23,608 --> 00:49:35,130
lately higher that's just that jab

1059
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:37,170
around both tangi is very popular out

1060
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,460
here in California right now and of

1061
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,440
course they're mixing that with now

1062
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,309
everything and you've got all kinds of

1063
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,510
different strains coming out from it so

1064
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:47,789
which of course comes from the Cali oh

1065
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:51,530
and yeah so it's interesting to see all

1066
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:54,300
these different sounds good you know

1067
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:56,700
people should try to get not only the

1068
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:00,030
taste they like but the effects a like

1069
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:02,730
then I would also suggest in the

1070
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:06,750
strength they prefer because you can

1071
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:11,000
smoke smaller amounts to adjust but it's

1072
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:11,000
nice if you can get what

1073
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:26,309
right now I'm smoking some fresh off the

1074
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:31,440
bud good guy out of SoCal some og

1075
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:36,799
lemonade live resin fresh the bird yeah

1076
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:38,940
yeah his uh as you can see it's uh I

1077
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,220
want to start competing with this

1078
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:47,010
company I'm gonna start one called fresh

1079
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:50,339
from the bud pretty much smoking some

1080
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:57,140
West Coast concentrates bubble hash what

1081
00:50:50,340 --> 00:51:03,210
flavor there D is purple crush PK

1082
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:06,509
because she's the popular yes a while

1083
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:14,159
ago a good one heard of any new strains

1084
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:18,150
out and Amsterdam their Sam semi-retired

1085
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,949
and not really very active so III hear

1086
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,690
about him when people bringing to my

1087
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:23,509
attention but I'm not out there looking

1088
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:26,550
like I used to

1089
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:31,220
gadget yeah you said your finger on the

1090
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:31,220
pulse always that's why I was asking I

1091
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:40,590
mean now there's just these multi poly

1092
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:45,329
complex hybrids that you know they're

1093
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:49,320
they're so complicated they're genetic

1094
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:52,230
backgrounds that and they everybody just

1095
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:54,180
takes really really really good female

1096
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:59,550
clones and crosses them with other

1097
00:51:54,179 --> 00:52:02,879
really really really good that that

1098
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:05,070
seems to be the fastest way to achieve

1099
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,809
something that's probably going to be

1100
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:12,750
really really really good yeah we live

1101
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:14,250
in definitely a very poly world well it

1102
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:16,860
was interesting to see it I would love

1103
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:19,170
to fully originally we're doing testing

1104
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:24,570
it was so interesting to see how very

1105
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:28,650
close and ratios of course all these

1106
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:31,230
cannabis were that I would say that 96%

1107
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:33,440
of them all had very similar profiles of

1108
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:36,119
THC

1109
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,920
two other ratio so we didn't really have

1110
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,568
terpene testing originally and I would

1111
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,579
love to see that in comparison cuz you

1112
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:45,329
know that's the difference between each

1113
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:49,170
one of those strains when you grow a

1114
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:52,289
hundred plants from some modern pop poly

1115
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:56,900
multi complex hybrid you've got a

1116
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:59,759
hundred plants the I sorry you're that

1117
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:04,460
one expression you're you're gonna get a

1118
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:07,380
diverse selection of expression and

1119
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,630
that's a fun part selecting and finding

1120
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,440
out which one of those is the the

1121
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,660
reigning champ

1122
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,869
you know because usually just gone off

1123
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:18,118
of vigor you know or you know how fast

1124
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:20,220
it grew its strength its overall health

1125
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,050
you know as opposed to growing out I

1126
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:24,568
mean have you ever did you ever go out

1127
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:26,310
every hundred one of those and try every

1128
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:28,769
single hundred of them to figure out

1129
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:30,420
which profile was bass or you what did

1130
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:37,429
you do for your selection just off of

1131
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:40,559
smell taste well in the beginning I used

1132
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:42,980
how bigger estimate was because if it

1133
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:47,849
wasn't vigorous I wasn't so interested

1134
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:51,449
but also smell flavor resin production

1135
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:54,210
flower to leaf ratio and you know really

1136
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:56,489
important things like the effect and

1137
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:58,349
they were all shaped by your palate cuz

1138
00:53:56,489 --> 00:54:00,449
you even said you went toward the more

1139
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:04,859
sweeter as opposed to the more of the

1140
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:09,598
same amount I but I was also selecting

1141
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:14,779
not just for myself but yes in general I

1142
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,780
used my values of the judgments yes

1143
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,909
because there's all kinds of strains

1144
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,910
that have been lost that are different

1145
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:26,129
you know flavor profiles that you know

1146
00:54:23,909 --> 00:54:27,690
and this is just the reality of just you

1147
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,880
know farming as you were saying you know

1148
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:32,659
it's it's a lot of experimentation as

1149
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,670
long as you have the genes for that

1150
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:39,078
cannabinoid which I don't see that as a

1151
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,079
problem they're all out there

1152
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,519
and as long as you have the genes for

1153
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,760
the particular terpene synthases

1154
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:53,550
only 150 that we've ID'd in cannabis so

1155
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:56,490
far then you can breed any chemical

1156
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:58,859
profile combination of a particular

1157
00:54:56,489 --> 00:55:02,009
cannabinoid profile matched with the

1158
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:07,289
particular Turner P bro it's just a

1159
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:09,240
matter of doing the work and things like

1160
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:12,000
patient surveys like you were talking

1161
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:14,969
about that gives a kind of feedback for

1162
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,309
what particular group of cannabinoids

1163
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:20,189
or cannabinoids work best with which

1164
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:22,828
carpets for which medical indications

1165
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,450
and it's a combination

1166
00:55:22,829 --> 00:55:26,670
what's that information is available

1167
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:33,598
then breeders can target that

1168
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:36,809
combination so start your germination

1169
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,079
people get your seeds going find this

1170
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:41,250
genetics mm-hmm find what works because

1171
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,990
you know that's a great thing we all

1172
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,989
have different flavors and we all have

1173
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:47,818
different flavor tastes so I'm excited

1174
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:50,098
to see what's gonna happen when these

1175
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:53,039
you know with these legal markets and as

1176
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:55,559
these different type of aspects of

1177
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,199
genetics come online of you know this

1178
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,929
next generation that you know puts

1179
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:05,608
forward I'm very excited to see over the

1180
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:08,940
horizon cannabis wise because it's gonna

1181
00:56:05,608 --> 00:56:13,108
go all kinds of directions not only from

1182
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:16,559
the different states but also from you

1183
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:19,259
know different international countries I

1184
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,269
I can't wait till it's legal worldwide

1185
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:26,550
and it's just like buying a bottle of

1186
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:29,639
wine from which you can count from 100

1187
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:32,310
150 different countries easy oh I'd love

1188
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:39,299
to order my turban from South Africa oh

1189
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:42,328
absolutely and yeah various other you

1190
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,400
know Jack's but as well Sam though I

1191
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:46,769
mean how many of these old-world

1192
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,559
genetics are still out there that are

1193
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:51,630
being you know I mean there's small X in

1194
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:53,630
the world they're still patches of but

1195
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:56,630
they had the best chance

1196
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:59,720
find some pure for example Durban South

1197
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:02,990
African genetics would be there I mean

1198
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:06,230
I've got some but I'm sure there are

1199
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:10,489
people there and they can grow it in the

1200
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:13,338
best way for that area so that they can

1201
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:16,538
produce in other words it'll be like

1202
00:57:13,338 --> 00:57:19,278
boutique cannabis produced for export

1203
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:21,319
not like the way it used to be but way

1204
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:23,210
better right because they've been

1205
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:24,380
growing it already for generations so

1206
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:27,440
they already know what they're using

1207
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:30,380
conventional genetics right but I mean

1208
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,210
I'm I'm curious as to how much of those

1209
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,769
traditional genetics are still out there

1210
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:36,380
because we know that the world's been

1211
00:57:33,768 --> 00:57:38,858
flood with these quasi euro kali

1212
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:43,190
genetics over the past couple of decades

1213
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:45,288
absolutely true and and till cannabis is

1214
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:48,858
really legal we can't answer that

1215
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:50,269
because nobody knows for sure right and

1216
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:51,920
that has to be that research and that

1217
00:57:50,268 --> 00:57:54,500
gene mapping to actually break that

1218
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,858
although the worst obvious examples of

1219
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:01,309
what you're talking about is Mexico

1220
00:57:56,858 --> 00:58:04,130
Jamaica Morocco those three they're so

1221
00:58:01,309 --> 00:58:07,099
flooded I don't think you can find any

1222
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:10,309
untouched land race genetics from those

1223
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:14,109
three countries its unless somebody took

1224
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:16,640
it as it

1225
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:19,639
what about Thailand or Indonesia or

1226
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:21,889
somewhere like that well III don't think

1227
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:24,768
it's as bad but probably the worst

1228
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:27,710
actually is Morocco because in Morocco

1229
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:31,338
they don't call nails they allow males

1230
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:34,519
to pollinate because they produced and

1231
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:37,308
all of it is seeded so that means any

1232
00:58:34,518 --> 00:58:38,919
male introduction gets spread through

1233
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:45,710
the community within a few years

1234
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:48,349
everywhere the first generation it's

1235
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:52,480
pure male pollen from an important

1236
00:58:48,349 --> 00:58:55,430
genetic the second year there's

1237
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:59,028
thousands of plants that are half that

1238
00:58:55,429 --> 00:59:01,788
foreign genetic and the third generation

1239
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:03,858
there's millions of plants that are a

1240
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:05,660
quarter of that genetic so it gets

1241
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:07,608
through the whole population one thing I

1242
00:59:05,659 --> 00:59:11,318
I doubt you can fine

1243
00:59:07,608 --> 00:59:14,838
untouched land races in Morocco it just

1244
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:18,108
it's doesn't does it wouldn't be like

1245
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:19,998
Jacobi ether it doesn't seem like it

1246
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:22,009
would be so it's the same way for you

1247
00:59:19,998 --> 00:59:24,048
know people have always asked if I could

1248
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:25,429
like go to Maui do you ever see real

1249
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:27,318
Maui Wowi is like I don't think there

1250
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:29,239
ever was real Maui Wowi and if it was

1251
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:31,248
it's been eradicated a long time ago

1252
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:33,650
from you know the helicopters and

1253
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:35,899
harassment so all that's there is what's

1254
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:39,170
brought to the islands you know that's

1255
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:43,249
just the reality of the situation and

1256
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:45,650
those matter the county there's a lot of

1257
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:49,608
commercial production except for medical

1258
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:52,039
in Hawaii now there used to be but

1259
00:59:49,608 --> 00:59:55,369
there's I mean there was enough

1260
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:59,059
marijuana that who I was support in the

1261
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:02,390
in the late sixties early seventies they

1262
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:05,380
were an exporting but yeah it's reversed

1263
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:08,358
and it's they're an important country

1264
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:11,059
area they were so they wanted to make

1265
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:13,219
itself to the turret yeah everybody I

1266
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:16,729
know that was local before the the

1267
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:20,539
medical that they have growing I mean

1268
01:00:16,728 --> 01:00:23,899
just gross and very small one to outdoor

1269
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:26,119
tops and couple plants indoor tops

1270
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:29,749
because you know they have to discretion

1271
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:33,380
is key and they still fly helicopters or

1272
01:00:29,748 --> 01:00:36,828
their government staff legally and in

1273
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:40,369
Hawaii you give them your GPS address

1274
01:00:36,829 --> 01:00:42,079
whether you're allowed to grow five or

1275
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:47,680
something you have to tell them the

1276
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:50,690
location and Ali did yes correct now and

1277
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,159
I know that there's I want to go in

1278
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,469
December I hope to check out the

1279
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:58,399
facility there in Maui go through

1280
01:00:54,469 --> 01:01:00,139
they're producing but I think there

1281
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,318
already had just a short production run

1282
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:06,078
and they already ran out so it's one of

1283
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:09,288
those initial situations that we've seen

1284
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,509
way when you they've got vertically

1285
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:14,299
integrated setups like that that it

1286
01:01:11,509 --> 01:01:17,088
takes time for the grow to catch up to

1287
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:18,708
the consumer so it's definitely they're

1288
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:20,978
going through that growing pain as we

1289
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,978
speak

1290
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:27,990
well I used to in the early 70s I

1291
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:30,869
thought Hawaiian

1292
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:35,309
and the reason was was because they were

1293
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:39,559
using narrowly drug genetics in Hawaii

1294
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:42,329
and was some really really really

1295
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:45,599
interesting psychedelic trippy tech

1296
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:47,130
cannabis but that that's cannabis and

1297
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,839
again that was brought to the island

1298
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:53,510
there doesn't seem to be any type of was

1299
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:56,070
it quiet variety snow grown in Hawaii by

1300
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:58,380
you know people who would bet on the

1301
01:01:56,070 --> 01:02:01,140
hash trail and stuff and pretty much any

1302
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:03,059
cannabis from Maui was just called Maui

1303
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:06,000
Wowi correct it wasn't necessarily the

1304
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:06,960
same I would not be surprised if that

1305
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,570
was true for sure

1306
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,789
yeah it's that's the rumor I've been

1307
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:13,980
told because again they were growing you

1308
01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:16,590
know I have artists renditions I even

1309
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:19,050
have one here for artists thing for Maui

1310
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:24,200
gold you know Molly's finest cannabis

1311
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:28,320
grown on that mountain Haleakala and its

1312
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:31,139
hold on here it's being brought over and

1313
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:36,300
it's it's just it's from the 70s it's

1314
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:47,759
kind of a it's just one of those it's a

1315
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:50,010
print so yeah that's one of those crazy

1316
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,420
things fine Canada set apart for the

1317
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:56,070
price harvester done on slopes of

1318
01:02:51,420 --> 01:03:00,269
Haleakala yeah they just it was more of

1319
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:01,890
just advertising and and just things

1320
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:04,199
like that it wasn't any type of specific

1321
01:03:01,889 --> 01:03:06,089
genetic from even people that I've

1322
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:10,169
talked to they were just as you stated

1323
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:11,610
Sam they were long leaf equatorial

1324
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:13,800
genetics that were brought to the

1325
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,700
islands and grown apparently very well

1326
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,220
it grew

1327
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:19,980
you know those equatorial 's apparently

1328
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:23,899
yeah because they're resistant to the

1329
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:27,000
kind of problems that you get in wet hot

1330
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:29,809
earth photo period environment and them

1331
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,460
sure a lot of them did super nice and

1332
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:33,869
how would you rate the quality at

1333
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,880
cannabis because you got

1334
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:38,609
you had tried some of that Maui back in

1335
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,910
the day yes oh yeah I thought some of it

1336
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:43,740
was almost as good as the haze almost as

1337
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:47,609
good as the best Thai sticks it was

1338
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:49,889
really really really good excellent

1339
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:51,150
yeah the first time I saw Thai stick so

1340
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:57,029
I didn't believe that was actually

1341
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:59,760
canvas will grow Hayes and his hybrids

1342
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:02,580
in Hawaii two that came out really

1343
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,640
really really nice they didn't want to

1344
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:08,429
grow super big giant plants because they

1345
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:09,869
didn't wanna Thebes to see it they

1346
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:12,149
weren't afraid of the police because

1347
01:04:09,869 --> 01:04:14,339
they were legal under that program but

1348
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:17,010
they could only grow I think it was five

1349
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:19,760
plants or something but yeah they they

1350
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:21,840
thought the quality came out super nice

1351
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:26,870
here's somebody if they won't they want

1352
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:32,820
to see this again the the marigold so I

1353
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:35,789
got this in place of that I started

1354
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:37,950
smoking that yes it's Einstein holding a

1355
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:41,369
pipe which if he was you know tobacco

1356
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:44,669
pipe but yeah it's definitely I picked

1357
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:48,139
that up ten years ago and Maui and PI oh

1358
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:50,940
yeah no I understand went to Maui yeah

1359
01:04:48,139 --> 01:04:53,789
yeah you know it was this place to hang

1360
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:57,840
out over the guilt of the atomic bomb I

1361
01:04:53,789 --> 01:05:01,409
guess who knows I don't think he's ever

1362
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:03,390
been there but of course somebody will

1363
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:05,670
produce a picture of him in Hawaii and I

1364
01:05:03,389 --> 01:05:12,190
you know with a lay around his neck and

1365
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:14,500
some Bermuda shorts I

1366
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:17,470
all stunned over your bone pipe last

1367
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:21,480
week there Sam I have to say that was

1368
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:25,118
definitely the mic drop of the month for

1369
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:28,420
quite a few people who have the very top

1370
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:31,539
half of a human skull and they use it

1371
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:34,210
for you you know when you break up buds

1372
01:05:31,539 --> 01:05:36,818
you make the joint with passion and weed

1373
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:39,369
or with passion tobacco some Europeans

1374
01:05:36,818 --> 01:05:43,559
do and they have like a little a hash

1375
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:46,920
bowl that they use well the heat is

1376
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:56,199
these a kissing skull as a rolling tray

1377
01:05:46,920 --> 01:06:01,240
yeah but it's a rolling bowl yeah that's

1378
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:05,019
a whole other level a whole other level

1379
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:09,449
that's yeah that that's some hunter s

1380

they were all either a polar Trebek yeah

1382
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:25,000
I've seen Tibetan monks that have you

1383
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:27,068
know the knuckle necklaces that are

1384
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,710
carved into little skulls they actually

1385
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:31,779
take the knuckles from the dead monks

1386
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:34,690
and actually carve them into skulls and

1387
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:40,839
make them into I guess kind of prayer

1388
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:42,818
beads I guess you've seen that as well I

1389
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:47,710
saw that kind of stuff when I was there

1390
01:06:42,818 --> 01:06:48,759
I liked the Nepali people and the

1391
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:55,269
Tibetan people

1392
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:58,390
I like them too very interesting had to

1393
01:06:55,269 --> 01:07:01,239
be kind of culturals you know submersion

1394
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:04,179
that you were in but to look around and

1395
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:07,328
see all that eat with the Tibetans I was

1396
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:10,739
dealing with were in Ladakh which is

1397
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:14,500
what's commonly called Indian Tibet and

1398
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:18,848
China got most of Tibet but part of

1399
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:22,059
Tibet was the Indians took control of

1400
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:26,140
and that's but but capital city is leh

1401
01:07:22,059 --> 01:07:28,088
and it's Ladakh and yeah it was

1402
01:07:26,139 --> 01:07:30,489
very very Tibetan when me and my wife

1403
01:07:28,088 --> 01:07:32,349
went there but now I've heard there's

1404
01:07:30,489 --> 01:07:34,118
more and more and more Indian business

1405
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:37,630
people you know moving up there to

1406
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:41,559
control the this is a lot of torment

1407
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:44,260
it's unbelievable place if you ever get

1408
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:46,869
a chance to visit but don't don't go if

1409
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:49,079
you are expecting a lot of

1410
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:52,809
infrastructure what they've got is just

1411
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:55,240
age-old tradition it's Tibetan and it's

1412
01:07:52,809 --> 01:08:01,390
not screwed over the way it has been in

1413
01:07:55,239 --> 01:08:04,899
China by yeah China would say just to

1414

1441
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:58,369
this is my cat scotch captured a bird

1442
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:59,539
just today or last night some time and I

1443
01:09:58,369 --> 01:10:01,880
come up my hallway and there's some

1444
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:04,729
feathers in the floor and I might go and

1445
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,199
catch another burden here to eat I'm

1446
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:07,699
looking for the carcass and there's no

1447
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:08,630
carcass so I'm thinking they ate the

1448
01:10:07,699 --> 01:10:11,059
whole thing and they're just the

1449
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:12,710
feathers leftover couple hours later I'm

1450
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,870
looking on my windowsill in the kitchen

1451
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:16,010
getting a drink for making my coffee and

1452
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:18,680
there's a little bird on my windowsill

1453
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:20,600
hiding behind the vitamins so I grabbed

1454
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:23,450
a towel and I grab this I put it over

1455
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,430
the thing and I move the vitamins out so

1456
01:10:23,449 --> 01:10:27,019
delicately so nicely they save this

1457
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:29,150
little bird I can feel a little

1458
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,290
heartbeat just pounding away in the

1459
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:32,359
cloth and the towel

1460
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:34,010
I bring him outside halfway down my

1461
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:36,619
driveway to the tail end in my trunk and

1462
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:39,140
I put him on the back of the truck and a

1463
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:40,789
little [ __ ] [ __ ] flies directly back

1464
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,250
into the [ __ ] Lois it goes and hides

1465
01:10:40,789 --> 01:10:46,279
behind the couch it's like you're free

1466
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:47,659
man [ __ ] so now I can't find him you

1467
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:49,759
can't get him on from under the couch

1468
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:52,460
and the cats are gonna probably eat them

1469
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,119
so mother nature is running its course

1470
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:58,909
once again natural selection happening

1471
01:10:56,119 --> 01:11:02,599
it is I tried to save it man it was

1472
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:04,399
saying right back in that's why you got

1473
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:08,090
to close the door behind you when you go

1474
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:09,739
outside what's the first thing I just

1475
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:12,650
had him in the towel oh I just wanted to

1476
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:15,199
get him out there yeah that reminds yeah

1477
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:17,389
I had my own that reminds me I was like

1478
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:20,479
11 years old and I caught us caught a

1479
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:22,490
garter snake and it was wrapped around

1480
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:27,889
my arm and I brought it into the kitchen

1481
01:11:22,489 --> 01:11:32,800
and my mom was asleep and I'm I get I

1482
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:33,969
got a jar and I got its tail in and I

1483
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,829
tried

1484
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:38,769
throw its head down and then put the cap

1485
01:11:35,828 --> 01:11:42,939
on and it just springs straight out of

1486
01:11:38,769 --> 01:11:46,300
the jar goes right behind everything on

1487
01:11:42,939 --> 01:11:48,219
the counter and I'm just frantically you

1488
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:50,380
know looking for it I was like just grab

1489
01:11:48,219 --> 01:11:52,210
it I turn around and there's my mom with

1490
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:57,099
her arms aren't what the hell are you do

1491
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:59,319
I have a snake in the house you brought

1492
01:11:57,099 --> 01:12:01,659
a snake in there oh yeah so what you

1493
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:03,609
should have said was you found a snake

1494
01:12:01,658 --> 01:12:05,319
in your house and you wanted to get rid

1495
01:12:03,609 --> 01:12:07,630
of it so your mom wouldn't get up to

1496
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:10,658
that I wasn't that bright in the moment

1497
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:13,779
back then I was I was a deer in the

1498
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:15,728
headlights I was like I was a good

1499
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:19,599
little Catholic boy so you know I

1500
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:36,639
confessed immediately I was yeah I

1501
01:12:19,599 --> 01:12:39,550
learned a lighter that's y'all knew you

1502
01:12:36,639 --> 01:12:43,090
couldn't last without us I like the

1503
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:45,038
picture of bubble man it kind of looks

1504
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:50,229
like he's pointing this finger down that

1505
01:12:45,038 --> 01:12:52,268
you saying don't tell lies well I

1506
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:52,989
learned that along you know you know in

1507
01:12:52,269 --> 01:12:55,539
my adulthood

1508
01:12:52,988 --> 01:12:57,218
you know don't lie that way you don't

1509
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:59,469
have to cover up your own tracks you

1510
01:12:57,219 --> 01:13:02,050
don't have to remember what you said you

1511
01:12:59,469 --> 01:13:03,849
know it's one of those life lessons you

1512
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:07,479
know this little white lies sometimes

1513
01:13:03,849 --> 01:13:10,659
you have to say in life but you know in

1514
01:13:07,479 --> 01:13:16,150
the short term lies are better or easier

1515
01:13:10,658 --> 01:13:17,589
but in the long the truth is yeah you

1516
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,058
gotta always play the long game in that

1517
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:24,610
result you know you're only selling

1518
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:25,659
yourself short well who the hell wants

1519
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:27,339
to be deceived

1520
01:13:25,658 --> 01:13:29,589
I mean how lame is that let's just

1521
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:31,328
deceive our friends in the play the

1522
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,190
American public apparently like it

1523
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:34,768
because look what we keep electing you

1524
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:37,859
know we keep electing the fools and

1525
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:41,729
people go to Las Vegas

1526
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:41,728
that's what is it for

1527
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:54,250
what is it for to be deceived you mean

1528
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,250
that's not really the Eiffel Tower

1529
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:08,979
you're on mute there

1530
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:10,679
bubbleman that pen looks really good man

1531
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:15,399
how's it working

1532
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:17,139
dude it's delicious I gotta say and you

1533
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:19,059
Jam like a ridiculous amount of terpenes

1534
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:23,980
into like any type of cannabinoid

1535
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:26,679
mixture and inhale it it's generally

1536
01:14:23,979 --> 01:14:28,839
gonna taste pretty now we sold out of

1537
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:31,270

1538
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:36,880

friends actually we beans and then they

1540
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,119
filled them up with roses so they we

1541
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:43,029
were actually selling rosin filled pens

1542
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:45,460
at my booth but really it was them

1543
01:14:43,029 --> 01:14:46,719
selling Rafi fill bullpens but I'd just

1544
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,639
like to be a part of that I like

1545
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,469
watching people come up and you know we

1546
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:51,909
I'd watch them like get it going and

1547
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:59,069
kind of teach them how to use it and

1548
01:14:51,908 --> 01:14:59,069
that was really exciting it's a repeat

1549
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,928

01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:09,719
will not be here I will be sitting in my

1594
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:15,789
seats in the stadium in New Orleans so I

1595
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:18,789
will not be able to be on board so I'll

1596
01:17:15,789 --> 01:17:20,859
miss you it that's all good I'll be back

1597
01:17:18,789 --> 01:17:28,840
the week after for sure and continue

1598
01:17:20,859 --> 01:17:30,519
onward it goes to New Orleans well the

1599
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,219
one behind it is what we're concerned

1600
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,770
about and the one behind that as well so

1601
01:17:33,219 --> 01:17:38,829
we're keeping an eye and that's happened

1602
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:41,530
before that's happen to me for Katrina I

1603
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:44,350
actually bought actually my sister and

1604
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:47,800
her kids and myself tickets to that game

1605
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:49,510
and I had to cancel the game so if that

1606
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,389
was the reality I still have those

1607
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:54,969
tickets by the way and that's just the

1608
01:17:52,389 --> 01:17:57,279
reality of being from the south is you

1609
01:17:54,969 --> 01:17:59,500
know when hurricanes happen you cancel

1610
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:02,349
you don't fight the system you can't

1611
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:05,050
fight the system mother end of story so

1612
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:07,900
if that happens then I will be here you

1613
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:10,869
know for sure next week I won't fly out

1614
01:18:07,899 --> 01:18:12,399

1615
01:18:10,868 --> 01:18:16,779

1617
01:18:16,779 --> 01:18:22,779
that's a opportunity for me to be here

1618
01:18:18,789 --> 01:18:26,260
then I'll enjoy that as well but I yeah

1619
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:28,809
these hurricanes are just man that that

1620
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:30,289
that I mean harvey was bad enough for

1621
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:31,880
houston i mean

1622
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:34,729
there's no municipality I know could

1623
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:37,750
survive four foot of water falling on it

1624
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:40,189
I mean anywhere much less now you know

1625
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:42,979
or am i coming right behind which is

1626
01:18:40,189 --> 01:18:45,739
just absolutely devastated the Bahamas I

1627
01:18:42,979 --> 01:18:48,309
mean beyond some some places beyond

1628
01:18:45,739 --> 01:18:50,569
recognition I saw a video today of

1629
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:52,910
somebody on a beach in the Bahamas and

1630
01:18:50,569 --> 01:18:55,639
there's no water at the beach they had

1631
01:18:52,909 --> 01:18:59,479
literally the storm had sucked all the

1632
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:02,660
water four miles off the Atlantic

1633
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:04,759
completely so it's just the amount of

1634
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:07,449
force that that thing is generating and

1635
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:10,190
the strength it's not even funny so I

1636
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:12,489
have people that are actually in the

1637
01:19:10,189 --> 01:19:14,869
path of that so I send my love and I

1638
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:17,420
wish the best for you because people

1639
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:20,149
can't afford to get out that's the

1640
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:22,279
reality and I wish them nothing but the

1641
01:19:20,149 --> 01:19:25,969
best and we got other ones right behind

1642
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:27,590
that so I don't know how after seeing

1643
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:29,690
these storms that are considered

1644
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:32,900
once-in-a-lifetime once in a century

1645
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:36,979
we've had five of them in the last you

1646
01:19:32,899 --> 01:19:38,420
know 10 years or so I before humans or

1647
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:40,309
at least Americans who deny climate

1648
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:42,739
change start to believe that we're

1649
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:45,560
actually having effect on the reality

1650
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:47,239
that we're seeing and I can't see with

1651
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:52,000
this type of evidence out there that

1652
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:53,769
people still deny it it's amazing

1653
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,029
doc it's got to be absolutely

1654
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:58,640
dumbfounding for you to mean it from a

1655
01:19:56,029 --> 01:20:01,969
man of science to watch constant denial

1656
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:04,940
of actual science replicated science and

1657
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:07,930
for them to go off of [ __ ] papers

1658
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:13,009
that have actually been debunked to

1659
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:16,539
continue to deny a man's influence on on

1660
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:20,720
its on the weather that's happening is I

1661
01:20:16,539 --> 01:20:22,970
don't get it yeah by Senators who states

1662
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:27,980
need billions of dollars in government

1663
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:30,619
aid right but it's a it's amazing

1664
01:20:27,979 --> 01:20:33,669
well not amazing but imagine if there

1665
01:20:30,619 --> 01:20:38,689
would have been a cannabis industry in

1666
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:42,670
Houston I mean it would it if there was

1667
01:20:38,689 --> 01:20:47,719
an industry like cannabis on the

1668
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:51,440
in industrial areas of you know large

1669
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:53,569
cities like Houston like it is in Denver

1670
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:56,899
it would have been completely wiped out

1671
01:20:53,569 --> 01:20:59,380
Oh hands down there's no way I could

1672
01:20:56,899 --> 01:21:03,738
survive the week without light

1673
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:06,050
no way well just all the water and then

1674
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:09,319
the you know the water is filled with

1675
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:11,029
all kinds of runoff and toxins and it

1676
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:14,750
would basically just wipe out your

1677
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:18,289
entire crop and you'd lose you know a

1678
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:20,420
lot of equipment and your facilities

1679
01:21:18,289 --> 01:21:24,828
would just become completely fouled with

1680
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:26,719
all that mucky water yeah I mean you see

1681
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:29,569
what what people are doing is they're

1682
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:32,059
coming in and you know gutting their

1683
01:21:29,569 --> 01:21:34,578
house at the water line right so you see

1684
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:36,860
everyone removing their there the

1685
01:21:34,578 --> 01:21:40,609
sheetrock and I guess it would be a good

1686
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:43,368
time to be georgia-pacific selling

1687
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:46,299
sheetrock her Louisiana these sheetrock

1688
01:21:43,368 --> 01:21:49,670
companies are probably making a bundle

1689
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:51,529
but you'd have to imagine again that you

1690
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:55,489
know like with a something as

1691
01:21:51,529 --> 01:21:58,309
devastating as this I mean it's like not

1692
01:21:55,488 --> 01:22:00,078
only something like this like if this

1693
01:21:58,309 --> 01:22:02,900
were to happen if there were cannabis

1694
01:22:00,078 --> 01:22:05,238
industry in there all the people who

1695
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:09,500
work there while right away their houses

1696
01:22:05,238 --> 01:22:11,689
are flooded right their jobs are

1697
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:14,149
basically on hold right because they're

1698
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:17,058
whole you know operations is completely

1699
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:18,939
fun I mean your whole life is just

1700
01:22:17,059 --> 01:22:23,469
completely devastated

1701
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:26,629
just because of a hurricane and you know

1702
01:22:23,469 --> 01:22:28,550
and then out in Oregon you know I mean

1703
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:31,670
the whole states on fire for Christ's

1704
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:34,400
sakes it's unbelievable I mean we're

1705
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:37,399
gonna find again someone had made this

1706
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:40,460
comment and chat earlier that outdoor

1707
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:42,439
Oregon and in 2017 is going to be the

1708
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:47,420
year of the concentrate because

1709
01:22:42,439 --> 01:22:51,979
everyone's gonna have to distill there's

1710
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:54,989
stuff to make it not smoky I mean III

1711
01:22:51,979 --> 01:22:57,419
don't know what the impact of follow the

1712
01:22:54,988 --> 01:22:59,868
all the smoke in the air is going to be

1713
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:06,090
on on these these plants but um

1714
01:22:59,868 --> 01:23:07,738
certainly all the ash good thing not

1715
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:10,078
good yeah we were talking about before

1716
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:12,839
you came on Doc it was half without the

1717
01:23:10,078 --> 01:23:14,698
smoke in the ash and it not only you

1718
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:17,130
know coats the plants but also you know

1719
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:20,638
coats to the rosin you know and that

1720
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:23,038
that you know it you can taste it you

1721
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,920
have actually if anybody has smoked

1722
01:23:23,038 --> 01:23:27,509
cannabis that's been around a fire you

1723
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,849
can taste it I mean there's no doubt

1724
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:35,039
about it it alters the flavor and

1725
01:23:29,849 --> 01:23:36,748
everything so it's very I as Sam was

1726
01:23:35,038 --> 01:23:40,649
saying and unfortunate reality is you

1727
01:23:36,748 --> 01:23:42,510
know it's not good cannabis and that's

1728
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:47,118
just the reality of farming you know

1729
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:49,710
it's you've lost that year yeah is it

1730
01:23:47,118 --> 01:23:52,558
translated into the concentrates that

1731
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:54,538
you make from it to like you say you

1732
01:23:52,559 --> 01:23:57,719
didn't taste it in the cannabis is that

1733
01:23:54,538 --> 01:24:00,509
like smoking flour but you know your

1734
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:02,698
tree yeah because it gets them that gets

1735
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:04,829
in the glands you know and it stores it

1736
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:07,288
doesn't stay and I mean if it does stay

1737
01:24:04,828 --> 01:24:08,788
I mean the plant continues to build

1738
01:24:07,288 --> 01:24:14,399
around it so it's actually inside the

1739
01:24:08,788 --> 01:24:15,059
crystals themselves correct Sam it's no

1740
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:19,828
bueno

1741
01:24:15,059 --> 01:24:21,840
yeah it's no bueno that's with it in

1742
01:24:19,828 --> 01:24:24,960
Jamaica often they try to dry herb

1743
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:29,869
around fires and certain people do it

1744
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,868
and it's like you just smoke out the bud

1745
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:37,729
what's that sin I said it's a no-no

1746
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:49,019
enough said it's a no-no it's bad and

1747
01:24:47,029 --> 01:24:50,908
unfortunately as we're saying you know

1748
01:24:49,019 --> 01:24:53,309
the entire western United States is on

1749
01:24:50,908 --> 01:24:55,198
fire right now now as well as I mean

1750
01:24:53,309 --> 01:24:57,960
you're dealing with that all up in DC I

1751
01:24:55,198 --> 01:25:02,038
mean fires are going like mad out there

1752
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:03,658
as well right all right the whole

1753
01:25:02,038 --> 01:25:06,800
province seems to be on fire right now

1754
01:25:03,658 --> 01:25:14,659
and I can't imagine it not affecting

1755
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:17,150
damn near everyone's crop so is it just

1756
01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:18,800
dry right now is our rains not coming

1757
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:28,489
through is that why it's continuing to

1758
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:30,170
burn up their pine beetle kill yeah see

1759
01:25:28,489 --> 01:25:33,319
we have that problem here in California

1760
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:35,840
from the last year's drought there's

1761
01:25:33,319 --> 01:25:38,539
millions of trees throughout the Sierras

1762
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:40,340
right now that are just dead they're

1763
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:42,319
trying to cut them out I mean you can

1764
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:45,409
literally see them brown against the

1765
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:47,840
green all summer long and it's so

1766
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:49,569
spotted without you could see why you

1767
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:52,670
know something like that would continue

1768
01:25:49,569 --> 01:25:55,579
and why there's such you know kindling

1769
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:57,470
out there for these fires but I hate to

1770
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:59,029
hear of you know that type of beetle

1771
01:25:57,470 --> 01:26:02,810
breakout that's cause I mean that's

1772
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:05,090
you're losing tons of forests mother

1773
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:06,620
nature's doing a purge that forest needs

1774
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:10,159
to regrow and everything because it's

1775
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:12,489
dead now but it's just unfortunate

1776
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:16,519
there's human populations in the path

1777
01:26:12,489 --> 01:26:18,469
without sort of stuff like I drove from

1778
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:22,760
that goo right up to Prince George and

1779
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:25,340
fir about six seven hundred kilometres

1780
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:28,520
it was so smoky you couldn't see the

1781
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:30,260
valley you know a bunch of miles ahead

1782
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,330
Ian because the smoke would cover the

1783
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:34,369
mountains and then of both the last

1784
01:26:32,329 --> 01:26:39,229
hundred or sold two hundred kilometers

1785
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:41,059
it cleared up but it also caught up this

1786
01:26:39,229 --> 01:26:43,099
way I'd say the whole province was the

1787
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:46,010
lower province was hit for sure with all

1788
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:47,900
the smoke I toward the upper province in

1789
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:49,970
the mid summer when all the fires were

1790
01:26:47,899 --> 01:26:51,769
happening and there was no fires up

1791
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:53,840
there and no smoke or anything had

1792
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:56,120
reached up there but there's no dad

1793
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,819
beetle kill up there it's all plush

1794
01:26:56,119 --> 01:27:02,210
beautiful green forest first far as you

1795
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:04,939
can see it's quite nice to see but down

1796
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:07,100
this way the lower province is just

1797
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:09,879
devastated with pine beetle kill and

1798
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,880
it's a matchbook

1799
01:27:13,219 --> 01:27:17,810
storms and you get one lightning strike

1800
01:27:14,779 --> 01:27:22,488
and it just goes yep that's look lights

1801
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:25,100
off and just [ __ ] rips it's it's

1802
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:27,738
killed a lot of wildlife the whole works

1803
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:33,230
devastated this whole province in one

1804
01:27:27,738 --> 01:27:36,879
way or another then you can do about

1805
01:27:33,229 --> 01:27:40,819
either just is what it is

1806
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:44,029
well hopefully it rains come through and

1807
01:27:40,819 --> 01:27:45,429
quiets it down there makes it a little

1808
01:27:44,029 --> 01:27:52,969
better

1809
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:57,170
damn beetles yeah pine beetle used to be

1810
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:58,969
cold enough that'd kill him but man-made

1811
01:27:57,170 --> 01:28:00,920
lakes and all that sort of stop has

1812
01:27:58,969 --> 01:28:02,659
changed weather patterns up here and

1813
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:07,090
everything so the winter winters are not

1814
01:28:02,659 --> 01:28:09,948
as long as well and of course the global

1815
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:13,699
changing pattern weather and all that

1816
01:28:09,948 --> 01:28:15,259
kind of stuff right as well we don't get

1817
01:28:13,698 --> 01:28:17,359
the winters like we used to get here

1818
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:19,480
even close not even close

1819
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:24,859
by Halloween we'd have snow that stayed

1820
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:30,439
right through till April you know we

1821
01:28:24,859 --> 01:28:38,630
have 20 to 40 below months two three

1822
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:43,719
months maybe sometimes but yeah this is

1823
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:48,800
so [ __ ] tasty and what flavor is that

1824
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:49,969
this one is the Viper with Jamaican Sour

1825
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,100
Diesel terpenes

1826
01:28:49,969 --> 01:28:54,760
but the really tasty one is at my booth

1827
01:28:52,100 --> 01:29:01,940
right now which is the where is my bike

1828
01:28:54,760 --> 01:29:03,860
no wooden swiss things yeah I like I

1829
01:29:01,939 --> 01:29:09,559
like just the name where is my bike I

1830
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:14,238
can't wait to try this string it sounds

1831
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:20,550
so it is so Amiga Haze it's a super old

1832
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:24,928
cut of an amnesia but some type of

1833
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:38,789
kushai think it was great

1834
01:29:24,929 --> 01:29:41,130
unique definitely nice but to say I wish

1835
01:29:38,789 --> 01:29:46,050
I had the news they usually would send

1836
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:48,210
me the ICRS news for some reason it's

1837
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:50,279
coming later in the day now so I don't

1838
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:51,658
get it to give all the update on what's

1839
01:29:50,279 --> 01:29:53,039
the latest stuff on the news because

1840
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:55,348
some people asked what's up

1841
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:56,519
so I'm sorry it just depends on when it

1842
01:29:55,349 --> 01:29:58,230
comes out when it comes out in early

1843
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,449
morning when we do the show I can

1844
01:29:58,229 --> 01:30:02,189
actually read it and but for some reason

1845
01:30:00,448 --> 01:30:11,368
it's coming out in the afternoons now so

1846
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:11,848
I don't have it sometimes that's how it

1847
01:30:11,368 --> 01:30:14,578
was

1848
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:21,300
yep exactly so I just try to go with the

1849
01:30:14,578 --> 01:30:25,649
flow of it that was why I guess we lost

1850
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:27,449
Wade yeah he texted me he said that he

1851
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:30,750
was having a hard time getting a

1852
01:30:27,448 --> 01:30:32,158
connection I'm running connections of

1853
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:37,529
it's spotty so it might make it more

1854
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:39,328
difficult for you guys not to sure you

1855
01:30:37,529 --> 01:30:42,859
do come in choppy but everybody else

1856
01:30:39,328 --> 01:30:48,868
seems to come in as normal

1857
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:51,868
Sam's as usual choppy self you guys are

1858
01:30:48,868 --> 01:30:54,649
usually pretty good for me well a fat at

1859
01:30:51,868 --> 01:30:56,969
home but well I still you know it was

1860
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:58,710
Natasha earlier was like oh maybe you

1861
01:30:56,969 --> 01:31:01,020
could just skip the day and I thought

1862
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:03,179
about us me I could skip it to Ava like

1863
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:05,400
a week before the three year anniversary

1864
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:07,739
when we've never missed a single day

1865
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:10,189
we're gonna take a day off before the

1866
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:10,189
three-year anniversary

1867
01:31:12,359 --> 01:31:24,098
uber and I raced back so this event what

1868
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:27,309
is the event you're at saris sundaes

1869
01:31:24,099 --> 01:31:29,889
karma cups so it is it's pretty roots

1870
01:31:27,309 --> 01:31:32,110
but I'll tell you you know like poor

1871
01:31:29,889 --> 01:31:34,868
Sara gets a lot of hate I mean I seen

1872
01:31:32,109 --> 01:31:38,139
one guy posting the other day hey lying

1873
01:31:34,868 --> 01:31:41,828
all the math and he's saying that so she

1874
01:31:38,139 --> 01:31:46,750
sold this many passes for for this much

1875
01:31:41,828 --> 01:31:49,149
money you know of these for this much

1876
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:51,340
money oh look at Mattie private it his

1877
01:31:49,149 --> 01:31:53,828
account that's funny and then added up

1878
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:55,900
like a million boxer half a million

1879
01:31:53,828 --> 01:31:57,009
marks are four hundred thousand dollars

1880
01:31:55,899 --> 01:31:58,750
and it's just you know people are trying

1881
01:31:57,010 --> 01:32:00,699
to make it seem like she's just killing

1882
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:03,130
it and crushing it when really she's so

1883
01:32:00,698 --> 01:32:05,288
stressed out there's so many logistics

1884
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:07,719
there's so much work and she's done a

1885
01:32:05,288 --> 01:32:09,488
good job in my opinion the venue is not

1886
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:10,210
the best venue in the world it's a it's

1887
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:11,888
a parking lot

1888
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:16,929
hole in the ground type of thing with

1889
01:32:11,889 --> 01:32:18,969
booths in it but she's bring there are

1890
01:32:16,929 --> 01:32:20,649
people rocking through this thing left

1891
01:32:18,969 --> 01:32:22,359
right and center weenie we're non-stop

1892
01:32:20,649 --> 01:32:25,538
for 10-plus hours yesterday we didn't

1893
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:29,348
get a break and that's home but because

1894
01:32:25,538 --> 01:32:30,670
there's Pat I barely know the size of a

1895
01:32:29,349 --> 01:32:32,369
parking lot maybe a half an acre a

1896
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:42,550
quarter of an acre even maybe smaller

1897
01:32:32,368 --> 01:32:44,319
but good well hey what's up like haters

1898
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:46,360
are always gonna hate but you know it

1899
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:49,299
costs and takes a lot of time and energy

1900
01:32:46,359 --> 01:32:51,038
and people don't realize the logistics I

1901
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,679
mean back when we would throw events I

1902
01:32:51,038 --> 01:32:55,479
mean just the cost of insurance alone we

1903
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,118
had just one event you had to have over

1904
01:32:55,479 --> 01:33:00,129
a million dollars in insurance just to

1905
01:32:58,118 --> 01:33:02,558
hold the event you know I'm saying so

1906
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:04,150
III don't get off where people start to

1907
01:33:02,559 --> 01:33:06,489
start throwing that type and unless

1908
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:08,769
they're actually on the inside and see

1909
01:33:06,488 --> 01:33:12,069
what actually goes down you'd be amazed

1910
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:14,739
how actually thin those margins actually

1911
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:17,170
are you know you know bubbleman but it's

1912
01:33:14,738 --> 01:33:19,118
it's amazing when I see people on the

1913
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:20,550
outside starts you know punching bag on

1914
01:33:19,118 --> 01:33:22,750
people and stuff like that it's just

1915
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:23,890
unfair unless you've actually done it

1916
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:26,770
and throwing these types

1917
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:28,990
things you know there's no need for you

1918
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:31,690
to comment just either go and enjoy and

1919
01:33:28,989 --> 01:33:34,599
rate the event for exactly what it is

1920
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:36,429
you know or isn't you know and if you

1921
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:39,789
don't like it go through your event you

1922
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:43,030
know people's energy in trying to do

1923
01:33:39,789 --> 01:33:44,800
something on their own event they wanted

1924
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:46,719
the event that someone else is throwing

1925
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,119
it's just like easier to criticize what

1926
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:52,740
people are doing and I spoke at the

1927
01:33:49,119 --> 01:33:55,180
normal part of the conference yesterday

1928
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:57,489
normally I spoke on a panel of growers

1929
01:33:55,180 --> 01:34:01,210
and we were just kind of talking about

1930
01:33:57,489 --> 01:34:04,659
that very thing and it's uh it's people

1931
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:06,640
yeah people are a bit funny I've

1932
01:34:04,659 --> 01:34:08,139
complained about access there's a

1933
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:10,869
hundred and fifty new stores that are

1934
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:13,119
gonna open up in Ontario to sell Canada

1935
01:34:10,869 --> 01:34:14,409
this and everyone's upset about it

1936
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:16,390
they're gonna call they're gonna control

1937
01:34:14,409 --> 01:34:18,039
intimate because like what they tried to

1938
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:19,960
do the same thing with booze when booze

1939
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:21,510
was legalized but they can't control it

1940
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,680
it's available on every street corner

1941
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:26,110
restaurants can you [ __ ] sell it like

1942
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:27,789
for God's sakes there's bars they're

1943
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:29,439
just places where people go and drink

1944
01:34:27,789 --> 01:34:31,539
booze and the exact same thing will

1945
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:33,309
happen with cannabis LCB types stores

1946
01:34:31,539 --> 01:34:34,479
that are government-run will never be

1947
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:36,700
able to control it

1948
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:38,199
they'll just be one part of it and I

1949
01:34:36,699 --> 01:34:40,420
think people are so limited in their

1950
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:42,489
ability to see the bigger picture they

1951
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:44,350
only see their slice of their pie that

1952
01:34:42,489 --> 01:34:46,359
they want and it's like well that's

1953
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:48,670
great but you know there's a lot of

1954
01:34:46,359 --> 01:34:50,949
people out there and they require all

1955
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:53,409
the slices of the pie to be taken care

1956
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:55,329
of evenly so I think that with the

1957
01:34:53,409 --> 01:34:56,979
normalization and the acceptance of

1958
01:34:55,329 --> 01:35:00,489
cannabis as a medicine and a

1959
01:34:56,979 --> 01:35:01,659
recreational drug in society all of

1960
01:35:00,489 --> 01:35:03,550
those things are gonna come to fruition

1961
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:06,849
vapor lounges aren't gonna go away vapor

1962
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:09,670
lounges are the new bars for cannabis

1963
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:12,850
away I can promise you no matter what

1964
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:13,329
any government does it will never go

1965
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:15,250
away

1966
01:35:13,329 --> 01:35:17,350
we tell them what we want that's how

1967
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:19,270
good government works everyone should

1968
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:22,150
remind themselves of that but the

1969
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:24,160
government is what's going on we decide

1970
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:26,859
as a society and then we make it happen

1971
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:29,349
and you know it's been slow in Canada

1972
01:35:26,859 --> 01:35:31,210
but nonetheless it's exactly what's been

1973
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:32,500
happening we say and we wanted to we got

1974
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:34,539
hep growing we said we wanted to grow

1975
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:37,420
our own personal licenses slowly but

1976
01:35:34,539 --> 01:35:38,349
surely we got exemption 56 isn't a MMAR

1977
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:41,800
ours

1978
01:35:38,349 --> 01:35:43,360
the end of May our system so badly they

1979
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,300
tried to get rid of it we fought in

1980
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:50,819
court and we won under charter breaches

1981
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:54,750
so in my opinion fight for what you and

1982
01:35:50,819 --> 01:35:57,549
the things out there that you might not

1983
01:35:54,750 --> 01:36:03,670
see as being the way it should be then

1984
01:35:57,550 --> 01:36:07,449
make it away and take a giant steaming

1985
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:09,368
[ __ ] on someone else's dream well we

1986
01:36:07,448 --> 01:36:13,710
almost had that happen to us this week

1987
01:36:09,368 --> 01:36:16,630
actually in the United States we had the

1988
01:36:13,710 --> 01:36:19,889
war backer blue an hour was originally

1989
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:24,489
the word bakka Farr amendment was

1990
01:36:19,889 --> 01:36:28,510
initially pulled and we thought we were

1991
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:31,269
going to be without federal protection

1992
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:34,719
anymore which basically the Rohrabacher

1993
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:36,369
bloomin our prohibited the federal

1994
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:40,389
government from going into any state

1995
01:36:36,368 --> 01:36:45,368
where there is a legal cannabis market

1996
01:36:40,389 --> 01:36:47,349
be it medical or recreational and could

1997
01:36:45,368 --> 01:36:50,979
not you spend any money it's the whole

1998
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:53,770
reason of one why I won my case against

1999
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:55,509
the federal government is because after

2000
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:58,360
a certain amount of time the federal

2001
01:36:55,510 --> 01:37:00,429
prosecutor could could not take me into

2002
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:03,609
court because they would have to pay him

2003
01:37:00,429 --> 01:37:06,069
to go into court and by doing so they

2004
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:08,139
would have violated this amendment that

2005
01:37:06,069 --> 01:37:09,939
has been passed alongside with the

2006
01:37:08,139 --> 01:37:13,710
budget amendments so there was some

2007
01:37:09,939 --> 01:37:17,500
budget shenanigans this past week where

2008
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:18,550
Democrats and Republicans didn't think

2009
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:22,060
they were going to have anything go

2010
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:26,770
through positively but for some reason

2011
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:33,250
Pelosi and the Democrats put up a sort

2012
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:38,260
of a coup and educated 45 who is the

2013
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:42,010
current president and he capitulated and

2014
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:43,860
went along with Democrats and initially

2015
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:46,780
it's made sure that any type of

2016
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:49,539
amendments were that were controversial

2017
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:51,699
amendments were pulled and therefore it

2018
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:55,359
looked like the Rohrabacher blew an hour

2019
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:57,519
was dead and it was for about 12 hours

2020
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:59,609
until the next business day when the

2021
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:03,310
house in the Senate passed their own

2022
01:37:59,609 --> 01:38:05,559
amendments of the word backward bloom in

2023
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:10,840
our therefore reaffirming our

2024
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:13,300
protections and passed the House and the

2025
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:15,670
Senate so it's attached to the current

2026
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:18,420
budget that is funded through December

2027
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:22,750
and it looks like it will be continually

2028
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:25,510
added to each successful budget because

2029
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:29,619
our successful lobbying has got enough

2030
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:33,220
Republican senators on board that we

2031
01:38:29,619 --> 01:38:35,769
have a momentum that we haven't seen

2032
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:37,449
before and this is many years of hard

2033
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:40,960
work and I have to thank a lot of

2034
01:38:37,449 --> 01:38:43,389
activists that it made this a reality

2035
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,220
from you know eight years of failure of

2036
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:47,829
the Blum and I were for amendment before

2037
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:49,750
it actually got passed and now it went

2038
01:38:47,829 --> 01:38:52,659
from something that we never thought was

2039
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:56,920
the possibility to now becoming a

2040
01:38:52,659 --> 01:39:00,369
mainstay addition to each budget and

2041
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:03,149
budget amendment which is as best as we

2042
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:06,220
can get until federal prohibition

2043
01:39:03,149 --> 01:39:08,739
changes this is the best type of

2044
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:11,170
protection that we have currently to

2045
01:39:08,739 --> 01:39:14,439
stave off any type of federal

2046
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:17,190
interference into our individual liberty

2047
01:39:14,439 --> 01:39:19,359
situations that are happening in these

2048
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:20,859
individual states via the Tenth

2049
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:23,849
Amendment we're allowed to you know

2050
01:39:20,859 --> 01:39:26,559
exist and be our own little democracies

2051
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:30,880
even in the face of you know federal law

2052
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:33,070
and of course that interference would be

2053
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:36,609
very costly to the industry needless to

2054
01:39:33,069 --> 01:39:38,710
say and we were all initially in our

2055
01:39:36,609 --> 01:39:41,319
industry pretty worried for that you

2056
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:43,659
know 24 12 to 24 hours until they

2057
01:39:41,319 --> 01:39:46,299
actually passed this amendment if we

2058
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:48,250
were wondering if this was the we were

2059
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:51,760
we part of a backdoor deal that throw us

2060
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:53,729
to the wolves or to sessions and you

2061
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:58,750
know the DEA and I'm coming in so

2062
01:39:53,729 --> 01:40:03,069
fortunately they the momentum that we

2063
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:05,500
have has been continued and it seems

2064
01:40:03,069 --> 01:40:07,170
it's going to continue further because

2065
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:09,880
we're continued to lobby these

2066
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:11,619
Republican and Democratic senators were

2067
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:14,650
having meet and greets with them

2068
01:40:11,619 --> 01:40:16,630
constantly those that are voted against

2069
01:40:14,649 --> 01:40:19,359
us in the past this is how we built the

2070
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:23,560
momentum to get them to vote for us

2071
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:26,609
consistently so congratulations to many

2072
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:28,960
hard-working people and many staffers in

2073
01:40:26,609 --> 01:40:33,309
Rohrabacher and Blum an hour for their

2074
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:35,529
very hard determination but this is also

2075
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:38,080
a friendly reminder people wake the [ __ ]

2076
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:40,509
up we have to still get involved this is

2077
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:42,939
still very fragile if they want to take

2078
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:46,020
us down this is one way that they could

2079
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:49,210
have easily reopened the floodgate so

2080
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:50,830
you are still watching and if you're a

2081
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:52,989
US citizen you can call your

2082
01:40:50,829 --> 01:40:55,659
representative and your senator and tell

2083
01:40:52,989 --> 01:40:59,710
them to stop this federal interference

2084
01:40:55,659 --> 01:41:02,079
and still make your voice heard you're

2085
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:04,630
an individual citizen and each voice

2086
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:06,880
that calls represents a hundred to a

2087
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:10,600
thousand even up to ten thousand people

2088
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:13,650
per phone call so go out to your town

2089
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:16,329
hall meetings talk to your Senators your

2090
01:41:13,649 --> 01:41:18,339
representatives make them aware that you

2091
01:41:16,329 --> 01:41:21,489
are an informed citizen and that you

2092
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:23,500
need to be aware of how you feel

2093
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:26,500
regarding cannabis and what's going on

2094
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:29,560
you can still get out there and get

2095
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:31,180
involved so you know don't complain get

2096
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,640
off your ass and do something about it

2097
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:36,940
you know contact your representative

2098
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:38,770
your senator and make them aware of the

2099
01:41:36,939 --> 01:41:41,109
changes and get involved locally again

2100
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:43,270
remember 2018 s next year these

2101
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:45,549
elections that are happening if you want

2102
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:48,880
to see change get behind Canada get

2103
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:50,409
behind cannabis you know support of

2104
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,590
candidates out there because there are

2105
01:41:50,409 --> 01:41:55,329
out there and you know go out there go

2106
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:57,159
support them right now they could use

2107
01:41:55,329 --> 01:41:59,289
your phone banking they could use your

2108
01:41:57,159 --> 01:42:01,420
dollars they could use your you know

2109
01:41:59,289 --> 01:42:03,609
ability to pitch in in any way shape or

2110
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:05,859
form you may have a talent maybe you can

2111
01:42:03,609 --> 01:42:07,809
only talk on a phone well go down and

2112
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:11,439
phone bank volunteer get yourself

2113
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:14,020
actively involved you know you have a

2114
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:16,719
chance to be active in this democracy to

2115
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:18,910
make us make the future easier at for us

2116
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,240
because we could have quickly found this

2117
01:42:18,909 --> 01:42:21,760
we

2118
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:23,469
ourselves all back behind the gun again

2119
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,440
and having the federal government

2120
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:30,190
gunning for us so it is still that

2121
01:42:26,439 --> 01:42:33,279
fragile so our voices still have to be

2122
01:42:30,189 --> 01:42:34,899
active so don't forget that people we

2123
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:40,239
love you but we still can get more

2124
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:49,149
involved Tony good to see you buddy yeah

2125
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:51,699
welcome Tony I was just uh pontificating

2126
01:42:49,149 --> 01:42:52,960
yeah that was like that was actually a

2127
01:42:51,699 --> 01:42:55,179
conversation I think you were talking

2128
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:58,329
about the same thing where they were

2129
01:42:55,180 --> 01:43:00,310
trying to pass something in the budget

2130
01:42:58,329 --> 01:43:03,519
bill where it was the point that's

2131
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:05,200
exactly it yeah and so we were worried

2132
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,790
they were you know we were possibly as

2133
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:10,149
an industry thrown under the bus but

2134
01:43:06,789 --> 01:43:13,390
they amended it and it's continued and

2135
01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:15,069
moving forward so again that's credit to

2136
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:19,240
the momentum that we've built but we

2137
01:43:15,069 --> 01:43:21,130
still have more momentum to move yeah

2138
01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:25,149
but it's just a stopgap measurement

2139
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:27,430
until December the 8th so you know I

2140
01:43:25,149 --> 01:43:30,759
mean it's [ __ ] I mean the way that

2141
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:33,940
you know this government and it's run

2142
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:36,010
you know is that you know again raising

2143
01:43:33,939 --> 01:43:37,839
the debt ceiling and doing what they

2144
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:41,079
need to do to have all their bills paid

2145
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:45,010
this amendment is just a rider on the

2146
01:43:41,079 --> 01:43:47,170
appropriations that basically the House

2147
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:50,050
Appropriations Committee has to approve

2148
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:53,500
the spending of all you know years and

2149
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:55,119
i's tax dollar right and god knows

2150
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:58,960
they're not the best stewards of that

2151
01:43:55,119 --> 01:44:00,640
money well until we have a law or

2152
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,000
something actually changes this is the

2153
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:06,070
best we have and so we're trying to get

2154
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,380
behind that but that's why we also why I

2155
01:44:06,069 --> 01:44:13,090
was ranting is we need people involved

2156
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:15,550
so that would they if enough of these

2157
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:17,619
people hear from their constituency

2158
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:18,460
regarding this issue they're going to

2159
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:20,140
leave us alone

2160
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:22,119
and we're already affecting some of

2161
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:23,740
these Republican and Democratic senators

2162
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:26,170
but there's still many out there we

2163
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:28,389
still have to affect change so this is

2164
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:30,640
Hill it's number the 8th right I mean

2165
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:32,710
well and then it will be continued on

2166
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,900
with the next the same way with the

2167
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:34,789
night

2168
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:37,399
I mean this is unfortunately the game

2169
01:44:34,789 --> 01:44:40,399
the government's playing and yes they

2170
01:44:37,399 --> 01:44:42,198
are punting everything and it is you

2171
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:45,799
mean they've got everything from Dhaka

2172
01:44:42,198 --> 01:44:47,809
to you know the wall and all that on top

2173
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:50,090
of that tax cuts that they're gonna try

2174
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:53,150
and all pass all in this time in

2175
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:56,860
December I mean that's too much to punt

2176
01:44:53,149 --> 01:45:00,559
and on top of that you've got 45

2177
01:44:56,859 --> 01:45:02,599
insulting the Republicans daily now so

2178
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:06,739
even those that her his supporters he's

2179
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:09,770
pissing on no pun intended and I mean I

2180
01:45:06,738 --> 01:45:12,649
just the cohesiveness is not going away

2181
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:14,420
however we have enough Republican and

2182
01:45:12,649 --> 01:45:17,269
Democratic support and continue to

2183
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:19,850
maintain that that any continuing budget

2184
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:22,250
in the future this continues to get

2185
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:24,739
added to and will continue to be added

2186
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:28,069
towards so yes it is up until December

2187
01:45:24,738 --> 01:45:30,859
eighth but they will either there will

2188
01:45:28,069 --> 01:45:33,590
be a slight time between where they will

2189
01:45:30,859 --> 01:45:35,019
take the budget and they will be either

2190
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:37,489
shut down the government temporarily

2191
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:39,530
which they won't do in December because

2192
01:45:37,488 --> 01:45:42,109
it's the holidays they're not going to

2193
01:45:39,529 --> 01:45:44,719
do that to their government employees so

2194
01:45:42,109 --> 01:45:47,779
it's gonna be just another continuation

2195
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:50,300
until you know remember the government's

2196
01:45:47,779 --> 01:45:52,550
fiscal year starts October to October so

2197
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:54,800
we're already emergency funding for the

2198
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:57,140
year so they have to resolve the

2199
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:01,039
situation however they're still going to

2200
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:06,260
use all these political realities doc of

2201
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:09,920
the wall etc as you know negotiation

2202
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:11,780
point or at least 45 is going to sorry

2203
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,219
this we should get out of politics and

2204
01:46:11,779 --> 01:46:16,840
getting up back onto cannabis but that's

2205
01:46:13,219 --> 01:46:16,840
sorry sorry people that's just a

2206
01:46:19,869 --> 01:46:26,630
separation of church and state sorry

2218
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:14,020
inspiration behind the the penny

2219
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:15,580
inadvertently by ash flaming all about

2220
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:17,650
the shitty things that are in behind the

2221
01:47:15,579 --> 01:47:21,510
pens and how dangerous they can be and

2222
01:47:17,649 --> 01:47:23,589
how inexpensive and non sustainable and

2223
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:25,780
fun now

2224
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:28,360
Omicron introduced me to Gary turn me on

2225

2227
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:35,890
big time because he and I and Gary

2228
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:38,650

good thanks for your your part well and

2231
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:45,489
his knowledge drop has still got to be

2232
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:47,140
one of the most epic ones own you know

2233
01:47:45,489 --> 01:47:49,539
hash Church where he broke all those

2234
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:51,970
down because that seemed to be the the

2235
01:47:49,539 --> 01:47:55,029
way things are going and I mean look

2236
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:57,460
what has changed you know across the

2237
01:47:55,029 --> 01:47:59,969
industry you know look how everything is

2238
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:02,800
really improved so it's really made

2239
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:05,890
consumers aware of what's actually there

2240
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:08,140
inhaling and it made them realize what

2241
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:10,210
they need to look for in these types of

2242
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:12,640
devices you know it's why a lot of us

2243
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:15,159
have back to our either manual or

2244
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:18,160
electric way of imbibing as opposed to

2245
01:48:15,159 --> 01:48:19,840
now you from those frustrations look

2246
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:23,139
what you know do you and Tony have

2247
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:24,730
created along with you know alacrán you

2248
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:26,440
know you've taken it to the next steps

2249
01:48:24,729 --> 01:48:28,659
because now we know what was bad and

2250
01:48:26,439 --> 01:48:30,759
what's out there so we know then what we

2251
01:48:28,659 --> 01:48:32,710
wanted to see so now you're creating one

2252
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:34,869
of those aspects of things that people

2253
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:38,170
want to see you need apparatus that you

2254
01:48:34,869 --> 01:48:40,960
can utilize and make viscous things like

2255
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:43,720
Rosen through that you can inhale what

2256
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:48,630
that you're on the go and you know that

2257
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:48,630
didn't exist so again kudos

2258

01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:29,390
after this and although it looks to be

2267
01:49:27,289 --> 01:49:30,890
kind of hot today so we may want to ride

2268
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:32,950
later in the afternoon so maybe this

2269
01:49:30,890 --> 01:49:34,700
afternoon

2270
01:49:32,949 --> 01:49:38,019
alright well let me know when you're

2271
01:49:34,699 --> 01:49:43,488
done biking I'm gonna I'm gonna go visit

2272
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:45,700
think Duchess his garden nice never seen

2273
01:49:43,488 --> 01:49:48,169
what I've seen pictures of it looks nice

2274
01:49:45,699 --> 01:49:51,769
looks pretty good right and she she

2275
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:55,069
plays her steel drum to her plants did

2276
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:57,530
you see that yeah yeah she did a video

2277
01:49:55,069 --> 01:49:59,920
the other day it's really cool yeah I

2278
01:49:57,529 --> 01:50:03,639
had no idea this was like a professional

2279
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:08,710
steel drum player but she played like a

2280
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:08,710
Beethoven or something just show me the

2281
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:14,780
goods the inventor of that actually

2282
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:19,279
actually teaches at West Virginia

2283
01:50:14,779 --> 01:50:21,859
University oh yeah he came on a few

2284
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:23,229
years ago as a musical teacher and of

2285
01:50:21,859 --> 01:50:25,399
course I still have friends that are

2286
01:50:23,229 --> 01:50:28,369
musicians they're in Morgantown because

2287
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:30,889
it's still a strong music scene and yeah

2288
01:50:28,369 --> 01:50:33,619
so he's he's doing that and that's

2289
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:36,910
that's that's quite a talent that's

2290
01:50:33,619 --> 01:50:41,180
quite a musical sound all unto itself

2291
01:50:36,909 --> 01:50:43,069
so kudos there what does that the last

2292
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:46,280
the thing I remember about that was when

2293
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:48,679
I was a kid we used to watch like Sesame

2294
01:50:46,279 --> 01:50:50,420
Street or there's some show that we

2295
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:53,300
watched and it was like the make they

2296
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:54,739
showed like a real cool like after kids

2297
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,570
program or something it was like they

2298
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:59,359
showed like people rolling out a barrel

2299
01:50:56,569 --> 01:51:01,399
like a trash can and they would show

2300
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:03,380
them cutting off the bottom it would

2301
01:51:01,399 --> 01:51:05,509
show forming it you know what is this

2302
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:06,380
and they're like forming the whole steel

2303
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:10,719
drum

2304
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:13,960
from from just throw away material

2305
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:16,369
repurposing that's what it was that a

2306
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:20,359
musical instruments out of the Castaway

2307
01:51:16,369 --> 01:51:22,250
oil containers and look now it's a

2308
01:51:20,359 --> 01:51:24,349
complete musical instrument that's world

2309
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:26,060
round you know but it was all made from

2310
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:28,070
throw away and I need to have a

2311
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:30,949
percussion and it made such a beautiful

2312
01:51:28,069 --> 01:51:32,960
unique sound that yeah it's still

2313
01:51:30,948 --> 01:51:35,238
continues to this day but she's quite

2314
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:37,448
talented as a grower as well as a hash

2315
01:51:35,238 --> 01:51:39,198
maker but as well as the musician so

2316
01:51:37,448 --> 01:51:43,189
good job there

2317
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:46,428
goddess keep it up just very good very

2318
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:48,529
very good at the steel drum and I'm and

2319
01:51:46,429 --> 01:51:50,389
I'm a big believer in having music in my

2320
01:51:48,529 --> 01:51:55,698
gardens I always had classical or jazz

2321
01:51:50,389 --> 01:51:57,829
always 24/7 going on you know in my

2322
01:51:55,698 --> 01:52:00,049
Gardens when I was growing because I

2323
01:51:57,829 --> 01:52:02,179
always found a good response I know some

2324
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:04,940
people like heavy metal or any types of

2325
01:52:02,179 --> 01:52:08,090
things but I've always been a yeah I've

2326
01:52:04,939 --> 01:52:09,529
always found plants respond to music how

2327
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:12,350
do you know I don't know who ever talked

2328
01:52:09,529 --> 01:52:14,389
about this before how did have you ever

2329
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:17,090
heard of where you've seen anyone use

2330
01:52:14,389 --> 01:52:20,199
like just like you can in your house in

2331
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:24,199
my house has these little ultrasound pet

2332
01:52:20,198 --> 01:52:26,359
devices pest device that like pushes all

2333
01:52:24,198 --> 01:52:29,019
kind of hits a frequency that we can't

2334
01:52:26,359 --> 01:52:32,509
hear sometimes can be harmful for dogs

2335
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:35,300
but it pushes bugs you know out of the

2336
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:37,760
room and we don't really talk about

2337
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:41,000
using sound for in the gardens but I've

2338
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:42,679
you sound before anyone else has or if

2339
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,010
there's any like great device out there

2340
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:47,179
that it wouldn't just raves about that

2341
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:49,789
maybe should be shared out there you

2342
01:52:47,179 --> 01:52:50,899
know I had a sound device tried

2343
01:52:49,789 --> 01:52:56,679
something like that but it didn't work

2344
01:52:50,899 --> 01:52:58,789
for ants ants it did not work for at all

2345
01:52:56,679 --> 01:53:02,869
but there's some hearty kind of ants

2346
01:52:58,789 --> 01:53:04,609
around here as well in the Bay Area well

2347
01:53:02,869 --> 01:53:06,500
I think I think that's the one field

2348
01:53:04,609 --> 01:53:09,559
that we've got everything else to UV

2349
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:12,139
lighting the scrubbing yeah filtration

2350
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:14,449
air filters and I think that that's

2351
01:53:12,139 --> 01:53:16,789
still open you know because there are

2352
01:53:14,448 --> 01:53:19,469
frequencies so we could if we could test

2353
01:53:16,789 --> 01:53:22,470
the different types of spider mites and

2354
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:24,600
kinds of bugs and then kind of bring

2355
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:27,150
them into more of a study of it about

2356
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:29,700
we'd find a frequency that push them out

2357
01:53:27,149 --> 01:53:31,439
of the garden right sonica frequencies

2358
01:53:29,699 --> 01:53:32,939
that would make them uncomfortable so

2359
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:35,460
that they wouldn't want to nest you know

2360
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:38,539
or lay eggs you know that's the that's

2361
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:40,920
what you want any type of you know

2362
01:53:38,539 --> 01:53:43,350
preventing but at the same time you

2363
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:45,739
would think that they would if that type

2364
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:51,030
of situation would exist that would

2365
01:53:45,739 --> 01:53:54,659
exist on the large scale agricultural

2366
01:53:51,029 --> 01:53:57,420
you know reality you know I'm saying

2367
01:53:54,659 --> 01:54:00,059
like large scale nft systems would what

2368
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:01,140
do you think of that Sam sonic pest

2369
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:03,960
control

2370
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:10,950
what are you aware of I've never tried

2371
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:15,289
it I I can't really comment but I in

2372
01:54:10,949 --> 01:54:18,090
Sector domes to attract them to traps

2373
01:54:15,289 --> 01:54:22,649
either for monitoring or for destroying

2374
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:26,159
them but no I've never used vibrations

2375
01:54:22,649 --> 01:54:28,319
of any kind and we know plants are

2376
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:28,590
affected by vibrations and things like

2377
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:32,000
that

2378
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:34,710
maybe they're affect by good ones

2379
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,260
the insects don't seem to be affected by

2380
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:39,149
them well I guess they're either good

2381
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:41,730
vibrations or bad preparations to put

2382
01:54:39,149 --> 01:54:44,179
out what you doing yeah I think you look

2383
01:54:41,729 --> 01:54:47,279
this up because I'm pretty sure that one

2384
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:54,270
if it's a beach boys we know it's good

2385
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:57,029
vibrations that's funny so I had these

2386
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:58,500
things that I bought on Amazon these

2387
01:54:57,029 --> 01:55:00,899
little pest control thing since there

2388
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:03,479
was a lot of spiders actually in the

2389
01:55:00,899 --> 01:55:07,619
house and I was like kind of allergic to

2390
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:09,089
them so people say spiders don't fight

2391
01:55:07,619 --> 01:55:12,809
but they love to bite me for whatever

2392
01:55:09,090 --> 01:55:14,390
reason but as soon as I put these in

2393
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:19,440
each one of the rooms

2394
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:21,000
no one bugs on I'll tell you what the

2395
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:23,309
frequency is because I was worried about

2396
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,840
my dog and they said something about

2397
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:31,100
cats do you have any plants at the house

2398
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:32,569
I do

2399
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:34,820
it said something about there was a

2400
01:55:32,569 --> 01:55:37,670
certain way that's a look ultrasonic

2401
01:55:34,819 --> 01:55:41,299
electronic pest insect repellent device

2402
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:45,949
planned or hybrid sound so good plugin

2403
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:47,630
women and your pest woes probably have

2404
01:55:45,949 --> 01:55:49,340
to be really intense but there's

2405
01:55:47,630 --> 01:55:53,989
probably a reason why it hadn't been

2406
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:56,630
developed before but I see 20 Hertz mice

2407
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:58,340
will run they've got different sounds if

2408
01:55:56,630 --> 01:55:59,930
you kind of google it some of the some

2409
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:02,239
of the stuff out there is [ __ ]

2410
01:55:59,930 --> 01:56:04,310
but there's definitely it set the

2411
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:06,439
frequencies are you dial it in depending

2412
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:08,150
on your pests see that's the thing it's

2413
01:56:06,439 --> 01:56:12,349
just set to free the only cell devices

2414
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:14,839
that are set to certain things like it's

2415
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:18,170
a certain frequency of range like 20 I'm

2416
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:19,819
looking at where that was some of it's

2417
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:23,630
some of us kind of scammy

2418
01:56:19,819 --> 01:56:28,819
see here what is the name of the brand

2419
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:31,930
just out of curiosity sorry I thought

2420
01:56:28,819 --> 01:56:31,929
you may have known up top of your head

2421
01:56:41,199 --> 01:57:01,010
either you already forgot anti Prabang

2422
01:56:55,340 --> 01:57:07,010
right people that's an easy one pests

2423
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:10,460
reject all right well on Wikipedia they

2424
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:15,110
have you kind of call out the [ __ ]

2425
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:17,149
ones the good ones or whatever does it

2426
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:19,399
work on mother-in-law's it allowed two

2427
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:20,750
weeks it does not work on

2428
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:22,159
mother-in-law's well you could change if

2429
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:24,310
you could change your frequency I bet it

2430
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:24,309
would

2431
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:32,600
two weeks for sound waves to affect pets

2432
01:57:28,510 --> 01:57:34,579
past with an established I just think

2433
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:38,560
it's unjust just like it sits in its

2434
01:57:34,579 --> 01:57:38,559
really early stage but I bet you

2435
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:46,259
somebody out there

2436
01:57:41,909 --> 01:57:46,260
yeah they've got all kinds of Gophers

2437
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:54,400
safe for pets if you've got Gophers in

2438
01:57:50,289 --> 01:57:56,680
your house but they do throw those they

2439
01:57:54,399 --> 01:58:03,689
throw those I'm sure they throw like you

2440
01:57:56,680 --> 01:58:03,690
know if you've see Gophers in your house

2441
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:18,880
they're in the attic our honest review

2442
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:21,400
okay yeah there's a bunch of them out

2443
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,199
there this one's a micro and corporate

2444
01:58:21,399 --> 01:58:31,659
it's funny there's one from a micron

2445
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:34,539
corporation and so these are just direct

2446
01:58:31,659 --> 01:58:39,639
plug in the wall type of modules yeah it

2447
01:58:34,539 --> 01:58:42,579
takes it says takes a few weeks to build

2448
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:44,590
up the frequency or I put a bunch of my

2449
01:58:42,579 --> 01:58:47,949
I put one in every room let it all

2450
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:50,110
bounce around it takes two weeks for

2451
01:58:47,949 --> 01:58:53,170
them to get so [ __ ] tired of the

2452
01:58:50,109 --> 01:58:54,579
noise yeah that's what I think it is but

2453
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:56,109
I think if you started with your garden

2454
01:58:54,579 --> 01:58:58,210
with a frequency that was really like

2455
01:58:56,109 --> 01:59:01,089
annoying it'd be like it's just a

2456
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:04,029
horrible like rock concert that was just

2457
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:06,369
just no one was in tune and like they

2458
01:59:04,029 --> 01:59:09,369
came to a party and they were like looks

2459
01:59:06,369 --> 01:59:12,279
like a good party in the tank like all

2460
01:59:09,369 --> 01:59:15,399
horrible combinations of sounds and like

2461
01:59:12,279 --> 01:59:21,519
almost like an MRI probably for them you

2462
01:59:15,399 --> 01:59:25,000
know MRI skin and how long have you been

2463
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:26,770
using it a few months there's a couple

2464
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,180
of months online there's some having it

2465
01:59:26,770 --> 01:59:31,440
more expensive so I'm looking for

2466
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:34,570
cheaper this one I found the Guardian

2467
01:59:31,439 --> 01:59:39,210
this is for outdoor this has control for

2468
01:59:34,569 --> 01:59:43,359
this has raccoons deer squirrels cats

2469
01:59:39,210 --> 01:59:46,510
Chipmunks bats mice and rats and you can

2470
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:48,549
actually dial it in on the back and then

2471
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:51,430
you could say predator volume this is

2472
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:53,380
pretty cool well so that one you can

2473
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:55,340
directly dial into your okay that makes

2474
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:58,579
sense if you had deer

2475
01:59:55,340 --> 02:00:02,029
like a Turkey's so it does that a turkey

2476
01:59:58,579 --> 02:00:03,590
setting um it does not have a turkey

2477
02:00:02,029 --> 02:00:06,170
sitting this one does have a

2478
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:09,710
mother-in-law said it now ah well there

2479
02:00:06,170 --> 02:00:12,859
you guys a lower frequency humming bass

2480
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:16,279
really would play some drum and bass

2481
02:00:12,859 --> 02:00:23,089
your mother-in-law will go away crank on

2482
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:23,979
Bassnectar at five in the morning that's

2483
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:30,230
great

2484
02:00:23,979 --> 02:00:31,819
just show me ready for the door so yes

2485
02:00:30,229 --> 02:00:32,629
serious [ __ ] going on with this

2486
02:00:31,819 --> 02:00:35,689
hurricane Oh

2487
02:00:32,630 --> 02:00:37,550
everyone that's in Florida my prayers

2488
02:00:35,689 --> 02:00:40,250
and thoughts out to you my family is

2489
02:00:37,550 --> 02:00:43,789
their mother dad brother everyone in

2490
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:45,349
Miami Broward I haven't turned on the TV

2491
02:00:43,789 --> 02:00:49,399
this morning but I was watching it till

2492
02:00:45,349 --> 02:00:54,170
I 2 in the morning I said my best man

2493
02:00:49,399 --> 02:00:57,519
and I don't miss that you grew up with

2494
02:00:54,170 --> 02:01:01,279
that right yep I was in New Orleans

2495
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:05,889
Florida I was actually in Kansas so I

2496
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:10,460
have had tornadoes hurricanes floods

2497
02:01:05,889 --> 02:01:15,859
I've got I would say probably PTSD from

2498
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:18,639
storms but I don't know it's always a I

2499
02:01:15,859 --> 02:01:21,259
always have this fear now that I'm I

2500
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:24,770
thought I was okay from earthquakes

2501
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:28,099
where I'm at and then I realize like I'm

2502
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:31,880
like right on a fault line like whoa

2503
02:01:28,099 --> 02:01:33,920
okay and that's the only thing I haven't

2504
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:38,060
experienced it I've actually seen a

2505
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:41,000
volcano to erupting it's it's very

2506
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:43,460
humbling the first time I remember it

2507
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:50,590
was the first time I actually did speed

2508
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:52,010
haha and yeah it was back in 1992 and

2509
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:53,960
yeah

2510
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:57,289
I was literally everybody left the house

2511
02:01:53,960 --> 02:02:00,469
and I was playing my bass and then the

2512
02:01:57,289 --> 02:02:03,139
earth just gave the nice big old jolt

2513
02:02:00,469 --> 02:02:05,810
and I never felt so small or miniscule

2514
02:02:03,139 --> 02:02:08,118
but I can't look

2515
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:09,769
honestly I my whole life

2516
02:02:08,118 --> 02:02:11,089
growing up in dealing with hurricanes I

2517
02:02:09,769 --> 02:02:13,789
would rather be out here and deal with

2518
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:16,189
an earthquake any day than to deal with

2519
02:02:13,788 --> 02:02:19,578
having to board up the windows and you

2520
02:02:16,189 --> 02:02:21,349
know hunker down and loss of signal and

2521
02:02:19,578 --> 02:02:23,509
you know all that she now deal with this

2522
02:02:21,349 --> 02:02:25,159
Reed dealing with refrigerators and all

2523
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:27,979
that [ __ ] you have to deal with when you

2524
02:02:25,158 --> 02:02:29,779
should get flooded earthquakes can be

2525
02:02:27,979 --> 02:02:33,199
bad though I mean you saw a Mexico man

2526
02:02:29,779 --> 02:02:33,559
that's 8.1 you can study the Richter

2527
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:35,058
scale

2528
02:02:33,559 --> 02:02:37,489
most people don't realize that every

2529
02:02:35,059 --> 02:02:40,878
time he goes from like a 5 or 6 or 6 or

2530
02:02:37,488 --> 02:02:45,018
7 it's not just one unit it's a

2531
02:02:40,878 --> 02:02:50,498
multitude of things that I mean a

2532
02:02:45,019 --> 02:02:50,498
difference between like a 7 and 8 is

2533
02:02:51,099 --> 02:02:56,328
50/50 nuclear bombs or something you

2534
02:02:54,498 --> 02:02:59,418
know the size of it would be like 50

2535
02:02:56,328 --> 02:02:59,898
nuclear bombs between the two gadgets or

2536
02:02:59,418 --> 02:03:01,609
something

2537
02:02:59,899 --> 02:03:03,559
Oh in the amount yeah because the amount

2538
02:03:01,609 --> 02:03:05,418
of shifting that's happening and I mean

2539
02:03:03,559 --> 02:03:08,029
look at the last huge when that was here

2540
02:03:05,418 --> 02:03:10,488
the Loma Prieta one I mean I mean it

2541
02:03:08,029 --> 02:03:11,988
shifted things by feet so I mean an

2542
02:03:10,488 --> 02:03:13,569
eight point one would definitely move

2543
02:03:11,988 --> 02:03:17,029
things by yards

2544
02:03:13,569 --> 02:03:22,538
yeah eight point one serious there's

2545
02:03:17,029 --> 02:03:25,668
like so anyone out in Mexico again

2546
02:03:22,538 --> 02:03:27,618
thoughts and prayers with you got people

2547
02:03:25,668 --> 02:03:33,139
in Puerto Rico they said that they just

2548
02:03:27,618 --> 02:03:34,549
lost some power but they were okay just

2549
02:03:33,139 --> 02:03:39,019
crazy out there and there's a lot of

2550
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:42,559
storms a lot of tell extraordinary

2551
02:03:39,019 --> 02:03:45,199
London anything you know yeah you know

2552
02:03:42,559 --> 02:03:47,090
there's that back in the day watch this

2553
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:51,319
guy great something they took him off

2554
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:54,229
for YouTube but he's to be with NASA is

2555
02:03:51,319 --> 02:03:57,049
it good he's like I forget what his

2556
02:03:54,229 --> 02:03:59,449
background was as a scientist but he did

2557
02:03:57,050 --> 02:04:03,229
I don't know if you've ever talked about

2558
02:03:59,448 --> 02:04:08,688
Net Zero before like when the planet

2559
02:04:03,229 --> 02:04:13,249
gets to Net Zero now we have it you ever

2560
02:04:08,689 --> 02:04:16,329
heard of that before I've heard of it

2561
02:04:13,248 --> 02:04:16,328
you may want to explain to

2562
02:04:23,789 --> 02:04:29,019
what he said but essentially what

2563
02:04:26,679 --> 02:04:32,289
happens is our North and South Poles

2564
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:34,929
they they flip and this is evident on

2565
02:04:32,289 --> 02:04:36,640
the where our plates touch and then

2566
02:04:34,929 --> 02:04:38,800
bottom the ocean you see lines that go

2567
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:44,739
this way and then you give this way and

2568
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:46,029
it's 3,600 month 3,600 years or so I

2569
02:04:44,738 --> 02:04:47,619
don't know there's an average in there

2570
02:04:46,029 --> 02:04:49,750
where it happens

2571
02:04:47,619 --> 02:04:53,109
Einstein says that our planet goes

2572
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:55,479
through kind of a bigger shift every

2573
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:59,948
eighty six thousand mile eighty six

2574
02:04:55,479 --> 02:05:01,899
thousand years but doesn't mean our

2575
02:04:59,948 --> 02:05:04,479
planet light goes off or anything it's

2576
02:05:01,899 --> 02:05:06,129
just the way that our magnetics work and

2577
02:05:04,479 --> 02:05:08,889
our North and South worth but there's a

2578
02:05:06,130 --> 02:05:13,210
point that we get to that's like a net

2579
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:16,060
zero when that happens all kinds of like

2580
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:19,119
different theories have spawned off from

2581
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:23,080
that of what happened just you know does

2582
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:25,179
the ice age happen when the north and

2583
02:05:23,079 --> 02:05:27,698
you know when we hit a NetZero point and

2584
02:05:25,179 --> 02:05:30,010
we cycle through as a planet every so

2585
02:05:27,698 --> 02:05:32,799
often and we're just kind of riding it

2586
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:35,190
like a wave and you know depends if

2587
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:40,659
we're good or bad we influence that ride

2588
02:05:35,189 --> 02:05:44,109
differently but there is a resonant

2589
02:05:40,658 --> 02:05:46,960
frequency of things that exist and all

2590
02:05:44,109 --> 02:05:49,149
things in the planet has one and I think

2591
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,829
who's Einstein that was laughed at when

2592
02:05:49,149 --> 02:05:52,899
he first talked about it but the planet

2593
02:05:50,829 --> 02:05:57,488
has a pulse frequency or a resonant

2594
02:05:52,899 --> 02:06:01,059
frequency and so our frequency if you

2595
02:05:57,488 --> 02:06:02,439
look at like our planet as a grouping of

2596
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:05,909
the time a bunch of different tiny

2597
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:09,029
little marbles that makes up a sphere

2598
02:06:05,908 --> 02:06:11,049
that and they think of it as a vibration

2599
02:06:09,029 --> 02:06:16,750
think of those things being held

2600
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:19,449
together by and by a grab gravitational

2601
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:21,279
pull and our rotational pull with the

2602
02:06:19,448 --> 02:06:23,529
star all this is very important to keep

2603
02:06:21,279 --> 02:06:25,090
these little marbles together but

2604
02:06:23,529 --> 02:06:26,769
there's a frequency a resonant

2605
02:06:25,090 --> 02:06:30,000
frequencies of vibration just like

2606
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:32,800
that's why they use quartz for like

2607
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,659
turntables and for watches because what

2608
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:38,380
she put a frequency or vibration on it

2609
02:06:34,659 --> 02:06:41,099
it holds it perpetually like that very

2610
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:43,569
good at holding and responding to

2611
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:46,900
frequencies where other and it's in it's

2612
02:06:43,569 --> 02:06:48,069
a neutral quartz is neutral so it's one

2613
02:06:46,899 --> 02:06:50,559
of the only elements it's actually

2614
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:51,909
neutral but everything has these tones

2615
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:53,590
and frequencies that's where people

2616
02:06:51,909 --> 02:06:57,399
talked about chakras and open them with

2617
02:06:53,590 --> 02:07:00,670
tuning forks or bowls tie bowls those

2618
02:06:57,399 --> 02:07:03,449
sound effects kind of help tune you

2619
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:05,890
could tune crystals as well in stones

2620
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:09,880
people do it all the time

2621
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:12,280
and so there's that frequency that's out

2622
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:15,039
there and our planet is too said to be

2623
02:07:12,279 --> 02:07:17,619
speeding up since we've been monitoring

2624
02:07:15,039 --> 02:07:23,279
it which kind of makes sense so if

2625
02:07:17,619 --> 02:07:27,309
you're going through a North and South

2626
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:30,960
flip and you're getting to a NetZero

2627
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:34,539
point that frequent that that vibration

2628
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:37,060
would be more and more intense you

2629
02:07:34,539 --> 02:07:40,529
follow me and so then that's what would

2630
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:42,820
lead to that in contributing to like our

2631
02:07:40,529 --> 02:07:45,340
saline count in the water of the

2632
02:07:42,819 --> 02:07:48,630
greenhouse gas is different things that

2633
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:52,150
you know affect the planet on a whole

2634
02:07:48,630 --> 02:07:55,119
fukushima dumping nuclear waste into our

2635
02:07:52,149 --> 02:07:59,549
ocean things like that that doesn't go

2636
02:07:55,119 --> 02:08:03,130
away you know those things will affect

2637
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:05,289
have an influence on storms as well so

2638
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:08,079
you would see more earthquakes you would

2639
02:08:05,289 --> 02:08:11,050
see more storms you would see more more

2640
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:13,750
activity then maybe you would see in the

2641
02:08:11,050 --> 02:08:17,250
last under 200 years that's been

2642
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:21,220
documented does that makes any sense so

2643
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:25,600
I think we I think we as humans and we

2644
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:28,720
can trip we we contribute to that change

2645
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:33,370
in these experiences but I also do think

2646
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:36,220
that it happens it happens naturally and

2647
02:08:33,369 --> 02:08:38,439
it occurs in cycles and kind of how our

2648
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:42,570
planet recycles kinda like the forest

2649
02:08:38,439 --> 02:08:44,739
burns down you know and read and read

2650
02:08:42,569 --> 02:08:46,649
without a doubt it actually I mean the

2651
02:08:44,739 --> 02:08:50,460
poles are gonna switch I mean

2652
02:08:46,649 --> 02:08:51,719
when I was in the military wherever we

2653
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:54,270
were in the world we always had to

2654
02:08:51,719 --> 02:08:57,029
Declan ate our compasses too you know

2655
02:08:54,270 --> 02:08:59,040
true north and we always we were taught

2656
02:08:57,029 --> 02:09:00,689
in there that there's you know there's

2657
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:02,039
there's a kind of a shifting that's

2658
02:09:00,689 --> 02:09:03,899
happening that it was already happening

2659
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:06,420
back when I was in the military in the

2660
02:09:03,899 --> 02:09:08,879
90s you know in the eighties and the

2661
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:12,810
nineties that showed that there's you

2662
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:15,750
know already a degree change due to the

2663
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:17,310
the polls and it was continuing and you

2664
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:19,079
know was gonna get more extreme until

2665
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:21,090
the actual polls flip so there's no

2666
02:09:19,079 --> 02:09:22,679
doubt about it it's gonna happen the

2667
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:25,020
thing is is it should have already

2668
02:09:22,679 --> 02:09:27,600
happened already by those calculations

2669
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:29,580
so either we're about to go through a

2670
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:33,420
polar flip or it's currently happening

2671
02:09:29,579 --> 02:09:36,179
as we speak yeah it's also a great point

2672
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:40,109
because think about all the the

2673
02:09:36,179 --> 02:09:43,050
travelers that set sail and all the

2674
02:09:40,109 --> 02:09:45,920
devices that existed that allow you to

2675
02:09:43,050 --> 02:09:49,170
see true north you know well birds have

2676
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:50,730
birds have iron a sliver of iron in

2677
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:52,489
their beaks that helps them find true

2678
02:09:50,729 --> 02:09:55,069
north as well so it would affect

2679
02:09:52,488 --> 02:09:57,658
migrations yeah they found that out

2680
02:09:55,069 --> 02:09:59,789
through biology is that's why they're

2681
02:09:57,658 --> 02:10:01,529
able to find north and south so Ellis

2682
02:09:59,789 --> 02:10:03,779
they actually have a bit of iron in

2683
02:10:01,529 --> 02:10:06,319
their beak that points him magnetically

2684
02:10:03,779 --> 02:10:06,319
in the right direction

2685
02:10:07,219 --> 02:10:11,960
dinosaurs they've kind of evolved on us

2686
02:10:09,659 --> 02:10:16,380
[Laughter]

2687
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:18,448
so all right sound looks like we're

2688
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:20,789
losing most of the people here but I

2689
02:10:18,448 --> 02:10:22,948
didn't want to say one thing that I'm

2690
02:10:20,789 --> 02:10:24,689
really happy to see the industry at

2691
02:10:22,948 --> 02:10:28,639
least on the solve on the side starting

2692
02:10:24,689 --> 02:10:32,039
to push the sauces and the THCA

2693
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:37,560
I think it's important movement it's

2694
02:10:32,039 --> 02:10:39,869
going on it's you know kind of why that

2695
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:41,340
the whole idea why bubble and I were

2696
02:10:39,869 --> 02:10:43,319
talking about creating these types of

2697
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:45,090
tanks because once you when you get

2698
02:10:43,319 --> 02:10:46,799
something saucy you can't really put it

2699
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:49,230
in the jar you can't put it it's like

2700
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:53,820
you really it's hard to keep it in a

2701
02:10:49,229 --> 02:10:55,678
place so the tank itself is something

2702
02:10:53,819 --> 02:10:57,389
that I think's good just as if you're

2703
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:59,319
buying them as an empty you know you

2704
02:10:57,389 --> 02:11:02,078
just buy an empty kid

2705
02:10:59,319 --> 02:11:06,729
and you press rosin at home you can

2706
02:11:02,078 --> 02:11:09,698
double press that rosin and have thca

2707
02:11:06,729 --> 02:11:13,359
and have your sauce that sauces and

2708
02:11:09,698 --> 02:11:17,618
unbelievable of these little things like

2709
02:11:13,359 --> 02:11:23,259
really good and you got to put them in

2710
02:11:17,618 --> 02:11:26,679
something so it's just nice to have the

2711
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:29,050
options now to mix that seeing people

2712
02:11:26,679 --> 02:11:32,199
going for it because I remember a year

2713
02:11:29,050 --> 02:11:35,110
or two years ago people just still they

2714
02:11:32,198 --> 02:11:41,309
still just hate on rosin that's like man

2715
02:11:35,109 --> 02:11:41,309
I don't come a long way

2716
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:47,739
well it's a natural progression of

2717
02:11:45,698 --> 02:11:49,328
things they're gonna adapt you know or

2718
02:11:47,738 --> 02:11:52,118
you know somebody's gonna find something

2719
02:11:49,328 --> 02:11:54,880
that will so it's good to see that

2720
02:11:52,118 --> 02:11:57,578
there's more options out there for paper

2721
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,500
you know people in patience because they

2722
02:11:57,578 --> 02:12:02,859
read about it now they need to have

2723
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:04,238
access yeah and I think that you know

2724
02:12:02,859 --> 02:12:06,789
it's always comes back down to the

2725
02:12:04,238 --> 02:12:09,609
grower and the genetics like you can't

2726
02:12:06,789 --> 02:12:12,609
you can't just fabricate really good

2727
02:12:09,609 --> 02:12:14,759
product it's just to you know the person

2728
02:12:12,609 --> 02:12:19,059
doing the extraction or separation

2729
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:21,760
shirts it's about you know it's a good

2730
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:24,070
40 percent or so but once you have the

2731
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:25,599
tools and the knowledge every time if

2732
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:28,029
you run a lot of stuff that comes down

2733
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:30,010
to who well is that it's something new

2734
02:12:28,029 --> 02:12:31,689
that's a new flavor that's new head

2735
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:34,270
structure or why did that yield so much

2736
02:12:31,689 --> 02:12:36,789
more otherwise that all clear you know

2737
02:12:34,270 --> 02:12:39,310
just different unique characteristics

2738
02:12:36,789 --> 02:12:43,328
I've always found it interesting you

2739
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:45,520
know we washed resin and it gets

2740
02:12:43,328 --> 02:12:47,618
freeze-dried and it's all looks beaming

2741
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:50,469
white and you've got we've got different

2742
02:12:47,618 --> 02:12:53,139
micron runs you'll get like first run

2743
02:12:50,469 --> 02:12:55,569
second one third one fourth one but even

2744
02:12:53,139 --> 02:12:58,960
in the first or second runs between 273

2745
02:12:55,569 --> 02:13:01,389
90 120 45 have you go to press and you

2746
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:04,480
get different shades different colors

2747
02:13:01,389 --> 02:13:06,730
every time savings that you know you

2748
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:08,828
make a variation you make a change in

2749
02:13:06,729 --> 02:13:12,729
the way you would press based on you

2750
02:13:08,828 --> 02:13:15,340
know if it's a three or four five star

2751
02:13:12,729 --> 02:13:17,909
type of ash going in before it gets

2752
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:19,600
pressed but even with those slight

2753
02:13:17,909 --> 02:13:21,488
adjustments you're just making those

2754
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:24,010
adjustments but it's pressure or just a

2755
02:13:21,488 --> 02:13:25,539
few degrees or things like that based on

2756
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:27,909
the melt because you don't want to blow

2757
02:13:25,539 --> 02:13:30,909
your you don't to blow out but

2758
02:13:27,909 --> 02:13:32,769
ultimately if you're washing and

2759
02:13:30,909 --> 02:13:34,510
pressing you'll see all kinds of

2760
02:13:32,770 --> 02:13:37,950
variations it's really interesting

2761
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:41,440
sometimes you see like a second run

2762
02:13:37,949 --> 02:13:43,869
seventy-three very small and then the

2763
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:47,379
third run really big and the first one

2764
02:13:43,869 --> 02:13:48,909
in the third run is so much better than

2765
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:51,239
the second even when you go to press it

2766
02:13:48,909 --> 02:13:53,829
I just find it fascinating it's like

2767
02:13:51,238 --> 02:13:55,449
when friend she was talking to me one

2768
02:13:53,829 --> 02:13:57,789
time about a lemon tree you know if

2769
02:13:55,449 --> 02:13:59,529
you've got this big lemon tree you go up

2770
02:13:57,789 --> 02:14:02,170
to it and shake it and the fruit falls

2771
02:13:59,529 --> 02:14:04,449
down you know and you grab the fruit and

2772
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:05,680
you all eat off of it you could you go

2773
02:14:04,449 --> 02:14:09,210
to it again and you shake it and shake

2774
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:11,890
it again and more fruit comes off and so

2775
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:14,800
it's just interesting how the plant when

2776
02:14:11,890 --> 02:14:15,940
you look at it in a small level the

2777
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:19,300
different trichomes how they're

2778
02:14:15,939 --> 02:14:22,299
developing you know an indoor versus an

2779
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:24,279
outdoor things that I've seen those

2780
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:26,980
those heads don't really extend out in

2781
02:14:24,279 --> 02:14:28,960
the winter cycles so you get a lot of so

2782
02:14:26,979 --> 02:14:31,689
if your plant tested you know fifteen

2783
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,399
percent THC those heads aren't extended

2784
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:35,649
all right a lot of them by the surface

2785
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:38,738
same thing with CBD mature CBD flowers

2786
02:14:35,649 --> 02:14:40,509
so it doesn't wash very well your first

2787
02:14:38,738 --> 02:14:43,449
light that gets better with in full

2788
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:45,869
season seems like the heads fully fully

2789
02:14:43,449 --> 02:14:48,880
extent and you're able to get more of

2790
02:14:45,869 --> 02:14:51,479
the resin in its full mouth

2791
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:54,400
capacity than you were in the wintertime

2792
02:14:51,479 --> 02:14:55,809
even though it's still there so it's

2793
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:57,639
kind of like the Sun itself and

2794
02:14:55,810 --> 02:15:00,190
intensity of the Sun itself allows for

2795
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:03,070
the secretion and to push up higher into

2796
02:15:00,189 --> 02:15:04,689
its head into its sack and if the sun's

2797
02:15:03,069 --> 02:15:06,789
not there the intensity is not there it

2798
02:15:04,689 --> 02:15:10,779
doesn't probably push up it's not

2799
02:15:06,789 --> 02:15:12,430
secreting up and it kind of has more of

2800
02:15:10,779 --> 02:15:16,199
an oil at its surface instead of a

2801
02:15:12,430 --> 02:15:18,579
little bit away from it but with indoor

2802
02:15:16,199 --> 02:15:20,139
you know there's a bandages to endure if

2803
02:15:18,579 --> 02:15:23,199
you're looking at football fresh frozen

2804
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:25,150
indoor you if you had a very even canopy

2805
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:25,800
of the same variety you've been growing

2806
02:15:25,149 --> 02:15:28,589
in a while

2807
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:30,329
under a certain intensity of light you

2808
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:32,730
tend this and you're gonna grow to an

2809
02:15:30,329 --> 02:15:36,149
exact date you know you tend to see very

2810
02:15:32,729 --> 02:15:38,069
uniform head structure and that distance

2811
02:15:36,149 --> 02:15:39,899
from the plant so if you tested

2812
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:43,170
something that's 25 percent 20 percent

2813
02:15:39,899 --> 02:15:45,750
indoor like oh we got a 14 percent yield

2814
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:48,989
of that 14 percent yield you'll get a

2815
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:51,930
good 30 percent plus a full mouth you

2816
02:15:48,989 --> 02:15:55,529
know where you might you might have a

2817
02:15:51,930 --> 02:16:00,659
big wide gap of varieties if it was an

2818
02:15:55,529 --> 02:16:05,369
outdoor winter cycle you know so there's

2819
02:16:00,659 --> 02:16:07,380
there's places for it all well that's

2820
02:16:05,369 --> 02:16:08,939
what the reality of seasons you know in

2821
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:11,850
farming you know you have to deal with

2822
02:16:08,939 --> 02:16:13,679
the those changes that are gonna happen

2823
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:17,180
depending on what season you're growing

2824
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:17,180
as well as which one you're processing

2825
02:16:20,989 --> 02:16:36,239
