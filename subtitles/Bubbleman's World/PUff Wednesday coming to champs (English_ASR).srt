11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,000

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,558

right now we'll go see those later and

23
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,319
John has finished some so you've already

24
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,319
seen us run fresh frozen and turn it

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,158
into unbelievable quality melt but this

26
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,478
dude how do you even describe this part

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,640
um well it's like a bloody treat it's

28
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,920
it's it like I was telling Mark in the

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
past of what it was doing to my room so

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,560
understand we did the fresh frozen on

31
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,798
Mark's birthday so I took it down a week

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,600
well that the day before on the 30th now

33
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,920
this went for another 2 and 1 half weeks

34
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:43,000
and uh so this this has just turned out

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,040
amazing this literally has got to be

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,599
some of the

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,560
nicest tastiest weed that I've ever

38
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,000
grown as in not being a cush for an

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,879
exotic it is crazy well I can tell you

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
from my perspective um it almost looks

41
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,039
grapefruit esque this looks like what

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,478
the grapefruit used to look like back in

43
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,320
the day

44
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,959
and when I used to be a cannabis broker

45
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,959
when I used to actually broker cannabis

46
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,878
this was the dream you could flip any

47
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,199
amount of this in any amount of time it

48
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,239
was just uh it's perfect herb it's light

49
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,759
colored very lime green you know oh look

53
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,719

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,598
up we got the first bounce ah so of

55
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,120
course John did it over the screens

56
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,439
that's what I always do no and I uh what

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,519

Grail of hash it's right there and it's

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
not that much you know there's only

109
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,959
about four or five rips each out of the

110
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,038
whole thing that I because of I'm not

111
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:46,959
I'm not raping it I'm just I'm just

112
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:50,000
trimming it so of course the

113
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,799
exhale lovely and did you bounce this

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,038
over your 140 or did you do the two-

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,759
screen trick with the 250 and the 180 I

116
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,478
actually just did the regular Note 2

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,759
screen Tri what I do I can tell because

118
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,680
of the little black dots in yeah no it's

119
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,240
just what you know how I do it it's

120
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,600
still very pure though I'll tell you

121
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,240
that melts like crazy you should next

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,720
time do your first bounce on those two

123
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,000
screens we're going to do that I se know

124
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,960
that's why I gave them to you

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,839
oh I'm used to my big 2x4 screen they're

126
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,839
awesome but awesome just to do a light

127
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,719
light bounce but definitely we saw it at

128
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,318
Matts the quality of the resin that came

129
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,880
out just for that small small small it

130
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,240
was 99% head yeah no definitely I'm

131
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,038
going to grab that down I'd say this

132
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,319
can't be too far

133
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,038
away oh my God does it ever grab you in

134
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,720
the throat too it definitely melts very

135
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,560
nicely we're going to we're going to be

136
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,080
able to see that underneath those photos

137
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,240
but by looking at it little grains of

138
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,359
sand yeah super blonde and and and

139
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,918
beautiful that's the when I see that I

140
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,560
see grains of sand I know I'm happy so

141
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,719
as you can see not that

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,519
much yeah it's not

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,400
much but it's

144
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,079
beautiful I'll give you a little uh

145
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,359
close closeup of it with the camera it's

146
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,120
uh yeah it's beautiful it's the first

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,720

lots of full melt bubble the fresh

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,879

for me this is really nice yeah I I've

164
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,519
been really pushing medy to its those

165
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,399
limits lately I've been taking it like

166
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,038
you know day 885 day 90 that's great um

167
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,839
just just going crazy with it because

168
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:57,959
it's doing it for because there are no

169
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,598
limits and that's what I'm kind of

170
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,000
trying to show in when I'm doing my

171
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,759
grows that uh you don't necessarily have

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,360
to be super hung up on the flowering

173
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,879
periods just grow your plants uh for

174
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,720
resin and grow resin look at the resin

175
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,599
like you grew resins so many people

176
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,599
would have cut that down way before Oh

177
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,560
months like a month it just keeps

178
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,360
growing resins certain strains will just

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,120
keep producing tricomes and those are

180
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,240
the strains you want to find and those

181
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,439
are the strains you want to grow I mean

182
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,000
at least they are the ones I want to

183
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,918
find and I want to grow I guess I should

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,478
repeat myself these two are definitely

185
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,959
full melt killer quality oh yeah full

186
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,560
melt certified 100% 100% so we

187
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,918
definitely have the two full melt

188
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,478
certified strains here um which is uh

189
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,478
well I don't have any full melt of the

190
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,439
of the medic cush of the first bounce

191
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,120
because um well it's my medicine so it's

192
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,959
at home yeah

193
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,560
perfect

194
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,198
awesome well maybe we'll uh take you

195
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,199
down and show you a little bit of what's

196
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,360
going on in the other Garden the little

197
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,800
garden behind me of course is the Barb

198

201
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,520
doing too from when we brought them here

202
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,318
yeah this one this one's grown like I

203
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,519
mean

204
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,439

205
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,758
video in six 6 to 8 in this one's only

206
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,240
grown literally maybe 2 to 4 Ines these

207
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,319
ones are a couple inches these ones are

208
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,240
maybe like three to four but these barbs

209
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,840
have literally grown like a huge chunk

210
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,360

light fan that blows across them it's a

216
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:43,439
