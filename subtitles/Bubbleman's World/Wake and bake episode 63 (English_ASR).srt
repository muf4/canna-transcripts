doing good we were talking a little bit

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,670
about people were talking a little bit

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,399
about you know how you finding a

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,870
cultivar that is mold resistant and/or a

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,609
cultivar that is good for the west coast

23
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:01,709
everyone wants to know what a good good

24
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,840
cultivar is for their environment so a

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,719
real simple way is for people that can't

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,030
seem to find the truth out there is to

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,010
do some simple research research where

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,349
your environment is are you in a dry

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,540
area like in Arizona are you in a wet

30
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,949
area like in Washington those two areas

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,950
are very different and they're going to

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,509
have you know certain things will be

33
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,670
easier to grow there and it's very

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,009
simple powder is powdery mildew

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,540
resistant cultivars generally come from

36
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,759
the tropics they've spent you know

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,560
generation upon generation growing in

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,569
the tropics where mildew exists and so

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,500
they've created resistance ease to it

40
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:39,929
and you know cultivars like Afghan ease

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,420
that are in the dry arid mountain ranges

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,250
that do not have have never been around

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,469
powdery mildew they have no resistance

44
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,509
to it they almost attract it so you plug

45
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,489
it in on the west coast somewhere you're

46
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,590
oh geez and of course you see the

47
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,319
pattern of many many many many many many

48
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,259
people getting powdery mildew so there's

49
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:02,938
a lot of that we're going on the worst

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,859
alive aren't we over here well good all

51
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,809
right good we're good I thought we maybe

52
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,530
we're dead out there for a minute so hey

53
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,069
let's do something fun let's give away a

54
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,340
bottle of DC glass cleaner really

55
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:18,039
the wick really quick talking like my

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,239
son putting an L in front of everything

57
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:23,688
the video that we're going to be asking

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,000
the question for today is called it's a

59
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:27,709
puff Wednesday so it's called puff

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,408
Wednesday and then it is called

61
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:36,259
mothership elite 3d EXO fab session so

62
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:38,658
if you like I could potentially plug

63
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:42,858
that in for you guys because it is a

64
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:43,848
little bit of a little bit of a all

65
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:46,010
right here we go

66
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,149
so there is the name of the video right

67
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,938
there puff Wednesday mothers should

68
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,379
believe through the EXO fab session it's

69
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:53,930
in the first few minutes of the video

70
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:57,138
and what I want to know is it's actually

71
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,760
in the first two and a half minutes of

72
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,409
the video so if you watch the first two

73
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,078
and a half minutes of the video all I

74
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:06,168
want you to tell me is what happens

75
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,459
that's a little out of the ordinary what

76
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,169
happens in the first two and a half

77
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,780
minutes that's kind of like a little

78
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:14,180
shocking and if you can tell me that

79
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,769
remember I am the pump I don't want to

80
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,699
hear any whining when you've mentioned

81
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:22,579

he did that in that video if you watch I

103
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:23,659
don't even react I actually watched it

104
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:27,150
later and was like wow

105
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,160
ship just take out like a $14,000 chip

106
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:30,359

107
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:36,060
I'll have you know so that's only about

108
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:38,759
seventy thousand can us so not quite not

109
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,680
quite as crazy as one might think so I

110
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:45,060
guess it's time for a wake and bake here

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,540
ya little vatican bacon well hash stuck

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,949
to the bottom of my pipe will be open

113
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,340
when across this border mine had holes

114
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:56,069
poked in safety seal ooh

115
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:58,169
that's weird that's okay though if they

116
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,620
want to open it no problem they can open

117
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,780
it new problem what's a website to get

118
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,230
the glass cleaner uh try googling it nor

119
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:10,049
cows nugget I think it's uh Amazon but

120
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,280
try googling dark crystal glass and you

121
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,199
should come up with it pretty fast

122
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,599
missed the giveaway hey let's actually

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,539
do a rip here what the hell too much

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
time

125
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:24,710
all right so this will go till about 50

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,030
and it's time for a bong rip it's time

127
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:28,060
for a little wake and bake it's time to

128
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:34,069
get ourselves inspired it's time to feed

129
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,660
our endocannabinoids systems uh hasn't

130
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:37,250
left a film on my quartz it could leave

131
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,460
a film on your quartz if you left it

132
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,399
there but I just clean mine up with with

133
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,469
the q-tips and it's been fine but I'm

134
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:49,279
definitely not forcing anyone to use a

135
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,890
DC glass cleaner I just myself find that

136
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,799
it's very convenient and useful and for

137
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,719
those of you that don't that's cool too

138
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,100
but man I've always thought another

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,320
means produce move but it's not clear

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,810
your mind Papa Papa what's your secret

141
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,649
thought it's well it's just my the way I

142
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:08,560
am Brandon it's just how I operate would

143
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,069
you give us an inspiring story about

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,410
educating people about the

145
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,990
endocannabinoids system well I mean it's

146
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,090
a pretty incredible system you know I

147
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,420
would look at into dr. William Courtney

148
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:22,419
dr. Bob malla me dr. David Allen and

149
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,970
probably a few that I'm forgetting about

150
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,370
it's a very important system it's it's

151
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,470
almost like the crank of two wheels that

152
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,259
turn and the two we are the two pedals

153
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,670
that turn are the central nervous system

154
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,649
in the immune system and when you get

155
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,840
that crank going perfect

156
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:41,779
there's homeostasis that's creative and

157
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,699
you get your healthy your body is

158
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:45,169
communicating as your body is unable to

159
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,939
communicate and remember it's

160
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,470
communicating because it's operating all

161
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,509
of your biological functions it's

162
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,420
responsible for all of your biological

163
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,659
functions it's pretty heavy its turf up

164
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,660
shall we

165
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:29,709
oh yeah nice and low temp there well

166
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,789
there's always a little trick when you

167
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:37,870
get a real nice low temper you can just

168
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:51,370
give it another snack boom that ought to

169
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:57,939
do it no need to waste it hey Alan I'm a

170
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:59,949
bubble man's younger brother actually I

171
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:03,339
really only need to kill clean the

172
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:12,250
banger the rig was cleaned yesterday

173
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:16,989
midday when you puff the kill that [ __ ]

174
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:18,720
reclaims pretty fast clean that banger

175
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,879
pretty nice

176
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,770
judy judy judy well today I was gonna

177
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,600
talk a little bit about bubble hash you

178
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:30,419
know I was gonna talk a little bit about

179
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,810
some of the tips and tricks that I have

180
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:37,810
found useful over the years one of the

181
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,059
things for sure is people that have

182
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,649
washed using the bubble bags water this

183
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,629
is a water extraction process for those

184
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:45,899
of you that don't know I've often

185
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:48,549
wondered why they're getting a cleaner

186
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:52,149
material out of the second batch this is

187
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:54,250
because they have not done a proper pre

188
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,110
cleaning so if you're using outdoor

189
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,909
material if you're using material where

190
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,629
the people have been sweeping a lot in

191
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:04,419
their rooms and don't have proper clean

192
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,828
I'm the more licensed production

193
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,809
facilities that I go into the more

194
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:09,939
professional builds and greenhouses that

195
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:12,669
I go into the more I cringe at the

196
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,370
thought of black pots on a concrete

197
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:17,919
basement floor with dirt all over the

198
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,889
place it's how I started I'll admit it

199
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,958
it's fine for a personal grow but I

200
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:26,379
don't think it's the best situation to

201
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,508
be growing for other people so these are

202
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,000
little errors that can happen and what

203
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:33,068
happens is is you get dust all over the

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,190
plant little little bits of dirt and

205
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:37,929
dust and so a great way to get that get

206
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,370
rid of that is to take that material so

207
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:41,828
you've got a pound you're gonna run a

208
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,500
pound at a time maybe in a twenty gallon

209
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:46,629
kit you take that pound and you put it

210
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,278
inside I like to use kind of like one of

211
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:51,399
those portable sinks that you clean

212
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:53,588
dishes in when you have fans kick mad

213
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,139
[ __ ] up especially if the shit's there

214
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,790
to kick up in the first place but a

215
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,350
portable little plastic sink that's

216
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:01,539
about this tall and I'll put the

217
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,889
material in at all gently massage it I

218
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,809
don't want to knock off any glandular

219
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:09,519
trichomes heads what I really want to do

220
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:11,619
is I want to make sure that I am

221
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,629
allowing the dirt in the debris to

222
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,269
dislodge and it will sink immediately

223
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,948
and I just kind of massage it very

224
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,230
gentle and this is one of those things

225
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:22,479
that is hard to teach it's very much

226
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,670
like sieving someone asked me the other

227
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,709
day what's the best temperature how much

228
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:28,419
moisture should I leave behind before I

229
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,869
see even I said well that's the tricky

230
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,870
part

231
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,000
therein lies the conundrum there is no

232
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,149
perfect number each and every time it's

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,419
variables that occur and they have got

234
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,490
to be learned to be seen you have to

235
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:43,688
learn to recognize what you're looking

236
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,519
at and when you have a really high

237
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:48,250
quality resin and you don't know it and

238
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,929
you press too much moisture out with the

239
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,730
pressing screen well you've just pressed

240
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:52,958
that patty now you're gonna have to

241
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,629
throw it in the freezer and you're going

242
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,429
to be forced to microplane I'm

243
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,769
microplane only when I'm forced to

244
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:02,409
microplane I feel that micro planing

245
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:05,110
shreds the heads it opens them up it

246
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:08,438
really it opens them up to oxygen and to

247
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,539
light and not necessarily the worst

248
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:11,528
thing in the world but for me I prefer

249
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,799
my micro

250
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:17,649
encapsulated resin glands to be micro

251
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,588
encapsulated not shredded so that's

252
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,059
that's how I like I learned a lot thanks

253
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,649
for helping me step up my game so yeah

254
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:26,588
in the in the pro in the regards to

255
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,480
these these things are hard to learn you

256
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:30,129
know how gentle do you massage because

257
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,839
some people might massage so and then

258
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:33,490
you realize you've knocked a bunch of

259
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,740
resin off now of course that resin will

260
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,778
be easily trapped but it'll be trapped

261
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,879
with all that dirt and debris ie take

262
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:42,490
the water from that container pour it

263
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,959
through a 25 or a 45 micron bag you'll

264
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,990
catch all the heads but you'll see how

265
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:49,058
much contaminant is in there for real

266
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:52,110
same thing with the moisture content of

267
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:55,328
the patty very very tricky to know I

268
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,269
always say the cold of the room the more

269
00:11:55,328 --> 00:12:00,248
of a sweet spot you'll open up ie if

270
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,769
you're in a warmer environment and you

271
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:04,709
have high quality resin it'll be easier

272
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:07,058
to [ __ ] up and be forced to microplane

273
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:10,088
before you know it then it would be in a

274
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:12,519
colder environment the water content is

275
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:15,220
what's going to allow the the hash to

276
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,889
sieve perfectly through the sieve okay

277
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,720
that water content you have to know what

278
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,000
it is I can't there's no numbers I can

279
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,709
explain to people I don't know the

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,929
numbers each and every time they change

281
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,938
and the variables change depending on

282
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:30,308
the size of the head depending on the

283
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:33,068
percentage of wax membrane versus oil

284
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:35,799
inside the head all of these little

285
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:37,719
variables that take place create the

286
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,028
effects that you end up with and it

287
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,470
really is a feel it's much like when you

288
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:45,338
heard chimera if you were watching

289
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,959
hashed Church yesterday say you're like

290
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,610
the hash whisperer it's not like you

291
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,528
were just pressing that hash you were

292
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,659
you were listening to it you were

293
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:54,730
looking at it you were smelling it and

294
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:57,129
I'm like yeah I use all my senses when I

295
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,579
when I make hash that's how I feel I'm

296
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:02,740
at my best when I can can you dry out a

297
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:05,229
patty of hash successfully well Ryan no

298
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,079
you can't and yes you can is the quick

299
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,749
question now say Ryan that you are in

300
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,239
Arizona and you were talking about a 25

301
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:15,278
micron patty but you just say patty 25

302
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,769
micron heads are so much smaller that

303
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,259
they have less picture marbles in a bowl

304
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,500
large marbles in a bowl will create

305
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,700
larger spaces between the marbles

306
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,669
smaller marbles in the

307
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,528
will create much much smaller spaces so

308
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:32,189
less room for water to be trapped

309
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:35,169
seemingly easier for the patty to dry

310
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:38,410
higher quality larger heads very

311
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:40,229
impossible to to draw a patty like that

312
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:43,659
particularly if you're not in Arizona

313
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,370
but you're up in Washington State so

314
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:47,139
often people forget to mention the

315
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,700
variables when they ask questions or

316
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,019
when they answer questions or when

317
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,390
they're telling people and teaching

318
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,070
people they teach them based on the

319
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,809
variables in the environment that they

320
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,310
themselves are used to but you have to

321
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,199
understand I've been doing this for

322
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:02,018
almost 20 years and about five to eight

323
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,149
years ago I came under the understanding

324
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:06,549
that I'm talking to the world and that

325
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,320
everyone has different environmental

326
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:12,849
variables and now I have to take that

327
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,709
into account so this is very this is

328
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,180
where in lies the confusion when we're

329
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:19,268
trying to learn about these simple

330
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:21,009
processes so the real answer to all of

331
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,690
your questions is this how do I get

332
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:24,578
better how do I make the best hash

333
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,649
you're going to have to make some

334
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:29,319
mistakes you're going to have to stop

335
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,250
being afraid to [ __ ] up and jump in with

336
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,699
both feet

337
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,860
happily ready to [ __ ] up because in that

338
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:38,679
[ __ ] up you are going to learn so

339
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,930
much more than me or anyone else could

340
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:44,439
possibly teach you but I think it's

341
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:46,689
probably the most valuable thing that I

342
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,480
could say that if you listen to anything

343
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,980
that I said today and don't it's it

344
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,289
sounds like a great quote and all but

345
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,199
really think about it go make your

346
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:57,909
mistakes we all fear them weak nobody

347
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,319
wants to make their mistakes we get into

348
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:02,259
a position where we're like we want to

349
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,300
play it safe but when you really start

350
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:07,629
doubling down and you jump in with both

351
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:10,948
feet each and every time the mistakes

352
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:13,299
are priceless they are they are not

353
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:17,019
costly mistakes they are valuable

354
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:21,849
lessons so that's what I could say about

355
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:24,399
that awesome drew good to hear pharmacy

356
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:29,019
bro in the house bingo Lombardi sticks

357
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,490
with Terps Jeff Roe áall oh yeah that

358
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:32,019
was pretty good little knowledge drop I

359
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,560
think it only lasted about seven minutes

360
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:37,480
but yeah so those are the two parts in

361
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,989
my opinion getting your material clean

362
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,519
the processing part is

363
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,320
super-easy I mean putting in the ice and

364
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,088
putting in the material and dropping it

365
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,520
into a machine and turning a dial and

366
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,250
filtering it through bags a monkey could

367
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,230
do that let's be honest lifting up the

368
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,750
bags and scooping it out with a spoon a

369
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,370
small child could do that now I'm not

370
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,230
condoning that small children go and

371
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,509
make hashish I don't want to get myself

372
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,759
into any trouble but I'm just saying

373
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,088
it's so easy to scoop it out the really

374
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,179
only hard part is when you're going to

375
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,800
be drawing it or preparing it for drying

376
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:12,349
and curing if you don't do that

377
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:14,479
correctly you could make all sorts of

378
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,370
mistakes for instance I told people four

379
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,769
years on the west coast particularly in

380
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,019
my area that if you wanted to get the

381
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,389
moisture out in the west coast in the

382
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,429
winter or fall it would be a good idea

383
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:27,649
to use a desiccant I found food grade

384
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:29,028
cardboard to be the safest it didn't

385
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:30,940
contaminate in any way but that's

386
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:33,889
because I was sieving my powder

387
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,890
spreading it thin and always when people

388
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:39,139
send me pictures of cardboard with piles

389
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,028
of hash on and I'm like no no no no no

390
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:44,899
no minimal you have to you have to

391
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:47,509
basically squeeze stretch that out thin

392
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,220
it out I want it very very thin so it

393
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:51,769
almost looks like nothing's there it

394
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,690
can't be touching itself and if it is

395
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,370
touching itself it'll create larger

396
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,540
patties that will stick together and

397
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,669
then it will pull cardboard fibers off

398
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:03,409
now I photograph all my hash with a

399
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:05,808
macro photograph so when I have someone

400
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:07,939
who's done it incorrectly pull up a big

401
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:09,500
patty of hash with cardboard fibers on

402
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,600
it and tell me that I'm an idiot because

403
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,390
I'm using a desiccant that allows fibers

404
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,178
to be pulled into the final product

405
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,209
I say no you are doing it incorrectly

406
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:21,949
and if you follow the rule not the rules

407
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,189
but the the simple directions

408
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,050
instructions if you will you will do

409
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,880
that it will come out the right way you

410
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:33,069
know you can't change a bunch of things

411
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,070
and then expect it to come out the same

412
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:38,919
well here's the thing about the

413
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,710
parchment paper it works to a degree I

414
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,450
now use pizza boxes for years now where

415
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,009
I closed it over the parchment paper

416
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,140
that I have in the bottom and it's very

417
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:49,269
very nice in that sense and the part and

418
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,160
the cardboard surrounding it still

419
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,319
manages to pull out the moisture but

420
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,500
there are some hashes that really do

421
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:59,139
require the direct surface area of the

422
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,049
desiccant the parchment of course is not

423
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,840
a desiccant it will not really absorb

424
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:07,269
too much water it will for a little bit

425
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,769
but it won't it not it doesn't disperse

426
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:11,410
it and dry out the same way that

427
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:13,720
cardboard does so yeah definitely be

428
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,100
very careful what's going on the hash

429
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,740
blade sounds great but it's not how the

430
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,449
alternative music okay yeah you know

431
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,700
what pharmacy I can't even remember if I

432
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,620
said anything to you I was a little you

433
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,870
know someone said something earlier they

434
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,969
had said oh hi times blah blah blah blah

435
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:29,829
but I won't go on in a rant and I was

436
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,380
like oh thank you like in my hand I said

437
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:34,299
thank you and I thought yeah pharmacy

438
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,040
was ranting it's like dude you know what

439
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,200
I would say get in touch with him if you

440
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,019
want to offer help and make it better

441
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,819
but yeah it's hard to rant you know it

442
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,740
got away from him last year he's a good

443
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:46,299
dude man he means well and he's really

444
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,809
like he's good people

445
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:51,279
so yeah just I'm sure that he's just

446
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,559
trying to make it the best event that he

447
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,500
can and anytime you make something like

448
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:59,500
that I'm sure there's gonna be

449
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,930
impossible logistics to deal with have I

450
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,230
ever been to a volcano well yes I have

451
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:09,670
I've been to volcanoes before I guess

452
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:12,190
one was in Panama shell in Guatemala I

453
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,370
think there it's surrounded by volcanoes

454
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,410
actually I can't remember Santa Cruz and

455
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:21,579
there's like two or three of them right

456
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,920
there but yes I have well you know what

457
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:26,619
listen Indra and Todd constantly we're

458
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,080
getting into it I love them both I did I

459
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:32,919
do feel that when Indra originally came

460
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:35,049
on he spoke a lot more about just his

461
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,269
stories and cool things and since it's

462
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,279
turned into a business for him he's

463
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:41,079
really just talks about the business end

464
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,769
of it it's always about his product it's

465
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,689
always about something that he's do

466
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:48,019
that's gonna be a business and I'm

467
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,809
really really really careful to not try

468
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,660
and over promote any of us you know I

469
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:55,519
don't really promote bubble bags you

470
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,279
don't hear me promoting my products on

471
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,410
hash church because hash Church has it's

472
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,359
gotten a little bit bigger than us if

473
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:08,029
you would you know it's bigger than me

474
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:10,039
for sure I want it to be the most like I

475
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:11,899
don't want it to be promotions you know

476
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,579
I want us to promote what we believe in

477
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,700
and I understand that he believes in his

478
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:20,449
product so and I believe in mine but we

479
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:24,529
have to we really have to maintain an

480
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,850
integrity so Todd had brought on Tim as

481
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:28,369
a guest and I just thought out of

482
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,990
respect Todd is really much more than

483
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:33,919
someone who wants to come on and promote

484
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:37,700
the products that he's selling and he's

485
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,440
more along the lines of wanting church

486
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,180
to be the best that it can he's trying

487
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,549
to bring great people and trying to

488
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,500
create great dialogue and to me that's

489
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:48,349
really really important now don't get me

490
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,660
wrong I'm stoked interest God all his

491
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:52,939
businesses and I think like I'm I'm not

492
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,340
upset with Indra it's just like imagine

493
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,170
that hash search is bigger than us you

494
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:00,439
know Todd may come off as a dick but

495
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,269
he's not trust me he's just he's just a

496
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,370
unique person that has a really unique

497
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:06,559
foundation all of this that came out of

498
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:09,079
almost dying as a child

499
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,659
so his cannabis and he's gone to prison

500
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:15,980
for four you know five years of his life

501
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:18,460
he served in a penitentiary I I really

502
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,539
love Todd he's a great friend of mine so

503
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,640
it's okay if you have your opinion about

504
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,139
him for sure but just be careful at

505
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,070
knowing that he is really one of my

506
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,070
close friends and

507
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,660
yeah I don't you know I don't I mean

508
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,519
you know Sam's Salmon injury used to get

509
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,470
into it as well and I don't I hate the

510
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,599
idea of people like trying to tell

511
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,920
people who they should thank you know

512
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,389
that was one of the things that didn't

513
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,730
sit well with me when people would say

514
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,410
oh Rick Simpson turned me on to this and

515
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,870
it saved my life and then Andrew would

516
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,519
say well you need to thank me I showed

517
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:51,379
him how to do that and it was like no

518
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,299
you didn't show him how to do that it's

519
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,270
he's making something different so I

520
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:58,099
love him he will be back on hash Church

521
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:59,720
he's not kicked off by any means but I

522
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,759
have to let people know every once in a

523
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,910
while that no one owns a position on

524
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,549
hash Church hash Church is ever changing

525
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,000
the panel changes different people come

526
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,149
on

527
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and if someone is not on it doesn't mean

528
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,759
necessarily that they're in the outs

529
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,450
with hashed church so I still support

530
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,099
Indra

531
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,690
I'm glad his businesses are doing good

532
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:23,809
and I want people to go and check out

533
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,390
his product you know I did ask him if he

534
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,609
wouldn't you know stay in the chat or in

535
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,320
coming to you know we asked are you mad

536
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:32,029
at me and I said well I don't just want

537
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,250
you to come in and turn it into a

538
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,500
commercial for your product and I will

539
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,970
say that I listen I watched him in the

540
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,640
chat room the whole time and it was

541
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,470
pretty much a commercial for his product

542
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,060
like he's I understand that I've created

543
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,730
the place for him to come and sell his

544
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:49,759
product but even the chat I would love

545
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,220
the chat to be about what we're talking

546
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,990
about I would love the chat to not be

547
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,079
people who want to come in and promote

548
00:22:53,990 --> 00:23:00,559
themselves and so that's just where I'm

549
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:03,319
coming from that's where my that's my

550
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,720
opinion so I hope I didn't offend anyone

551
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,839
by saying that I sure don't I like I

552
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,509
love those guys they're amazing and

553
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:13,789
having Indra come on hash Church has

554
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:17,000
been a huge blessing you know but I just

555
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:19,579
I just think that people have to stop

556
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,890
overly advert I mean even Tony who's

557
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:23,750
like constantly doing it do you see how

558
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,759
much he dials back and doesn't self

559
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,490
promote even though it's hard for him to

560
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,259
talk about prana or the bubble man brand

561
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,779
or blue river because those are the

562
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:35,119
things that he's doing constantly and

563
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,430
he's innovating and he loves to share so

564
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,500
it's it's very different you know I have

565
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,660
to be careful I just I don't

566
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,539
want you guys to think that one day hash

567
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,769
Church has turned into some sellout

568
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,210
promotional thing where everyone's just

569
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,389
there

570
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,160
you know from self promoting so I think

571
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,780
it's bigger than us and I think that you

572
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,000
guys like it because of that and I think

573
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:57,920
that if we change that it's a tough

574
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,680
position pharmacy bro you know it's a

575
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,330
tough position for sure hey you know

576
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,490
what don't Bret maverick I'll say this

577
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:06,710
about Bret maverick I [ __ ] like Bret

578
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,140
maverick I think he's a character I

579
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,029
think he means well I don't think he's a

580
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,160
bad person I don't know enough about him

581
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:15,859
but I kind of get a kick out of him and

582
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,800
a few things that he said have have

583
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:20,689
really made me laugh and I there's a

584
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,819
good reason why that guy has a following

585
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,410
and anytime anyone has a following

586
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:27,470
there's gonna be a small group of people

587
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,920
who just hate the guy and say negative

588
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,870
mean nasty things and I don't really see

589
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,539
what the purpose is you know I don't

590
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:37,699
really see what the purpose is yeah he

591
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:40,099
is what he is I'll get him on again Chaz

592
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,390
the banger exactly Bret brought us the

593
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:46,399
Banger chasm so yeah you know trying to

594
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:50,509
do that trying to do that mama trying to

595
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,370
keep it positive and yeah just trying to

596
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:53,690
we please explain the process of

597
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:55,339
spreading the hash thin and what you

598
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,289
used to do so while kicking me out it's

599
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:59,389
very simple I'll put a first of all when

600
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,250
I say get a piece of cardboard I it's

601
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,470
not a small piece it has to be like an

602
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,299
extra-large pizza box or something now

603
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,009
if you had a very small amount you might

604
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:10,159
be able to do all the bags on there and

605
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:12,109
just do a with a marker as you how it is

606
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,269
is simple okay imagine you have a cheese

607
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:16,519
grater or not a cheese grater a parmesan

608
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:18,349
grater okay because that falls a little

609
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,029
closer to what we're looking for so

610
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:23,929
imagine I have it up here and I'm doing

611
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:27,470
this if I don't move the grater it all

612
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:30,799
falls in a pile on top of my pasta but

613
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:33,170
if I move it around the pasta I can put

614
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,720
a thin layer as thin as I want or as

615
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:38,810
thick as I want evenly spread over the

616
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,370
surface area of what I want covered so

617
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,169
yes I have videos where I'm doing this

618
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,669
and you can see it it's easier to see in

619
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,039
person but we're talking about it we're

620
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:49,640
here why not answer the question so I

621
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:51,769
gently will push now I'm using a cold

622
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,770
spoon and I'm using small amounts of

623
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:54,150
bubble in a cold

624
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:55,740
environment if I'm in a warmer

625
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,810
environment I'll use even smaller

626
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:02,309
amounts of bubble keeping the other ones

627
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:04,349
cold for to just keep that structure of

628
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,359
how it wants to fluff and fall apart if

629
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:08,069
you allow it to self press and gravity

630
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,259
to hold upon it and more moisture to

631
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:12,329
remove you'll be forced to freeze it in

632
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:15,509
microplane which is going to bust up all

633
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:17,970
the heads so spreading it thin is easy

634
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:19,799
from my perspective you just great

635
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,350
not great sorry push with the spoon

636
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:26,009
gently through the sieve and it'll fall

637
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:28,319
like little droplets now just spread it

638
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:30,180
thin there's nothing no tool you can use

639
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,309
because it's wet bubble if you try to

640
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,769
use anything to eat to move that stuff

641
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:37,829
around now that it's fallen it'll be a

642
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:40,109
nightmare it has to fall properly and

643
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:42,299
that's how it has to get there everybody

644
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:43,919
understands past that just keep them in

645
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,389
about the meds sharing the process and

646
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,519
helping people get quality if the leaves

647
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:50,190
them to your products great that's what

648
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,960
I say big squirrel nuts that's exactly

649
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,360
big squirrel nuts basically nailed it

650
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,160
right there look I'm not opposed to me

651
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,259
or my friends selling a product that

652
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,230
people are stoked about having it's why

653
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,940
I talk about the cleaner it's why I talk

654
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,880
about little things that I like I don't

655
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,340
like a ton of things in the industry I I

656
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,170
have a fairly you know most of the

657
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,169
things in the industry I'm kind of like

658
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,730
that's not something I will have a use

659
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,550
for but when I find something I have a

660
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,680
use for I'm extremely excited to show it

661
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:21,269
to people and I don't get paid by these

662
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,230
companies they don't give me shares and

663
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:24,329
their companies they don't give me

664
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,000
anything so yeah well sometimes they'll

665
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:29,309
give me products and now I'm just giving

666
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,680
all those away too so I'll keep it like

667
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,059
they don't give me anything

668
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,789
although friends still do give me little

669
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,460
gifts that I appreciate and am very

670
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,529
thankful for Aloha rich Griggs from

671
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,860
Hawaii I hope you're having a beautiful

672
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:45,660
wonderful day in paradise really I mean

673
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:47,490
[ __ ] people go there travel from across

674
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,220
the world just to visit for a week and

675
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:54,359
you get to live there bro so boom that's

676
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:56,279
awesome yeah there you go what's with

677
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,619
these thermal bangers well a banger

678
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,000
within a banger right it's just the way

679
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:03,059
you'll see all sorts of different

680
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,160
innovations with the way when we find

681
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:06,808
out the importance first of all terpenes

682
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,460
are important we finally learned

683
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:10,558
so much about that that now that we

684
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,480
understand how important they are and

685
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:16,829
what they're doing to the cannabinoids

686
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,319
that obviously how they are inhaled how

687
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:21,990
they are evaporated what surface area

688
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,628
and what temperature they are evaporated

689
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,730
at we'll have the facts on how you feel

690
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:27,329
like how they feel in your body it's a

691
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,179
fact

692
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:32,699
you hit a low temp banger it's tasty

693
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:36,240
it's beautiful it will not rock you the

694
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,159
same as a much hotter rip and also off

695
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,349
of different surface areas there are

696
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,539
subtle differences and I find that

697
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:45,359
there's a quality of preservation that

698
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:48,778
occur in surfaces that allow heat to

699
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:52,469
dissipate evenly if you will and hold

700
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:56,038
heat oh you know in but not for too long

701
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:59,759
you want it to dissipate evenly titanium

702
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:02,908
holds it for too long no bueno I'll hit

703
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:06,210
it if I have to but yes he means a

704
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:08,730
higher well no no no no no he's not he's

705
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:12,090
just meaning that of the glandular

706
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,710
trichomes heads you know the there's a

707
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:16,618
high percentage of terpenes there's

708
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,058
higher percentages of terpenes what's

709
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:20,038
the difference between a turf and a

710
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:21,749
flavonoid well I would say Google would

711
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:25,019
definitely be your friend there probably

712
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:26,960
a Wikipedia on each one would define to

713
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,298
you exactly what terpenes and terpenoids

714
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,700
what class of isoprenes those are and

715
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,798
then you could go into flavonoids I have

716
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,298
less experience with flavonoids I

717
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,700
haven't researched it as much and much

718
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:41,429
like skunkman Sam because they are non

719
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,980
active when smoked or inhaled there's

720
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:46,070
never really been a reason to try and

721
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,230
find out what was going on there Oh

722
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:50,878
where's the troll troll troll tell me

723

744
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:49,449
looking for things though - I kind of

745
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,450
remember back in the day when I was on

746
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,190
the computer just skyping strangers like

747
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,869
hey I was so excited to get Skype I

748
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,639
would just go through the Skype

749
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:59,108
directory and I would just hit people up

750
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:00,699
and I I heard some pretty incredible

751
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:02,798
conversation and then it turned into

752
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,350
every single time someone hit me up it

753
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,579
was ASL and I just turned it off and

754
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:08,738
stopped with that that must have been

755
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:12,158
like 15 years ago I don't even know but

756
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:14,739

764
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:46,469
trolling for like desperate people

765
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:49,079
usually dudes fishing at best I just

766
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,610
avoided it at all coughs never looked on

767
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,710
the internet for that it was more

768
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:56,069
interested in finding educational

769
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:57,450
information and cannabis wow look at all

770
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:59,099
the cannabis information we put on the

771
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,920
computer over the course of the last 20

772
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:06,329
years it's really been massively

773
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,860
affecting the populace people are

774
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,839
learning about this for sure don't get

775
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,329
me wrong a ton of people learn about it

776
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,129
from Sanjay Gupta and other very very

777
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:15,929
mainstream straight people that mention

778
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,540
it just in a little blurb or maybe even

779
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,370
do a whole show on it but those people

780
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:22,769
then go on to the Internet and they

781
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:37,819
start doing research and that's where

782
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:40,200
our information comes in handy oh yeah

783
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:44,789
damn cannon brah why were you expecting

784
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,210
that you might be on the wrong on the

785
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:47,210
wrong chap

786
00:32:53,368 --> 00:33:01,959
well the Cuevas are great obviously

787
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:04,389
qwave bangers are like that look top DC

788
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,358
makes them pretty damn decent bangers -

789
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:08,888
oh these are from method sevens the

790
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:11,468
glasses that I wear all the time it's a

791
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:13,598
great logo it says don't grow blind

792
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:15,070
maybe I'll hit these guys up and see if

793
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:16,689
they want to give away a few shirts or

794
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:19,509
maybe even a pair of method sevens I

795
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,200
think they were they're really generous

796
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:22,200
they always have been

797
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:30,988
yeah the claves are nice all right so

798
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:30,988
where do the DC's don't get me wrong I

799
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:39,368
mean I'm using one no I know but you

800
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:41,978
know what it's they might like it it's

801
00:33:39,368 --> 00:33:44,199
kind of like it might be nice for method

802
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:45,548
7 to get the exposure as well so I'm

803
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,499
kind of like thinking they've been so

804
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:48,819
generous to me I don't feel like I'm

805
00:33:47,499 --> 00:33:51,700
going out of my way as much as maybe

806
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:54,658
giving them an opportunity where if they

807
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,249
want to donate some shirts or whatever

808
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:03,700
we would gladly give them away on the

809
00:33:57,249 --> 00:34:06,308
