5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
uh we're about to walk into the garden

6
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,880
right now I'm just sort of uh standing

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
out in the sort of garden foyer where

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,719
they do a lot of their work I'm making

9
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,439
sure I'm keeping the camera nice and

10
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,399
close so you're not catching a glimpse

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,399
of anything that's on their boards I

12
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,160
like to keep people's privacy but the

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,679
guys at Heavenly days were nice enough

14
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,479
to let me come in and do a little

15
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,159
filming and a little macro photography

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:52,000
today and that's what I wanted to share

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,000
with you guys so uh why don't we head in

18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,198
now all right so this crop is at the end

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,879
of its life uh inspired by Remo for

20
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,960
certain with the nice 20-gallon brw

21
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,438
uh pot right at the front and he's got

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,920
some other I'm guessing those are at

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,000
least 20 gallons right at the door here

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,400
we have uh a high press sodium let me

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
make sure I get the the lights proper

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,680
here for you so we don't have to go back

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,560
and do this again let's go to man there

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,560
it is turned green that's the color we

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,439
want so this is the congales right here

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
at the start uh this congales is under a

31
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,279
high press sodium light bulb which has

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,560
been turned off for now but an

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,879
interesting fact is that he's got this

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,200
Cong

35
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,158
uh plugged in under the HPS but then

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,118
he's got another congales right over

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,680
here and this one's over a metal Hy

38
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,359
which is uh literally burning right

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,720
above us right now and producing a fine

40
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:48,078
color light at least for film so you can

41
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:51,759
see this one uh is from The High Press

42
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,758
sodium and this one is from the uh metal

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,959
Hy the metal halide buds I'm not going

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,079
to lie look a little thicker look a

45
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:02,199
little frostier interesting how a plant

46
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,839
can just decide you know you know this

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,359
particular one congales in this

48
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,280
particular environment for this

49
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,199
particular situation preferred the metal

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,039
Halli light now I wouldn't go and say

51
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,079
scientifically that you've now

52
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,479
established a scientific Truth uh it

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
just happened to work out that way in

54
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,560
this particular situation so uh

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,360
interesting things that we see in the

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,199
grow room uh uh particularly with the

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,560
exact same strain same strain different

58
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,799
lights a little bit of a different

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,878
production

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,760
value all right so we'll come back

61
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,479

everything about it and it is a monster

Vancouver ever since Steve really

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,918
stopped producing it it never went away

110
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,399
uh the smell is extremely lemony with a

111
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:45,079
mix of that exotic sativa now not a

112
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,679
spicy exotic sativa but this

113
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:52,879
really sweet and perfumey exotic sativa

114

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,000
spectacular and look at that bud how

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,560
nice that looks with the light shining

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,399
through the back

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,399
there I guess I'm shading myself

124
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,439
out

125
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,038
beautiful all right now the Le here

126
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:37,120
behind me and then we've got we've got

127
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:39,199
this big monster and this is the king

128
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,639
and the King this little bud got bent

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,038
but thank God it did because I found

130
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,079
these beautiful little pinkish hairs

131
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,599
pistolet hairs that I photographed for

132
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,359
you guys and uh I think you'll really be

133
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,319
quite happy with how those came out

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
really nice uh resin production on this

135
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,160
plant and to be honest it really just

136
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,038
smells to me like a God Bud it really

137
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,199
does smell like a God bud I think maybe

138
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,519
even Jordan uh put this together as a

139
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,400
God Bud cross and uh that's why there's

140
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:12,560
seeds available of it so nice resin

141
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,879
production um very photogenic not my

142
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,800
favorite profile um it looks like that

143
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,879
La weed that everyone wanted in the 9s

144
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,960
and uh I think it's just a left a

145
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,120
leftover remnant of that very time much

146
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,279
more impressed with these exotic sativas

147
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,240
these congales and sweet skunks and I'll

148
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,239

150
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Burmese two monster Burmese plants one

over here one over here I'll try to keep

152
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,800
the light on this side of thing so we

153
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:49,038
can get that greenish light uh from the

154
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,038
metal Hy this plant might not look that

155
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,199
great through the camera but let me tell

156
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,000
you it is absolutely spectacular I've

157
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,720

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,240
thicker vegetative Bud uh this is that

159
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,080
sort of land race sort of style uh uh

160

166
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,719
in the background here and then these

167
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,359
three in the corner here the lightest so

168
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,599
terrible I won't really bother coming

169
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
too much in here are the train wrecks so

170
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,560
that's a train wreck right there uh and

171
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,918
another train rack right beside it I

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,519
could potentially uh use my flashlight

173
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,359
to kind of give you guys a little bit of

174
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,198
a a little bit of a light there we go so

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,319
that's the train rack you can see the

176
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,840
cush like uh uh structure of the bud

177
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,840
very different from uh these other

178
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,519
sativas that uh I've been showing you

179
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,000
can tell that it's quite uh quite a

180
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,758
substantial difference there very

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
different from the sativa buds that I've

182
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,120
been

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,519
showing and uh yeah just nice little

184
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,079
nice little Crystal content on

185
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,359

186

little tour of the Heavenly days Garden

187
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,680

188
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,520

189
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,879
chemicals uh and they're producing

190
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,198
really really beautiful buds so a lot of

191
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,759
