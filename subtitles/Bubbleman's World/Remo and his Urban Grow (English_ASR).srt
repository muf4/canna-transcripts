here just uh it's about 6:00 in the

4
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,320
morning right now and I'm heading over

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to Remos to do some filming and some

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,520
puffing today um just got the mother

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,558
ship here filled up with the grunge off

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,200
and we're just going to do a

9
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:42,399
quick pouring it back into its own

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,840
bottle I love this product wake up in

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,960
the

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,199
morning I can wake up in the morning and

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,640
simply see I don't want to make a big

14
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,320
mess here but I want to share it with

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,198
you so I'll just pour that basically

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,359
right back into its

17
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,798
bottle try not to leave all of

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,159
it little bit to

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,320
spillage this stuff is basically

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,240
like a natural

21
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:17,359
cleaner just basically do a quick rinse

22
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,359
through it's going to be extremely soapy

23
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,519
grung off is is is a soapy substance I

24
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,719
think it's using

25
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,640
um he uses a a an enzyme from a soybean

26
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,319
egg but uh basically what it does is it

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,960
strips the resin off of the inside of

28
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,758
the pipe and it makes for very easy

29
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,199
cleaning all I'm doing here is rinsing

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,319
it out you'll see you get a very very

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
nice clean piece of glass so this is

32
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,758
what I do every morning this is how I

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,439
keep my whips my daily drivers I should

34
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,239
say this is how I keep my daily drivers

35
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:55,718
clean and just uh yeah nice quick rinse

36
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,759
with hot water and you've got yourself a

37
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:00,599
beautiful clean

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,478
bong I know Remo has no shortage of nice

39
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,679
glass over this place but we figured we

40
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,200
might as

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,799
well show up with a nice piece when you

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,799
show up

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,760
right all right that a little to do

44
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:25,479
it all right

45
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:28,399
so clean glass all right so let's take

46
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,399
this piece over to Remos and see what

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,760
he's saying this morning right so we got

48

49
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,280
going to put her away in

50
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,719

51
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,199
keep everything nice and clean I got my

52
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,759
controller my dnails in

53
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:50,119
here the quartz whip quartz bowl and my

54
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,239
remote control and last but not

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,840
least my

56
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,158
glass so that right there is pretty much

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,200
all you

58
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:02,239
need for denailing

59
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,039
I also have my license in there just in

60
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
case I'm pulled over at any point in

61
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,919
time it's nice to have the federal

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,239
exemption to show the RCMP that hey it's

63
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,439
okay I'm allowed to have these pounds of

64
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,239
hash all right let's get on the road and

65
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,158
head over to Remo shall we all right

66
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,719
another 6A ammer for the bubble man just

67
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:26,079
pack up my BS here in the truck and I'm

68
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,080
going to head down and check out

69
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:35,479
body alcohol can produce longlasting

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,199
changes in the neurochemistry of the

71
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,199
brain so this is really

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,120
rather because it

73
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,759
has high THC content which is boosted by

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,480
being grown

75
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,280
under how many young smokers actually

76
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,199
use is

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,598
another it is expensive and the best

78
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,119
estim suggest that

79
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:10,000
these account for just 50% of the UK

this is really rather uning have exped

but

wonderful

116

right there that is uh what I hope the

118
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:03,318
mmpr grow can produce but that I am

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,360
slightly

120
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:09,280
doubtful so yeah let's get the session

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,279
to be here dude um well thanks for

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,800
having me on your show too dude you you

125
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,478
had me on mine last time I was here and

126
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,560
that was really fun we got to make that

127
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,000
bubble with those uh I guess we were

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,879
using fresh frozen yeah and that was

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,519
what the UBC chemo cush that we got a

130
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,439
killer yield of that too actually it was

131
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,679
kind of surprised how we got you know

132
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,278
and it's interesting because I was

133
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,000
talking with um Matt from the great

134
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,838
Gardener recently and we were talking

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,839
about the difference between the oil

136
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,880
yields and the bubble yields and people

137
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,959
are always like why does the oil pull

138
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,480
out so much more yield and so he

139
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,919
actually ran fan Leaf through his Bubble

140
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,800
Bags yeah and he got all this hash uh I

141
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,639
guess they're like um um CLE heads that

142
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,759
don't have capitate stocks they just

143
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,600
grow on the leaves the stock tragon the

144
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,679
stock tricomes yeah they're they're

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,399
basically real real small little guys

146
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,039
and um he produced a bunch of it it was

147
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,919
the strangest stuff it was definitely

148
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,799
not like you know the real good stuff in

149
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:17,039
the 90 and 73 bag but uh the it

150
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,799
definitely had medicinals there 100% and

151
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,240
I and if you were to make oil out of it

152
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,399
I.E remove the oils that are in those

153
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,839
little wax membranes you know rather

154
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,159
than the way with the hash you're

155
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,000
smoking the whole wax membrane it seemed

156
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,519
like a lower grade you know what I mean

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,159
to a half guy with the oil that will

158
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,120
just get all of that resin out you know

159
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,639
not only the regular heads but in these

160
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,000
these smaller ones as well so here's a

161
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,039
side note for you um remember Jeff Tech

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,039
absolutely he uh took a bunch of stocks

163
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,519
he had L over stocks and he's what the

164
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,799
hell sort of my tumbler he tumbled it

165
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
and he got hash out it just stock no bu

166
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,799
totally believe it I was I was telling

167
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,879
these guys to do the same thing with

168
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,639
with water cuz they did the family batch

169
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,958
and I said try a stock batch the only

170
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,838
time I ever did it yeah it was the

171
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,000
whitest hash I've ever made really yeah

172
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,480
hands down it was bizarre it was it had

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,320
like no chlorophyll in it whatsoever

174
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,320
that it was just this white so here I

175
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,200
want you to push the top button on this

176
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,399
little remote control okay that's the

177
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,160
top button and what that's going to do

178
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,720
is that's going to turn on our denail oo

179
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,719
okay here we go click so that's on wow

180
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,519
just lit up yeah it'll lit up it'll go

181
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,278
off for 1 second and then it'll hit the

182
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:30,720
temperature and then we'll climb I've

183
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:32,838
got it set to about 750° f and uh yeah

184
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,440
just stok to have an electric mail

185
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,399
session with uh with rol this thing

186
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,000
looks pretty [ __ ] this thing is

187
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,120
really cool man these guys have done a

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
great job so it's it's simply put it's

189
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,000
an element you know the Box runs the

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
temperature it's they've got all these

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,480
wonderful components they're not using

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,879
the Chinese components anymore they've

193
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,639
got another British component for the

194
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,879
front piece this is going to heat up to

195
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,839
700° at 750 fhe and then I have a quartz

196
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,559
Bowl it's a little bit dirty right now I

197
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,120
usually keep it a little cleaner but

198
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,518
sweet it's machined to fit that pretty

199
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,679
much

200
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,200
perfectly that eats up the quartz to the

201
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,599
right temperature or 7° yeah or whatever

202
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,839
you want 800 900 600 it depends on sort

203
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,360
of your palette and your your flavor but

204
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,240
it's basically a nail that's always on

205
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,480
we don't have to torch so it's ready to

206
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,519
go one after another go all the time

207
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,879
beautiful yeah it's kind of a NE concept

208
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,720
absolutely we're back okay all right

209
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,480
yeah let's see we've got a little bit of

210
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,879
water actually quite a bit of water but

211
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,399
I'm okay with that the mother ship's

212
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,919
kind of a neat piece you know sometimes

213
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,159
I'll put a third of the water a half the

214
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,919
water today we got a lot in so that's

215
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,559
okay well notice there's re diffusion

216
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,919
get lots of bubbles with this prodct

217
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,759
yeah yeah absolutely they've got this

218
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,120
sort of Swiss perk happening which they

219
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,480
call the Fab and usually they blow it

220
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,560
out into an egg and then there's this

221
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
little guy right here it's a little puck

222
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,879
yeah and you can kind of see on top well

223
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,319
there's holes in it everywhere it's

224
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,620
etched it's a flower of life laser

225
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,760
etched symbol and that's where the

226
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,240
[Music]

227
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,720
bubbles come out of right out of the top

228
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,959
of that little p per so it's way for

229
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,160
thin dud yeah Mothership these guys are

230
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,039
definitely uh ahead of the game right

231
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,759
now with sort of uh the glass that

232
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,879
they're that they're producing

233
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,879
definitely a ton of talent coming out of

234
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:21,759
the mothership crew I guess somewhat

235
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,399
local too CU just over the Border just

236
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,399
right over the Border in Bellingham

237
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,078
which is which is nice so I think we're

238
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,720
going to start it off with this this is

239
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:33,919
some sweet skunk dry sips SM smells like

240
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,959
sweet dude it's 99% gland heads no

241
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,159
Waters touch this hash it's completely

242
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:41,319
dry and it's the Purity is still uh like

243
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,519
what we like with uh with bubble hat I

244
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,959
remember Steve cubby um he gave me a

245
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,399
cutting to this way back when using

246
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,719
Canada oh yeah and I grew it out and you

247
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,600
know what it was the only sativa that I

248
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,000
really loved growing consistently and I

249
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,199
remember just lighting it up and people

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,799
would come you know even if it was a

251
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:58,639
smoker room they'd come from across the

252
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,759
room and come up to me and go what is

253
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,360
that true oh yeah it cut any smoke any

254
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,919
smell CU it's got such a distinct sweet

255
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,039
such a distinct smell no it's true like

256
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,000
however that came about what I remember

257
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,000
about like just a shorter flowering

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,480
sativa that still has that hazy fluffy

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,078
look but yet with this sweet I I just

260
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,680
never really tasted a sweet Haze before

261
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:29,919
you know hazes are usually just pissy

262
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:31,479
and almost sour yeah but here Let's uh

263
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,319
let's load you up with this so this is

264
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,800
from uh the great Gardener right on

265
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,278
actually I'm going to grab the one more

266
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:41,198
thing that I sort of forgot over

267
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:46,439
here which will come in handy for this

268
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:48,120
which is um a quartz carb cap and that's

269
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,880
when I put the bowl on here you'll see

270
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,240
that it's a little bit there's a lot of

271
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,639
air coming through and I'll just carve

272
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,839
it up like that you'll be able to use

273
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,278
your finger to uh control how much how

274
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,639
much you go you can give it right away

275
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,639
the minute it

276
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,480
sometimes you don't even have to carve

277
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,079
it just a little bit of reduction that

278
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:15,839
the cap itself gives is

279
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:18,000
perfect yeah wow flavor flavor City it's

280
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,320
nice to be doing sativa bowls with raino

281
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,320
at what is it 7:30 in the morning right

282
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,199
it's early I've been up for a couple

283
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,519
hours already though you had to be up to

284
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,958
yeah yeah I had to get up pretty early I

285
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,879
mean I wasn't you know working in the

286
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:33,479
garden like you probably were but uh

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,440
into

325
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,479
um not just being worried about their

326
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,720
own license but actually being worried

327
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,159
about everyone's license you see even as

328
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,240

that are just're freaking out we're

330
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,079
freaking out yeah you know what I mean

331
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,879
it's uh I I don't think it's a hard

332
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:22,359
thing to dis to even discuss when you

333
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:25,078
consider how much energy people have put

334
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,278
into building themselves a proper

335
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:30,239
facility um making it safe doing all the

336
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,639
cameras and all the security that Health

337
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,720
Canada requested oh yeah giving our

338
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,039
addresses through all the hoops and we

339
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,959
jumped through all the Hoops we did

340
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,198
everything that we were needed to do and

341
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:43,439
you know for me I still have faith cuz

342
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,838
it hasn't happened yet I'm I'm pretty I

343
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,680
think we'll get it I think whatever

344
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,720
whether we get it or not I think we

345
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,078
won't stop growing and I don't think

346
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,399
we're all going to be going to jail

347
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,078
either so it's uh yeah that injunction

348
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,679
is what I've got my money on for sure

349
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,799
and uh you want to give them the website

350
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,799
actually where they can go

351
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,879
that's mm Coalition against ral.com

352
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,879
absolutely if you're a Canadian citizen

353
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,199
or even an American or someone else from

354
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,600
around the world that wants to learn

355
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,038
what's going on with us then you can

356
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,078
check out that website and there's a

357
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:15,959
bunch of different uh discussions and

358
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,240
sort of information that can give you

359
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,120
the updates on uh on what we're going

360
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,558
through here in Canada yeah you know no

361
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,838
we can't lose this battle it's just

362
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,798
ridiculous and you know what's even more

363
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,599
ridiculous is that uh the feds expect us

364
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,279
you know the night before to take all

365
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,918
our weed that we have accumulated and

366
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,160
sitting around destroy it all and start

367
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,120
purchasing the weed the next day that's

368
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,038
makes no sense at all why would you know

369
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,159
I I can't imagine any patient cuz a lot

370
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,200
of them are on fixed incomes taking

371
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,960
perfectly good Canabis and destroying it

372
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,798
or flushing it down the toilet just to

373
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,480
spend their money at $10 or $14 a gram

374
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,558
the very next day that that makes no

375
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,640
that's throwing money down the drain

376
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,918
absolutely and to do the math real quick

377
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,520
of what Ramo just said let's go to a

378
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,400
lower number than uh 122 to $15 a gr

379
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:03,519
let's say say 10 cuz it's easy for the

380
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:10,240
math that puts us about 4 uh

381
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:12,918
4, uh 4 480 bucks 448 G per pound we're

382
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,839
at about 4500 for a pound and now both

383
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,840
Remo and I know how much resin is

384
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:22,359
actually on that pound you're looking at

385
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:26,439
between 20 and 30 g m and for $5,000

386
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:28,798
that's over $100 a gram for resin and

387
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,600
that's diluted on plant matter and

388
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,960
hasn't even been worked off the plant

389
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,439
you have to buy whole plant medicine

390
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,880
from these people they don't even sell

391
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
extracts well and it's not going to be

392
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,039
buds it's going to be this ground

393
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,720
irradiated crap it be like buying a

394
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,720
bunch of shap yeah it's uh it's it's

395
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,839
it's definitely I'm praying that it's

396
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,720
just all a nightmare and they just want

397
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,639
these mm licenses in so bad that they've

398
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,759
made this you know these ridiculous um

399
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,000
assumptions as to how reality can can

400
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,480
exist for us which we don't fit in into

401
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,200
this reality that they're trying to

402
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,480
create yeah but you know what I can't

403
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,360
see you know any reason for there to be

404
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,798
um us existing you know producing our

405
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,359
own cannabis and having these commercial

406
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,639
producers as well because not everybody

407
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,079
can grow their Canabis listen I'm 100%

408
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,000
And I get a lot of flack for this

409
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:20,000
because I post the links I'm 100% for

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,880
licensed production facilities I'm just

411
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,359
100% against

412
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,600
exclusive licensed production facilities

413
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,719
no you should be able to grow your own

414
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,399
absolutely if you have the ability

415
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,120
do it absolutely 100% and none of this

416
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,200
grandfathering into everyone has the

417
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,439
right to do it I mean you can Brew your

418
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,798
own beer and you can make your own wine

419
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,440
I'm pretty sure you could probably grow

420
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,839
your own tobacco people just don't

421
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,720
bother because the products that they

422
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,599
have available to them are are good

423
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,440
enough for those people and the small

424
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,678
percentage of people that those products

425
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,400
aren't good enough for they brew and

426
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,440
make their own wine and you know what I

427
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,240
mean like why can't we do the same thing

428
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,240
let us grow our own medicine

429
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,519
also you know one one more side note um

430
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,480
I I think they got to get real with the

431
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,519
pricing because if they don't what's

432
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,759
going to happen is most of these

433
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,839
patients aren't going to be able to

434
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,279
afford your $10 ground stuff and they're

435
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,158
just going to go right back to the

436
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,119
street right back to the black market to

437
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,880
buy their cidis because it'll be cheaper

438
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,519
for them it's true you know they'll be

439
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,240
able to have a better quality life cuz

440
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,319
they have money left over they can't

441
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,679
blow all their money on taxes and high

442
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,119
pric weed and get a bunch of Swag

443
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
they'll go to the street and buy a $20

444
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,798
rid for some killer weed cuz I know it's

445
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,839
out there oh yeah oh it is out there for

446
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:35,759
sure uh it'll be interesting to see

447
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:40,558
where it goes nonetheless um yeah OG

448
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,558
Kush full m dry SI all right bless

449
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,919

450
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,400

bigger Hoots just like bubble man right

455
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,839
it's true and one thing is for sure that

456
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:12,199
joints are not going to affect that and

457
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,319
I'll bring this back to once again Steve

458
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,798
cubby now I before I met you Steve cubby

459
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,319
you remember how much that guy used to

460
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,158
smoke yeah like it was unbelievable like

461
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,839
he smoked like a pound every week or two

462
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,640
or something it was just insane how much

463
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,439
weed he was smoking and I kind of was

464
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,320
like dude like it can't be good for your

465
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,840
lungs well he I think I smoke more

466
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:36,639
though I I believe Sooke well he he went

467
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,678
down and did this big test on his lungs

468
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
you know where they blow into the

469
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,960
machine and it was at some heavy duty

470
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,200
Clinic down in the US M well the guy's

471
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:50,278
lungs tested like that of I'm certain it

472
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,480
was like a late 20s healthy men you know

473
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,400
what that is Cubby was in his late 40s

474
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,558
or something at the time but you know

475
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,200
why that is it's not the same as smoking

476
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:01,079
tobacco even tobacco what it does when

477
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,480
you smoke it you have silic hairs that

478
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:05,798
help clean out your lungs and those

479
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,880
hairs get paralyzed paral and when you

480
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,519
smoke cannabis uh those those hairs are

481
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,320
still very much active doesn't and when

482
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,400
you cough it's actually a good thing

483
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,319
it's uh forcing that you know that's an

484
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,600
expector totally I mean the real bottom

485
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,960
line is that they spray tobacco with

486
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,079
radium 226 which is a radioactive

487
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,400
nucleotide and we don't put that on

488
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,558
cannabis no tobacco wouldn't be that bad

489
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,480
if they just didn't spray that chemical

490
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,440
on it cuz I have friends in Jamaica that

491
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,400
smoke like the natural stuff doesn't

492
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,720
give me a headache you know when I when

493
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,159
I smell indian spirit or whatever like

494
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,038
those give me a headache they're

495
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,919
cigarettes they're have a filter and

496
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,679
they just it's not real well they got

497
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,480
other chems in there that actually slow

498
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,840
burning they definitely they make it to

499
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,480
go out and all that stuff and it's not

500
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,879
allowed to burn for a certain time my

501
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,720
friends Harvest their tobacco right out

502
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,480
of the for out of the Jungle that's the

503
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,679
way it should be that's 100% the way it

504
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,558
should be so this is from a good friend

505
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,400
d420 K he's up in Prince George yeah and

506
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,639
he's been mastering the art of of dry

507
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,640
sifting I mean uh he's got it down

508
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,278
pretty good so I'll give you a little

509
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,278
rip here I okay bombs away this little

510
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,400
hoochi really feel that reduction it

511
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,079
makes the hit in my opinion easier to

512
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,519
take that was a nice rip oh I'll clear

513
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,158
it up for you

514
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,158
thanks sweet some leftovers so yeah

515
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,919
we're hoping uh to show you a little bit

516
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,240
about what Remo's got going on today and

517
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,000
uh obviously he's always got some fun

518
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,319
things to show us so we'll probably just

519
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,278
continue to smoke a few more bowls I'll

520
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,599
show you my terpinator experiment oh

521
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:43,558
yeah I want to I want to hear about

522
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,918
terpinator experiment yeah terpinator is

523
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,879
a new product uh I guess Green Planet is

524
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,240
Distributing up here in Canada and uh

525
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,440
yeah supposed to increase not only tpine

526
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,400
production but Tricom and resin

527
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,320
production so I I I'm not sure how but

528
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,000
it if if it can that isn't

529
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,879
unbelievable um statement to make I

530
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,759
agree so we're putting it to the test

531
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,559
yeah 100% what a great thing to put to

532
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,839
the test too if this works this is a

533
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,480
revolution especially for hash makers

534
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,079
you know without growing any more

535
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,440
Canabis you're going to get 20% more

536
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,240
unbeliev and more so than that even like

537
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,519
for me it's like to increase tpine

538
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,480
content or to be able to have any idea

539
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:32,079
how to manipulate such a thing M tpin

540
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:34,919
are the modulators of canabo and THC

541
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,839
they offer and create different

542
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,320
perspectives depending on their ratios

543
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,678
and you know where they are in their

544
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,480
life and it's why cannabis can change so

545
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,159
much when you cure it over a long period

546
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,919
of time MH you know get that creeper

547
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,760
sort of weed thing coming on if you've

548
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,399
ever cured I had some ancient hash it

549
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:56,640
was 13 or 14 years and it was dry sift

550
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:59,278
wow um from Amsterdam and um that was a

551
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,120
smoke you know the smoke was

552
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,359
absolutely I mean just to be able to

553
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,678
smoke anything that old was special it

554
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:09,038
was red powder dust so it looked like

555
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:12,120
nothing I'd ever seen um unfortunately

556
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,679
taste wise it was very stale I guess it

557
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:16,879
would be after time it was very St

558
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,559
taste-wise but I will say that it was

559
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,600
the first time since probably I was in

560
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,240
high school that I experienced that

561
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,759
creeper effect I hadn't experienced the

562
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,880
creeper effect and I really started

563
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,759
putting it together with you know the

564
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,039
way the tpin when you get get a real

565
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,599
good hit and it grabs you in the throat

566
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,000
like those are tpin that's those are

567
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,079
those volatile oils just grabbing you

568
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,119
and they're they're actually they can

569
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,918
bring canabo into your bloodstream right

570
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,959
through the back of your throat just

571
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,320
from taking one good rip I mean

572
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,558
obviously they get into your lungs and

573
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,678
it goes even quicker into your into your

574
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,278
bloodstream and whatnot but um the fact

575
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,320
that they weren't present they were

576
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,839
almost

577
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,759
gone you take a hit of this hash and it

578
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:02,319
would be literally 3 4 5 minutes before

579
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,240
you felt the effects of it crazy yeah it

580
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,000
was definitely interesting so we know

581
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,200
that tpin modulate the effects of canono

582
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,640
and THC so being able to increase or

583
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,919
even manipulate the ratios of tpin in

584
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,278
any strain that's why I had to try it I

585
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,159
got a question uh how did they store

586
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,640
that um that hash that you smoke that

587
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,840
was 13 years old like was it vacuum seal

588
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,919
you know what I think I think for quite

589
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,798
a while and I'd have to confirm cuz I

590
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,880
don't want to be disinform

591
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,000
people um that it was in a nitrogen Rich

592
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,760
environment that the oxygen was removed

593
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,240
and it was replaced with nitrogen so

594
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,278
this will preserved for a long time

595
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,278
however I think that was around maybe 10

596
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:47,880
years and so when I saw it it was 12 or

597
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:51,278
13 years old had had 2 years I'd say

598
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,880
just inside a small little uh glass case

599
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,960
probably in a cool dark place but

600
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,080
nothing like a refrigerator right um and

601
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,038
it's still around I think now today it

602
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:04,759
was was made in

603
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,720
1991 holy so there might be a half a

604
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,278
gram or a gram of it but yeah my good

605
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,399
buddy he used to just give me the

606
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:13,880
tiniest little bit each year that I go

607
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:18,678
to Amsterdam from like around 11 or 12

608
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:21,440
to 16 or 17 years old wow yeah it was a

609
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,640
pretty neat experience sounds like it

610
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,000
you know what maybe we will get our

611
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,440
licenses preserved and we won't have to

612
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,960
worry about it anymore we will doing

613
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,558
things like that yeah no think PA I

614
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,720
think they lied to us straight up oh

615
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:38,079
yeah and exposed us yeah I mean wow I'm

616
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,798
not sure if you guys know this but they

617
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:45,000
sent out letters to all 30,000 um exemp

618
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:48,000
or uh people that hold Federal licenses

619
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,119
whether you're a designated grower or a

620
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,960
a person that's possessing it and

621
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:55,599
growing it yourself they sent us all

622
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,798
letters in big white envelopes with

623
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:01,480
clear plastic windows huge huge clear

624
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:04,440
plastic windows that instead of just

625
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,159
showing you know our address in the

626
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,159
corner it showed their full name which

627
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,559
is basically like a medical marijuana

628
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,120
Access

629
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,798
program basically a lot yeah basically

630
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,479
what they did is they told anyone that

631
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:20,158
could like every mailman every person in

632
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,558
the mail industry that touched or SE had

633
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,159
seen those envelopes they knew that

634
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,519
every one of those addresses either had

635
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,278
cannabis stored there or first responded

636
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,278
with a grow up even better I

637
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,798
corresponded with a grow up so yeah it

638
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,398
was it took me a few days to actually

639
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:40,200
realize that that happened I was in

640
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:42,678

ranky danky smell yeah it grows giant

726
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,599
dense it was actually some of the

727
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:28,519
biggest buds uh in my garden are going

728

to be the blue cheese this one your buds

729
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,599
generally are always pretty dense though

730
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,798
all the different strains you show me

731
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,879
have uh that one sort of thing in common

732
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,720
that they're definitely yeah I find the

733
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,960
Kush doesn't really grow giant butts

734
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,480
just really good quality lots of resin

735
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,278
lots of crystals or tricomes yes

736
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,558
excellent crystals tricomes call them

737
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:48,319

738
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,200

you really grow right stunning so here

760
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:44,439
we are in week six of

761
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:47,038
flour just started to Lee uh going to be

762
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,720
some yellow here and there the purples

763
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,558
just starting to set in just lowered the

764
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,639
temperature in the air conditioner we're

765
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:55,558
doing a crazy test we're testing that

766
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,199
terpinator product out supposed to

767
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:00,440
increase your flavonoids terpenoids and

768
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,639
resin content and give you more triones

769
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,399
up to 20% so I'll try anything that'll

770
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:10,480
do that so this half the room we tried

771
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:13,759
terpinator on and this half no

772
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,800
terpinator be able to compare the two

773
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,760
plants we're going to get bubble man to

774
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,200
take some closeup photos so you can see

775
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,440
it because apparently there's a physical

776
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,838
difference you can actually physically

777
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,398
see more triphones like a considerable

778
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,960
amount more so we're going to test it

779
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,638
what do you think oh I'm definitely

780
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,358
stoked I mean it's true anything that

781
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,358
can make a claim like that you got to at

782
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,000
least give it a shot yeah no I'm I'm

783
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,239
giving it a fair try for

784
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,039
sure and this already has a lot of

785
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,638
tricomes on

786
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,918
ITC it's got some great purple color

787
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,039
happening lots of

788
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,199
tricomes yeah I'll be coming in here in

789
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:51,279
a little bit with the macro lens so uh

790
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,239

00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,400
the terpinator is working that looks

814
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,240
like it's rolled in

815
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,720
Sugar you see that

816
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,039
mhm very nice nice resin production and

817
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,879
this is this is a Kush um yeah this is

818
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:07,559
UBC

819
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,400
chemo and actually this is a perfect

820
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,159
sample two plants cuz they're ruply the

821
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,000
same size they're the same strain

822
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:14,239
they're in the center of the room so

823
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,239
maybe we'll get you to do the macro

824
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,759
shots and needs to compare the two to

825
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,279
see if we can visibly see more triom

826
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,520
absolutely cuz this one's non-

827
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,519
terpinator and this is Bator right here

828
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,559
and it does look kind of a little more

829
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,559
crystally I think it's a little early at

830
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,559
do have a lot the product

831
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,760
but I'm going to get the maximum

832
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,759
strength 30 MS

833
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,440
excellent and then moving right

834
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,159
along got rockar right

835
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,639
here right here that's the rockar that

836
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:54,078
is the rockar just back in I half the RO

837

this she looks beautiful starting to go

844
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,119

DNA

851
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:32,519
I'm looking at the CO2 we down to 464

852
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,480
looks like I got to swap that CO2

853
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,280
tank

854
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,920
okay go and get one of those go get a

855
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,599
new CO2 tank yeah but I guess you can

856
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,000
get your lens on and take some macro

857
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,920
phot yeah that's what I'm going to do

858

for

859
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,800
sure I'm going to slap the macro lens on

860
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,519
this camera and we're going to start

861

914
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,960
rig I just got yesterday oh that's right

915
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,199

916
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,039
nothing is

917
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:27,078

918
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,480
here I like the Dabber here let me uh

919
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,240
press up some of this dry SI so we can

920
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,358
actually use the Dabber and right now I

921
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:36,559
got a Boral silic it down

922
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:39,000
in I usually use a fumo pipe on there

923
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,440
but if you want to try dabbing of it and

924
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,400
look at this it's got this ledator you

925
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,838
can actually put concentrates or daer on

926
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,160
there so you just go yeah and then we

927
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,000
got the

928
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,239
dome right there that we're going to put

929
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
on last but not least last but not least

930
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,318
all right so let's get some Gable

931
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,838
product here well you know what you're

932
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:59,318
the guest so I'm going to heat it up but

933
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:02,279
I'm going to let you go for it okay so

934
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,960
there's a there's this I am going to get

935
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,720
the quartz nail it does hold the heat a

936
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,480
little bit longer oh yeah let's see what

937
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,199
uh this isn't hot now is it no actually

938
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,719
I think your quch Bol might fit on this

939
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:16,399
thing I know I wonder if it would let's

940
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:18,919
just check it out real quick might be a

941
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,119
little bit warm well usually I can do it

942
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,880
if I I usually like 750° warm well you

943
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:25,480
do this little trick where you get

944
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,680
holding the bottom quartz is an

945
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:32,199
unbelievable product mhm this is not hot

946
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:35,879
this is a little bit hot this is Wicked

947
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:38,199
hot oh my God so we'll see this isn't

948
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,358
really meant to fit in there but n not

949
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,719
going to do if we had a piece we would

950
00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:44,199
have been able to do it but that's cool

951
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:46,559
we'll torch the quartz it's still a

952
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:48,159
quartz Bowl it's just no no it's just a

953
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,039
or it's a little glass bowl it's a Boral

954
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,440
silicate now well no problem we'll hit

955
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,639
the Boral silicate it just doesn't hold

956
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,039
the heat quite the same but you know

957
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,879
what it's equally as clean and that's

958
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,440
what it's all about having a clean to

959
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,280
exactly and really I just want to hit

960
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,400
the pipe and feel the the filtration of

961
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,800
it whatnot oh no this thing's a

962
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,680
Cadillac you're not going to believe I

963
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,280
really um this is my new favorite pipe

964
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:14,639
I've got tons of dozens of pipes dozens

965
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,480
of bonds and this is it that's a nice

966
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,279
looking piece so let's get the torch and

967
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,039
dab I'll let you take it for a chest

968
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,400
drive I'm going to take uh Remo's new

969
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:28,480

a A little dab of the

973
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,838
Barb for silicate

974
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,519
ribs all the different ways to inhale

975
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,519

1013
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,759
inhale frequently oh my goodness and I

1014
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,318
would be a buzz kill about it I'd

1015
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,200
legalize that be my platform well I'd

1016
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:42,719
legalize and then I'd quit it seems as

1017
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,399
though it's coming you know I mean

1018
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:47,439
that's the one Saving Grace in our

1019
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,440
injunction and in our the mmpr change in

1020
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,639
licensing is that look at how it's

1021
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,880
changing everywhere else legalized in uh

1022
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:59,400
not legalized but definitely Statewide

1023
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:02,280
allowed in in Washington and in

1024
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,760
Colorado California's never been too far

1025
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,280
behind more and more States putting it

1026
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,119
on putting the initiatives on their

1027
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,160
ballots to get for uh I've heard Florida

1028
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,160
I've heard Michigan I've heard Boston

1029
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:18,679
I've heard New York the ti are changing

1030
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:18,679
all right go give it a

1031
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:25,358
go oh

1032
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,920
nice professional to his own pipe oh

1033
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,480
that is so smooth it was very smooth

1034
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,200
that's what I felt like the the

1035
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,079
filtration was so much less than I'm

1036
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:40,279
used to the mother ship has much more

1037
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,640
water in it right now and more of a chug

1038
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,920
but it's still filtered beautifully it

1039
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:47,440
does it does yeah nice little piece what

1040
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,119
else can we smoke in this thing um well

1041
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,200
we could smoke some really nice powdered

1042
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,760
dry sift cool I wonder if that stuff

1043
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:57,039
will from our grinder would go there I

1044
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,839
think to a degree it won't probably

1045
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,039
bubble and melt the way we want it to

1046
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:02,599
that's really the ideal situation to get

1047
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:06,318
something that's like extremely clean

1048
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:07,720
like the these two are are 99% just

1049
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,800

1050
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:13,318
hits

1051
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:16,530
crazy beat it up

1052
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:18,079
yeah so hopefully we can
