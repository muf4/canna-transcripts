parking lot in cyprus wouldn't you say

55
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,158

56
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,719
from the highway up to the parking lot

57
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,598
than it does from here to the exit yeah

58
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,840

65
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,158
summer and

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the winter yeah like in the summer i'm

67
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,598
up there on dirt bikes

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,959
in the winter it's like sleds and

69
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,798
snowboards

70
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239

they're working with us over at embark

79
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,479
we just had our sale go through with

80

bevcana which now they're called naturo

81

how can you keep up with all this stuff

82
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,079
i'm a lifer so it really doesn't matter

83
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,238
what the banner is that i do these

84
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
things under um i'm just always doing

85
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,120
them so

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,280
yeah i'm pretty excited to get some of

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
these products going yeah me too man

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
absolutely it's uh you know to be able

89
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,439
to get the bubble man brand out there

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,159
with the actual hash that i want and the

91
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,079
rosin that i want that is a dream come

92
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,158
true

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,720
it's gonna be it's it should be good i

94
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,680
mean we know it's a small group but

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,759
they're a group that recognizes quality

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,519
when they see it so that's really who

97
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,439
that will be for and

98
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,439
try to make it affordable it's not a

99
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,839
hundred dollars a gram i don't know i'd

100
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,120
love to see it be closer to

101
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,319
like 40 percent less than that yeah

102
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
definitely

103
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,599
and it'll be good to have some legal

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,919
stuff to dab sometimes because right now

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,639
there's not too much yeah it's true it's

106
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,478
true not enough anyway although i did

107
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,478
hit some of that afghan kush that we

108
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,800
made a while ago and sold under the hank

109
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,519
brand it was lacking in terpenes didn't

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,680
have a great flavor but i cannot deny

111
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,799
how strong that hash is

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,560
close to 70 percent but even know if

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,680
it's the number that means anything it's

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,918
just it's really strong whatever that

115
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,720
the terpene whatever's modulating it

116
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,918
because it's not just thc a whatever is

117
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,280
modulating it just makes it really like

118
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,038
like heavy

119
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,799
still to this day it's the best hash i

120
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,719
have for going to bed

121
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,478
like if i just if i'm all amped up and

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
i'm like i just

123
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,879
hit it up yeah

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
i've been smoking a lot of these like

125
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,680
just smearing like i was saying on these

126
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,439
guys

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,199
here in live resin on the joint i'm like

128
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,800
that's a good night joint i have to say

129
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,120
not bad and it burns pretty good what

130
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,720
kind of flower you got in there uh i

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,918
have some

132
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,120
what is this

133
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:43,120
this is wedding cake with uh

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,280
with girl scout cookie live bread

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,439
so not a lightweight you know

136
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,719
it's a pretty hardcore tv actually as

137
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,319
you can see it burning like you were

138
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,880
saying yeah yeah it's nice but it's

139
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,879
actually not so

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
and it has a light ash yeah i haven't

141
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
smoked a joint a very very very very

142
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,399
very

143
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
very long time

144
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,839
well i'm excited to get to watching you

145
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,038
make this okay what are you gonna do

146
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,638
you're gonna make something in 15

147
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,199
minutes it's it's a dessert are we

148
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,000
surprising them we're making a chocolate

149
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,720
raspberry lava cake

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,879
and uh yeah it's the best for late at

151
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,560
night and it's actually gluten-free

152
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,639
of course it is yeah right because you

153
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,959
of course just had this discovery yeah

154
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
totally so that's good to have to get

155
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,799
pretty experimental in cooking

156
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,198
i think you've already always kind of

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,120
been pretty experimental with cooking i

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,360
think it's just a shift on the

159
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,360
experiments that you're doing

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
but i think that's much easier to do

161
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
than say go from

162
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,680
a regular person that just cooks kind of

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,639
blandly and doesn't experiment a lot to

164
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,639
just trying to experiment yeah you you

165
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,319
experiment dude

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,918
we try that's for sure you're like

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,199

people

189
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,680
pretty simple ingredients you need

190
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,759
four eggs

191
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,759
five ounces of

192
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,400
chocolate

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,160
two

194
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,000
one and a half tablespoons of

195
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
gluten-free flour

196
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
some raspberry jam

197
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:55,199
some sugar a bit of vanilla and four

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,839
tablespoons of butter

199
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,120
just toss the butter in with the

200
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,119
chocolate put it in the microwave

201
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,199
then she goes do it for one minute and

202
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,359
30 seconds at 50 power and then just

203
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
toss it after

204
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,038
i feel like they missed out on seeing

205
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,799
that so i wanted to

206
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,740
give them the best

207
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,919
not so good view but while that's going

208
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,560
[Applause]

209
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,758
get your little ramekins good

210
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,720
when you want to do it is you want to

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,240
push it up like this

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,960
so that it rises properly

213
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,960
it's just a bit of butter

214
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,948
up we go

215
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,949
[Music]

216
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,799
then put the sugar in there

217
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,519
just toss that around

218
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,360
and you want to just coat the whole

219
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,039
thing and this just makes sure that the

220
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,039
cake doesn't stick to the sides when it

221
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,039
rises

222
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,720
a little bit more

223
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,759
and just make sure that it's coated all

224
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,759
on the sides

225
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,278
here we go the rest of the trash

226
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,039
no more chocolate

227
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,600
chocolate dash butter

228
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:51,159
chocolate slash butter starts to melt

229
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,159
it's very similar

230
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,039
mix all that together you probably have

231
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
to put it back in the microwave for a

232
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,759
little bit

233
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,759
i'm surprised

234
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,680
it feels pretty good otherwise you can

235
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,040
do a double boiler but

236
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,399
yeah

237
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,399
that takes a while it does

238
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,239
kind of gotta pay attention to that

239
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,839
thing too exactly

240
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,560
yeah it's not really a walk away and dab

241
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,760
situation this you can do at your house

242
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,759
super fast at night

243
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,278
first we'll start with the eggs

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,040
eggs in there

245
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,039
then two egg yolks

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
this will make it super creamy

247
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,000
it's good enough there we go

248
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,480
let the chocolate sit for a second we'll

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,480
lift these up

250
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,720
you want to beat it so that it's nice

251
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,959
and consistent get a bit of vanilla in

252
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,959
there

253
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
you want to get a little bit of salt in

254
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,200
there as well

255
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,200
it's nice to salt with the chocolate

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,799
that's next

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,799
now you got your chocolate

258
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,360
get it nice and consistent

259
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,039
it smells chocolatey it doesn't it

260
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,039
really does

261
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,600
oh sorry

262
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
now

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
we'll mix the chocolate in with the eggs

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,799
this all mixed nice

265
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,569
[Applause]

266
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,159
you want it whip nice so that

267
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,759
it rises well in the mannequins

268
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,759
now get a bit of flour in there

269
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,039
you don't need very much flour

270
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,319
i actually have done this and forgotten

271
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:48,278
the flour before and it still worked

272
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,278
yeah almost like a souffle

273
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,399
okay

274
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,440
by the way the oven's on at 475. okay

275
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,839
that's a really key point to when you

276
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,440
start this whole thing start the oven at

277
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,880
475. yeah

278
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,880
now we'll pour these things in

279
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,799
try not to drip any on the

280
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,799
sides

281
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,240
now we want to keep just a little bit

282
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
left in here

283
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
so that we can cover up

284
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,278
the jam

285
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,600
yeah

286
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,838
so let me just take a little bit of jam

287
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,839
here

288
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,519
just kind of push it down in there

289
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,838
scoop it over

290
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:56,680
cover that little jammy eh yeah

291
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,680
that way it becomes part of the lava

292
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,360
i can kind of just smooth them over just

293
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,480
to make sure there's no jam exposed

294
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,480
these are all good

295
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,120
now toss them on the pan so that the

296
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,120
heat gets distributed evenly

297
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,959
in the oven you go and they go

298
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,838
for eight minutes

299
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,838
oh really

300
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,839
now we can do dabs and make whipped

301
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,600
cream ah very good very good

302
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,920
now we can have our dab that we're all

303
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,680
cleaned up here

304
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,439
i need my torch ah torchy maybe we'll

305
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,479
show them out the window

306
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,880
on such a beautiful day in lions bay

307
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,639
just a beautiful day

308
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,639
in lions bay this is where the orcas

309
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,759
were out here today they were actually

310
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,639
out

311
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,000
over

312
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,240
here

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,278
and had we been here with the camera we

314
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
probably would have been seeing them

315
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,519
right now they were swimming around

316
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,319
north of that island right there so

317
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,799
just great view

318
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,920
at this spot

319
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,919
band of windows

320
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,519
i hear the sound

321
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,519
beckoning the eye

322
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,959
oh

323
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,759
that was pretty low down by guys

324
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,799
you could use my temp tech if you wanted

325
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,800
or just heat it up again

326
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,560
oh hey hey

327
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,559

328
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,078
[Music]

329
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,838

a little sugar sugar

336
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,479
and what machine is this oh it's like a

337
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,319
little blender

338
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,558
a little cream whipper

339
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,558
cream

340
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,400
seems like such a ridiculous thing to

341
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,400
just pull out of the drawer

342
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,558
but there it is folks

343
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,038
if you're baked you've been enjoying

344
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,960
some fine cannabis or extracts or

345
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,558
edibles or

346
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,720
whatever

347
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,240
you can make this cake real bad this is

348
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,000
a real fast one we'll put the

349
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,400
ingredients list in the description

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,359
and um

351
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,798
yeah

352
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,599
merlin said this is the one he tried to

353
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,319
get it down to 10 minutes he said 13 14

354
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,359
was about as close as he got

355
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,359
um

356
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,678
we're doing more rushing yeah we're

357
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,038
doing a slower version for you guys here

358
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
but still i don't think it'll be much

359
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,960
more than 15 minutes

360
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,640
nope there is one minute and 30 seconds

361
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,798
left and we got pretty much everything

362
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
set here

363
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,038
our whipped cream is there we got some

364
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,639
strawberry powder too little strawberry

365
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,720
powder

366
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
strawberry powder huh

367
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,160
yeah this is just an extract a

368
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
strawberry fruit powder

369
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,080
that's what it is it's pretty tasty

370
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,839
should be ready any second here sounds

371
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
good

372
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,640
then just take a knife

373
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,639
gently go around

374
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,000
so it can get out huh yeah

375
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,879
that's why you put the sugar too it

376
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,798
helps it to not stick yeah you can

377
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,960
definitely see that the sugar's doing

378
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,960
that

379
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,359
we didn't add any sugar besides the

380
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,359
semi-sweet chocolate that we did

381
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:23,558
water recipes will tell you to add sugar

382
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,558
but i don't think he needs it

383
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,519
four to go there you go

384
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,200
all right now this is where it gets a

385
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,720
little trickier

386
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,400
because you're not just gonna serve them

387
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,558
in those little cups you're going to try

388
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,360
to flip them upside down be very fast if

389
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,359
you are going to touch them

390
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,879
be careful grabbing them if you are

391
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,679
going to grab them

392
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,679
be very fast

393
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,239
now

394
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,240
give them a little

395
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,558
oh that was like harder and louder than

396
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,639
i would have anticipated

397
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,279
waiting for one of those things to break

398
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,720
these are pretty tough i bet

399
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:38,759
oh this one not as green

400
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,759
the lava popped first

401
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,539
look at that little guy

no one's perfect they come out [ __ ] up

404
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,119
sometimes too but they still taste just

405
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,240
as good

406
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,239
this one definitely looks perfect

407
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,839

409
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,079
just for our show here

410
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:47,960

411
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,960
a little strawberry powder

412
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,839

getting cooked with merlin

418

419
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,480
sometimes artistic

420
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,719
sometimes he does art

421
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,400
boom that one didn't work out as good

422
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,000
but

423
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,480

424
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,480
so good man

425
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,600
