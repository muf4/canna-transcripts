of people bringing me dry sift to clean

that you you brought me something that

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,239
was

21
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:08,599
worthy dude so shout out to your buddy

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,200
who produced this lovely Trikes and grew

23
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:13,319
and listened to you putting screens

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,799
under his uh material we've got some

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,279
beautiful dry sift now it was AR

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,040
originally this was originally what I

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,560
got to work with and I'll show you that

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,280
in a better angle as well as well as

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,040
photos John had cleaned up a little bit

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,879
of it already just a little so he had uh

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,280
you know a nice little chunk

32
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:37,959
here and then um I basically went

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,239
forward and cleaned the sort of low

34
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:44,438
quality the low the seconds that he was

35
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,438
left with and I did this here and so

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,438
what this particular puff Wednesday is

37
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:52,319
going to entail I suspect is us talking

38
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,599
about this dry sift and of course us

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,158
enjoying this dry sift oh I mean there's

40
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,679
a little ball in there because you just

41
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,560
touched it with your finger and it just

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,118
went right it was amazing how fast this

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,840
this uh product uh melted in your hands

44
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:11,120
uh you just touched it and it was

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,560
literally clear almost opaque Amber and

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
the best part about all this is just

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
just this part of this is is how fresh

48
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,199
this resin truly is yeah so I mean we

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,959
went from I I I've convinced convinced a

50
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,439
few people to start trimming with screen

51
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,878
just just trim over the screen just take

52
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,239
a look at what you're losing yeah and he

53
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,159
calls me up he's like dude you got to

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,840
come check this out so the beginning

55
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,439
stages he took the 60 the 90 the 120 and

56
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,400
the 200 and just trimmed over top of

57
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,159
them and put it all together that's what

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,000
we got there right then I came back he

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,239
had it all on these screens and I did a

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,878
little bit of cleaning and I did

61
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,599
original cleaning that you taught me

62
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,639
right which is using the 60 the 90 the

63
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,518
110 and then cleaning on the 200 sure

64
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,878
well I pulled this off the 200 nice and

65
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,840
it showed him a little epicness and I

66
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,959
thought you know what to really show him

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,959
the true magic would be to come and see

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,560
you like that that that that alone would

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
just happened there so sticking the

70
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,318
Dabber on here and getting it hot and

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,759
then putting it into the sift as it

72
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:13,119
melts around it was pretty

73
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,840
awesome give me a little dab right

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
definitely a little

75
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,759
dab pressed it's very light and fluffy

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
so it won't be an oversized dab but I

77
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,878
figured while you're chatting away over

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,519
there about the beautifulness of this I

79
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,000
just got a puff Wednesday you just got a

80
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,400
puff onnes what I really really enjoy

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,239
about this guys is of course this is

82
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,080
organically grown this is grown with

83
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,719
many one so it's my one part growing

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,680
Bloom that I really really get behind

85
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,158
and stand behind and and it really shows

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,200
and Mark will will contest to that

87
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,479
whenever I bring resin that I've grown

88
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,359
with the certain nutrient what I do we

89
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,878
get these awesome gland heads and I

90
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,400
think it really do is just maturity

91
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,919
taking it to day 63 day 65 finding out

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,920
when it stops drinking all these little

93
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,559
tips and tricks that ensure that I've

94
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,119
learned just from talking with you over

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,318
the last four years right I've had to

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
make sure that I have developed

97
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,158
triphones

98
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,399
and you know what as he's doing that and

99
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,878
he's looking for the the cap if you

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
don't think I'm jumping in here right

101
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,479
now and doing my own little dab yeah

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,319
it's

103
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,878
like on that just a beautiful thing

104
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,878
right here right

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,600
now s to leave you hanging Johnny Be I

106
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,959
cuz I left the Q-tips sitting right over

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,520
there in the recycling bin so I couldn't

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,359
see them I I saw them with the

109
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,639
sunglasses I thought he's looking for a

110
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,759
carb cap and then I started using the

111
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,800
carb cap I'm like he's looking for a

112
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:42,000
carb cap I'm like he didn't do that 500

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,160
Q tippers and remember to always clean

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,759
one thing I've learned now I've been

115
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,080
cleaning my uh my thing and I actually

116
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,080
managed to pick up some of the goodness

117
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,758
oh nice yeah uh I was when I saw a

118
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,560
friend and he had a jar of it a bottle

119
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,240
of it and I'm like dude can I have some

120
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
he's like sure I took

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,918
half perfect well let's get you a nice

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,160
big rip on this that was really nice

123
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,038
yeah see I just tried doing that fail so

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,400
this is I'm learning we're holding on

125
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,319
the bottom is getting a little bubble

126
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,560
going on there and that bubble is

127
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,199
actually that's like the end of the

128
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,199
Dab's got a

129
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,520
bubble there you go Johnny B get your

130
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,240
proper

131
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,680
Styles you deserve oh man look at that

132
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,680
we're going to do macro uh video for you

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,959
to see the Melt Factor on this tiny

134
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,800
little bit of char left over on the

135
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,198
Sapphire Nail at the end of the hit but

136
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,879
very little compared to the quality of

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,038
the actual resin it's not always that

138
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,959
you get resin of this quality you know

139
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,519
and it's why a lot of people have a hard

140
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,478
time making that six-star bubble hash or

141
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:45,359
making that six-star 99.9% gland head

142
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:48,318
ratio dry sift because having the

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,280
material first and foremost is what's

144
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,479
going to move you into the next stage of

145
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,918
actually being in the game and now being

146
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,478
in a position where you could unveil the

147
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,839
quality of that resin I mean what do we

148
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,478
got three different piles we got three

149
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,758
different piles of epicness and then two

150
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,839
piles of contaminant mhm and then

151
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,199
there's one way that well it is nice to

152
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,959
have you come over and say hey I got

153
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,439
some resin can you clean it up I'm happy

154
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,598
to do it well we did that there last

155
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,680
time we got to see the difference and

156
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:14,439
there was hardly nothing well that's it

157
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,280
there was nothing the last resin that

158
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,120
you brought me it was like I went to

159
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,000
clean it and there was literally like

160
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,918
nothing like not even a dab worth of a

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,240
rip so it was kind of interesting

162
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,159
because I thought it was really really

163
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,160
good

164
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,599
sift exactly you know you never know and

165
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,800
it's funny when people think something

166
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:31,519
and then you show them otherwise and

167
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,400
they're kind of like wait a second wait

168
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,560
a second whereas today you know when you

169
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,000
brought this I knew the second I saw

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
that it was going to be fire but you

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
were like no no clean this one and I was

172
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,560
like well okay it's the shittier version

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,918
of want to see that now and now it's now

174
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,879
it's what I cleaned is much nicer than

175
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,198
that you look at that color right there

176
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,120
this is the difference and you can start

177
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,840
seeing that color change dude we're

178
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,319
going to turn this into this so this

179
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,000
except this pile here is going to be big

180
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,639
huge it's going to be probably like it'd

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,560
be good I should weigh that to find out

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,478
what percentage of heads we get out of

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,680
it because I bet it it's 50 to 60% we

184
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,639
will We it yeah well no exactly and we

185
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,759
and this will be detailed we'll detail

186
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,160
it out with with a photo essay at the

187
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,199
end of this video we'll be able to show

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,879
you the pictures of what we started with

189
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,680
the weights of it and that'll kind of

190
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,840
make this a fun interesting video well

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,879
you know what it get to show you what

192
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,318
you can get and what the screens that I

193
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,400
get from you and what they can possibly

194
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,120
work what I'm able to accomplish with

195
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,638
just screen

196
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,319
yeah well dude like I said you did a

197
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,160
great job on that it definitely looks

198
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,598
fire when I was showing my bunny and you

199
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,599
know what I Ed the best part about it

200
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,360
what I use to clean this was at Tim

201
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,000
Horton's dut box and I was showing him I

202
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,560
was going over I said you got a cut up

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,240
because I was pulling out what you have

204
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,038
in here I was pulling out all the leaf

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,439
matter that they mix into it and they

206
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:51,079
didn't know how to do that so I

207
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,519
everybody's got a different way of a

208
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,478
different way of trying to do their

209
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,839
sifting and what you showed me I've you

210
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,839
know came up with little ways of making

211
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,359
sure to pull the contaminant make a

212
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,638
little bit easier and uh you know what

213
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,960
that's how easy it was to do this but to

214
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,918
get from here to this

215
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,598
stage with the static and using the DVD

216
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,240
in the parchment would probably take me

217
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,878
about a week yeah it take a while I do

218
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,598
that or I can come here how long was

219
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,960
that I don't know 15 minutes I think it

220
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,279
took 15 maybe maybe 10 I didn't have set

221
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,959
up I I was trying to catch an ant with

222
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,318
your son oh so that that's what I mean I

223
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,478
didn't know cuz I was you know we

224
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,519
catching that quality time with T man oh

225
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,718
he's awesome it's awesome I was

226
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,918
explaining to him how he went into the

227
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,479
hole and he was going to come back and

228
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,958
then I thought he'd never come back

229
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,320
little bugger did ended up to be at the

230
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,119
end of he got dabbed out with a wet

231
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,800
napkin what do you think of this hot

232
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,919
Dabber technique well you know what I

233
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,559
thought that was cool because you had a

234
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:52,639
bubble come on there and then you dipped

235
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,879
into it right there you got the

236
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,240
bubble and it's like

237
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:01,120
boom and it's really hard to pick up

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,200
this sift because it's just like I don't

239
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
know it's like all you can do is really

240
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,120
melt it you know when it first snows out

241
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,759
and it's really really nice and it's

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,759
powder and you you look at it fluffy

243
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,200
powder it's fluffy powder and as it

244
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,600
settles and as the day progresses it

245
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,800
settles and gets harder and harder well

246
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,079
that's exactly what's happening here

247
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,879
right now it's fluffy and in about an

248
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:20,599
hour it's going to be stuck to that card

249
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,838
dude well here's to you Johnny B A

250
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,839
little

251
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,200
rip you know it seems like just

252
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,720
yesterday I was watching the RCMP rifle

253
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,440
through your [ __ ] put you under a and

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,879
threaten you with uh jail yeah doesn't

255
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,560
it seem like just like yesterday it was

256
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,439
oh

257
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,359
[ __ ] and which was coincidentally enough

258
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,200
one year to the day where they announced

259
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,839
that we won the injunction correct um my

260
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,240
my my picture with the that bra on only

261
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,240
the Paul Leaf was on the front page of

262
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,159
the Global Mail all across Canada right

263
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,839
and on the same day A year

264
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,958
later I got pulled over and was

265
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,440
questioned if I had been smoking and do

266
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,399
you have any cannabis in your car and

267
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm like well I if I were you I would

268
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,078
have said you know funny enough I don't

269
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,480
which is extremely rare extremely rare

270
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,599
it's so rare I honestly can't believe

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,120
you didn't have cannabis in your car I I

272
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,000

284
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,519
on the dash and he thought it was part

285

00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,360
day doing a a talk I didn't even know

326
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,838
that which is guaranteed why those RCMP

327
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,159
so we had RCMP there they pull me over

328
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,760
and when I see them going through the

329
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,278
camera I go you know what Facebook live

330
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,360
p dude when I saw it first I was in

331
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,278

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,639
months ago or oh they yeah 6 months ago

feeling like you know what like how but

340
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,480
I guess you do put videos up on YouTube

341
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,319
for people to watch well yes but I mean

342
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,399
I'm doing but not to be but not to be

343
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,120
harassed by cops you should just tell

344
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,278

his that anyway so you know as I'm

351
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,919
looking in my rear view I see what's

352
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,959
going on I hit Facebook live because I

353
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,559
think you know what this is good this is

354
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,159
some [ __ ] such a good move that you did

355
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,198
that so uh I never thought it would get

356
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,480
like you know 25,000 plus hits in a

357
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,719
period of like 24 hours hell yeah

358
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,199
there's like 800 people watching live I

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,360
people watching telling me that cuz I

360
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:34,838
was going to the mom cup the mail order

361
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,000
marijuana cup and everybody was waiting

362
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,199
for me to get there but tons of people

363
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,919
shared it like hundreds people shared it

364
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:41,838
over 500 everyone shared it everybody

365
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,360
shared it that's how you get those views

366
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,199
up you got to share those videos you

367
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,680
know and

368
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,799
unfortunately you know it would be great

369
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,319
if people shared more than just our

370
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,078
dramas and the bad [ __ ] sh share the

371
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,959
information so understand this and I

372
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,039
talked to the lawyer about this I got

373
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,518
pulled over in a company car what was

374
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,919
registered under my company so and the

375
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,278
first thing he asked me is it smells

376
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:05,479
like marijuana now speed back 6 months

377
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,600
prior to that I got pulled over in my

378
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,839
truck with my Dad pulled up and goes it

379
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,240
smells like marijuana both times there's

380
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,720
no marijuana in my car this time there

381
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,879
wasn't a medtainer the last time I was

382
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,480
with my father there wasn't you sweat

383
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:20,559
marijuana though I do I do sweat it it

384
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,039
does come through my glands so so the

385
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,198
question is is as being a medical

386
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,759
patient as being a medical patient and

387
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,439
and the advocacy that I do am I is it on

388
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,079
my record when my come up they go oh

389
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,399
check for can because now this is

390
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,758
happening um I got a message that's what

391
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,440
that's what you get for being a cannabis

392
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,159
activist I mean cannabis activist

393
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,079
because because because I'm a medical

394
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,600
patient and I use cannabis for my pain

395
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,439
what you get John I I I got I got two

396
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,839
hours of my time taken up I sat in that

397
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,480
and and this is the other one I said so

398
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,040
when I sat in the back of the car that's

399
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,920
what you get that's what you get that's

400
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,120
what you

401
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,399
get so uh I sitting in the back of his

402
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,879
in his Tahoe and this Tahoe has got a

403
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,039
police dog in it and it's barking like

404
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,278
crazy and then as I'm sitting in there I

405
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:07,399
can see his computer screen right yeah

406
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,879
and it's dudy trunk R the marijuana girl

407
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,360
someone pull over with marijuana

408
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,198
marijuana so his whole screen so this

409
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,600
traffic this traffic officer was not a

410
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,559
traffic officer at all it was RCMP Drug

411
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,720
Squad because Bill Blair was there he

412
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,719
was on a back road driving down the road

413
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,600
and you know what I pulled up beside him

414
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,600
and knew he was beside me didn't click

415
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,720
he was RCMP until after the fact I done

416
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,480
the video and left and went why was RCMP

417
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,199
there

418
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,839
they're feds so they're feds they

419
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,439
gowhere they they go anywhere they want

420
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,720
and back road doubt I doubt the RCMP

421
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,319
even have traffic cops I think they're

422
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,839
all federal agents I I I would actually

423
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:44,679
almost say you know what I think he

424
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,079
actually got something got something

425
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,599
that's that's like the federal task

426
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,679
force like they have down in the US

427
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,120
anytime you get busted for any sort of

428
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,239
like illegal drugs it's the RCMP even

429
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,879
when I ended up getting busted in west

430
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,360
Vancouver years ago it was RCMP RCMP

431
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,078
ended up coming in I got charged fed

432
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,800
it's not like a provincial crime it's

433
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,120
kind of confusing and weird but uh well

434
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,439
the bottom line is I'm sorry that you

435
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,360
got harassed that really sucks but I do

436
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,399
hope that uh you'll enjoy that big old

437
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,919
[ __ ] dry sift d i just hooked you up

438
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,360
with you it was so nice to be able to

439
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,078
sit here and do this D but yeah well we

440
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,399
got we got a nice uh couple of carb caps

441
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,000
if the one gets too

442
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,958
hot very nice melt on this it's

443
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,879
definitely a five star for sure maybe

444
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,599
closing it a little bit of char at the

445
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,278
end but uh

446
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,959
it's still pretty damn clean I'd say

447
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,879
it's I'd say it's a solid 98 there's a

448
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,719
tiny little bit of contaminant in there

449
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:42,000
that probably makes up the 1 to

450
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,600
2% uh I did do a very quick quick

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,399
cleaning and so uh who knows maybe when

452
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,040
I have more time when I clean this

453
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,000
one I'll take it to that next level

454
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,919
because it's for Johnny and my's head

455
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,120
it's basically head stash so me you and

456
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,639
my buddy who grew yeah yeah and you know

457
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,360
all the other people we puff it with and

458
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,519
and the best part about it is is he's

459
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,919
the guy who's going to Puff it too he

460
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,000
loves this stuff and and being able to

461
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,160
being able to actually finally show him

462
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,318
what he's been losing the look on his

463
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,360
face dude was like this he's like are

464
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,480
you kidding me I've been doing this for

465
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,479
20 years I like I know you throwing away

466
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:22,000

468
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000

469
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,879
are throwing in the garbage get yourself

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,960
a set of screens well here's the thing

471
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,840
this is what some of you Growers are

472
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,919
throwing in the garbage in fact I doubt

473
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,159
not a lot of people have that same sort

474
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,120
of mentality of the old school sort of

475
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,440
just you know I called it hilly Bill

476
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,279
hillbilly growing and I don't say it as

477
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,880
like a like a negative cuz I'm a

478
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:49,918
hillbilly I love that country hillbilly

479
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,840
action but the growing way of that sort

480
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,440
of like real loose and real sort of just

481
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,119
like w we'll just get her done it's not

482
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,360
always going to produce this you know

483
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:00,519
dealing with commercial Growers there's

484
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:03,240
a small percentage of them that even

485
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,639
best part he hung dry this everything

486
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,640
that I talk about is what he did yeah

487
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,679
you have to if and he got this why

488
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,600
because it was just the way he cured it

489
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,679
the way he grew it yeah the genetics

490
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,599
just the genetics everything there's no

491
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,120
unveiling of anything if if they don't

492
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:20,399
put it there in the first place you know

493
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,798
I'm telling you man a lot of people have

494
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,840
brought me sift in the last couple of

495
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:27,359
years and this is the first time in a

496
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:29,199
long time that I've been like been like

497
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,399
right on that's nice you know I saw the

498
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,480
look on your face you want me to clean

499
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,280
this I'm like well yeah I don't know and

500
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,759
you came up like this that's the good

501
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:41,000
one where last time the good one was

502
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,038
what we could it wasn't even a pile it

503
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,319
was like inconsequential I was really

504
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,798
really surprised

505
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,879
so once again the last one was

506
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,879
commercially

507
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,440
grown right more or less uh dried on

508
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,799
screens and not hung dry we should show

509
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:01,759
them a nice macro um

510
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:05,279
uh hit on the sapphire of this dry sift

511
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,558
oh my do I I I think I think you guys it

512
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,759
won't be this hit because I'm going to

513
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,440
be cleaning up the dish like really

514
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,759
clean but we cut as I'm about to take

515
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,558
this rip they're going to be seeing this

516
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,759
melt so if you want to like talk about

517
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,440
it Johnny B the Melt content I think the

518
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,720
best part about how this melts is how it

519
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,960
puddles right away and it swirls around

520
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,880
the bowl and goes into a really nice

521
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,440
liquid you can see it bubbling and then

522
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,440
you can almost see it dissipate so we're

523
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,159
not getting the great big huge bubbles

524
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,880
it kind of just kind of goes like water

525
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,880
it looks like

526
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,640
water and at the end of that see that is

527
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:44,079
my favorite cough you you get it in all

528
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,200
the videos the first video we did were

529
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,879
cleaning dryft in 40 minutes dry clean

530
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,360
in 40 minutes when we used to rip it so

531
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,700
hard it was like we were trying to get

532
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,319
like a like a pulled muscle in gr I know

533
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,759
[Applause]

534
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,158
like true true true true do that but I

535
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,960
mean it's come a long way and learning

536
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,720
exactly uh the proper ways of well I say

537
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,480
there's no proper way the way that you

538
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,319
like the way that you the proper ways

539
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,079
the proper ways because there's times

540
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,000
and temperatures some people I used to

541
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,918
like at higher heat but now that I'm not

542
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,720
such that harsh chronic pain anymore my

543
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,038
Pain's different now the lower heat

544
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,200
seems good have you ever seen me hitting

545
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:25,000
anything now at 710 at 740 anymore cuz

546
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,558
cuz I felt like that that higher hit hit

547
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,798
Me Harder this is more tpin and I can

548
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:30,720
see how the tping are being able

549
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,639
modulate and help me better that's why I

550
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,120
like the Sith so much it's because it

551
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,038
gives me all those flavors that I don't

552
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,918
get beautiful macro photos of this stuff

553
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,960
as well you can see glistening gland

554
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,440
heads mixed in with the plant matter

555
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,919
tiny tiny tiny little bits of plant

556
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,320
matter in there um with a little bit of

557
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,679
uh maybe citate stock solid 98% hash

558
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:54,918
with uh you know done in about I mean

559
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:57,200
realistically done in about four or five

560
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,280
minutes so I guess we'll end it with

561
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
that killer puff Wednesday say Johnny be

562
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,678
nice and short but sweet but but look at

563
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,279
how sweet that is and we're going to

564
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,080
continue doing some puffing here well

565
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,038
we'll sit and we'll puff for a bit I'll

566
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,918
clean this up so we get the bowl nice

567
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:12,000
and white and we'll film a really nice

568
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,038
macro rip of some dry sift hitting the

569
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,278
dish of course we're not going to carb

570
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,798
cap it so there is going to be a little

571
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,519
bit of a waste someone's going to get

572
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,599
