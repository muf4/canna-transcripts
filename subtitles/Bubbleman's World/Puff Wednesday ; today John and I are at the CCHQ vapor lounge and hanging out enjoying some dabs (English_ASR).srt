172
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,960
green apparently it's not because the

00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,800
key is green the key for the jam door is

174
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,918
green I always thought thought Adam

175
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,759
chose it because it was the uh the herb

176
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,399
in the key of green you know appar it's

177
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,199
a good story too you'll have to ask Adam

178
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,198
you come you have

179
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,038

watermelon got that one you

191
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,478

192
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,879
labeled differently like jod said she

193
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,918

194
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,599

195
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,639
you're dripping too well someone said

196
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,639
the other day you need to get a

197
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,038
container

198
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,479
that's not too bad these rubber ones

199
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,719
worry me though they have like compared

200
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:09,399
to the silicone ones feel this feel that

201
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,919
I have one that's called um yeah these I

202
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:15,519
have one that's called concentrate

203
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,399
that's silicone feel this oh my God conc

204
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,279
it's

205
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,318
rubber no I don't

206
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:24,598
think a

207
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,240
container and lid like one of those lip

208
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:30,439
containers kind of R through the lid and

209
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,158
the inside is oil slick resistant

210
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,879
but there's no corners like the corners

211
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,038
are rounded I actually just finished

212
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,399
building

213
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,240
my I got it all set up I don't even

214
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,360
smoke oil my hash is always just my

215
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,120
brother gave me like an old here I have

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,680
this for your birthday different way my

217
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,560
friend owns this company and I like to

218
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,079
support them and I kind of I don't think

219
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,639
people were putting hash in these before

220
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,200
I really sort of started putting full

221
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,480
milk in them

222
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,120
and it's for oil I'm like no it's for

223
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,920
everything man it's notop B Little P you

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,679
made them no like High

225
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,719
thing I don't know where I don't know

226
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,399
where he got that how do you like The

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,920
Hive Hive isn't that bad actually like I

228
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,879
like I'm more used to using like uh

229
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,719
Titan meals from just friends in general

230
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,399
that's had but like I don't know I

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,399
really like how it looks it's just like

232
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,159
when you uh drop sh just like at least

233
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,278
like a black scorcher when you obviously

234
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,759
didn't do it right so like if you like

235
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:21,958
tried to low temp it and you don't do it

236
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,919
right you'll know when you start [ __ ]

237
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,679
up when you just drip a little bit and

238
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,360
just go black and it's not like burning

239
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,439
it properly so it's just like you can

240
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,519
tell me to [ __ ] up I like cuz like with

241
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
I found with the titanium cuz like I'm

242
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,320
still really Nee dabbing and everything

243
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,480
right so like me too how long have you

244
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,839
been maybe a couple years I haven't

245
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,000
really been dabbing that long I've been

246
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,920
smoking but the weird thing with me is

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,440
in a sense I was dabbing without dabbing

248
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,919
I was like hitting full melt bubbl dry

249
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,800
sift for the last 12 to 15 years uh on a

250
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,599
super tight stainless steel screen like

251
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,120
Fanning it with a with a be line or

252
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,200
something it's just bubbling and melting

253
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,759
so basically I'm dabbing but it's like

254
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,240
it's not you know it's a little more

255
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,519
archaic okay I see this is

256
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,959
like oh I see I see but not even like

257
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,639
with a lighter I'd be more like even

258
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,078
even that Bowl's too dirty for me like

259
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,600
if you look at inside the bowl like

260
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,958
there's that's a lot of flavor stopper

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,040
i' keep a real clean Bowl have real

262
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,879
clean screens and just take like fresh

263
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,480
hit so it was literally like taking a

264
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,720
clean fresh hit just just people are

265
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,399
going to be like oh bubble man you're

266
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,600
such a snob or whatever but I'm just

267
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,600
it's just no it's true it's a true thing

268
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,000
flavor like I'm I'm more of like a

269
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,519
straight up like I'll take a balling

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
I'll take a dirty tote I'm one of those

271
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,480
guys could sit there and just do that

272
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,120
I've taken many yeah yeah you can did it

273
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,600
all through my 20 you always do it but

274
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,799
like sometimes you just want to sit

275
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,440
there and just have a really nice clean

276
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,719
tooke sometimes it's just really nice

277
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,920
yeah absolutely even this is too dirty

278
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,839
for me right now and I only am using

279
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,199
titanium cuz my whip for my quartz is

280
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,160
broken so I've got a new whip yeah I

281
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,079
rode over it with my chair and severed

282
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,559
the piece like an idiot so the good

283
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,799
people at Dil have have sent me a new

284
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,799
whip and I have multiple really nice

285
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,599
spooking bee quartz bowls at my house so

286
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,159
this won't see I'd like to get the

287
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,920
little drop down too I don't really like

288
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,879
the idea of putting the the ti nail

289
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,838
directly in even though it's it's fine

290
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,240
it works but we had our conversation

291
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,760
last time about the potential of

292
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,959
breakage and I know you took it and and

293
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:22,838
then the heat oh whatever it's all good

294
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,039
man but they were just talking I was

295
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,680
just downstairs and it should I should

296
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,559
get a drop down for this too and stuff

297
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,679
like that true it's true and it's if

298
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,078
we're going to be doing certain for this

299
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,919
would be nice right a little piece that

300
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,000
just went so this nail was right here

301
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,159
that would be pretty sweet cuz then it's

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,480
just the nervousness of putting it in a

303
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,600
in a in that Mothership

304
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,039
joint it's like definitely I was talking

305

to flab today and I was like what do you

306

308

00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,799
we're looking at exploring our medicine

378
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,600

mentioning about thetio and I was like

380

about today because it's something that

384
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,240
the first caps and T caps were

385
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,079
definitely uplifting and uh of course

386
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,879
caps would be good fighting fighting any

387
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,799
kind of disease or condition um this is

388
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,439
the way to go um full plant profile this

389
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,078

402
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,639
cush that's that I've seven

403
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,838
years pretty sick it's actually I I can

404
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,480
see I remember when he first had it it

405
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,120
was a big slab like

406
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,519
this a couple years ago now that slab's

407
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,198
he's like yeah you

408
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,919
got

409
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,159
remember the rim to heat it up a bit and

410
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,120
we'll drop it in there takes a few

411
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,759
seconds because a lot of the Turpin over

412
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,759
time evaporate out at room temperature

413
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,079
so you get a kind of a slow melt almost

414
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,199
like a lava but then as it as it as it

415
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,120
accesses the oils inside that have been

416
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,439
preserved it starts start bubbling and

417
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,120
melting at that

418
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,480
