1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:58,590
[Music]

2
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
a

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,000
[Music]

4
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:32,378
[Music]

5
00:01:34,780 --> 00:02:01,840
[Music]

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
he

7
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:14,318
[Music]

8
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,560
all right so doing a little pre-soak

9
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,318
here yeah getting things nice and cold

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,759
he's rocking the trim and the and the

11
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,238
ice and it's a good

12
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,079
idea it's always good you ever pre-wash

13
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,120
your

14
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
trim there's a little trick you can do

15
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,400
with the trim after after I make it

16
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,640
sometime I wash the hash okay okay yeah

17
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,039
this is a different little trick I'll

18
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,039
show you it's uh basically

19
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,878
about just taking what just doing

20
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,959
basically what you're doing pre- soaking

21
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,799
it and then when you take it out of

22
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,280
there a lot of the contaminant will stay

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,280
in the water okay that's that's a good

24
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,598
idea buddy yeah you just filter the you

25
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,199
can filter it out and still save the

26
00:02:53,598 --> 00:03:01,039
hash that is potentially lost as well

27
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:04,359
your can too buddy what's that

28
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,359
Fu [ __ ]

29
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,799
sh so basically where we're walking used

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,360
to be under the

31
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,360
ocean looks like that it really does

32
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:31,080

90
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,359
it's a lot of work man it's commendable

91
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,758
you know the Ganja Farmer is a hard

92
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,879
working man but it's not work when

93
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,639
you're having fun exactly when you love

94
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,080

95
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:06,189
work when the [ __ ] Federal is taken

96
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,839
from you oh that's stress

97
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:10,279
[Laughter]

98
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,519
oh yeah we can't have

99
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:15,598
that well good job man I'm impressed I

100
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,279
really like what you got going on

101
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:22,800
here so I feed them basically water

102
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:26,038
every day and I use like the goat the

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,478
goat manure I put it inside the tires

104
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,120
with mixed with the dirt do you do you

105
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,758
water in the morning or or do you water

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,759
as Sunset well in this stage it's it's

107
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,120
better to water in the evening yeah

108
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,319
that's what I'm saying those ones over

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,759
there is best to water in the morning

110
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,759
because they they could gather the

111
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,639
energy to grow in the day and these ones

112
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,360
are flouring so they water them in the

113
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,199
night so they use the water to make big

114
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,800
buds you know mhm all right so the

115
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,560
vegging ones water at in the morning

116
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,000
keep them from burning give them water

117
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,199
to produce their their vegetative state

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,879
and then

119
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,879
water these guys at night they're I I'd

120
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,479
say about one to two weeks some of them

121
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,479
seem a little more than a week in yeah

122
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,598
what what is it this seems a couple

123
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,800
weeks in well they're all the same ages

124
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,478
but um some of them are faster than some

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,400
because there's the mixed train with the

126
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:25,279
blueberry and um the the diesel right

127
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,399
yeah so they

128
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,719
move whatever some come looking like the

129
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,278
blueberry and some come looking like the

130
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,879
Diesel and some come looking like

131
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,439
something different I don't know you

132
