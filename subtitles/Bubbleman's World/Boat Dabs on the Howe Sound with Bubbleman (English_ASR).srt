Hey guys, Bubbleman here. Just just

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
hopping in the boat for the first time

4
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,559
of the season and heading out onto the

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,520
Pacific Ocean here. We call this little

6
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,879
section the house sound and it is my

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,960
home. Beautiful. Got my little dog with

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,079
me. Oris, how's it going, buddy? You

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,000
good? You good? Yeah. Yeah, you're good.

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
You love on the boat.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,160
Okay. So, I was hoping on getting a few

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,120
friends out on the boat today, but uh

13
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,359
for now, I think we're just going to

14
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,359
head out to the back side of Gambia or

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,679
sorry, uh Ber, which is that island

16
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,840
right in front of me there, that little

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,359
guy that's the closest. And uh well, I

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,159
think we'll uh we'll go have a little

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,159
dab session over there.

Heat. Heat.

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,159
Now you're living in this

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,159
life. So this boat goes about 45 miles

24
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,840
an hour.

25
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,759
Not the fastest boat on the sound, but

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,439
uh not definitely fast enough when you

27
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,599
want to go shred the the ocean. I go a

28
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,599
little

29
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:12,959
faster. They won't see the next ride.

00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,959
They won't. They won't. They

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,039
won't. So many I recycle

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:27,039
garbage. They won't see the next life.

All

00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,879
right. Well, that was a nice little rip

61
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,599
across the How sound. Just a few

62
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,478
minutes. And uh I'm at my office. So,

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
this is my office. This is where I I

64
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,120
usually come and spend a lot of the

65
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:29,519
summers. Um if I got to work, if I got

66
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
to do editing, I come out here, sit out

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,198
on the boat, and uh just sit right in

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
the back of this island. It's always

69
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
calm here. Even on the windiest of days,

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,360
it's uh 90% of the time it's going to be

71
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,680
calm unless the water's coming up from a

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,520
particular angle from up north from

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,199
Squamish. Um just checking it out to see

74
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,198
if there's any seals on the rocks

75
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,600
because

76
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,680
um well, the moms, they they come here

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,680
and they lay their their babies out on

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,478
the rocks just to hang tough and then

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,600
they go feed for them, go hunt for food.

80
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,758
So, it's uh it's nature. You're going to

81
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,560
see uh potentially out here we'll see

82
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,520
bald eagles, gold eagles, um sea lions,

83
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,680
seals, uh killer whales, humpback

84
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,719
whales, blue whales, and Pacific

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,400
white-sided dolphins. Those are all all

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,800
little bits of nature that you can see

87
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,918
out in here. And it's uh it's pretty

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,840
damn sweet when you see it, I got to

89
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,279
say. The seals, they blend right in with

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,638
the rocks, though. So, they're literally

91
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,839
the hardest thing to see on the coast

92
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,199
here.

93
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,359
I'm sure there's got to be some here,

94
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,759
though. They're always here. Pretty

95
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,759
early, but

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,759
uh we'll tag along the side of the

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,639
island here for a little bit and see if

98
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,120
we can't catch a little wildlife to uh

99
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,759
to have a session with. My dog will keep

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
an eye out on

101
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,680
things. What do you say,

102
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:01,240
horse? Out on the out on the water.

103
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,199
co-pilot. Dog is my

104
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,120
co-pilot. Look at how beautiful the

105
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,280
mountains are that I that I that you

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
don't see very often because they are

107
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,279
where I live. It's not in my view, but

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,439
uh yeah, those are the mountains that I

109
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,318
live

110
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,519
on. Pretty

111
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,160
sweet. Really surprised we haven't seen

112
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,839
any seals out here yet. Usually would

113
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,280
have seen like 20 or 30. It must be too

114
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,359
early. Or they're all out somewhere else

115
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,159
hanging out. Man, what a beautiful day

116
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,479
it is today. Let's hope D420K and Johnny

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,360
B can get out later today to come for a

118
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,199
little spin. Come for a little puff

119
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,759
down. Um jeez, I guess you could call

120
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,280
this uh ocean dabs. The ocean dab

121
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,759
session. Hooking up my buddies out

122
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,879
here. Show them the

123
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,120
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

124
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,399
place. It's

125
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,840
uh yeah, you can live out here for a

126
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,399
long time, you know, and not be and if

127
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:02,159
you don't have a boat, it's really quite

128
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,159
a different experience from having a

129
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,318
boat. Probably going to truck around

130
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,198
this whole island once I've had a few

131
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,960
few puffs. I was kind of hoping on

132
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,439
showing you guys some seals, but we

133
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,719
might have to wait uh might have to wait

134
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,918
for that cuz it seems like it's a little

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
bit early. It's about 8:00 in the

136
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,318
morning right now. So, I uh I really

137
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,598
jumped the gun today and and got out

138
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,400
nice and

139
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:28,240
early. So

140
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:30,560
sweet. You guys a little view what I'm

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
checking

142
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,360
out. See the water's down. Not not as

143
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,478
low low low low as it goes, but it's

144
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,439
definitely a a little bit low from the

145
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:53,000
tide marks that you can see across

146
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,000
across the mountain

147
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,399
careful around this side because you

148
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,400
have uh you have more

149
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,959
rocks. There's a

150
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,120
seal poking his head out over there on

151
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,120
the

152
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,479
water. Probably some out of the water,

153
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,240
but I don't know. There's another one

154
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,038
over there.

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,120
This could be the

156
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,639
moms

157
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,000
hunting while the babies relax on the

158
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,000
rocks, but I haven't seen any

159
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,120
babies. Usually don't go too close into

160
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:54,559
this little area cuz uh you can smoke

161
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:58,560
rocks. Although right now we are 53 ft

162
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,159
57 ft. So not too bad.

163
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,599
tell you those rock towers can come up

164
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,990
pretty damn fast though when you're

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,800
cruising along in a

167
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,879
boat. All

168
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:15,639
right, this looks as good as any spot.

169
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,639
What do you guys say?

170
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,679
All

171
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:25,919
right, let's get this

172
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,919
untied. And

173
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,399
this

174
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,080
actually Yeah.

175
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:04,559
Oops. Look at this. The

176
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,600
biminy boat essential for the house

177
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:12,639
sound. getting a hot summer this year

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,399
and uh it is really really essential to

179
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,039
have this thing down when you're a pasty

180
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,039
white guy like

181
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,440
me. Must hide from

182
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,039
sun. Must hide from

183
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,800
[Music]

184
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,639
sun. All right, guys. Well, we made it.

185
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,319
We made it to my office. We're sitting

186
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,399
on the back side. I guess we're sitting

187
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,240
on

188
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:42,000
the east uh side, the east coast

189
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,680
of Ber Boyer Island. If you want to

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,320
Google that, it's in the House Sound.

191
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,000
And uh it's a habitable island. There's

192
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
a few people that live on it, but not a

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,159
ton. I got seals, three or four of them,

194
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,000
floating right in front of the boat now.

195
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,719
Maybe they'll uh they'll come up to the

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,159
side and to the back and we'll see them.

197
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,600
So, today I'm just going to have a quick

198
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,838
little session out here with you guys.

199
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
don't have a ton to talk about, but I

200
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
really figured more than anything this

201
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
would be an eye candy video. The boats

202
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,639
on a slow 360° turn. So, we're going to

203
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,480
get the mountains uh in behind. Then

204
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,720
we'll eventually be posting up towards

205
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,959
the north where you can see um the

206
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Diamond Head and the Gabaldi Mountains

207
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:22,799
as well as um Anvil Island, one of the

208
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,120
islands here in the House Sound. So,

209
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,240
I've got my mother ship Taurus filled up

210
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,360
with ocean water, rocking the DC glass

211
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,759
banger. Thank you very much for that DC

212
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,000
glass. And uh I brought out a little bit

213
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,000
of

214
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,838
rosin. We got that right there, too. I

215
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,159
know you can't really see it, especially

216
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,079
cuz it's not in the sun, but just trust

217
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,240
that it's amazing and beautiful. You

218
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,679
know, it

219
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,480
is. Oh. So, yeah. I'm going to invite

220
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,919
Johnny B and D420K out on the boat later

221
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,360
on. Hopefully, they come out for a

222
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,399
little session. Be kind of fun to have

223
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,039
them out on the boat. Um, you know, for

224
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,958
me, having a boat is really mostly about

225
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,240
just uh a a good 50% of it is doing this

226
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,159
right here, getting to where you're

227
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,759
going,

228
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,600
stopping, having an awesome session.

229
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,319
That

230
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,759
is boat fun like to the tea for me. Um,

231
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,720
the other part of this boat that I

232
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,759
really love, which we're going to do

233
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,560
this summer, is wake skating, wake

234
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,319
surfing, and wake boarding. Uh, in that

235
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,159
order, wake skating is by far my

236
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,440
favorite. Wake surfing is my second

237
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,039
favorite because you don't need the rope

238
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,279
and it's kind of cool to get in behind

239
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,199
and jam behind the boat. And then wake

240
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,679
boarding is kind of on my third of the

241
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,000
list. It's uh I got hurt a couple years

242
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,919
ago trying to jump a wave and tweaked my

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,759
neck and have to admit I've been a

244
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,559
little bit afraid of the wake board ever

245
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,799
since the wake skate and the wake surf.

246
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,479
I'm able to easily jump off and it it is

247
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,559
removed from my feet. But I'll tell you,

248
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,920
when you whip when you when you bail at

249
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:57,838
20 m plus an hour uh on that wake board

250
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:59,360
and it grabs the wrong way, and I'll

251
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,519
tell you, that is some serious ankle

252
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,240
pain that you do not want. I'm sure that

253
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,159
many of you out there can

254
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,879
attest. So, I guess it's time to

255
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,879
uh light this puppy

256
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,680
up. Loving the DC bangers. Real thick

257
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,278
glass. Um, kind of a little bit of a

258
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,439
nerve-wracker in the sense that you

259
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,919
really do need a decent torch. You need

260
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,079
to uh have a decent flame to get this

261
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,199
thing hot. Just burning off a little bit

262
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:31,278
of my last hit that I took here before I

263
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,639
went on cam. You know, you got to take

264
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,519
that hit just to make sure it's going to

265
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,278
work out. The prehit hit, I like to call

266
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,879
it. Sometimes I take a pre prehit hit.

267
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm sure most of you know there out

268
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,039
there what I'm talking about.

269
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
Love the portability of the Mothership

270
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,319
Taurus as well. You know, I don't feel

271
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,000
it with my straight fab. Obviously, the

272
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,839
thing is huge and I definitely don't

273
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,159
feel it with my egg either, but the

274
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,880
Taurus just really feels like a piece

275
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:00,198
that you can bring with you anywhere.

276
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,198
And uh well, I damn near have, haven't

277
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:03,198
I? All

278
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,159
right. Dabs on the

279
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,000
ocean. H surprisingly not as warm as you

280
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
might think. Never got to

281
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:42,120
orange. Very nice. Very tasty.

282
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,239
Loving the mother ship, loving the

283
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,279
rosin, and loving the house sound today

284
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,919
on the

285
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:52,240
[Laughter]

286
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:54,919
boat. Getting a little bit close. I'll

287
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,519
back her up a little

288
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:01,439
bit. Another thing that you boat people

289
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,440
will recognize, the

290
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,120
endless the endless backing up. You

291
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,838
don't want to be too close to that uh to

292
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,120
that coastline.

293
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,160
Luckily for me, this boat has a great

294
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,120
reverse. Always remember when you're

295
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,519
backing up in a boat, too, to look. I'll

296
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,000
tell you, if there was anything floating

297
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,399
or, you know, god forbid, like a rope or

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,919
something from someone's buoy, you're

299
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,919
pretty much uh going to say goodbye to

300
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,719
your

301
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,000
prop, goodbye to boating for that

302
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,879
day. I've learned all the lessons the

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,879
hard way, that is for sure.

304
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:45,638
Oops. Bang. Boom.

305
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:48,679
Bam. Oh, yeah. This is

306
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,278
the incredible amazing

307
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,599
spot. Might head up to Horseshoe Bay or

308
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,198
Bowen Island later. You start getting uh

309
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,040
you stop at this spot and then you head

310
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,479
to the next spot and you you can travel

311
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,519
a fair distance throughout the house

312
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,759
sound. I mean, it's pretty big. I'm

313
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,198
hoping on getting Rob Clark uh up here

314
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
this summer. He was thinking of heading

315
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,359
up to California and if he did, he was

316
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,198
going to try and make it uh make it up

317
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,839
north to see us for a little bit. And

318
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:17,359
Rob is an avid fisherman. I would love

319
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,279
to do a salmon fishing with Rob Clark

320
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,519
video here in the house sound. And the

321
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,838
pinks are running this year, so it's

322
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,399
totally realistic that we could uh that

323
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,800
we could get such a thing

324
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,360
done. What's up, Orus? What's up, little

325
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,278
bud? My dog gets slightly nervous on the

326
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,720
boat. Not too nervous, but just nervous

327
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,159
enough to give a little a little kind of

328
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,160
Was that a tick? What do you got on you?

329
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,639
Oh, no. You w you went through Oh, I see

330
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,639
what you got on you. Jeez, you got a

331
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,919
gazillion of these on you. These are

332
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,919
probably what's pulling your

333
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:53,240
hair. Dogs. Hey, aren't they funny?

334
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,000
Funny little creatures. Love

335
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,159
them. Well, I don't really have too too

336
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,600
much left to say. Um, I've already

337
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,439
mentioned a few times Periscope, new

338
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,038
app, doing some live video footage.

339
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,038
Quality is not that great, but it's kind

340
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,558
of cool how fast you can just go live.

341
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,480
So, I am going to be using that a little

342
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,160
bit. And for those of you that enjoy

343
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,360
Bubbleman's World and might feel that

344
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,199
you're missing out, you can just check

345
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,159
me out. Join uh add me on Twitter, BC

346
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,000
Bubbleman. The app works through

347
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,880
Twitter, so you can't really avoid that.

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,679
And, uh, the app is called Periscope.

349
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,000
And uh I may just go live right now on

350
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,559
Periscope at BC Bubbleman. Thanks for

351
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,319
watching, guys. And

352
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,839
uh this video is not over. We've got a

353
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,960
little bit more boating to do. So you

354
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,319
guys are coming with me. I hope you

355
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,079
don't mind. All right. So just as I

356
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:43,079
started to pull away, I saw a gold

357
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,079
eagle.

Don't react before you know now. You may

360
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:10,038
act on an impulse. That's wrong. That's

361
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,038
wrong. That's wrong.

362
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,960
Now your next door

363
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:23,199
neighbor has a wrong impression of

364
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,200
you. That's wrong. That's wrong. That's

365
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:34,960
wrong. Feeling up against

366
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:37,519
someone who is in the That's wrong.

367
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,279
That's wrong.

368
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,839
Sorry for the short shitty footage

369
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,678
there, guys. But

370
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,798
uh yeah, that bird was flying at about

371
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,480
35 m an

372
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,879
hour. Beautiful. They seem to hang out

373
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,480
off the coast of this

374
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,039
island almost all the time. Where the

375
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,880
most place the place I've seen golden

376
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,679
eagles the most uh is right here on uh

377
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,780
off the coast of

378
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,880

Living off

381
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,519
limitations with false

382
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:17,839
impressions. That's wrong. That's wrong.

383
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,839
That's

384
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:26,599
wrong. Wouldn't you be

385
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,759
sorry? You're acting on a false

386
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:32,279
impression. So be

387
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:37,480
sure before you react. Be

388
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:40,678
sure before you react, wouldn't you be

389
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,919
sorry? We're acting on a force

390
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,759
impression. So be

391
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,280
sure before you be

392
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:51,440
sure.

393
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,960
Well, that was a little bit of uh the

394
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,038
house sound for you. Wish I could have

395
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,640
showed you a little bit more wildlife.

396
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,160
I'll be trucking around out here for the

397
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,080
rest of the summer, though, so I'll try

398
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,798
and catch some whales and some uh

399
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,480
dolphins at least to share with you

400
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,960
guys. Always nice to share dabs with the

401
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,839
dolphins and the whales. And uh I guess

402
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,759
I'll call it a call it a day on this

403
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,038
particular video. I may still get

404
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:18,000
together with uh D420K and Johnny B or

405
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,160
one or the other, if not both, I hope.

406
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,279
And uh that'll probably be another video

407
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,200
to ensue as well. So stay tuned and keep

408
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,079
watching Bubble Man's World. Thanks for

409

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,720
on the other side? Someone's making

417
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,720
judgment of you. That's wrong.
