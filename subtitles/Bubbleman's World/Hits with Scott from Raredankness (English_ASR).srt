Bubble Man's World. Welcome here with

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
Scott from Rur Dankness. What's wrong?

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
We're in Amsterdam at the Krasolski

5
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,118
Hotel with some other good friends,

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,880
Buddha, Alio, and John B. off camera.

7
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:37,679
We're about to hit the moonshine haze

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,679
bubble. Yeah, man. Might as well hit

9
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,119
it. Wait,

10
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,359

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,439
double

12
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:56,920
domes. We'll

13
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,919
take it from here.

14

15
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:09,349
Go suck out the bel line.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
All right, we're blowing the hits out

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,000
the window because it's 3:00 in the

19
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,640
morning. We don't really feel like

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,280
dealing with security, but we'll have

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
more from the Cannabis Cup later. Peace.
