here and of course uh like we always do

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,120

Bret got out and he walked around and he

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,038

better so we can talk a little bit um

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,119
about how we got into making hash that'd

66
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,519
be perfect dude because that's kind of

67
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,400
what I wanted to ask you guys from a

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,400
perspective of like fresh on the game

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,239
well I would say it first off started um

70
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,280
with me and Adam being inspired by

71
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,560
seeing full melt resin that we couldn't

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,360
purchase um couldn't go out and buy so

73
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,680
we decided we were going to take it upon

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,599
ourselves to try and make it um mind you

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,280
that that was a a long road to where we

76
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:14,518
are now not that long I mean not long in

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,680
time but long long in um um actually

78
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,640
practicing you know and making a lot of

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,040
hash and it wouldn't be possible without

80
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,878
you know the help of our our Collective

81
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:27,039
and our crew behind us um because that

82
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,158
really gave us opportunity to uh you

83
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,878
know hone in on our skills guys like

84
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:36,000
Phil in knowledge uh coming in to the

85
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:38,560
crew uh definitely helped um and and

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,280
your videos really um got some water in

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,438
there yes there's definitely water in

88
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,239
there beautiful well I'll hit this while

89
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,759
you continue to tell the story of uh how

90
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,759
you guys got into this yeah so basically

91
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,519
we just started making hash for

92
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,598
ourselves and um yeah we met up with the

93
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,560
West Coast Collective guys they seem to

94
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:59,000
like the hash and uh wanted to offer a

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,598
solventless product in their Collective

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,479
so we came in and um started doing that

97
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:08,318
for them and then um we started with

98
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,759
Rosen dryft um when Phil came in he

99
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,798
really helped us hone in on the bubble

100
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:16,199
scales so now you see um some beautiful

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,239
bubble like that oh yeah it's not it's

102
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,239
not really a long story we basically

103
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,478
were inspired we went out and try and

104
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,599
did something we accomplished it and we

105
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:26,800
try and just redo that day after day

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,520
after day well I think it's going to be

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,478
an inspiration for people to listen to

108
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,639
because they all want to be doing it yep

109
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:35,359
and so I mean really I think from my

110
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,400
perspective the the tip I always give

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,439
people is is hone in on the best quality

112
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,000
possible yeah because that's where you

113
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,680
want to pay your attentions to yes

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,918
that's all that matters if you find

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,478
something that someone thinks is the

116
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,439
bomb but it's not you're kind of wasting

117
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,439
your time in that sense of like why is

118
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,918
my product not melting why you know why

119
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:58,038
am I getting such shitty yields why I'm

120
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:00,478
personally bummed when I run a bat and

121
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:03,279
it's just not yeah it's not what you're

122
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,478
what you're expecting yeah for sure or

123
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,879
or when somebody um you know the whole

124
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,719
uh trash to stash it's like you're only

125
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:14,839
going to get as good as good as melt as

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,960
the uh you know the product that the the

127
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:21,519
resin comes from um it's hard to turn

128
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:23,279
real trash into six-star full melt um a

129
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,519
lot of the time damn near impossible

130
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,918
it's damn like you go and shake the

131
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,120
Grower's hand when you're done fire in

132
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,639
fire out always what always say fire in

133
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,560
fire out I'd say that's the most

134
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,759
important thing to remember this is some

135
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,759
great uh tasty bubble of course uh I'll

136

Do all right so yeah we've been trying

153
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,279

00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,598
more little dab a doodle here while

165
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,318
we're try the other stuff here let's do

166
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:01,360
it

167
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,439
the

168
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,038
PC we're going to do a little uh

169
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,000
Periscope after this too so I want to

170
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,038
keep this video short and sweet kind of

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
the inspirational video of like young

172
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:14,918
fresh new hash makers that want to make

173
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,639
their Mark you know this is a video that

174
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,560
I want to be able to sort of answer a

175
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,720
few questions to people like that which

176
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,959
is you know where do you start quality y

177
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,599
That's pretty key and then the

178
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,560
information I guess when you're someone

179
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,399
that doesn't know how do you know what

180
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,478
information is real and what information

181
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:36,318
is not experimentation yeah yeah really

182
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,240
R&amp;D because there's so many things out

183
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
there and you may you may think

184
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,160
something works and then you try it and

185
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,240
you you quickly come to the realization

186
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,240
that it doesn't um we all have those

187
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,439
ideas and you know after you make it for

188
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,038
a year um you start realizing what works

189
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,800
what doesn't uh in the end fire in fire

190
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,000
out um is is the main not to mention

191
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
when you say something like I've been

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,120
making hash for a year that can mean a

193
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,840
lot of different things depending on

194
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,120
where you're coming from like oh I made

195
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,119
like three batches in the last year

196
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,000
that's what I mean or we make like 5 to

197
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,038
10 batches a day 365 days a year so

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,598
those are two different sort of

199
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,519
spectrums mind you I wouldn't say we're

200
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,439
making hash 10 batches a day 365 days a

201
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,799
year but we definitely get to make hash

202
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,839
every week um if we aren't making hash

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,759
we're making Ros and we're trying to

204
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,679
understand um more about the plant we

205
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,719
all love awesome really right on guys

206
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,079
and what uh when people ask me locally

207
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,399
where can they pick up West Coast

208
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,320

209

they just did a pickup of uh some of our

214
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,440
purple candy uh full spectrum it was a

215
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,159
really nice drop and I think the guys

216
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,200
over there grabbed a couple GRS for

217
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:03,439

219
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,720
