00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,718
dude he really was a dick he was so

18
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,000
trying to discredit how can of was

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,518
therapeutic and that's why I said

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,079
Priceless Surprises I found he was

21
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,600
trying how how are you trying to say

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,599
that cannabis has no therapeutic value

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,239
and and this is what health Canada keeps

24
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,839
saying and over and the guy goes well we

25
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,719
got 600 people doing this we got these

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,118
studies doing that and he's like well

27
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,920
yeah but if we look at the numbers and

28
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,118
the percentages and you say well are you

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,879
accurate with this it was it was it was

30
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,879
the way he was trying to do things that

31
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,039
in my opinion it was

32
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,920
like oh it's right here well I feel the

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,680
same way dude I feel the exact same way

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
that it was just uh he was just trying

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,320
he was doing this passive aggressive

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,880
thing where he was trying desperately to

37
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,078
piss him off to to yeah get him to say

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,640
something get him to make a mistake to

39
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:38,319
get him to to say something that he that

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,519
he shouldn't be saying to to get him to

41
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,158
say a mistake and it just it just didn't

42
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,839
feel very I don't know I didn't like it

43
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,840
at

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,478
all why mention of it right now because

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,320
came across as a bit of a dick he was a

46
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,959
dick and it wasn't the the regular

47

135
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,560
couple of dabs while you're hashing and

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,680
dabbing loading up a couple of mighties

137
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,000

started on the mountain before on the

140
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,839
mountain we hid it in the hot tub we

00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,758
took it up to the mountain and we had it

142
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,519
in the bike park or sorry I keep calling

143
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,240
it The Bike Park that's how warm it is

144
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,079

149
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,639
nyush had some a with me but I I didn't

150
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,560
I have these uh this thing has a

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,360
hilarious um it looks like a grinder and

152
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,038
it breaks in half and then you put the

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,038
bottom half and you screw it into here

154
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,918
and it makes this big circle and then

155
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,199
you can basically grind weed with your

156
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:47,279
grinder and dump it right into this

157
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,360
piece that it fits perfect and then the

158
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,359
center hole pulls out and all the weed

159
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,439
funnels into the middle I it was quite a

160
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,240
unique uh little thing although I didn't

161
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,240
use it and I'll tell you why I didn't

162
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,800
use it because I found the medtainer

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,759

202
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,079
attention

203
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,478

206
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,759
all so we're we're actually seeing how

207
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,560
long it takes can you dab or can you hit

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,680
the the the the good old Mighty well

209
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,879
you're good to go you could start

210
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,598
hitting Vape hits right now it just

211
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,158
hasn't reached full temp I I'm going to

212
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,639

here

215
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,918
sucks to you hitting this dry that's the

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
one bummer we should have put some water

217
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:18,639
in it I'm sorry that's okay I I just

218
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,280
find when you carry a Dabber and hash

219
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,680
and medtainers and weed and a bong bag

220
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,478
and a bong and the nail and the

221
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,439
Dome all these different things it's

222
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,959
like thirsty might as well throw in a

223
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,519
bottle of bong

224
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,240
water maybe if I keep a bottle with just

225
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,240
bong water in it I won't drink water or

226
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,360
you could get yourself a bottle of water

227
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,759
that you could drink when you're thirsty

228
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,360
and you could get another bottle of

229
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,759
water for your bong when you need to

230
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,680

231
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,799

we got John here two things here

404
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,799
actually first things first is the new

405
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,078
deep dish Banger I believe Brian was one

406
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:24,078
of the guys that helped design this unit

407
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:27,958
it's got a little piece for holding the

408
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,599
uh holding the bar of the the heater

409
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,359
this goes in yeah right like that Dil

410
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,529
will be on the front see the words there

411
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
it goes and then you want to turn this

412
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,198
[Music]

413
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:41,679
on and then you'll also most likely have

414
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:44,318
to turn this on which will start giving

415
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,239
you your temperature increase so check

416
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:49,240
this out how this works is this wraps

417
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,639
along the bottom like this I'm going to

418
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,159
turn the other way around you want it

419
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
the other way around yeah no problem

420
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,039
just cuz I'm going to say that's going

421
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,839
to turn in and then boom and it just

422
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,159
sits like that and that's your deep dish

423
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,440
banger so that's exciting we got water

424
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,000
in the bong now this bong I'll tell you

425
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,400

430
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,279
and you're giving this to me too

431
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:28,639
noing out for things today now we got

432
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,558
you no no no no no I'm kidding no it's

433
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,200
going good so then the quartz Banger as

434
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,879
well fits on there on the deep dish

435
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,400
Banger the quartz carb cap check that

436
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,799
out boys nice fit that fits perfectly I

437
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
smell the beginning of it heating up too

438
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,119
which is yeah just cleaning off the

439
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,880
element and getting that out it's at

440
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,759
360° so far so climbing so quick how

441
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,840
nice is the Ninja nail you know what I

442
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,679
thought was really cool cuz I'm looking

443
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,038
at think this is really cool and I was

444
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,559
think it'd be cool if if it was on the

445
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,038
side here and goes well then that would

446
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:56,359
compromise a lot of things well that's

447
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,919
why they didn't do it yeah no it makes

448
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,839
sense but then but then I was like

449
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,799
pulling up this really oh so softly and

450
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,399
this ninja note for me and it came right

451
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,798
out came right out exactly I'm not going

452
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
to do it right now because I put this

453
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:11,720
back in here but this pulls right out

454
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,559
and it's this big yeah dude it's like

455
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,038
let's get some dabs ready here we go

456
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,158

462
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,678
do you mean

463
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:33,798
you must have

464
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,640
tried yeah but it wasn't the live sift

465
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:37,759
I've never I haven't seen you that's

466
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,880
what I thought he was saying no earlier

467
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,400
today he was no there is no live Sif out

468
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,640
there that dude should be showing up

469
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,559
with you getting warm you're 710 in it

470
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,240
710 load your when do I stop this thing

471
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,119
wow that is a pretty Co P stop you let

472
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,558
it you know what I think you'll get more

473
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,558
of the

474
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,558
dish that's what I was I just went to

475
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,798
put my fingers there and I was like how

476
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,519
do you yeah so you push it up and then

477
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,400
yeah you get more radiant heat well

478
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,400
that's it cuz it wasn't just quite going

479
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,559
up enough with the other

480
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,919
one can get it up a little bit more no I

481
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,960
guess it is supposed to go upside down I

482
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,320
guess that's enough

483
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,600
I I guess it radiant catches up yeah

484
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,558
okay there we go that's sitting a little

485
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,240
bit better always learning with the new

486
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:29,558
tools quite a few times when I got

487
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,440
different um New pieces from Dil I would

488
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,918
always even well for instance when I put

489
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,159
the sapphire insert on my titanium nail

490
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,520
and I it didn't go right in and mine sat

491
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,720
on top yeah well that became a tech that

492
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,240
people started using but Brian said you

493
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,440
just did it wrong and I said no I didn't

494
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
do it wrong I asked you to grind down

495
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,640
the middle part yeah so that it fit

496
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,319
flush with the edges and when you did it

497
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,640
got it got wider and this the insert

498
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:56,759
didn't fit anymore so it was just kind

499
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,559
of a funny little seven star dab on the

500
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,158

little bit of

518
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,320
a I remember I closed my eyes when I did

519
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,880
that because someone did a video said

520

close the eyes did you I got it I got it

521
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,679
in my eye in Jamaica that's why I just

522
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,158
that was a bummer see I I learned from

523
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,840
his video to close my eyes while blowing

524
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,840
inside when did you press that this is

525

526
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,959
right there I pulled it out of here and

527
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,558
then I just pressed I was like where the

528
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,558
hell did you press that [ __ ] to have a

529
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:14,879
long yeah you didn't have a long one now

530
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:18,200
we need some parchment let's press you

531
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,880
up something real oh wow yeah look so

532

534
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,799
put this all in one

535
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,360
I don't know if I'm going to be so lucky

536
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,960
with my finger press your finger press I

537
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,278
don't know if it's going to finger press

538
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,840
I doubt it it

539
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:46,519
should don't doubt nothing buy the

540
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,639
pressure feel I'm not a finger presser

541
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,240
typically I just change the Dabber to

542
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,520
bit the dab size I

543
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,120
want on over

544
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:00,319
there that's nice it cleans real nice

545
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:03,519
with the Dabber oh yeah you can clean

546
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:07,278
the residual that's that's on there you

547
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:11,918
can see the the dish is way below the

548
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:11,919
neck of the piece which I got to say I

549
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,558

552
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:32,558
I have I don't think I've ever had hit a

553
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,879
Dil set up to a big RAR tube like that

554
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,798
this was the first color section that

555
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,080
this was the first color section that

556
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:44,359
Martin bizzel had ever pulled so he had

557
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,639
only blown clear glass before 2003 when

558
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,359
he did this pipe with Mike fro that's

559
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,320
cool pretty [ __ ] cool man that's

560
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,158
pretty cool I don't know why I keep

561
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,158
trying to load more and more more

562
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,120
because yours looked like a big slab of

563
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,840
freaking flesh and just lowering in the

564
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,558

for a nice little uh yeah let's get

566
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:08,200
something on the little bit closer okay

567
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:11,678

568
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,759
to dab the [ __ ] out of me all right

569
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,919
that's not too bad you know Seven Star

570
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,720
let's do it barely held onto the nail

571
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,278
okay all right let's see what we got we

572
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,278
got the the deep dish

573
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,880
got to pull off that car he's falling

574
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,400
up hold in hold it

575
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:56,159
in hold it

576
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,159
in hold it take it smoke it clear it

577
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,640
there we

578
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,319
go something like doing a sesh I was

579
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,558
ready as soon as you inhaled I'm ready

580
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,038
to be like so what do you think about

581
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,759
that MK Ultra is it like the MKS you've

582
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,519
tried I only it's been a year since I've

583
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,480
seen it and now I can't even remember

584
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,759
what that original CBD

585
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,159
Renee do you want to have a hit of

586
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:29,000
that now this one isn't the Supreme like

587
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,039
liquid melter yeah but it has a amazing

588
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,839
head space that I think that you will

589
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,640
enjoy well I was already I mean I

590
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,038
haven't that I think I wanted to ask you

591
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,679
but then we were when we were together

592
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,759
just we were talking about it was me and

593
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,759
you talking about strains that are

594
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,079
really hard on the nail and I was soorry

595
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,440
not the nailed the screens and I was

596
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,079
like I wonder what that CBD um strains

597
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,159
are like cuz it's not a guarantee that

598
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:55,278
it's going to be heavy on the sticky

599
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,799
right but with you being you know

600
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,000
familiar with great Garder stuff

601
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,480
everything he does is going to be the

602
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,679
sticky version of The Strain when it

603
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,000
comes to the turp so sure is that uh one

604
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,519
of those ones that needs that Winter's

605
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,599
day or is it a reasonable um I never

606
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,679
really played around with this sift too

607
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,959
much but it was it was fairly reasonable

608
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,519
from what I from what I got to

609
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,798
play here we go John's in the background

610
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,158
coffin

611
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:30,319
awesome deep dish Banger rips I like

612
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,320
them I got to say

613
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,599
yeah that's a slow one eh when you have

614
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:42,278
a lower melt quality on your on your

615
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,398
sift or on your bubble hash for that

616
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:45,599
matter there's just a period of time

617
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:48,239
where you're kind of waiting for the

618
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,199
oils to heat up within and sort of press

619
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,720
out which brings me up to you know um

620
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,200
you see you hear these kids on Instagram

621
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,159
we're taking Buds and squishing them

622
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,480
between parchment paper now Rose and

623
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,399
Tech yeah well it's I guess it's a sort

624
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,000
of a rosin Tech really this this guy

625
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:04,439
called squishy buds I think was one of

626
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,278
the first people to do it and yeah he's

627
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,399
basically melting the resin off of off

628
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:10,200
of buds that that are then coming to the

629
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,678
surface and sticking to the parchment

630
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,960
and it's funny cuz they're getting dabs

631
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,960
off parchment just from squishing buds

632
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,720
well the bud if I saw it and I was like

633
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,558
well if we can do that in the grow room

634
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,880
if we could get wipes could in and just

635
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,480
keep that

636
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,559
up just if like if it takes three plants

637
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,159
to get a guy a personal everyday dab and

638
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,240
he just keeps wiping down the strain for

639
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,799
like 6 years I'm that's a double thumbs

640
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,480
up the D the dab plant but if it's like

641
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:40,679
I just got some fresh Buds and we're

642
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,519
just going to kill them and crush them

643
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,720
then I'm not but my thumbs are so up for

644
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:49,879
the Perpetual half gr Harvest per day

645
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,600
that would that would be a tech worth

646
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,360
worth saving worth wild yeah the

647
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:58,240
parchment way well I I talked to Matt

648
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:02,278
and I know that he knows uh compassion

649
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,278
the guy who uh originally did the

650
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,359
tech blow that all over our table and

651
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,240
onto our hash so I thought I would

652
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,319
invite him into hash church so I'm going

653
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,278
to get his email here in the next day or

654
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:15,720
two and I'll invite him into hash church

655
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,319
as well as squishy buds from Instagram

656
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,319
and we'll have a neat little discussion

657
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,798
on uh you know when he first started the

658
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,678
process which I remember it was

659
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:26,480
legitimately to milk non- melty resin

660
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,440
glands that were thicker wax membranes

661
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,200
uh and just melt those oils out of them

662
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,000
using this double boiler technique with

663
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,840
boiling water in a in a glass

664
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,839
bowl the thing is that's those texts

665
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,359
that really help extend your product

666
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,079
when it comes that's kind of why when I

667
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:47,038
first heard I'm like what they're doing

668
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:49,240
what to Bud good good bud crushing wet

669
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,359
but now you throw out the Perpetual

670
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:56,200
Harvest and it's back into the Forefront

671
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:58,639
as a great idea oh there it is thank you

672
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,960
thank you what do you want to get in on

673
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,679
all right what I want to get in on is

674
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,880
giving you guys a rip you're next I know

675
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,559
there's all these rip trades where

676
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,278
everyone's trying to get the next man

677
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,960
high on what they got what's going on

678
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,798
yeah but you know what mine mine is cool

679
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,480
because I often give people other

680
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:16,359
people's hash I'm not so hung up on

681
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,919
getting everyone to try my own cuz I

682
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:22,359
know it's pretty killer but this is d420

683
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,480
K's orangey diesel just a it'll be the

684
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,558
best flavor of hash that we could smoke

685
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,839
during this session I thought we might

686
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:33,359
as well throw might as well throw it

687
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,398
in there we

688
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,398
go it's pretty nice the way that uh

689
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:42,319
heats up the the quartz and just gets

690
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:45,678
that whole dish nice and really

691
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:48,558
hot of a interesting Vapor style rip to

692
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,278
it than uh you can basically throw like

693
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,839
two gram of hash in there and just let

694
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,599
it smold bubble away like crazy and have

695
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,398
like 10 people just keep hitting it I

696
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,719
mean that's better than where I was

697
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:02,158
saying be best in the how many dabs you

698
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,440
can do you can throw two gs of melty

699
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,559
hash in there a gr probably and you can

700
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,000
just line people up yeah like you might

701
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,759
even eventually suck clear domes right

702
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,839
into the neck see that's that would be

703
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,038
the most up and that rip that's like

704
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,000
going so good and all of a sudden you

705
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,000
feel that moment where it

706
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,119
clogs well this is the first of many

707
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,038
sessions I'm sure that we'll be doing on

708
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,319
Johnny's

709
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,480
denail so we're just going to keep at it

710
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,720
here guys and uh we'll catch up with you

711
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,919
guys in a bit back to

712
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,839
back hey welcome back guys we are now

713
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:44,278
back at my house in my office and uh

714
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:47,678
while we were at Fresh headies well we

715
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:49,679
came across something didn't we yeah we

716
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,038
came across this Beast that you see

717
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:57,440
before us here this is the ham gravity

718
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:59,798
bong from I'd say 2002 2003 2004

719
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,000
somewhere around that time ham came up

720
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,359
with this design came to the Cannabis

721
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,200
Cup and it was actually the first

722
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:10,079
Cannabis Cup that anyone knocked out

723
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,200
almost as many people as we did he was

724
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,398
knocking people out left right and

725
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,558
Center there's actually a guy that

726
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,079
passed out at Ham's table I'll never

727
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,798
forget it he hit it and then he passed

728
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,038
out kind of on Ham's table but then

729
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,519
rolled over to the guy next to Ham's

730
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:23,480
table and that guy just had a ton of

731
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,519
Glass on his table and the dude passed

732
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,079
out and rolled over his glass probably

733
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,558
broke like three or four pieces in an

734
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:33,240
instance it was

735
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:35,960
this thing is no [ __ ] joke now I was

736
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,319
trying desperately to set it up I'm

737
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,720
going me just see there might be one

738
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,759
piece one last chance this is my last

739
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:48,600
chance right here if we can find this

740
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:51,119
little piece that I may or may not have

741
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:55,319
and this is um an adapter that I'm

742
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:58,359
looking for right now uh this adapter it

743
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:01,119
turns I think it goes

744
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,638
for an 18 to a 14 but I'm not going to

745
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,678
end up finding it guaranteed it's I mean

746
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:08,479
I'm a pig I don't know my office is

747
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,759
terrible in my every drawer every drawer

748
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:17,360
is just full of hash and glass and then

749
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:21,079
more hash and apparently that piece is

750
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:23,278
gone I remember having it for a long

751
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,278
time unless it got put into this

752
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,519
top

753
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,440
top this one has a lot of different

754
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,599
things there are all sorts of good

755
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,000
things in here I think one day I can do

756
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,918
a video on what's in your drawer all

757
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,679
right so what this is actually this is a

758
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:43,519
this is a 14 to 18 so it's the opposite

759
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,200
of what we need if this was 18 and this

760
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,399
was 14 we'd be in business we're going

761
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,038
to get one of these for next time

762
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,398
because we want to be the first to set

763
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,960
up the electric nail and the gravity

764
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:57,638
bomb however that's not going to stop us

765
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,360
from lighting up a piece of beine or

766
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:00,599
getting getting a maybe a torch lighter

767
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,398
do you have your torch lighter up here

768
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,519
Johnny Be I a torch you have a torch I

769
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:10,199
have a torch you have a torch all right

770
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:11,880
so got for some reason I I came up here

771
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,840
Bowl right here with nothing but I

772
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,840
brought my torch all right the only

773
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,918
thing I'm going to require is a

774
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,918
screen all right so yeah let's give this

775
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,159
thing a shot we got the screen here in

776
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,000
the top of the bowl this is a huge drop

777
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,440
down on this bowl not a drop down but

778
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,278
the uh you know the m

779
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,000
piece it's bigger than what you normally

780
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:34,000
see on a bowl that's for sure well most

781
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,079
of them are both that big yeah exactly

782
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,359
so you can see so you can see it's

783
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:43,240
double size monster that's your so let's

784
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,479
go for Uber tasty Uber Uber tasty Diesel

785
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,000
and big you know we're going to go for

786
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,798
much bigger of a rip than normally whoa

787
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,798
whoa who

788
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,798
really yeah

789
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:57,798
you maybe

790
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,439
okay

791
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:07,679
so yeah we got that in there loaded up

792
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,159
with some New York City Diesel from d420

793
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,440
K and I guess we're going to need a

794
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,960
little bit of beline which is always

795
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,440
close by we got the

796
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,000
torch I like the idea of having the

797
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,679
torch nearby you know what let's do the

798
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,319
torch just because um it'll ensure that

799
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,360
the full the full rip I'll take the

800
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,759
first RIP just to show you how it works

801
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:29,759
okay and to give you an idea

802
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,000
um monster rip I'm scared like what was

803
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,199
that five times what we normally hit

804
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,240
yeah in

805
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:01,440

806
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,120
I just said he just like took that like

807
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,960

ham gravity bong RI Gravity Bone rip

818
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,519
someone was like no I saw you do one

819
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:40,878
before anytime you're ready buddy you

820
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:42,719

821
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,440
it

822
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,158
perfect pretty good pretty

823
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,559
good you get pretty good eventually you

824
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,720
won't even have to put your lips on the

825
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:54,480
thing first time most people do it but

826
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:57,000
how's that I was scared to drop it like

827
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,119
how you did cuz I'm not used to it yeah

828
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,599
to be honest as do it often you start of

829
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,079
start getting this you kind of got it at

830
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,480
a bit of an angle and you can we've got

831
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,440
it really full of water for a super

832
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,880
awesome rip so I don't know I think I'm

833
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,079
going to take one

834
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,160
more I think I'm going to take one more

835
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,920
dude let's see what else we can try

836
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,559
maybe some CBD Renee from the great

837
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,639
Gardener

838
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:25,159
wow it's just like it's

839
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:28,039
a yeah remember you can't do that John

840
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,358
yeah that's why it's just stop so one

841
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:32,358
here's here's the thing about a gravity

842
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,000
bong it's not a good idea just to go up

843
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:37,119
and down with it cuz eventually what

844
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you'll do is you'll break it or with

845
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,320
this particular unit it can't go down

846
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,320
with the bowl on there's a tiny little

847
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,720
hole can you see it right through there

848
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,960
yep so that little hole allows for when

849
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,559
you push down for the release of the air

850
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,559
and for it to push the smoke up like

851
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,159
that but if the Bowl's on it that hole

852
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,318
is plugged and of course the only place

853
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,920
for the water to come is up through the

854
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:01,920
stem and out the top of the the bowl so

855
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,599
I've definitely seen it done would have

856
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,680
that P is now hitting me isn't that

857
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,280
