got even sicker and it just that was

164
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,699
like the plague

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,060
that was like five Mike's got you know

166
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,009
oh yeah it seemed like if there was ever

167
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,810
a conspiracy there there was like some

168
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,579
crazy virus that got dropped on

169
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,470
spannabis I suspect it was just some

170
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,959
random dude traveling from like India

171
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:25,550
Africa just brought the brought the

172
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:30,259
plague with them every time I go to the

173
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,450
yeah they found common hatch and then

174
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,819
those germs on the pipe that passed it

175
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,890
around yeah that's basically what

176
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,320
happens they just get it all get it all

177
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:40,908
viral and pass it over I got it I got to

178
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,339
avoid it it's also all the cigarettes

179
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:45,919
they still smoke mad cigarettes in Spain

180
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,810
and so that really just lowers my immune

181
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,329
system after about four or five days of

182
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:52,399
like every breath I take even outside

183
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,160
like you go outside in the fresh air

184
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,389
there's just some

185
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,948
banished you smoking like five

186
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,500
cigarettes he's just like right beside

187
00:08:55,948 --> 00:09:00,958
you people used to get sick at 90 times

188
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,480
and it was because of sharing pipes

189
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,018
because it was very little tobacco use

190
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,970
there actually it was just you know well

191
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,009
that and the other thing Amsterdam was

192
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,720
everybody was smoking weed that hasn't

193
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:18,209
been cured dry yeah that's true too you

194
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,730

197
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,059
Instagram resident of today that's like

just like to cut this let's just just

200
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,889
extract it while it's still growing on

201
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:34,230
the plant

202
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:36,028
we'll get all the most caustic terpenes

203
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,438
and then we'll take giant dabs of them

204
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:44,480

211
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,129
the middle finger and what was it like

212
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:19,588
did he how did he lose that [ __ ] did he

213
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:21,659
get brother yeah yeah Sam bought the

214
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:27,149
finger and uses the fingerprint to get

215
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:29,278
into his iPhone yeah yeah I'm sure he's

216
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,620
got it right the actual fingering so

217
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,730
that's one Jerry thing I never saw on

218
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,889
sale on tour

219
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,389
fun fact he had to relearn how to play

220
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:38,938
the guitar after that happened

221
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:42,000
fun fact he was able to play the guitar

222
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:44,099
quite [ __ ] awesomely after one day

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,688
that was before he played the guitar I

224
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,470
think it happened to him as a young

225
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:51,480
child so I think it was way before he

226
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,290
started playing anything but yeah I mean

227
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,240
it was not on his on this finger or on

228
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:59,969
this hand it was on this hand right his

229
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:05,899
pick not picking

230
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:11,040

232
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,169
he started playing stringed instruments

233
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,240
but damn I let less than a year later he

234
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:21,509
watched his father drown in a river

235
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,938
during a fishing accident I had no idea

236
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:26,550
about that yeah that's really heavy

237
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:31,049
Jerome damn that's like he was 5 years

the pool gave me artificial respiration

245
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:56,789
I'm still there I have a similar story

can remember I bet you want some of my

251
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,490
oldest memories I can remember going

256

it's full-blown insanity so what about

260
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:35,909
you dr. mark are you gonna head to

261
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,089
spannabis you never come to these things

262
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:41,370
do you you're more like a I'm not going

263
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,050
this year I got my hands tied up in so

264
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,299
many different projects right now I've

265
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:47,519
never been busier which is great Marcus

266
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:51,000
as you know I mean in this industry you

267
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,688
have to you know sort of go where the

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,438
where the work is and I'm fully

269
00:12:54,688 --> 00:13:01,318
committed on several different projects

270
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:05,009
both in the hemp and cannabis space and

271
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:08,849
Ben never been busier and but it's great

272
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:11,188
what it says you know just are different

273
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,569
and all the clients are different but

274
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,829
you know as you know like when you're

275
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:16,289
consulted the space

276
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:21,030
you're sort of you know the expert at

277
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:22,949
the table that's making you know people

278
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,039
feel good about you know buying

279
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,400
equipment or dedicating you know entire

280
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,230
production - you know methods that you

281
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,720
know we're recommending and so we have

282
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,269
to you know do the best job we possibly

283
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,759
can to make sure that we got our eye on

284
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:40,889
the target of where this thing is going

285
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,929
to be in the future you know and not

286
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,409
necessarily sort of like where it is now

287
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:48,209
so you know the great thing is like all

288
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:51,509
these projects like the one in Jamaica

289
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:55,410
is just like the unlimited potential

290
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:57,750
that exists you know like like we can

291
00:13:55,409 --> 00:14:00,089
see it like when you and I go there and

292
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,690
when other people you know go to these

293
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:05,519
places but um it's just unbelievable

294
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,170
because again you know that we can bring

295
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,079
there concentrate level and to make it

296
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:12,059
to a whole new level that it doesn't

297
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,910
exist today which which is really cool

298
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,619
because you know just given the whole

299
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:19,860
culture and attitude and everything that

300
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,389
goes on down there so just you know

301
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,960
these projects where there's unlimited

302
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:27,590
potential is just you know like just

303
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,019
great I mean it's why we do it right

304
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:38,759
more like what you said way up when you

305
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:41,009
say hemp CBD yeah yeah yeah just when

306
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,379
Americans say hemp when Americans say

307
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:46,080
hem they're talking about CBD when

308
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,210
Canadians say ham we're actually talking

309
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,100
about all the rest of the plant we're

310
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,200
not allowed it's just the way it's just

311
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,629
the way it is they all the hemp growing

312
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,580
in America is for CBD extraction and

313
00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:02,100
Mart right are you growing in Jamaica

314
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,740
we're growing there's projects I'm

315
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,810
working on all over I mean right now

316
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,210
Jamaica does offer a tremendous

317
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:12,599
opportunity to grow em we're not growing

318
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:15,000
up per se right now but I've been the

319
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,190
trip that I made down there that you

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,070
know I threw some pictures that we

321
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:23,440
posted on it was a potential project

322
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:27,430
with a group called sativa

323
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,580
and university is a West Indies and yeah

324
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:33,039
ultimately there is hemp production in

325
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,009
the scope of that project I'm absolutely

326
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,349
certain of it well one of the parts of

327
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,450
the temperate climate you know that they

328
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,960
have down there to be able to grow all

329
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:46,629
the time you know no but the problem

330
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,800
with hemp is all of the varieties are

331
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:53,470
registered low THC varieties worldwide

332
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:59,009
require northern climates but you're not

333
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:03,220
about or near the equator or near the

334
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:08,350
tropical there are no tropical have

335
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:16,420
slightly behind plants well cool well

336
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:19,180
let's make them time to get busy I tell

337
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:22,419
you I'm just gonna make the oil though

338
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:24,429
grow that the plants do it exactly the

339
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:26,019
beautiful thing about extracting and I

340
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:29,109
tell this to people all the time is that

341
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:32,319
we can pick and choose who can actually

342
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,570
grow good enough herb rather than try to

343
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,220
like everyone in Canada is all about

344
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,600
this like I'm gonna build my grow and

345
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,250
then I'm gonna build my facility and

346
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,370
then I'm gonna just process what I grow

347
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,110
in my facility and it's uh

348
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,629
you know it seems limiting to me

349
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,279
compared to I will just Pro like even

350
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:49,779
even Jamaica for instance I had my

351
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,419
project going on and Jamaica they're

352
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,129
sort of I wouldn't say it's falling

353
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:56,219
apart but I don't talk to my business

354
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,529
partners at all anymore like period and

355
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,889
so I kind of feel like you know I could

356
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:04,809
just process if I want so I've been also

357
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,400
a few companies have reached out to me

358
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,619
and I've just sort of like okay well

359
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,360
well suss this out it's easy you don't

360
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,448
have to start a whole company you can

361
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:15,429
literally just go there and just do what

362
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,490
needs to get done because the bottom

363
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,439
line is they don't have people who know

364
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,880
how to do that well especially working

365
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,100
with the university because the

366
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,520
university is just chock-full of people

367
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:29,469
who have minds that are absorbing you

368
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,230
know higher levels of you know academic

369
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,329
information it's a quality University

370
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,950
like when you go to

371
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:36,960
it's one of that you can't even believe

372
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,200
you're in Kingston I mean Yui is on

373
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,129
point I mean they have who proton NMR is

374
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,899
in that building yeah I I saw yeah isn't

375
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:50,668
that crazy though they just got two of

376
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:53,339
them opportunity to not only you know

377
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:56,190
produce but also to train people for the

378
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:59,368
industry is just it's really cool the

379
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:02,580
folks who down there who are working in

380
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:04,439
it everyone's got a smile you know in

381
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:08,730
the grow everyone's happy to be there

382
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,889
yeah they're happy to be employed yep

383
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,389
100% and with herb

384
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:15,678
I mean how [ __ ] beautiful is that

385
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:18,238
there is one way to grow hemp in Jamaica

386
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,259
outdoors I'm talking about which is what

387
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,460
you're talking about

388
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:26,519
and that is you put lights above the

389
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:29,038
property then like you say you can just

390
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:34,169
turn off the lights and flowers no right

391
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:35,878
under what time here it is well yeah and

392
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:38,100
Marcus I'll say that like one thing

393
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:43,259
that's going on here in Pennsylvania is

394
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:45,839
they they uncapped or yeah I'm capped

395
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:48,749
the acreage limit was at a hundred acres

396
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:54,118
and now you can grow as much time do you

397
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:55,769
have land for so in Pennsylvania there's

398
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:57,238
been a number of different companies

399
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,730
that have announced putting in

400
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:02,819
facilities one is using that so-called

401
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:06,778
hemp train which is just a big you know

402
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:08,759
you know auger type of you know excluder

403
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:11,489
that just you put the plant material

404
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,378
into a conveyor belt that just feeds it

405
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:17,879
into the system and it separates out the

406
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:20,608
fiber from the from the herd from the

407
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:24,658
what they call green microfiber which is

408
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:26,339
what you extract for CVE and if you

409
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,528
check it out it's called hemp train the

410
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:31,079
hemp train it's like you know 1.5

411
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:32,909
million dollars worth of investment but

412
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,278
if you put this on the front end of an

413
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:37,200
extraction plant certainly you could do

414
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:40,470
just something like ethanol extraction

415
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,409
there is a you know value proposition

416
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,799
that's pretty compelling for building

417
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:50,040
processing plants for places that

418
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,889
again are just gonna be farming you know

419
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:58,309
that point three percent or less

420
00:19:52,890 --> 00:20:00,840
THC you know a variety of have no doubt

421
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:02,759
in terms of Pennsylvania that's a great

422
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:07,289
actually a great climate for growing

423
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:09,000
outdoors depending on turns your how the

424
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,099
hurricane season really shapes out down

425
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,869
in down in Africa how those storms come

426
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,699
off of there really determine your your

427
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:17,399
just what your September looks like but

428
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,880
you can absolutely dial it in in in that

429
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,710
in that climate there it's beautiful

430
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,110
sure is and at that scale it certainly

431
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,390
does make sense to you know separate out

432
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:30,240
the various components of what you can

433
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:33,090
get in terms of value if you can you

434
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,000
know recover you know value by

435
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:37,529
extracting the fiber and you know I

436
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,569
don't know what varieties they're

437
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:42,480
talking about Sam most of them were just

438
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:46,980
pretty you know I don't know I mean I

439
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:49,500
guess I need to learn more about so that

440
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,809
the varieties that that I'm seeing in

441
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,369
the state Sam are predominantly coming

442
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:58,649
from Oregon a lot of desert those are

443
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:03,959
not hemp right there hit up growth

444
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:05,730
hydrants absolutely but they are they

445
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,600
you can't grow them the most compete

446
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:13,019
because they are not registered low THC

447
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,669
varieties well some of them are Sam that

448
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,859
a lot of people I'm talking to you are

449
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:21,600
absolutely getting certified seed I'm

450
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:25,219
not quite sure the intricacies okay

451
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:28,379
super international registration is and

452
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,240
you can register should or Canadian

453
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,620
registration those are all different

454
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,910
than what you're talking about

455
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:38,189
certified seed so could you expand on

456
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,560
that Sam so you could explain everybody

457
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,660
with what the intricacies of those the

458
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,359
international laws are and how that kind

459
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,790
of plays a role and how it get how a new

460
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,519
cultivar gets on to the registry that's

461
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:54,720
a yeah I think that would be a great

462
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,940
conversation well I'm not sure I have

463
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,600
enough current because in a little bit

464
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:04,920
I've got to disappear and I'm going to

465
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:07,259
with my family I think it would take you

466
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,170
know maybe 15-20 minutes to explain it I

467
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,640
just don't write that much in Canada

468
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,980
it's fairly simple we have a seed

469
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,520
registry for the hemp cultivars yeah

470
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,410
they they grow them they require three

471
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,150
years of growth whether that's in

472
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,730
another country they want you to have

473
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,259
grown it and test it if you do you want

474
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,849
to sit do you want to say it's Amer do

475
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:29,849
you want me to because I think they just

476
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:31,259
want to be answered right cuz I'm down I

477
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,490
don't mind I just know that how that's

478
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:34,349
how it works in Canada you have to get

479
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,849
the seeds into the registry it takes

480
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:37,559
three years I actually talked to the guy

481
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:41,009
recently at the hemp conference in

482
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,929
Manitoba who was in charge of adding

483
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:44,730
seeds to the registry see when seeds are

484
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,980
in the registry and they've been tested

485
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,960
enough times they don't require testing

486
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,539
anymore so there's a bunch of cultivars

487
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,670
in Canada that they don't even test for

488
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,940
the THC levels because they absolutely

489
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:59,190
know that those THC levels like Zola

490
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,259
tanoshii are so much there they're below

491
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,970
the point three percent they're closer

492
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:05,250
to point zero three percent which is

493
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,660
literally ten times lower than the than

494
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,009
the amount that makes it hemp in the

495
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,080
first place but that's how it works for

496
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:11,609
Canada so that's why we're in a bit of a

497
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,799
quandary we don't have these high CBD

498
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:15,269
cultivars so we need to get ourselves

499
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,190
into a situation where we get these

500
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,109
cultivars into the registry and

501
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,660
everyone's kind of you know there's not

502
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:23,759
really a clear and precise concise way

503
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,920
of getting that done it just seems a

504
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,450
little bit convoluted but I'm sure a

505
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:33,120
couple of years will go by and we'll

506
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:35,670
have all of those cultivars Marcus five

507
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,829
years ago there was no new registered

508
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:41,100
varieties in Canada there was only

509
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:43,529
imported ones from Europe yeah Canadian

510
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:46,469
ones awesome yeah yeah exactly

511
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:48,750
so welcome my quest I like the way you

512
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,759
looked when you came in you had the hat

513
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,759
on and the glasses and it looked like

514
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:56,460
you were like just ready to go take eat

515
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,990
some psychedelics and enjoy the day put

516
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,769
a smile on my face really I'm not gonna

517
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,509
lie yeah and obviously the the state of

518
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:06,599
Colorado state of Oregon are working on

519
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:09,509
their seeds certification programs those

520
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,250
programs are designed for their States

521
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:13,799
there's a couple of groups in Colorado

522
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,278
and through two or three that I know of

523
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,048
an or

524
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:22,138
that are working on that certification

525
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:25,829
process but ultimately like like Scott

526
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:29,668
man said he's obviously in Colorado

527
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:32,569
they've had industrial Henson 2014 that

528
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:35,788
gives them four years they've been

529
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:37,348
developing cultivars testing them but

530
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:38,759
what we've seen some of the cultivars

531
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:41,249
that were developed in Colorado and

532
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:44,969
Oregon when you bring them to two places

533
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:47,690
with more blue light spectrum there's an

534
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:50,909
upregulation in the THC synthase and

535
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,759
down-regulation in the CBD 8da synthase

536
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,889
so we've actually seen some results

537
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,319
where cultivars that are certified

538
00:24:55,888 --> 00:25:01,498
certified in Oregon's safety grow in

539
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,148
Oregon or Colorado being brought to more

540
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:05,940
equatorial climates and they end up

541
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:08,338
testing hot so what you'll likely end up

542
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,649
seeing is in the u.s. at least you know

543
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:12,538
States certifying seeds those certified

544
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:15,949
seeds being state specific and tell

545
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:19,200
federal law changes and then on a as

546
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,999
federal law changed allowing US

547
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,069
companies to certify those cultivars

548
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,629
internationally then you'll actually a

549
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,648
lot be allowed to start seeing that

550
00:25:24,628 --> 00:25:30,718
exportation of seed cultivars

551
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:34,108
unfortunately federal law being what it

552
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:36,330
is we have to operate state-by-state so

553
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:39,588
many times we have to do research in

554
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:41,878
states that allow that research and

555
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:43,769
avoiding research in other states so

556
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:46,468
good example Washington state doesn't

557
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:49,229
allow any CBD extraction but they do

558
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:50,909
allow industrial hemp research so we did

559
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:52,889
some research at Washington State

560
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:55,739
University looking at industrial hemp

561
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:58,428
fiber processing into biomaterials

562
00:25:55,739 --> 00:26:00,899
whereas the University of Colorado

563
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:04,379
Colorado State University Oregon State

564
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:06,508
University are all researching CBD and

565
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:09,449
cannabis and offering actually

566
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:10,979
researching courses in cannabis so

567
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,598
you'll end up seeing that kind of

568
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:16,139
develop unfortunately that's going to

569
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:18,210
hinder Canada's CBD production for the

570
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:19,888
next couple years until we have CBD

571
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,288
cultivars certified in the in the

572
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:24,538
country of Canada but there's actually a

573
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:26,669
really long history of industrial hemp

574
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:28,500
you know my family when they migrated

575
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:31,230
from

576
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,798
the Catholic persecution of the Moors in

577
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:36,509
the sixteen 1500s to North America they

578
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,359
settled in New Haven Connecticut and

579
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:41,849
they were hemp farmers they the Spanish

580
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:45,569
the French the English all brought hemp

581
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:48,298
to the colonies but that was before a

582
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:50,490
lot of the THC testing so what we know

583
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:53,519
of as some of the Central American

584
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:56,640
cultivars are actually imported hemp

585
00:26:53,519 --> 00:27:01,019
cultivars from Europe that have become

586
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,630
feral or essentially landraces and then

587
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,970
through the domestic propagation have

588
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:10,200
become what we know of as the the

589
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:13,259
Colombians the mohawk ins the Panama

590
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,909
Reds those are all Spanish strains that

591
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:22,379
were brought to the new world by the

592
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:24,690
conquistadors so I think now it shows

593
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:29,130
that they're more likely from India or

594
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:33,690
Asia you know absolutely third they're

595
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:35,340
Indian Asian cannabis varieties that you

596
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:39,330
know were brought through the Silk Road

597
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:41,399
to southern Europe and then during the

598
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:45,558
colonial periods were brought from

599
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:48,030
southern Europe to the new world now

600
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:51,839
obviously there's been trade throughout

601
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:53,908
the Mediterranean for beyond 10,000

602
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,980
years but a lot of that trade you know

603
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:58,610
we did wouldn't have had transoceanic

604
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,409
trade without industrial hemp because

605
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:02,849
papyrus breaks down in salt water hemp

606
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:05,490
is one of the few that they can use for

607
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:08,730
their rigging the sails that wouldn't

608
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,009
degrade in salt water so it ended up

609
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,529
being quintessentially necessary for

610
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:15,359
transoceanic trade to have hemp

611
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:18,329
cultivars wherever they were building

612
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,889
their ships man who got to figure that

613
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,689
out the first time when their ship

614
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:25,860
disintegrated in the middle of the ocean

615
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:28,740
hey I don't think we can use this stuff

616
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:31,558
anymore guys the way it worked Marcus

617
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,960
first ships used to go along the coast

618
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:36,178
for hundreds of years finally they got

619
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,558
brave enough to cross the oceans sure of

620
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,230
course

621
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,519
Braden it was probably those bloody

622
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:46,829
there's the Egyptians on the nine

623
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:48,389
I was across the ocean yeah so the

624
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:51,629
Egyptians would be we're able to use

625
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:54,390
papyrus Reed boats bundling reeds into a

626
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,650
giant bundles that were more buoyant

627
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,380
than water so they would actually be

628
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,960
able to travel up and down the Nile but

629
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,309
once they would hit Alexandria and you

630
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,069
know obviously the Mediterranean ocean

631
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:07,319
that papyrus would would only last for

632
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:10,710
about a month and a half so they were

633
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:12,149
able to actually I guess circumnavigate

634
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,720
along the coast but they weren't

635
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:19,290
actually able to do any transoceanic

636
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:22,620
crossings so the there is some in

637
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:24,569
reading the Rob Clarke's

638
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,239
Annabeth's evolution ethnobotany book

639
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:29,639
there is some suggestion that new hemp

640
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,589
was as as the Egyptians brought per

641
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,040
pyres to the coast and then started

642
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:36,480
traversing around the edge of the

643
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,149
Mediterranean to places we now know of

644
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,630
as Israel Palestine Lebanon Turkey

645
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:45,210
that's when they started identifying

646
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:47,940
seeing the use of hemp and wooden boats

647
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,590
more so than the papyrus boats so is

648
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,200
this John the part --lens work is this

649
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:53,939
what we saw John do in Leiden a couple

650
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,549
of months back or if Jesus been a year

651
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,650
now actually is that is this kind of

652
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:00,990
what John was talking about Sam in

653
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:04,500
regards to what wasn't it all based on

654
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:06,660
Pollan where he was finding how cannabis

655
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,960
had traveled and where it was located in

656
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,080
its most ancient forms I guess sounds

657
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,630
yes yeah so using pollen samples you

658
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,189
know there's a if you actually go when

659
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,200
you guys are in Spain when you guys are

660
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,820
in France you can actually get in the

661
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,210
late summer that you can get pollen

662
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:27,089
reports for the cannabis or the hemp

663
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:30,299
pollen that's flowing over the Straits

664
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:32,909
of Gibraltar from Morocco so obviously

665
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:36,389
you know the wind same wind that brings

666
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:39,390
sand from the Sahara to the Amazon basin

667
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,270
brings hemp pollen from North Africa

668
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,830
into Europe so one of the things that

669
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:46,289
they were able to do is look at the

670
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:49,199
sedimentary layers of different parts of

671
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:51,149
Europe and you know hemp pollens unique

672
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,950
you can actually look at its structure

673
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:57,830
compared to other other wind pollinated

674
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:01,590
annuals and you can actually identify

675
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:04,099
where different parts in the strata

676
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:06,720
different parts in the historical record

677
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:09,269
have fallen pops up and that's gonna

678
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,900
tell you approximately within you know

679
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:14,549
five hundred miles you hey that at this

680
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,500
strata we start to see hemp pollen

681
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:19,919
appearing in these areas therefore

682
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,259
within 500 miles and X amount of time of

683
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,870
where we find these pollen we can assume

684
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:27,029
that industrial hemp was being pulled to

685
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:28,739
be or you know in that case it was all

686
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:34,230
cannabis back then because it's all

687
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:36,269
prior to the testing at THC because we

688
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:40,140
have to we have to understand that you

689
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:42,059
know prior to the singles treaty and you

690
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,190
know essentially creating that

691
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:47,579
definition of em for being below 0.3

692
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:50,039
percent THC you when Rafael Missoula

693
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:51,779
originally elucidated the chemical

694
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,700
structure of THC they didn't have lab

695
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:56,849
tests to be able to show they didn't

696
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:00,600
have proton NMR to show the structure so

697
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:02,339
they elucidated the form oh yeah they

698
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,149
had proton NMR that's how he figured it

699
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:07,459
out just had it was just right at the

700
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,890
beginning of the use of it

701
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,720
60 megahertz proton NMR and that's how

702
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,750
he you know did the structure

703
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,480
elucidation so we're meeting reports the

704
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,670
NMR data so it was NMR that you know he

705
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,670
used to basically fully do that and

706
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:26,880
prior to the 70s they they didn't have

707
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,769
60s yeah sixties yeah so the early

708
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,450
sixties they didn't they didn't have it

709
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:33,619
yeah until then it was just

710
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:41,940
yeah the structures that Adams said and

711
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:44,039
Todd and others had had proposed which

712
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,279
were close but not quite

713
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,019
yes definitely go ahead Mike so prior to

714
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,329
all that analytical testing being able

715
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,190
to identify the active compounds in

716
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:55,079
cannabinoids there there was no

717
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,920
difference in industrial Hampton and

718
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:00,449
cannabis yeah we when Linnaeus described

719
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,029
it he described it based on its

720
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:05,580
characteristics but not on its chemical

721
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:07,230
profiles so it's the whole

722
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:09,408
differentiation between industrial hemp

723
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,528
and cannabis is really only

724
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:15,569
evolved over the last 50 to 100 years

725
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:18,479
prior to that what we know of as the

726
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:21,048
Central American cannabis varieties were

727
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:26,159
essentially industrial hemp varietals

728
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:32,009
fiber for idols prior to 50 hundred

729
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:35,309
years ago well I'll tell you it was it

730
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:38,009
great it was a great presentation by

731
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:40,489
John McFarlane in Leiden Holland at the

732
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:43,709
International cannabis Research Society

733
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:45,209
when he did that it usually it starts

734
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:47,189
the first day I guess is a little bit

735
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:50,038
more plant-based in cannabis base before

736
00:33:47,189 --> 00:33:51,629
it gets just it goes so deep into

737
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,398
science all of a sudden we're you know

738
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:55,428
torturing animals to figure out how the

739
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,868
mechanisms in their brains work and that

740
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,548
both Ian and I from Saginaw right we

741
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:01,288
just we just we were just like you know

742
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:03,418
what let's go rent bikes and drive

743
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:04,979
around Amsterdam like this is I could

744
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:07,919
listen to the plant part but now they're

745
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:09,389
torturing rats and monkeys and all sorts

746
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,369
of things to figure out these mechanisms

747
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,990
and I'm sure they're it has its place

748
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:15,690
but it's hard for my brain to wrap

749
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:17,788
itself around one one problem I had with

750
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,730
it in particular was when the guy was

751
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:23,429
like when they give a rat or a mouse

752
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,909
like a normal amount of cannabis like

753
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:28,918
for their size of body they can never

754
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,108
tell that it's high basically because

755
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,328
it's just like a person you don't you

756
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:36,568
can't really tell it's not alcohol we

757
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:38,339
don't get all [ __ ] up and so what they

758
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:41,250
do for these experiments is they give

759
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:43,949
them so much it's like the equivalent of

760
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,259
you smoking like six pounds in a in a

761
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,028
sitting so they basically start to

762
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:49,349
finally look like you know they've got

763
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:52,289
brain damage or something and that's

764
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:54,990
when they decide okay now it's high we

765
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:57,149
can do the experiment it's like that's

766
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:02,848
really good because they're really

767
00:34:57,148 --> 00:35:05,429
testing people like you and me oh man

768
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:07,230
I'll tell you what about you Sam were

769
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:12,088
you digging those but that part are you

770
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:14,869
into the deep science I are much much

771
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:17,639
more but what I do is I ask Johnny

772
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:19,798
Parkland you know what's the good stuff

773
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:22,210
and I go around they looked at all of

774
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:24,849
the posters

775
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,679
posters I checked those out but it

776
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:31,269
doesn't sound like I'm going to be

777
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:35,588
interested and the speeches I I do not

778
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:38,769
listen to him anymore something that

779
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:41,858
really stood out to me and what Mike was

780
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:49,440
talking about was pollen drift the

781
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:49,440
observation that in North Africa

782
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:54,519
cannabis growing there and I assume

783
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:57,848
among other places you're talking about

784
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:00,820
like Gotama for example in Morocco where

785
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:03,700
big fields of cannabis are happening and

786
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,940
have been for a while that pollen

787
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:08,739
manages to get down out of the mountains

788
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:11,829
across the coastal plain across the

789
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:16,389
Strait of Gibraltar and to hemp fields

790
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:19,900
in southern Europe and pollen drift is a

791
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:22,539
real issue in California with because

792
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:26,200
California now has a hemp bill and a

793
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:27,519
cannabis regulated marketplace and one

794
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:29,588
of the real issues in local

795
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,500
jurisdictions is about the difference

796
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:34,088
between hemp and cannabis and all the

797
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,980
rules of involved with it and the

798
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:38,139
cannabis people are rightfully saying

799
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:42,070
hey pollen drift is a real issue for us

800
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:44,858
seeded cannabis doesn't wait well one

801
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,800
difference is yes Paulette makes it

802
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:50,858
across nobody has ever shown it's viable

803
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:54,700
nobody has ever proven that you know

804
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:58,389
pollen that can still germinate crosses

805
00:36:54,699 --> 00:37:00,039
the Baltics right there yeah and when

806
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:03,969
they look at when you look at I know in

807
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:06,070
Canada in talking to and reaffirming up

808
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:08,559
there they in Canada certified seed

809
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:11,109
program put a four mile buffer so in

810
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:14,019
order to be a producer with of certified

811
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:17,079
seed in Canada what's called pedigreed

812
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:20,019
seed you actually have to have your seed

813
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,088
production with greater than four miles

814
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:25,570
from any other potential pollen

815
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:27,519
contamination so they in Canada they put

816
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,109
a four mile buffer Washington they also

817
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,539
put a four mile buffer you can't

818
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:36,559
cultivate industrial hemp within four

819
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:38,210
miles of any I 502 recreational farm the

820
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,219
research papers I was reading was

821
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:44,289
showing that UV light from sunlight

822
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:46,549
assuming that you have a standard sun

823
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:48,349
irradiation is going to sterilize the

824
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,200
pollen somewhere between half a mile and

825
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,940
two miles so by the time it gets about

826
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,949
traveling the pollen traveling about

827
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,289
four miles it's going to be sterilized

828
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:58,969
now there's still a huge issue I'm

829
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:01,338
seeing it a ton in the Willamette Valley

830
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:04,098
of organ and go heading down into

831
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:06,469
Southern Oregon so you know Oregon's

832
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,570
having some tough issues with the prices

833
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:10,399
of the recreational cannabis the

834
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:13,519
recreational cannabis farmers are

835
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,720
actually switching from THC cannabis to

836
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:19,309
CBD hemp and that's actually causing

837
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,500
cross-pollination issues where you know

838
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:25,099
they're growing industrial hemp in land

839
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:28,909
that's great cultivation land great soil

840
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:30,559
but they it's too close to the other TAC

841
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:33,739
producers so you are seeing some of that

842
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:37,039
cross-pollination that cross pollination

843
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:41,029
you when you have hundreds of acres of

844
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:44,119
CBD and that pollinates you know a acre

845
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:46,280
of THC you have potential litigation

846
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,140
that could happen between you know the

847
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,359
THC guys are pissed because they just

848
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:52,940
you know lost their entire outdoor

849
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:55,068
harvest of THC but the same could also

850
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:58,670
happen I've seen in Colorado actually

851
00:38:55,068 --> 00:39:00,980
some CBD cultivars test hot because they

852
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,710
were accidentally pollinated by THC and

853
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:07,159
then all of it we tested we tested how

854
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:09,699
far campus the both in hungry on

855
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:12,529
industrial hemp and drug varieties and

856
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:16,338
in strong linked conditions they can go

857
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:20,079
10 miles usually four miles would be

858
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:24,980
safe and it's still viral after then

859
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,630
yeah because sometimes when it's windy

860
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,909
it's also cloudy

861
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,559
yeah windy and dark that's that's kind

862
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:32,598
of my nightmare situation avoiding

863
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:36,969
places where it's windy and then because

864
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:39,710
if it's windy it also most yeah right

865
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:41,929
isn't it ironic that if you're growing

866
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,630
hemp you can a crop insurance for crop

867
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:49,358
failure but if you're but doing cannabis

868
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,358
you can't buy crop insurance yeah

869
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,090
yeah that'll change as federal law

870
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,100
changes its its son it's an unfortunate

871
00:39:55,090 --> 00:40:00,010
part of the industry but ultimately what

872
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:03,219
what I'm seeing in organs specifically

873
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:06,760
the if I'm gonna cultivate five hundred

874
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:09,189
or a thousand acres of CBD hemp and try

875
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,200
and sell it at a price that is

876
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,990
competitive in the price depending on

877
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,339
how how heavily extracted it has to get

878
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:19,569
to whether it has to be distillate or

879
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:22,180
isolate TC free nonetheless I want to

880
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,700
excuse myself but I've got to leave for

881
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:27,759
my dinner so bye-bye everybody

882
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:30,579
take care Sam have a great dinner bye

883
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,080
Sam yeah have a good dinner Sam thanks

884
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:33,909
for stopping in it's just a short one

885
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,699
today I got to go at 11:00 myself so we

886
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:40,599
got another hour in 20 minutes to shoot

887
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:42,519
the proverbial cannabis [ __ ] and then

888
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,309
we'll have to all go our separate ways

889
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:47,650
but I have a feeling it won't be very

890
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,719
hard to burn through another hour with

891
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,750
you guys here I'm burning right here

892
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,449
right now just keep going beautiful so

893
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,219
see Mike in the state of Massachusetts

894
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:59,919
what we're up against with happy valleys

895
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:02,500
we can't even if I wanted to plant 100

896
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,320
acres and extract that CBD at all and

897
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,800
put it on my shelves I have to have that

898
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,900
come from a drug cultivar per the rules

899
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,700
so it's it's you know it's kind of a

900
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,200
backwards way to look at it but I think

901
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:17,649
that they're trying to do is prevent

902
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:19,239
people from doing what you know the

903
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,820
large big boys are doing which are just

904
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:24,209
coming in the state setting up running

905
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:27,490
the CBD game as a monomolecular

906
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:33,220
extraction and then that you know that's

907
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:35,829
it so you know as an ingredient I'm to

908
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:38,319
say that again can you source CBD as an

909
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:40,329
ingredient I cannot I have to grow it

910
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,500
from the drug cultivars that I select

911
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:46,690
now I have plenty of them which is great

912
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,030
but you know as I investigate into into

913
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:51,820
doing this the way that I see it being

914
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:54,990
most beneficial it's just you hit a wall

915
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:58,900
you know you literally or there's no

916
00:41:54,989 --> 00:42:01,659
there's a gas station you can buy CBD

917
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,829
tankers and lollipops absolutely it's

918
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:05,019
totally weirdest third

919
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:07,029
dogmatic man it drives me crazy so I'm

920
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,250
like thinking to myself like wow really

921
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,870
guys but it's just the way it is you

922
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,429
know and I'm sure it'll change over time

923
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:15,309
you know all this is a great experiment

924
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:16,779
as I like to say and you know each we're

925
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:19,570
all trying to learn from each other but

926
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,610
no one's got it right well what one new

927
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:24,220
development I mean if you read the farm

928
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:26,860
bill it says nothing about this but the

929
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:29,559
guy who made the response the

930
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:33,070
irresponsible comments from the FDA Scot

931
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:35,889
Gottlieb he retired or all sudden step

932
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:39,789
down and you got to think that you know

933
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:42,190
trout is only to put a pro cvd person in

934
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:44,949
there at the top of the FDA to sort of

935
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:48,400
resolve this issue because yeah there's

936
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:50,559
a lot of you know things hanging into

937
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,260
balance because this is really it's an

938
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,659
interpretation of what's the law and not

939
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,180
necessarily what one bureaucrat who's

940
00:42:55,659 --> 00:43:00,369
here today gone tomorrow says right

941
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:02,379
Malang garage of cannabinoids is more

942
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,109
efficacious than individual isolates so

943
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,750
cannabis guys start doing that breeding

944
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:10,420
breed for one to ones breed for computer

945
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,489
ones seek out those rare cannabinoids

946
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,610
and you'll end up producing better

947
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:18,099
products because as much as I enjoyed

948
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:20,769
creating CBD isolates for medical

949
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:23,469
purposes it's you know the entourage

950
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:25,179
effect is real ya know natural selection

951
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:26,559
is really I mean that's part of what I'm

952
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:29,559
doing with Happy Valley is we have

953
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,769
15,000 square feet for just exploration

954
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,239
and R&amp;D of breeding and natural format

955
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:36,280
for natural selection now it's not a

956
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,429
huge amount of space but I can get a lot

957
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,750
of real work done in there and to have

958
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:46,349
that many rooms to be able to isolate is

959
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:48,760
you know really fortunate you know so

960
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:51,239
hopefully we get a lot of real work done

961
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,470
in the next few years coming you know I

962
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:56,199
want to welcome Peter

963
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:57,639
mr. soil balance has entered the room

964
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:59,559
what's going on dude it's been a while

965
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:00,819
Marcus yeah it's good to see you brother

966
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:02,320
really good to see you

967
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,450
it's good to see you too man you've been

968
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,950
hard at it working working in this

969
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:07,960
wonderful industry that we're all trying

970
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:11,319
to push forward yeah

971
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,300
yep it's been it's been the I'll tell

972
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,280
you the the hemp industry this [ __ ]

973
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,710
right now is so thick in the United

974
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,069
States out there with the

975
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:21,449
with them brokering and the [ __ ]

976
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:23,099
it's nice to come together with some

977
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:25,019
with some good heart of dudes and and

978
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:28,050
talk about the science for a little bit

979
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:29,130
so yeah good to see all you guys man

980
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,920
really good to see you

981
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,750
yeah man you too I'm glad I'm glad you

982
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,039
came and shared some time with us today

983
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,929
I haven't done many of these hash

984
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,179
searches lately it's a life got really

985
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:40,919
busy it's kind of like it's like we all

986
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:42,389
had so much time we're just doing all

987
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,680
these hashed churches and then suddenly

988
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:50,308
we all got really busy you know like I'm

989
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:52,348
really busy right yeah so I'm sure

990
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:55,200
you're in the same boat as the rest of

991
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:57,180
us but it's it's been great it's nice

992
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:00,058
and it's nice too it's like Mark said

993
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:01,889
you know when when the works there you

994
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:04,349
got a you got to pump it out and do it

995
00:45:01,889 --> 00:45:06,539
so that's what we're all doing

996
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,910
yeah that's time and the the the the

997
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,009
starting gun went off and it's time to

998
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:14,670
start working and you know so I've been

999
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:17,630
doing some soil consulting so getting

1000
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:21,269
these these United States hemp growers

1001
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:23,900
conducive on their soil physics their

1002
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:27,599
soil microbiology their soil chemistry

1003
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,789
you know really trying to circumvent

1004
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,230
those plans from going hot because

1005
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:33,779
that's that's one of the biggest

1006
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:38,579
problems that happened in in like North

1007
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:41,880
Carolina and different states in hemp

1008
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:44,789
production was that they they weren't

1009
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,410
addressing the biology of the soil and

1010
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:48,210
the plants were going hot they were

1011
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:50,818
getting stressed out there Delta 9 was

1012
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,619
getting stress induced and and they were

1013
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:54,869
having a low CBD output and this is a

1014
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:57,358
very unique plant because it doesn't

1015
00:45:54,869 --> 00:46:00,349
really show signs like you know like a

1016
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:04,949
like a tomato plant or a cucumber plant

1017
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:06,359
with its with its stress it's it's it's

1018
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:09,598
a weed you know it's a little bit

1019
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:12,630
stronger and it's got more vitality and

1020
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,920
so you don't see the same signs as you

1021
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,010
would with like plant parasitic

1022
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,079
nematodes or Pythium or Rhizoctonia

1023
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:23,510
Meuse area I'm a lot of the things that

1024
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:27,240
can really tax this plant and you know

1025
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:29,010
get you those those low CBD numbers on

1026
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:30,359
genetics that should have hit you know

1027
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,670
maybe 15

1028
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,530
percent just poor expressions Duds

1029
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,809
basically I saw the article white

1030
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,910
buffalo seeds on instagrams been posting

1031
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:41,099
some great soil stuff lately

1032
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:42,869
and he wrote he posted a cannabis now

1033
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:45,389
article that says dark heart nursery

1034
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:47,869
identifies major virus behind dug

1035
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:52,049
cannabis plants they've identified the

1036
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:54,599
HPL VD virus said to infect up to 30% of

1037
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:58,560
crops causes cannabis plants to grow

1038
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:01,019
poorly so there you go that's it there

1039
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,090
and a lot of guys that are like buying

1040
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:04,380
these high high in genetics spending a

1041
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,210
shitload of money I mean they're

1042
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,579
mortgaging their [ __ ] houses and

1043
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,920
they're buying this seed they put it in

1044
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:14,759
there and you know with this particular

1045
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,760
plant I would say the biology is is even

1046
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,230
more important than the fertilizer for

1047
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,060
this plant I mean again we're not

1048
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,000
growing tomatoes or cucumbers were

1049
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:26,429
growing [ __ ] oil and and the the

1050
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,989
producers that you guys all know in

1051
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:30,359
Canada in the United States they learned

1052
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:33,149
a long time ago that the living soil was

1053
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,680
like the key to get more frost right and

1054
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,539
so to be able to do that on an

1055
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,509
industrial scale with hemp for oil

1056
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:41,460
production is it's a new science that

1057
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:44,010
that everybody is embarking on and

1058
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:46,829
trying to learn yeah and they're not

1059
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:48,660
they're not really addressing the the

1060
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:50,880
macro micronutrients of the soil for

1061
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:52,469
this particular plants needs on that

1062
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,760
industrial scale they're more worried

1063
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,799
about the sea they're more worried about

1064
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,040
the drip tape about the [ __ ] laws you

1065
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,110
know they're not focused in on what's so

1066
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:04,079
important in actually cultivating this

1067
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:07,559
plant that we all know so the consulting

1068
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,529
business is going crazy the the the the

1069
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,469
the the new growers who would like to

1070
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:15,180
get into the industry are holding back

1071
00:48:13,469 --> 00:48:16,500
right now so there's a lot of big money

1072
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:18,539
that wants to come in but everybody's

1073
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,190
scared because nobody knows how to grow

1074
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:21,929
this plant they're not yeah they're not

1075
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:25,200
connected with the plant they don't know

1076
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:27,629
it yeah so yeah that's really all really

1077
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,609
great points and and for you to your

1078
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:32,070
point and in terms of the seed that

1079
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:35,220
everyone's buying is is unfortunately we

1080
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:38,910
don't know enough in terms of breeding

1081
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:40,859
practices specifically for cannabis to

1082
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:43,379
eradicate them and to identify those

1083
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:47,280
types of pathogens so when you

1084
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:49,019
have someone breeding with great lines

1085
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,750
that may have good expressions there

1086
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:53,309
could be some there could be pathogens

1087
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:55,380
in those seeds you know and those things

1088
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:57,269
get carried on in large numbers and

1089
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,849
people don't understand quite yet and

1090
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:02,190
neither do all of us quite yet how to

1091
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:05,480
get rid of that's that right now in in

1092
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,800
terms of what pathogens are there right

1093
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,599
so those that's really exciting in terms

1094
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,920
of what what the next ten years will

1095
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,339
really look like in terms of breeding

1096
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,780
and in seed and verification is another

1097
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,460
thing you know understanding what you

1098
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,900
actually have versus what you're told

1099
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,460
you have that's a big big deal you know

1100
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,860
yeah I've heard some nightmare stories

1101
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:30,000
that people buying huge amounts of these

1102
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:32,579
CBD cultivars in seed planting out acres

1103
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,099
of it and being like oh yeah

1104
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:38,190
I've seen it in Kentucky I mean she is

1105
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,329
it it's brutal so even like to your

1106
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,159
point you know we've these younger

1107
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:44,190
growers that just don't understand the

1108
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:46,769
plan itself and the species so they're

1109
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,960
trying to adapt other practices from

1110
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:50,670
other species to this species and it's

1111
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,619
just sometimes doesn't translate so you

1112
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:54,389
really have to spend time with it to

1113
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,210
truly understand the intricacies of it

1114
00:49:54,389 --> 00:49:59,309
so that's you know that's a very fair

1115
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:02,789
point you know what you're talking about

1116
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:04,650
before yeah so it's some topical

1117
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:07,460
discussion I know we're in the first

1118
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:09,900
week of March

1119
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,570
generally speaking it's a little bit too

1120
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,099
cold to start putting plants outside but

1121
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:17,400
there is a ton of things you can start

1122
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:20,069
to do working in your garden to start

1123
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,710
getting your soil beds composted adding

1124
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:24,630
adding cover crops and amendments what

1125
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:28,110
do you what do you guys bulls for this

1126
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:36,240
month to get the gardens ready for this

1127
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:38,400
summer next couple of months I mean you

1128
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:40,559
know the whole no-till thing really took

1129
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,260
a cue from from crop rotation and

1130
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:47,039
large-scale farming or at least organic

1131
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,870
farming so there's a lot to take from

1132
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,730
both sides of what's happening in Doran

1133
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:54,449
and and traditional farming and

1134
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,699
agriculture so it really depends on your

1135
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:58,519
end goal and what your

1136
00:50:55,699 --> 00:51:00,500
you're doing but no dancer room you know

1137
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,289
I think there's a there's a plethora of

1138
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,358
things you can do it just depends on

1139
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:07,338
what you're trying to do all right and

1140
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:09,980
so it's bowhead or a genius right

1141
00:51:07,338 --> 00:51:12,828
exactly absolutely what we're doing to

1142
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:15,858
kind of help these guys prepare is is

1143
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:18,589
we're doing a bioavailable nutrient

1144
00:51:15,858 --> 00:51:21,799
analysis of the soil so again before our

1145
00:51:18,588 --> 00:51:23,210
guys actually go in and move forward

1146
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,269
with some of these larger acreage

1147
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:28,849
production operations what we're really

1148
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:31,250
trying to do is is understand what that

1149
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:33,970
plant is going to be able to absorb with

1150
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:36,559
regards to the macro micronutrients

1151
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:39,019
before they even plant so that way we

1152
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,239
know if they're gonna have a good crop

1153
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:43,009
or they're gonna get you know in trouble

1154
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:44,899
throughout the year because you know if

1155
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,210
you're for instance you're you're way

1156
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,470
too alkaline or if you're cation

1157
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,539
exchange isn't good or if you don't have

1158
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:51,799
the appropriate cal to mag what's

1159
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:53,659
happening right now in the states is

1160
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,820
these these growers are going to the

1161
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:58,368
universities and looking at total plan

1162
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,838
moocher or total nutrients in the soil

1163
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:02,390
they're not looking what's actually

1164
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,639
plant available and so their mineral and

1165
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:07,400
federal fertilizer recommendations are

1166
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,199
way off you know putting in way too much

1167
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,960
maybe nitrogen or me it really too much

1168
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,429
phosphorus when that plant can have a

1169
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,838
problem especially with a lot of these

1170
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:17,469
guys trying to grow organic for the

1171
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:19,549
first time those sustainable cultivation

1172
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:22,519
methodologies are not really being

1173
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:24,200
addressed much less than biology and so

1174
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:26,239
what we do is we go in like I had a

1175
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:28,669
grower in Arizona that wanted to grow a

1176
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:32,659
thousand acres of hemp and we tested his

1177
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:35,599
soils and he was like at 8.9 pH you know

1178
00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:37,338
his his they and because of that they

1179
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,990
had put in sulfur into the soil to try

1180
00:52:37,338 --> 00:52:40,940
and regulate it you know but they did a

1181
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:43,129
bad job so now you had sold for toxicity

1182
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,960
he had magnesium toxicity this guy was

1183
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,910
gonna put two million dollar was two

1184
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,769
million dollars of his own money in to

1185
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:50,358
grow hemp you know he's trying to find

1186
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,500
the genetics and all this stuff and I

1187
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:54,409
told him I was like you're gonna have an

1188
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,659
uphill battle on this soil man you know

1189
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:58,190
and so I think for most growers out

1190
00:52:56,659 --> 00:52:59,719
there that are considering getting into

1191
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:04,750
hemp the first thing that you really

1192
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:08,929
need to do is is get that co2 extraction

1193
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:11,088
done of the soil nutrients you

1194
00:53:08,929 --> 00:53:13,039
looking at how much phosphorous how much

1195
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:14,420
potassium how much nitrogen your plants

1196
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,519
are actually going to be able to absorb

1197
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,800
versus how much is in there so there's a

1198
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:21,619
different type of extraction method that

1199
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,530
we do that that looks at bioavailable

1200
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:28,190
nutrients and then you know to further

1201
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:30,740
assist these guys they need to do leaf

1202
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:33,289
tissue and SAP analysis throughout the

1203
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:34,848
season to actually see you know again

1204
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:38,329
we're talking commercial or industrial

1205
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:41,030
scale yeah they should I would recommend

1206
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:42,890
orange photonics I know it's not perfect

1207
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,859
but in the field it's it's very helpful

1208
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:48,469
to give you a really great understanding

1209
00:53:45,858 --> 00:53:50,299
of where you're falling and just every

1210
00:53:48,469 --> 00:53:52,750
week just get in there and start taking

1211
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,250
samples I'd recommend that to every

1212
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,568
large scale hemp farmer out there it's

1213
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,280
really important to understand where

1214
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:59,838
you're falling along the season and then

1215
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,720
it gives you those data points to make

1216
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,400
better informative choices for your next

1217
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,159
season or even the cultivars that you're

1218
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,900
running right what those choices are

1219
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:11,269
that's the thing that not right people

1220
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,389
know like how much magnesium do I need

1221
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:16,280
in the vegetative state absolutely not

1222
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:18,048
to your point with the nitrogen and

1223
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,059
those are the types of things that that

1224
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:22,969
throw your heavy-metal testing off you

1225
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:25,640
know you that the metals go up into the

1226
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:27,558
heads and they stay there once it once

1227
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,879
they're there it's locked in it's locked

1228
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:32,660
and loaded they're never coming out

1229
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,789
unless you blast it out so it's you know

1230
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:37,429
it's it's something you have to take

1231
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:42,230
into consideration in terms of yeah you

1232
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:44,239
know and then go ahead sorry so then

1233
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,010
there's the whole you know layers to

1234
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,808
this so then you you want to take into

1235
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:51,020
account the energetics that this plan

1236
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:54,109
necessitates right like paramagnetism or

1237
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:56,119
you know bio dynamics or some of the

1238
00:54:54,108 --> 00:54:58,730
other layers that are so conducive but

1239
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:01,039
again going back to the life in that

1240
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:02,449
soil the biggest caveat that I'm seeing

1241
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,920
right now are the biggest hardship that

1242
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:07,730
a lot of these growers are gonna undergo

1243
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:11,318
unknowingly in Canada as well as the

1244
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:14,780
United States for high oil production

1245
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:17,329
all falls back into that that that

1246
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,819
biological system because there are

1247
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:22,880
microorganisms that are signaling that

1248
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:24,920
plant to increase the CBD synthase

1249
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:31,190
if they're not indigenous within that

1250
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:33,380
soil you know that's that's not giving

1251
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:34,789
that plant it's it's familiar microbial

1252
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:38,329
partners that it co-evolved with in

1253
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:41,000
nature right and so yes all of the

1254
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:42,619
terpenes many of the terpenes many of

1255
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,199
the precursors to the cannabinoids

1256
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:48,440
are actually bioessence synthesized in

1257
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:51,589
the soil microbiome wanna right the

1258
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,090
bacteria the endo ecto bacteria which

1259
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:56,420
are the bacteria lived inside outside as

1260
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:58,480
well as the fungi will actually mind the

1261
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:02,300
soil for minerals

1262
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,579
- soil for the nitrifying bacteria will

1263
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,500
actually fix nitrogen into nitrates and

1264
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:08,900
nitrates and actually bring it up to the

1265
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,789
Canberra plant and exchange it for sugar

1266
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,769
because most of those soil bacteria

1267
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:15,559
don't produce sugar they're not

1268
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:18,050
photosynthetic so what they they form a

1269
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:20,059
symbiotic relationship with the cannabis

1270
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:24,440
plant or the canvas provides the sugar

1271
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:26,420
in the in exchange the symbiotic micro

1272
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,429
flora in the soil will end up providing

1273
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,309
all the precursors but the Animas plant

1274
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:34,009
means so being able to set your soil up

1275
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:35,929
and really nice by a biodynamic soil

1276
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:38,540
before you even get your plants in the

1277
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:40,159
soil is a great way to start I love that

1278
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:42,199
you're talking about this because last

1279
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:44,480
week I just did a transplant and I

1280
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:47,029
transplanted all of my plants into this

1281
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,099
product soil conditioner by dr. Mary

1282
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:51,380
Jane so I actually just have it on my

1283
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:52,819
screen right here I'm just going to show

1284
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,440
you I'm using this stuff right here I

1285
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,940
was gonna ask you about it and you were

1286
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,800
just talking about this because I was

1287
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,079
just actually really considering what

1288
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,300
I'm doing in my soils and adding some

1289
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,840
extras to it and then I was looking at

1290
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:07,519
you soils cold little bags sitting there

1291
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,960
and I tried this mama - Mary Jane's for

1292
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:11,000
the first time so I'm just kind of know

1293
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,619
this is more like the home grower it's

1294
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,039
one little package into like a five

1295
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:18,799
gallon pot and I let it sit for 24 hours

1296
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:20,300
I did my transplant and I split my room

1297
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,650
in half again and I can already see a

1298
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,600
difference within a week of the plants

1299
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,010
that are immense these group product oil

1300
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,349
conditions I'm like damn she like the

1301
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:29,390
whole room like you could definitely see

1302
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:30,339
a different word wrong and I always

1303
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:31,960
recommend you

1304
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:34,150
gardening for a lot of indoor growers

1305
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,599
they're trying to amend I think their

1306
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:40,720
products are great they they have a lot

1307
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,880
of the micros is really nice it's good

1308
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:45,639
for transplanting and it's easy and

1309
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,410
fairly quick it's easy and this was the

1310
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:48,789
whole thing for me I've always gone back

1311
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:50,409
and tried getting into doing these

1312
00:57:48,789 --> 00:57:52,300
living soils and stuff but it's it's

1313
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:54,219
difficult you know thinking about doing

1314
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,560
that on an industrial scale job yeah I

1315
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:58,119
mean yeah you're talking about this it's

1316
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,529
a great conversation for people who

1317
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:00,519
really understand on the industrial on

1318
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,740
what you're talking about but then

1319
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,480
either on grower and getting into those

1320
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:06,039
soils because I've noticed my difference

1321
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,329
in my growth everybody sees it I have

1322
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:08,889
these different well coats and stuff

1323
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:10,929
like that and really taking a really

1324
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:12,699
good look at the soils and using these

1325
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:17,759
group harmonics and stuff like that is

1326
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:20,949
is key yeah yeah man that's a job guys

1327
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,390
thanks John yeah yeah it's I it's just

1328
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:24,099
been it's just been interesting you know

1329
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:25,929
all these all our brothers and our

1330
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:27,460
friends and our family like in the

1331
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:29,079
Humboldt County man growing like the

1332
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,639
best cannabis in the world or whatever

1333
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:32,349
the best cannabis is growing I mean

1334
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,599
Canada has got some of the best grass in

1335
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:36,130
the world but but most of those growers

1336
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:38,409
have gone to a place point where they

1337
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:40,660
understand that that it's that living

1338
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:43,599
soil that's gonna give you that frost

1339
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:44,980
right and why why is that and so to be

1340
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,440
able to replicate that on an industrial

1341
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:50,050
scale to get CBD levels to like 18

1342
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,429
percent so you know with the CBD sent a

1343
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,200
sends on it goes back to what you were

1344
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:54,879
talking about with regards to the

1345
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:58,449
nutrient absorption the foundation as

1346
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,250
well as the the enzymatic communication

1347
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:02,379
of those microbes with the plant to

1348
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:05,320
create more oil and we found a huge

1349
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:09,430
correlation with bricks so to further

1350
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:11,110
quantify your hypothesis on the the

1351
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:12,309
nutrient absorption leading to that that

1352
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:15,519
foundation that's right on the money

1353
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:18,009
dude because the more glucose you know

1354
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:20,920
or the bricks reading that we're finding

1355
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:24,040
is is is again it's it's right now we're

1356
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,639
we're seeing this connection we haven't

1357
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:29,920
proven it but but those bricks or - all

1358
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:32,109
glucose is the precursor to all oils

1359
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,329
exactly Matt so so what is your

1360
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:36,039
summation yeah we'll set thank you

1361
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:38,110
that's exactly what I wanted to disclose

1362
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,179
is that that Brix level when you go out

1363
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:41,829
and test that leaf and if your sugar

1364
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:43,299
content is higher in one versus the

1365
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,199
other you know you've got glucose which

1366
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,109
is gonna actually

1367
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:49,719
cellularly transformed into the CBD

1368
00:59:47,108 --> 00:59:53,739
synthase enzyme as well as of the full

1369
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:55,959
cannabinoid spectrum so that sugar in

1370
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:58,929
the plant that glucose is everything you

1371
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:03,960
know that's good [ __ ] right there

1372
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:03,960
pastor gems it turns into [ __ ] imagine

1373
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:15,298
I'm gonna put a shout-out to the science

1374
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:18,970
of regenerative cannabis soil farming

1375
01:00:15,298 --> 01:00:20,829
they had a conference up the PC mark and

1376
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:22,899
I were able to attend and I think

1377
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:23,890
they've been having a couple there's one

1378
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,680
more that they're gonna be

1379
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:29,558
live-streaming mark is that last one in

1380
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:32,919
Michigan I want to say you know I'm not

1381
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:37,630
sure why don't I just invite Joshua in

1382
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:39,490
and maybe he can cool greys there was

1383
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:41,710
one in Maine that just happened good

1384
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:44,078
work happening there yeah very good work

1385
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:46,119
it was great listen Mike and I were in

1386
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,829
Vancouver for the lift conference while

1387
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:50,019
simultaneously the regenerative

1388
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:52,119
conference was happening and we spoke at

1389
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:54,548
that on a panel along with my partner

1390
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:56,230
Daniel from Whistler technologies and it

1391
01:00:54,548 --> 01:00:58,059
was great it was like it was like our

1392
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:00,490
people in that room you know really

1393
01:00:58,059 --> 01:01:01,990
conscious really the work that Joshua

1394
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:04,868
was doing by putting all those people

1395
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:07,058
together is definitely really good got

1396
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:09,519
to meet Kevin jawed free and got to meet

1397
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:11,260
kaya from the infamous Caius coffee

1398
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,000
which I'm actually puffin on right now

1399
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:15,250
and just some really great folk some of

1400
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,068
my friends came up from Ontario it was

1401
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:23,230
definitely a very good very good

1402
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:25,150
conference and I met I met Tara Lee

1403
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:26,829
Tara Lee was there she's in the chat

1404
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:30,548
room right now she's one of our old G's

1405
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:32,019
in the hash Church chatroom and yeah I

1406
01:01:30,548 --> 01:01:34,568
don't know if Joshua was gonna get that

1407
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:37,630
in time but I hit him up with it

1408
01:01:34,568 --> 01:01:40,420
nonetheless like I tried to send him the

1409
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:41,920
email but it would not I don't I guess I

1410
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,960
don't know Joshua was emailed because

1411
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,460
when I sent out the the thing yesterday

1412
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,490
I meant to send it to him I think I even

1413
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:51,460
might have mentioned if some of that

1414
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:53,769
check if anybody is in and around I

1415
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:55,690
think it's in Michigan is this last one

1416
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:57,909
but they're if they're if you're near

1417
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:01,420
the Midwest last one is

1418
01:01:57,909 --> 01:02:04,690
coming up in the next week or two and if

1419
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:07,750
you if you're not in the Midwest they're

1420
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,789
gonna be live-streaming it so oh great

1421
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:12,429
they can actually record it and make it

1422
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:16,510
available to have buddy who's doesn't

1423
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:18,940
want to drive to the Midwest so check

1424
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:21,250
them out if many of the viewers want to

1425
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:23,349
I guess watch some awesome speakers

1426
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:25,838
learn about buildings building soil is

1427
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:27,519
more than anything I mean it's very much

1428
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:28,929
like a hash Church in that sense you'll

1429
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:31,869
just have some really great people

1430
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:33,848
dropping some serious knowledge and it

1431
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:35,858
goes on for hours and then you can talk

1432
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:37,960
with them afterwards so it's I would

1433
01:02:35,858 --> 01:02:39,608
definitely suggest if you're in and

1434
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,829
around the neighborhood I would drive

1435
01:02:39,608 --> 01:02:43,960
ours personally to go to go see that

1436
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:46,380
just I'm sure they'll have great people

1437
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:51,429
I think the Dragonfly earth medicine

1438
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:54,940
crew is back from Bali literally the

1439
01:02:51,429 --> 01:02:57,598
next day they fly to Michigan so they're

1440
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,599
gonna be there as well

1441
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:03,788
yes yes good stuff Peter I really

1442
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:05,559
enjoyed all of that that's that's key

1443
01:03:03,789 --> 01:03:06,910
information getting down this rabbit

1444
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:09,309
hole a little deeper and just

1445
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:10,960
understanding you know like what do we

1446
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:13,000
want to be feeding this plant and how

1447
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,470
did the variables change what we want to

1448
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,019
be feeding the plant like what are the

1449
01:03:14,469 --> 01:03:18,548
ratios and how do they change when

1450
01:03:17,019 --> 01:03:20,588
suddenly we're growing in a different

1451
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:22,150
altitude or we're growing in a different

1452
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,769
environment completely with all

1453
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:26,048
different variables and that's why this

1454
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:29,650
plant just seems to offer us an

1455
01:03:26,048 --> 01:03:32,079
endlessly complex rabbit hole to dive

1456
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:34,088
down into with all these other little

1457
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,490
mini rabbit holes that go off the side

1458
01:03:34,088 --> 01:03:38,949
it's it's why so many of us have so many

1459
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:40,838
different interests in this plant and

1460
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:42,909
still can sit around and talk for hours

1461
01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:44,558
whether you're you know focused on the

1462
01:03:42,909 --> 01:03:46,659
science of it or you focused on the

1463
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,730
biology or you're focused on the botany

1464
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:52,328
or you're focused on whatever it is it's

1465
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:52,929
it's pretty cool it's pretty cool it's

1466
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:56,140
off

1467
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:57,879
I'd say it's awesome yeah and there's we

1468
01:03:56,139 --> 01:04:00,338
got five hundred people watching from

1469
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,579
around the world right now chatting

1470
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:05,619
about and listening and I'm still

1471
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:08,619
talking Joe and I explain how it breaks

1472
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:11,568
breaks meter works yeah so it's it's

1473
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:13,338
like a $6 tool

1474
01:04:11,568 --> 01:04:15,199
you can get it really easy it's like a

1475
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:19,458
it's like a little metal thing about

1476
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:21,739
this big and it's got a refractometer so

1477
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:25,848
basically all you do is you grind up

1478
01:04:21,739 --> 01:04:28,099
like a leaf of a cannabis plant you have

1479
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:29,838
to get like you know like a really good

1480
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:31,969
grinder to get the juices out of the

1481
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:35,088
leaf the SAP and then you take that

1482
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:37,429
liquid and you just rub it on the the

1483
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:41,538
the refractometer and then you look

1484
01:04:37,429 --> 01:04:45,228
through a little scope in light and and

1485
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:46,819
then it shows you the number of of your

1486
01:04:45,228 --> 01:04:48,889
bricks reading and that that really

1487
01:04:46,818 --> 01:04:50,329
determines like the sugar level there's

1488
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:53,179
a very small portion of that that's

1489
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:55,729
actually the nutrients I think it's like

1490
01:04:53,179 --> 01:04:57,288
one or two percent of that bricks is

1491
01:04:55,728 --> 01:04:58,939
actually like your calcium your

1492
01:04:57,289 --> 01:05:00,229
magnesium your phosphorus all your

1493
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,199
different things that are in that plant

1494
01:05:00,228 --> 01:05:04,848
but the higher the bricks reading you

1495
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,759
know usually what we're seeing is the

1496
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:10,039
more CBD oil that our hemp producers are

1497
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:12,228
getting it's just like every time we

1498
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:14,869
test non-treated treated bricks it's

1499
01:05:12,228 --> 01:05:17,509
like the the the the more oil the higher

1500
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:21,410
the bricks reading and and and that

1501
01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:23,358
really goes back to your your soil macro

1502
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:25,278
of your soil balancing so again on an

1503
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:28,038
industrial scale to be able to come in

1504
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:30,679
and actually quantify heterogeneous

1505
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:32,569
soils and if they're conducive to the

1506
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:35,118
hemp plant or not really takes a lot of

1507
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:38,088
reverse engineering to get to a place

1508
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:41,358
point where you can actually understand

1509
01:05:38,088 --> 01:05:43,728
the the soil physics the soil chemistry

1510
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:46,818
in the soil microbiology comprehensively

1511
01:05:43,728 --> 01:05:49,368
to be able to gauge what you're going to

1512
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:51,318
see at the end game and that's the

1513
01:05:49,369 --> 01:05:53,209
biggest thing that that is going to

1514
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:55,159
hopefully lead us back man to more

1515
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:59,690
sustainable regenerative cultivation

1516
01:05:55,159 --> 01:06:02,929
methodologies because you know it's it's

1517
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:07,369
it's the route essentially of the core

1518
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:10,098
the end quality is that soil right so so

1519
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:12,289
man the the soil is so impactful in this

1520
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:16,519
crop and it's the the most under you

1521
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:20,660
know under discussed portion just that

1522
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:24,209
that that whole system yeah you're tired

1523
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:26,250
oh go ahead earth man you know

1524
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:27,990
it's a secret it's the secrets that the

1525
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,250
suits won't understand most of the suits

1526
01:06:27,989 --> 01:06:32,578
are just looking at trying to build

1527
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:35,730
indoor crows they don't understand suits

1528
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:37,528
and the roots and the roots welcome

1529
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:39,059
Joshua we were just talking about your

1530
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:39,510
conference Mike was giving you a shout

1531
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:41,940
out

1532
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:43,650
Peter was dropping mad soil knowledge

1533
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,088
and I thought [ __ ] Joshua why should be

1534
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:47,548
here dropping this knowledge with us

1535
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:49,108
how's it going man good I love I love

1536
01:06:47,548 --> 01:06:56,338

harken I'm picks and pants and I just

1538
01:06:56,338 --> 01:06:59,659
saw that cooks down and saw the text

1539
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:07,099
exactly so you got one more conference

1540
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:09,900
going on in Michigan yeah we can

1541
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:11,670

1544
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:17,519
nice to hold because Josh and Kelly will

1545
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:20,099
be back in town they've been traveling

1546
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:22,619
abroad they have they've missed the two

1547
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:24,180
middle kind of conferences and so it

1548
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:25,579
feels like we'll have the band you know

1549
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:28,139
all back together

1550
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:29,490

01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:33,899
was just asking hey what are you guys

1553
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:36,269
all doing to get your your Gardens ready

1554
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,880
for for the spring and then you're like

1555
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:40,829
I'll and this and I'm doing that and I'm

1556
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,318

yeah actually just hey what's up brother

1558
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:49,190
yeah thanks for the seeds have sprouted

1559
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,829
already yeah this Wade laughter hey

1560
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,849
thanks yeah yeah I was actually just

1561
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:55,798
going through seeds uh

1562
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:58,619
pulling out packs I got a lot of

1563
01:07:55,798 --> 01:08:00,900
generous gifts on my travels I couldn't

1564
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:03,660
get it I didn't expect it to be honest

1565
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:05,608
so I'm I'm gonna start some seats this

1566
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:07,920
morning a bunch of cool stuff from

1567
01:08:05,608 --> 01:08:11,219
freeborn selections I got a couple packs

1568
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,108
of his sky Cutler cush I'm super excited

1569
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:15,568
about I got two you know I've heard a

1570
01:08:13,108 --> 01:08:17,809
lot of people talk about his stuff and I

1571
01:08:15,568 --> 01:08:20,189
got to smoke some down at Humboldt and

1572
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:22,980
yeah anyways I'm just super excited

1573
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:24,928
about that yeah how was the Kalle

1574
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:26,968
conference the regenerative conference

1575
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:29,158
down there it was awesome and it was

1576
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:30,929
blew us away I mean the last two just

1577
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:33,509
blew us away we had to actually change

1578
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:35,190
locations at the last minute because we

1579
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:37,979
had so many last-minute signups so we

1580
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:43,619
had about 250 people there yes

1581
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:45,869
rooms that's great news man really cool

1582
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:48,180
because it's it's it's you know the

1583
01:08:45,869 --> 01:08:49,798
measurement is really to dig into the

1584
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:52,350
science of how to do organic

1585
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:53,850
regenerative cultivation and it's it's

1586
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:55,109
still that's what we're doing and

1587
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:56,850
teaching but it's also I've got an

1588
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:59,400
aspect of community support that's

1589
01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:00,870
really come together you know I'm both

1590
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,338
starting in Vancouver when we were up

1591
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:04,019
there you know just seeing that the

1592
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:06,930
clash between the suits and the roots

1593
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:09,000
you know and it's big and it's it's

1594
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:10,680
really cool how the you know the dragon

1595
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,470
fires medicine cooperative has been kind

1596
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,029
of forming and we're figuring out how to

1597
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:17,609
establish ourselves what we want to be

1598
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:21,000
but the power of small farmers coming

1599
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:21,900
together is has really been a theme you

1600
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,399
know that's gone throughout the

1601
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:26,399
conversation well I'll tell you one

1602
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:28,469
thing at that Vancouver lift conference

1603
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:31,559
versus the regenerative soil and they

1604
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:34,680
had tens of thousands of people versus

1605
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:37,730
the 50 to 100 but all the best urban

1606
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:40,289
hash was definitely at that regenerative

1607
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:43,849
like conference I did not see anything

1608
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:47,369
worth anything at lift it was just like

1609
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:53,220
it was as my good friend Hillary said

1610
01:09:47,369 --> 01:09:56,880
this is just a bag of dicks I was like

1611
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:58,350
it really is it's true man and it's you

1612
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,420
know that's the one thing that's been

1613
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:01,650
Matt been missing you know I know you

1614
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:04,440
guys are talking about it but all these

1615
01:10:01,649 --> 01:10:06,420
big grows keep popping up and they can't

1616
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:08,429
produce the high quality you know they

1617
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:10,260
just thought the scenario for but as

1618
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:12,960
small farmers have been doing it and

1619
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:14,909
yeah it's it's just cool to see like the

1620
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,109
people being able to rally together

1621
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:17,729
instead of trying to come in

1622
01:10:16,109 --> 01:10:21,299
you know I'm my brand and here's my

1623
01:10:17,729 --> 01:10:22,709
t-shirt and you know everything we're

1624
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,300
all just trying to survive in so we'd

1625
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:25,859
you know but together I think you know

1626
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,800
just like we used to move it around a

1627
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:30,269
few friends at a time we'll have a good

1628
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,489
market share you know and can put some

1629
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,780
good quality herb on the table yeah

1630
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:35,429
absolutely I don't think we're going

1631
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:38,699
anywhere that's for sure especially I

1632
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:41,430
mean from my perspective as a processor

1633
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:43,289
I felt like we would have much more

1634
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:46,050
success with the roomful of people that

1635
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:48,600
you put together then we would with the

1636
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:50,520
people that lift put together and not to

1637
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,150
bash on left I I always have a good time

1638
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,770
at lift

1639
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:55,198
just saying it was very noticeable to me

1640
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:58,110
when I left left and went to your

1641
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:59,729
conference and was like okay so and I'm

1642
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:02,158
pretty sure I even said it when I when I

1643
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:04,349
spoke on the panel I was like these are

1644
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:08,219
my people you know these are the roots

1645
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:10,920
and over there are the suits and it's

1646
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:12,689
just a different vibe yeah and we need

1647
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:14,969
both to be honest to really get course

1648
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:16,469
out in the whole world you know we're

1649
01:11:14,969 --> 01:11:18,899
talking about a different scene you know

1650
01:11:16,469 --> 01:11:20,760
we're gonna be most of the stuffs gonna

1651
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:22,738
be going for oral you know we got to be

1652
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,539
all inclusive to the people who have

1653
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:26,549
you're just getting into the industry

1654
01:11:24,539 --> 01:11:28,469
the people who are just Church it's just

1655
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:32,239
starting their businesses as well as the

1656
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:35,969
a lot of us as well as the viewers or

1657
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:38,609
people who range in experience that have

1658
01:11:35,969 --> 01:11:40,619
just are didn't growing their first

1659
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:41,579
plant all the way up to been growing for

1660
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:48,899
decades

1661
01:11:41,579 --> 01:11:50,579
oh yeah totally and exactly the roots

1662
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:52,559
gotta educate the fruits and you know

1663
01:11:50,579 --> 01:11:54,750
what we're gonna want to talk about on

1664
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,449
high level science is not gonna be what

1665
01:11:54,750 --> 01:12:03,929
the new people want to learn about but

1666
01:11:57,448 --> 01:12:06,539
you gotta start somewhere so conferences

1667
01:12:03,929 --> 01:12:08,010
as well I'm excited about the new people

1668
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:10,050
personally because you know I always

1669
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:11,159
said it when the industry was kind of

1670
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:13,140
pre industry when it was just

1671
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:14,579
prohibition and everyone kind of out for

1672
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:16,679
themselves and they were just in there

1673
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:18,840
little grows and they were just paying

1674
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:21,210
their mortgage in their car payments and

1675
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:24,079
it it was what it was but I would just

1676
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:26,609
say that it wasn't the best of the best

1677
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:29,069
there was some incredible people in

1678
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:31,559
there but some really great people were

1679
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:34,139
kept from entering into the industry

1680
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,030
because of fear of losing their safety

1681
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,440
in their livelihood and their families

1682
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:40,289
and all of these other things that some

1683
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,689
of us were just like [ __ ] it I'm just

1684
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:44,819
gonna I'm doing this I don't care I'm

1685
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:47,039
[ __ ] doing this whereas the others

1686
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:48,448
we're kind of like now with the ability

1687
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:50,609
to come in safely

1688
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:52,829
first of all right off the bat what

1689
01:12:50,609 --> 01:12:56,189
we're seeing which is wonderful is a

1690
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:59,189
huge influx of women into our industry

1691
01:12:56,189 --> 01:13:01,859
another and not because they're women

1692
01:12:59,189 --> 01:13:03,779
because that's [ __ ] you don't give

1693
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:04,618
someone something just because of their

1694
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:07,319
genitalia

1695
01:13:04,618 --> 01:13:08,460
but I see great women coming in not

1696
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:10,859
because they're women but because

1697
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,029
they're now ready to be a part of this

1698
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:13,889
they're right they're like you know what

1699
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:17,189
I've got something to offer and there

1700
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:18,779
are a ton of them coming into the

1701
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:19,948
industry and so that's let's put it

1702
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:21,779
that's put a big smile on my face

1703
01:13:19,948 --> 01:13:23,339
because you know generally women are

1704
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:27,210
naturally better at things like

1705
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:29,190
nurturing and caring and you know people

1706
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:30,779
it's time to show nurturing and

1707
01:13:29,189 --> 01:13:32,848
compassion to our soils man you're

1708
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:36,029
absolutely right that's a great point

1709
01:13:32,849 --> 01:13:37,619
that yin and yang man it's nice the good

1710
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:42,210
balance I I was just saying that the

1711
01:13:37,618 --> 01:13:45,029
other day it's that's funny industry day

1712
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:47,460
panel and lift in Edmonton Calgary and

1713
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:50,899
I'd say over 50% of the people on the

1714
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:53,219
panel were women and just amazing

1715
01:13:50,899 --> 01:13:54,569
education coming out and have to say

1716
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:56,819
over the holiday events I've done over

1717
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:59,340
the years these last ones were all new

1718
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:00,179
people but all professionals all coming

1719
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,130
out of Harvard

1720
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:04,260
coming out of colleges like really

1721
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:06,810
really have been waiting for their

1722
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,670
chance to come into this industry and it

1723
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:10,139
was really actually rewarding to hear

1724
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:12,539
the doctors and the specialists of

1725
01:14:10,139 --> 01:14:14,489
scientists and even these new testing

1726
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:17,519
machine I was looking at yesterday that

1727
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:20,329
works off a light I actually have it on

1728
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:27,409
my phone it was

1729
01:14:20,329 --> 01:14:30,539
it's called [ __ ] sorry biz

1730
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:32,969
no it's yeah complete test like this

1731
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:34,789
little machine is the new complete test

1732
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:40,020
they're testing all these new little

1733
01:14:34,789 --> 01:14:42,090
like I'm going to say industry gain

1734
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:44,489
changes are coming to play right now so

1735
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:46,380
these little machines are gonna be game

1736
01:14:44,488 --> 01:14:47,939
changers for these micro growers so they

1737
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,949
can actually have these machines sitting

1738
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:53,368
in their facilities where they belong on

1739
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:55,049
the different TAC ttat you know CBD

1740
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:57,839
getting into the heavy metals into

1741
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:59,789
pesticide testing and stuff yeah HPLC

1742
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,800
machines if you're saying yeah but this

1743
01:14:59,789 --> 01:15:04,109
is not gonna replace it I was really

1744
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,960
cool it's called complete test and it's

1745
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:08,698
actually by floral tuck and I actually

1746
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:11,279
got a chance to look at this machine

1747
01:15:08,698 --> 01:15:13,529
yesterday behind closed doors with Remo

1748
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:15,118
and they actually did some testing I was

1749
01:15:13,529 --> 01:15:18,439
pretty impressed it's not replacing an

1750
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:20,238
HPLC or GC but it's able to allow some

1751
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:22,039
you don't have to have any status to

1752
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:24,829
calibrate this machine which is pretty

1753
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:26,420
pretty amazing actually my mind I'm like

1754
01:15:24,829 --> 01:15:28,550
what about this for me is just a

1755
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:30,440
difference in night and day but this is

1756
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:32,630
what's coming to the industry right now

1757
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:34,429
and I'm just I was like so excited to

1758
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:35,840
even kind of look at this thing it it's

1759
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:38,030
gonna be coming out we're hear more

1760
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,949
about it in the future but even to

1761
01:15:38,029 --> 01:15:41,779
little little grinding machines that

1762
01:15:39,948 --> 01:15:43,639
testing humidity levels that test the

1763
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:46,130
different cannabinoid levels for

1764
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:49,039
patients so this was another machine I

1765
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:50,420
saw and it collects the data onto an app

1766
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:52,100
where actually they start seeing how

1767
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:54,020
much they're using every day how much

1768
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,550
you know what what's strange they're

1769
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,900
using so they can actually patients can

1770
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:58,219
start actually tracking you'll see

1771
01:15:56,899 --> 01:15:59,960
what's helping them and stuff like that

1772
01:15:58,219 --> 01:16:01,250
so all these new little things this is

1773
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,409
coming out of Israel I learned about

1774
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,609
this over the weekend looks like it's

1775
01:16:03,409 --> 01:16:06,340
exciting to see what's actually

1776
01:16:04,609 --> 01:16:08,448

grammars a couple times a day rather

1803
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,770

1804
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:17,960
small ones which is gonna how is to roll

1805
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:20,120
but keep it going yeah right before I

1806
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,909
stop smoking joints completely I was

1807
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:24,738
smoking three to four grams and I was

1808
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:27,079
smoking I was smoking a good five or six

1809
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:29,089
of them a day it was it was a little out

1810
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:30,460
of hand I was definitely living in a

1811
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:32,829
cloud of

1812
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:35,560
and one of the first things my wife

1813
01:17:32,829 --> 01:17:39,039
noticed when I started smoking hash she

1814
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:42,370
was like wow like holy [ __ ] we were

1815
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:46,119
living in a house fire buddy like I had

1816
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:50,800
like I had three pounds of roaches when

1817
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:53,920
I stopped smoking weed three pounds okay

1818
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,510
I got garbage bags I feel like in my

1819
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,489
freezer I just gave him away going

1820
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:59,739
downtown little ziplock baggies of

1821
01:17:57,488 --> 01:18:02,409
roaches too you know people what was it

1822
01:17:59,738 --> 01:18:07,509
locks I only put privileges in glass

1823
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:10,988
jars I'm not even joking

1824
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:12,670
that's the pathetic thing I used to love

1825
01:18:10,988 --> 01:18:14,379
my roaches in my favorite thing but then

1826
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:17,230
they just started building up and he's

1827
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:19,810
kind of like started I I got a good road

1828
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:22,238
story so I'm going through a you know

1829
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:24,460
it's like it's late I probably shouldn't

1830
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:26,589
have gone and eaten mushrooms and picked

1831
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:29,529
up cannabis on this particular day but I

1832
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:31,390
was pretty high on mushrooms and had

1833
01:18:29,529 --> 01:18:34,779
some cannabis with me and ended up

1834
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:35,980
getting into a into a roadblock and got

1835
01:18:34,779 --> 01:18:37,659
into some trouble it was my it was my

1836
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:39,369
case actually with the compassion club

1837
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:42,460
got caught was 16 and a half pounds and

1838
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:44,199
some cash and ended up in jail for the

1839
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:45,730
night so I went to jail and I was all

1840
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:47,619
bummed out I was like [ __ ] they took all

1841
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:49,929
that beautiful organic weed I'll tell

1842
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:51,550
you that jail smelled amazing every time

1843
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:56,230
a new cop walked in they'd be like holy

1844
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:58,239
[ __ ] Barry what's going on in here

1845
01:18:56,229 --> 01:19:01,439
like it was so stinky because they

1846
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:04,029
opened it all and weighed it and so I

1847
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:07,839
got I got out the next morning at about

1848
01:19:04,029 --> 01:19:09,670
10:30 1040a you know they gave me all my

1849
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,310
stuff back and put me in my car and as I

1850
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:14,529
was driving home this is when I still

1851
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:17,440
smoke joints I was like hey I wonder I

1852
01:19:14,529 --> 01:19:20,409
was driving my wife's Jetta and I opened

1853
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:23,109
the ashtray and it's just packed full of

1854
01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:25,269
roaches so I grabbed the biggest fattest

1855
01:19:23,109 --> 01:19:27,159
one I can find and I light that up and

1856
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:30,340
I'll never forget driving up the sea to

1857
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:34,689
sky highway I lit it up and I exhaled it

1858
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:37,480
and I thought it's the haze it was like

1859
01:19:34,689 --> 01:19:39,969
the silver lining of the cloud you know

1860
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:42,399
like it was just like it's the haze like

1861
01:19:39,969 --> 01:19:43,710
I just got all my weed and cash taken

1862
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:46,500
away from me and thrown in

1863
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:48,449
jail for the night and it's like I'm I'm

1864
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,670
enjoying this haze joint right now like

1865
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:51,359
I felt like it was a gift from the

1866
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:52,829
police

1867
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:54,839
like they just were like we'll just

1868
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:57,659
leave him as roaches he's gonna need

1869
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:58,199
that anyway that's a true true roach

1870
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:00,059
story

1871
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:02,729
one of the last roaches I ever smoked

1872
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:05,580
actually but it was the haze there was

1873
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:09,419
man it was the haze I even said it I was

1874
01:20:05,579 --> 01:20:11,430
like it's the haze so for those of you

1875
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:13,469
that don't know I love the haze it is

1876
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:17,670
actually my son's middle name I have a

1877
01:20:13,469 --> 01:20:19,590
big fondness for nice was there a

1878
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:22,079
tipping point where you're just like

1879
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:23,760
[ __ ] it no more joints well there was a

1880
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:26,670
tipping point because what happened was

1881
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,619
in 1998 I tried water hash bags for the

1882
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:30,210
first time and I had tried them a couple

1883
01:20:28,619 --> 01:20:32,189
of times and I was like this is bunk

1884
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:33,810
this is just [ __ ] there's nothing good

1885
01:20:32,189 --> 01:20:35,579
about this and then breeder Steve was

1886
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:38,010
like hey try some of this shish-kebab I

1887
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:40,350
just cut down its really beautiful trim

1888
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:43,619
and so I ran the trim through these bags

1889
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:46,110
that I had they were isolator bags and I

1890
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:48,930
actually got something of like eye I got

1891
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:51,210
a glimpse of it I was like whoa and so

1892
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:53,280
within months I had my own bags bubble

1893
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:55,159
bags existed and I started running all

1894
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:58,679
these different peoples material while

1895
01:20:55,159 --> 01:21:01,349
when I started running Renee and it was

1896
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:03,750
like all of the terpenes were preserved

1897
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:05,430
from start to finish the tiny little

1898
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:08,880
piece of the hash smelt like a bag of

1899
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:10,880
weed it was just so over like just

1900
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,409
flavorful to the max and I thought

1901
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,180
that's really what destroyed joints for

1902
01:21:13,409 --> 01:21:16,889
me because I started smoking it like not

1903
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,780
even realizing I wasn't rolling joints

1904
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:21,270
anymore and I was smoking and smoking it

1905
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:23,969
and smoking it well after about two

1906
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:26,370
years of smoking at every single day

1907
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:28,949
because I was blessed a friend of mine

1908
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:31,559
had a hundred like bro and he would just

1909
01:21:28,949 --> 01:21:33,238
give me the trim every couple months

1910
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,700
he'd just give me these huge giant bags

1911
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:39,869
of Renee trim and it was it was a lot

1912
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:41,519
and so when I went back to burn a joint

1913
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:43,349
you know when I was finally like oh I

1914
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,770
should just try a joint like what's up

1915
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:49,110
what's up with me it smelt like smoking

1916
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:52,200
well if it felt like smoking wood it was

1917
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:55,349
just Burt I just tasted burnt it was not

1918
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:57,300
a good experience and in fact I I kind

1919
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:58,740
of was bummed out I won't

1920
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:00,869
be honest I definitely didn't think like

1921
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:03,779
I'm better than joints I kind of felt

1922
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:08,760
like whoa like I ruined joints for

1923
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:10,529
myself like [ __ ] and just can't do it

1924
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,239
just even when I smell them in the air

1925
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:15,090
I'm like that does not smell good to me

1926
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:17,399
compared to like some full melt like I

1927
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:18,989
just want full melt of all the varieties

1928
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,609
that's what I prefer we all prefer

1929
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:22,559
different things joints will always have

1930
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:24,599
their place some people will always love

1931
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,100
solvent extract and some people will

1932
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,480
love their isolates some people will

1933
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,010
like their distillate some people are

1934
01:22:27,479 --> 01:22:31,259
gonna like their traditional hashes

1935
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:32,909
regardless of how they were made I would

1936
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,310
never have it any other way thank God

1937
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:36,779
that we all love things a little bit

1938
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:39,420
differently about this plant and that

1939
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:41,909
we're all not just the same robotic like

1940
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:43,890
this is what's the best everyone agrees

1941
01:22:41,909 --> 01:22:45,779
there is no agreeance when it comes to

1942
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:48,960
what's the best with cannabis that's why

1943
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:53,489
the term the best is so ridiculous when

1944
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,829
it comes to cannabis subjective way too

1945
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:57,569
subjective yeah come on no this is the

1946
01:22:55,829 --> 01:22:59,609
best man this is the best I feel the

1947
01:22:57,569 --> 01:23:03,809
same way that Marcus like I still do

1948
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:06,149
burn herb it's just not only if someone

1949
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:09,000
has it around you know I really it's

1950
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:11,460
just dude not even when Remo passes me a

1951
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,670
giant fatty on camera and I know when I

1952
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:16,680
say no 10,000 people are gonna troll me

1953
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:18,359
or be like we're [ __ ] bubble man

1954
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,070
thinks he's better than Remo just smoke

1955
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:22,170
that [ __ ] joint you little douche bag

1956
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:24,750
just like all these wonderful YouTube

1957
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:26,819
comments I get and then poor Remo he's

1958
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:28,770
like oh dude I'm so sorry I always

1959
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:30,389
forget I'm like yeah dude it's all good

1960
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:32,160
like you should never apologize for

1961
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:35,250
someone else being a douchebag on the

1962
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:37,260
internet you should always offer me the

1963
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:39,300
joint and trust me when I sit with Remo

1964
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:43,320
when he smokes a single joint he'll

1965
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:51,060
offer to me like 19 times oh sorry dude

1966
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:53,159
I'm sorry I do you want this no head

1967
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,870
said Morpheus wants to say hi he's

1968
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:56,519
sitting on my lighter and my hash and

1969
01:23:54,869 --> 01:24:01,099
yeah yeah so I gotta go feed him

1970
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:04,470
something you guys alright there we go

1971
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:06,300
what else what else more more on soil we

1972
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:08,550
got Joshua popping in what were the big

1973
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:09,140
highlights of your you know like what

1974
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:11,750
what's

1975
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,039
the real like allows people to break in

1976
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:16,640
because I kind of feel like this

1977
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:18,500
regenerative organic no-till like it the

1978
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:20,990
rabbit-hole goes really deep with this

1979
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:23,270
one and it's like it's complicated yet

1980
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:25,219
it seems to be somewhat simple if you

1981
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:26,750
just sort of learn the right things and

1982
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:28,970
pay attention to the right things

1983
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:31,779
what would you say at the last one in

1984
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:36,350
Humboldt there was the real sort of the

1985
01:24:31,779 --> 01:24:37,909
the gem of the I think altogether it's

1986
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:40,100
really learn how to use the microscope

1987
01:24:37,909 --> 01:24:41,840
and you know because everyone that's

1988
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,610
coming to these conferences are tenured

1989
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,110
growers and they all have like like you

1990
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:48,199
said the best weed they've got their

1991
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:49,699
practices and you know I always I kind

1992
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:51,260
of use the analogy of cooking and baking

1993
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:52,939
you know or how a lot of people say

1994
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:54,500
thank you I can cook wonderfully but I

1995
01:24:52,939 --> 01:24:56,719
can't bake you know coz and it's because

1996
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:58,489
when they open up the recipe they don't

1997
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,800
adjust for their environment or their

1998
01:24:58,489 --> 01:25:03,739
oven or the humidity and stuff and so

1999
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,090
some good growers good growers usually

2000
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:06,920
have figured that out they just kinda

2001
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:09,470
they have that sense and they you know

2002
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:12,730
understand humidity and temperature and

2003
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:15,020
control and how that affects soil and

2004
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:16,819
but the real tried-and-true way is to

2005
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:18,800
use a microscope so when you're you know

2006
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:20,689
making compost teas and then pop buying

2007
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,909
company making compost you're you're

2008
01:25:20,689 --> 01:25:24,500
assessing which guys are in there and

2009
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:26,689
not just kind of guessing and and that's

2010
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:28,460
you know we're all guilty of it I'm

2011
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:30,349
guilty of it you know we get these

2012
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:32,630
recipes we do these things we see

2013
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:34,910
results and then we want to make it like

2014
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:37,329
this this recipe thing in it just

2015
01:25:34,909 --> 01:25:39,349
doesn't always work that way so I really

2016
01:25:37,329 --> 01:25:40,579
it's interesting that you would bring it

2017
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:44,180
to the microscope because that's

2018
01:25:40,579 --> 01:25:47,359
literally I feel how I was able to learn

2019
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:50,570
so much about cannabis resin and hashes

2020
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:53,509
and also share so much of it because the

2021
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:56,149
microscope getting into those close-up

2022
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:57,980
images where you're like oh what is that

2023
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:59,719
exactly and there's something about I

2024
01:25:57,979 --> 01:26:01,849
mean we have these senses they're

2025
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:04,760
obviously you know the things that allow

2026
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:07,850
us to discover and to learn in this

2027
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:09,800
world and seeing sometimes is such a big

2028
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:12,440
one you can read about it you can learn

2029
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,940
about it and then suddenly you see that

2030
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:16,279
thing that you've been learning about

2031
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:17,659
and something I mean with my photography

2032
01:26:16,279 --> 01:26:19,639
it was a guarantee I watched it happen

2033
01:26:17,659 --> 01:26:22,519
with people something just went click

2034
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:24,560
before you know I released

2035
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,970
Photography there was only a couple of

2036
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,520
people you really had to go like to

2037
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:31,670
Amsterdam and meet like you Dumas who

2038
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,010
took these most beautiful unbelievable

2039
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:36,050
trichome photos that he was taking in

2040
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:38,150
the 80s with an electron scan microscope

2041
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:40,310
I had never seen anything like it but

2042
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:42,920
prior to that before I started doing my

2043
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:45,950
own photography there really wasn't a

2044
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:48,560
lot of people like almost none taking

2045
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:50,659
up-close photographs of cannabis resin

2046
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,210
glands and sistah with hairs and the

2047
01:26:50,659 --> 01:26:55,399
different types of bugs and so I was

2048
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:57,230
using a camera not a microscope but a

2049
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:59,000
macro lens that works very much like a

2050
01:26:57,229 --> 01:27:01,579
microscope so it's interesting that you

2051
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,229
would say that no it's I mean it's just

2052
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:04,789
what you need you start to get serious

2053
01:27:03,229 --> 01:27:06,259
about stuff you gotta really find out

2054
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:08,229
especially these bugs you know we're

2055
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:10,489
relying on bugs the whole system and

2056
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:12,769
what bugs are there and how do they work

2057
01:27:10,489 --> 01:27:14,090
it you know same thing when you're

2058
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:16,220
looking when you're assessing hash you

2059
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:18,199
know I've said you know I've had sent

2060
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:20,119
out material to folks that you know

2061
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:24,170
here's a good mistake I made I pulled

2062
01:27:20,119 --> 01:27:25,460
tarp over a a OOP and I didn't have it

2063
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,260
the dust blocking it so there was

2064
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,970
getting despots onto the onto the head

2065
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:30,320
so you know every time and so they

2066
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:31,820
messed around and they sent me

2067
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:33,679
microscope shots they're like look dude

2068
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:35,750
there's dust in here what the [ __ ] you

2069
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:37,610
know and there's all this agar in it was

2070
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,229
for me and we figured it out and it was

2071
01:27:37,609 --> 01:27:40,519
you know it was pretty awesome you know

2072
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:42,799
they were able to show me just like that

2073
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,420
instead of being like nah man something

2074
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:48,440
not right here

2075
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:52,069
that doesn't help anybody the the

2076
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:54,500
microscope and the rhizosphere like what

2077
01:27:52,069 --> 01:27:56,210
would a world for pictures if you could

2078
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,649
actually visualize it so it's one of the

2079
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:59,750
things that people don't really you know

2080
01:27:57,649 --> 01:28:01,399
think about a lot because they can't see

2081
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:03,800
it Marcus and you're absolutely right

2082
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:07,219
you know putting putting a visual for

2083
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:08,869
for for us as a species to learn is so

2084
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:11,810
much more comprehensive than something

2085
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:14,000
that we can't see so so when you think

2086
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:16,610
about the colors and the images and the

2087
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,020
world that is what's happening on that

2088
01:28:16,609 --> 01:28:20,089
plants rhizosphere

2089
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:22,130
which is what he's saying is almost the

2090
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:24,110
foundation of sustainable regenerative

2091
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:28,010
agricultural practices it's bringing in

2092
01:28:24,109 --> 01:28:31,369
that microscope and to actually see just

2093
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:35,730
just as a weird example like what plant

2094
01:28:31,369 --> 01:28:38,250
parasitic mite nematodes are like

2095
01:28:35,729 --> 01:28:40,109
you know like like those are little

2096
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:41,819
worms that not a lot of cannabis growers

2097
01:28:40,109 --> 01:28:44,339
know about and they're so prevalent in

2098
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:46,889
sandy soils with with high moisture and

2099
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:48,779
so to get a microscope and to see like

2100
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:51,480
the beak or the still it of a plant

2101
01:28:48,779 --> 01:28:53,939
parasitic nematode like Malloy de chine

2102
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:57,899
that's eating your fine root hairs which

2103
01:28:53,939 --> 01:29:00,029
are where all that cannabis trichome and

2104
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:03,389
resin production really stems from that

2105
01:29:00,029 --> 01:29:05,759
nutrient dense base and you see the the

2106
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:08,670
world right you guys are studying the

2107
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:11,159
above ground with the trichomes but but

2108
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:14,520
you get that plant in the other part of

2109
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:16,738
it and and those those those fine root

2110
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:20,760
hairs are what absorbing a lot of your

2111
01:29:16,738 --> 01:29:22,709
macronutrients and so the nematodes eat

2112
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,780
those guys they eat them in abundance

2113
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:27,449
yeah oh it's fine root hairs are just

2114
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:29,880
gobbled up and then the nematodes will

2115
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:32,369
actually go inside the root and that's

2116
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:34,260
where like the disease can go in and and

2117
01:29:32,369 --> 01:29:36,149
again with this plant you don't see some

2118
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:38,960
of those signs you just see low THC

2119
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:42,359
production you see low CBD production

2120
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:46,829
the plant isn't as big in biomass

2121
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:49,289
because those those those that world in

2122
01:29:46,829 --> 01:29:50,729
there is out of balance and it's and

2123
01:29:49,289 --> 01:29:53,310
it's restoring it back to that balance

2124
01:29:50,729 --> 01:29:54,769
which is what I think this gentleman's

2125
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:58,140
talking about with the regenerative

2126
01:29:54,770 --> 01:30:01,350
sustainable cultivation methodologies to

2127
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:03,210
actually restore that with with his

2128
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:05,730
compost he's and and getting that

2129
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:09,390
microscope out and saying hey man a good

2130
01:30:05,729 --> 01:30:11,579
organic farmer uses three to five years

2131
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:13,860
worth of heavy amendments and composting

2132
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:16,079
and in teas and and humic acids and and

2133
01:30:13,859 --> 01:30:18,089
you know all these different natural

2134
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:23,309
blends of nutrients that this plant

2135
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:25,890
needs to to out balance the beneficial

2136
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:27,630
microorganisms on that soil so that the

2137
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:31,520
pathogens don't necessarily have the

2138
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:31,520
competency to take over the community

2139
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:42,750
what about host plants for beneficials

2140
01:30:40,699 --> 01:30:45,269
do you guys want to talk a little bit

2141
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:47,010
about that I do I just want to hear what

2142
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:47,349
Josh who I was gonna say cuz he looked

2143
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:49,389
like

2144
01:30:47,349 --> 01:30:50,828
really I was gonna happen I can hop it

2145
01:30:49,389 --> 01:30:52,958
on both those but I was gonna say on

2146
01:30:50,828 --> 01:30:55,238
that good example so you have root

2147
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:56,559
feeding nematodes and you discover you

2148
01:30:55,238 --> 01:30:58,839
looking at microscopy oh I got these

2149
01:30:56,559 --> 01:30:59,889
root feeding them a toads and so what

2150
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:02,529
are you gonna do you're gonna buy

2151
01:30:59,889 --> 01:31:03,729
beneficial nematodes predatory nematodes

2152
01:31:02,529 --> 01:31:05,319
that are gonna eat those and then you're

2153
01:31:03,729 --> 01:31:07,628
gonna apply them right so now you've

2154
01:31:05,319 --> 01:31:09,308
applied them in here to your root zone

2155
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:12,219
and now you want to go back and check to

2156
01:31:09,309 --> 01:31:15,038
see if it's effective and well you know

2157
01:31:12,219 --> 01:31:16,658
one guy that's actually super boredom

2158
01:31:15,038 --> 01:31:19,238
scuttle or granola I think he's been on

2159
01:31:16,658 --> 01:31:22,089
here before he's um been able to do some

2160
01:31:19,238 --> 01:31:23,678
you know look at some larger canopy

2161
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:25,599
spaces where guys are doing this and

2162
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:29,618
they're not applying evenly right there

2163
01:31:25,599 --> 01:31:31,269
at the beneficial nematodes so the whole

2164
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:33,279
crop you know they'll have patches of

2165
01:31:31,269 --> 01:31:35,168
areas it will be successful and patches

2166
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:36,759
of areas that aren't in there if you

2167
01:31:35,168 --> 01:31:38,439
didn't get in there with the microscope

2168
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,689
and assess all the different areas you

2169
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:42,010
wouldn't be able to confidently say that

2170
01:31:40,689 --> 01:31:43,510
you've dealt with the problem you know

2171
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:44,859
you'd be kind of guessing and that's

2172
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:46,809
what a lot of people do they they have

2173
01:31:44,859 --> 01:31:48,429
information they're like it's it's

2174
01:31:46,809 --> 01:31:50,019
partial information but until you

2175
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:52,958
actually go in there and do the checks

2176
01:31:50,019 --> 01:31:54,248
and balances the befores and afters you

2177
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:56,800
really are kind of shooting in the dark

2178
01:31:54,248 --> 01:32:01,179
and then you know about the beneficial

2179
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,590
or banker plants that's more for for the

2180
01:32:01,179 --> 01:32:04,590
leaf surface you know for beneficial

2181
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:07,628
insects that are eating you know the

2182
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:10,779
pathogenic insects we were talking about

2183
01:32:07,628 --> 01:32:14,349
root zone stuff but yeah so there's you

2184
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:17,378
know one of the things I learned in the

2185
01:32:14,349 --> 01:32:21,010
Lord at the roots trilogy as Jeff flume

2186
01:32:17,378 --> 01:32:23,019
feels likes to call it fungal hyphae

2187
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:26,998
will actually develop loops that that

2188
01:32:23,019 --> 01:32:28,179
can ensnare the plant path in and genic

2189
01:32:26,998 --> 01:32:29,918
nematodes

2190
01:32:28,179 --> 01:32:31,809
but the beneficial nematodes are too

2191
01:32:29,918 --> 01:32:33,309
small so the beneficial nematodes don't

2192
01:32:31,809 --> 01:32:36,309
actually get killed by some of the root

2193
01:32:33,309 --> 01:32:39,399
fungal hyphae so if you do see that

2194
01:32:36,309 --> 01:32:42,399
those in your soil you can you know do a

2195
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:47,469
cover from mulch and in that mulch throw

2196
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:49,329
in some you know cover cover crops like

2197
01:32:47,469 --> 01:32:51,059
crimson clover that's going to provide

2198
01:32:49,328 --> 01:32:54,578
nitrogen but also doing things like

2199
01:32:51,059 --> 01:32:56,529
creeping time creeping rosemary mints is

2200
01:32:54,578 --> 01:32:58,868
all kind of be plants that naturally

2201
01:32:56,529 --> 01:33:00,849
exude terpenes both in there's leaf

2202
01:32:58,868 --> 01:33:03,819
surface but also in the roots

2203
01:33:00,849 --> 01:33:07,090
and the fungal hyphae will actually move

2204
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:09,039
those mono-cyclic and bicycling

2205
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:11,770
terpenoids around in the soil to your

2206
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:13,810
cannabis plants it's actually you're

2207
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:15,219
right on its nose right have those in

2208
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:17,820
play you know a lot of people don't

2209
01:33:15,219 --> 01:33:20,050
understand and using mouth cries I fungi

2210
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:22,299
which is what he's talking about is the

2211
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:24,340
relationship is moronic Maya cries that

2212
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:26,199
connection where the fungus is actually

2213
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:27,670
harvesting nutrients and bringing it to

2214
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:29,769
the plants and the plants are calling

2215
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:31,179
for the nutrients they need at different

2216
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,790
times and then they go out and get it

2217
01:33:31,179 --> 01:33:36,179
but the point I was going to make is it

2218
01:33:33,789 --> 01:33:39,010
takes 90 days to inoculate a root zone

2219
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:40,328
with Mal quasi fungi a lot of people

2220
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:43,079
don't understand that so if you're a

2221
01:33:40,328 --> 01:33:45,578
synthetic based grower and you're adding

2222
01:33:43,078 --> 01:33:50,259
mycorrhizae every time it actually makes

2223
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:52,179
no sense whatsoever at all and and if

2224
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:54,550
you're a living soil regenerative grower

2225
01:33:52,179 --> 01:33:56,920
you really need to have cover crops to

2226
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:59,139
hold those those my friends I in place

2227
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,300
where they can live while you're doing

2228
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:02,920
you know your changeover and you always

2229
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,389
want to leave your stalks and stems from

2230
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,679
before and then you put your new plants

2231
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:07,480
in next to it so they can just kind of

2232
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,969
heart can kind of move over and you get

2233
01:34:07,479 --> 01:34:12,638
that benefit otherwise it's it's kind of

2234
01:34:09,969 --> 01:34:14,800
a waste of money yeah so if you guys if

2235
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:17,618
you know the viewers are watching or

2236
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,380
planting in planting crops into new land

2237
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:22,359
you you got to realize it's gonna if

2238
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:24,159
it's gonna take two three months to get

2239
01:34:22,359 --> 01:34:26,738
a stat a cover crops and mycorrhizae

2240
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,299
fungi the network's established and

2241
01:34:26,738 --> 01:34:31,629
you're planning on planting in June

2242
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:34,570
we're in March April May June you got

2243
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:37,060
three months so now you know March in

2244
01:34:34,569 --> 01:34:39,488
April are great months to you know hit

2245
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:43,539
your any new planting sites with cover

2246
01:34:39,488 --> 01:34:45,789
crops probably hitting them with a a

2247
01:34:43,539 --> 01:34:48,219
compost first you know or leaf mulch

2248
01:34:45,789 --> 01:34:52,658
that you can inoculate with a with a

2249
01:34:48,219 --> 01:34:55,090
fungal tea or bacterial tea and then

2250
01:34:52,658 --> 01:34:56,679
incorporating cover crops into that leaf

2251
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:57,849
mulch so that it can start growing the

2252
01:34:56,679 --> 01:35:03,310
cover crop so that when you actually

2253
01:34:57,849 --> 01:35:04,800
start planting in May in June then we'll

2254
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:07,510
actually already have some of that

2255
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:11,378
beneficial bacteria Network already

2256
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:13,989
built into your new net new soil beds

2257
01:35:11,378 --> 01:35:15,788
yeah I was actually gonna shout out so

2258
01:35:13,988 --> 01:35:18,488
there's one of the guys we've had work

2259
01:35:15,788 --> 01:35:20,198
with us is dr. Ephraim desire his are as

2260
01:35:18,488 --> 01:35:23,168
I was messin Flast name

2261
01:35:20,198 --> 01:35:25,598
he's at my co roots calm but what he

2262
01:35:23,168 --> 01:35:27,340
does is he just assesses my cries that

2263
01:35:25,599 --> 01:35:30,119
fungi that's his specialty and that's

2264
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:32,139
what he's done for his whole career and

2265
01:35:30,118 --> 01:35:33,578
everyone knows him you know Jeff blowing

2266
01:35:32,139 --> 01:35:35,019
bells nose and Mullane nose and they all

2267
01:35:33,578 --> 01:35:37,808
send their stuff to him to get tested

2268
01:35:35,019 --> 01:35:39,609
and so I got introduced to him and and

2269
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:40,840
he explained all this to me and

2270
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:42,459
explained you know that most of the

2271
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,279
stuff that's on the market has very

2272
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:46,779
little mal Karzai in there at all you

2273
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:51,518
know and you have to use a special scope

2274
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:53,139
to see it and so what what we were

2275
01:35:51,519 --> 01:35:54,248
recommending is are legit that you go

2276
01:35:53,139 --> 01:35:55,958
and just have a sec when we were

2277
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:57,878
recommending it at the conference is

2278
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:59,918
that you know before you go and spend a

2279
01:35:57,878 --> 01:36:02,229
bunch of money on crack because you only

2280
01:35:59,918 --> 01:36:04,779
need to inoculate once you send it to

2281
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:06,369
Efren to get tested and he would you

2282
01:36:04,779 --> 01:36:07,809
know test the viability of it and then

2283
01:36:06,368 --> 01:36:10,328
you know you then you go and spend you

2284
01:36:07,809 --> 01:36:12,128
know the kind of money anyway it's just

2285
01:36:10,328 --> 01:36:14,438
- just a plug in because he just did

2286
01:36:12,128 --> 01:36:16,628
send me it back he's got a him and his

2287
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:18,429
son developed their own thing after like

2288
01:36:16,628 --> 01:36:20,618
he's been doing this for like 40 50

2289
01:36:18,429 --> 01:36:22,239
years a long time so mycorrhizae has

2290
01:36:20,618 --> 01:36:23,858
been around yeah microwaves has been

2291
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,078
around since the Egyptian times right

2292
01:36:23,859 --> 01:36:29,409
they've they've quantified the the

2293
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:31,118
efficacy of it through sporulation you

2294
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:33,668
know it's it's one of those strains that

2295
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:36,009
can take two to three months to really

2296
01:36:33,668 --> 01:36:37,569
gain a lot of traction so when you're

2297
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:40,479
mono cropping unless you've established

2298
01:36:37,569 --> 01:36:42,849
a lot of that that mycorrhizae in there

2299
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:45,010
which is in the air actually a lot of

2300
01:36:42,849 --> 01:36:48,128
times what we see as micro azide

2301
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:50,619
populations increasing just with soil

2302
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:53,229
porosity being increased and you know

2303
01:36:50,618 --> 01:36:55,328
the the bulk density being reduced in

2304
01:36:53,229 --> 01:36:56,979
that soil the the if there's a living

2305
01:36:55,328 --> 01:36:59,608
soil the respiration will actually

2306
01:36:56,979 --> 01:37:02,199
facilitate more mycorrhizae from the air

2307
01:36:59,609 --> 01:37:04,419
and actually colonize the rhizosphere

2308
01:37:02,198 --> 01:37:06,308
just you know we have Micro Z in our

2309
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:11,618
lungs so it's one of those older strains

2310
01:37:06,309 --> 01:37:13,359
but you know as far as a simplistic way

2311
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:16,929
to kind of blow more distance [ __ ]

2312
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:19,749
mind or just a thought that I had so so

2313
01:37:16,929 --> 01:37:22,118
think about like an earth womb right so

2314
01:37:19,748 --> 01:37:24,128
I was at a bonfire last night with these

2315
01:37:22,118 --> 01:37:24,880
really cool guys man we started talking

2316
01:37:24,128 --> 01:37:27,010
about and

2317
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,260
earth where you could actually in your

2318
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:31,719
farm you could have like an earthing you

2319
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:35,110
know type of experience where you lay

2320
01:37:31,719 --> 01:37:39,279
down and you just kind of skin touching

2321
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:42,908
the earth right and allowing that

2322
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:45,539
biology to reconnect with your skin you

2323
01:37:42,908 --> 01:37:49,359
know and then it kind of brings you to a

2324
01:37:45,539 --> 01:37:51,310
lot of is that biology touching my skin

2325
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:54,569
gonna be conducive to my health how does

2326
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:57,159
it make up my human microbiome you know

2327
01:37:54,569 --> 01:37:59,289
should I touch a lot of different soils

2328
01:37:57,158 --> 01:38:00,849
like farmers are usually pretty healthy

2329
01:37:59,289 --> 01:38:04,750
they're touching the soil a lot it's

2330
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:06,699
it's it's that that soil microorganisms

2331
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:09,069
touching the skin now what are the

2332
01:38:06,698 --> 01:38:11,289
correct microorganisms for that plant

2333
01:38:09,069 --> 01:38:14,859
that we've decided to put in there that

2334
01:38:11,289 --> 01:38:17,679
wasn't naturally supposed to be in this

2335
01:38:14,859 --> 01:38:19,479
soil so if we think that maybe our

2336
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:21,060
microbes in our microbiome are coming

2337
01:38:19,479 --> 01:38:23,259
from our food they're coming from

2338
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:26,710
touching the earth they're coming from

2339
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:29,380
the air like mycorrhizae does so we're

2340
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:31,090
constantly you know regenerating and

2341
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:32,920
renewing depending on where we're going

2342
01:38:31,090 --> 01:38:36,940
depending on what we're touching the

2343
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:39,960
actual microbes in our own bodies much

2344
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:43,238
less what's conducive to the plant so

2345
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:45,939
excuse me when we start talking a lot

2346
01:38:43,238 --> 01:38:47,649
about what strains are conducive like

2347
01:38:45,939 --> 01:38:50,198
mycorrhizae which again has been around

2348
01:38:47,649 --> 01:38:52,689
so's bacillus subtilis we have to start

2349
01:38:50,198 --> 01:38:55,238
looking at some of the different types

2350
01:38:52,689 --> 01:38:59,138
of acting oh my seed strains that are in

2351
01:38:55,238 --> 01:39:01,809
the soil that are conducive to to oil

2352
01:38:59,139 --> 01:39:04,029
production the raizou bacteria that are

2353
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:06,850
gonna actually colonize and sustain and

2354
01:39:04,029 --> 01:39:10,448
regenerate on that root because here's

2355
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:12,969
the thing compost has approximately 500

2356
01:39:10,448 --> 01:39:15,939
colony forming units per gallon of

2357
01:39:12,969 --> 01:39:18,760
compost tea so if you create anaerobic

2358
01:39:15,939 --> 01:39:20,919
houmous compost that's got clay

2359
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:22,480
aggregates it's insoluble it's it's got

2360
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:24,340
very high nitrate levels and it's

2361
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:30,309
aerobic we produced and you make a

2362
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:32,679
compost tea it's gonna have potentially

2363
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:36,159
500 million colony forming units per

2364
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:38,649
gallon okay so you you you can put a

2365
01:39:36,158 --> 01:39:41,379
million gallons of that in and Nan this

2366
01:39:38,649 --> 01:39:44,469
certainly give that plant the strains

2367
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:46,239
that are gonna regenerate on its in the

2368
01:39:44,469 --> 01:39:49,448
rhizosphere because think about what

2369
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:51,339
compost is its its crop residue it's its

2370
01:39:49,448 --> 01:39:55,569
animal [ __ ] and so you're getting

2371
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:57,610
strains that are coming there they're

2372
01:39:55,569 --> 01:40:00,009
not raizou bacteria they're not strains

2373
01:39:57,609 --> 01:40:02,769
that are reproducing on that root to

2374
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:05,789
really increase that nutrient absorption

2375
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:08,710
for high bricks for high oil production

2376
01:40:05,789 --> 01:40:10,779
okay and so to do to replicate that on

2377
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:13,719
an industrial scale it's very difficult

2378
01:40:10,779 --> 01:40:16,179
you know and it's in a small grow

2379
01:40:13,719 --> 01:40:17,890
operation you get these guys that you

2380
01:40:16,179 --> 01:40:19,420
know like this gentleman you know we're

2381
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:23,170
focusing on the smaller grower we're

2382
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:25,510
trying to put that quality into into our

2383
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:27,429
soil but how are we doing that by

2384
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:30,369
increasing the food sources for the

2385
01:40:27,429 --> 01:40:33,850
microbes by by adding the correct

2386
01:40:30,369 --> 01:40:37,809
amendments and the correct you know crab

2387
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:40,060
meal or you know kelp or whatever you

2388
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:42,820
decide to put into to to get that

2389
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:44,440
biology going again on a large scale

2390
01:40:42,819 --> 01:40:45,908
especially in hemp production like in

2391
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:47,859
Canada where these guys are doing

2392
01:40:45,908 --> 01:40:51,609
strains that are two or three percent

2393
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:54,908
CBD what if those guys can get 6% CBD or

2394
01:40:51,609 --> 01:40:57,839
7% CBD in industrial strains and that's

2395
01:40:54,908 --> 01:41:01,539
possible if we correctly address the

2396
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:03,550
biology on an industrial scale which is

2397
01:41:01,539 --> 01:41:05,350
which is what we've done with soil

2398
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:08,860
balance so that's that's one of the

2399
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:11,230
things that were really focused on is is

2400
01:41:08,859 --> 01:41:12,698
the population so taking strains that

2401
01:41:11,229 --> 01:41:16,419
have naturally co-evolved with the

2402
01:41:12,698 --> 01:41:18,428
cannabis plants in nature or and that

2403
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:19,690
are in any soils that are conducive to

2404
01:41:18,429 --> 01:41:21,609
plant growth but there's soil

2405
01:41:19,689 --> 01:41:24,879
microorganisms and I really feel like

2406
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:25,899
those those soil microorganisms when

2407
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,539
people are starting to talk about

2408
01:41:25,899 --> 01:41:30,369
earthing or actually connecting their

2409
01:41:28,539 --> 01:41:33,279
skin to the earth and sleeping there at

2410
01:41:30,369 --> 01:41:35,109
night and feeling healed by the soil and

2411
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,519
they're you know it's it's this it's

2412
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:40,149
this thing that people are talking about

2413
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:42,100
but but what are those microbes in those

2414
01:41:40,149 --> 01:41:45,099
footing they call it ground grounding

2415
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:47,079
earthing or grounding right - yes that's

2416
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,909
right and you know what that is I don't

2417
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:50,559
know everything about it tell me about

2418
01:41:48,908 --> 01:41:51,619
it man well I don't know what ton about

2419
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,900
it either but I read

2420
01:41:51,619 --> 01:41:55,699
article in this old dude and he got into

2421
01:41:53,899 --> 01:41:57,500
it and he literally like he couldn't

2422
01:41:55,699 --> 01:41:59,630
sleep I think it was like an insomnia

2423
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:01,069
thing and then he got it in his head he

2424
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:02,359
learned about grounding and walking

2425
01:42:01,069 --> 01:42:05,449
around in his bare feet and then he

2426
01:42:02,359 --> 01:42:07,880
grounded his bed he literally grounded

2427
01:42:05,449 --> 01:42:10,250
his bed to the earth and started

2428
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:12,140
sleeping and so there's I'd have to look

2429
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:13,609
it up but it was the first couple of

2430
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:15,650
articles I read were about this

2431
01:42:13,609 --> 01:42:17,389
particular guy who was like he just

2432
01:42:15,649 --> 01:42:20,259
couldn't say enough about it how

2433
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:24,470
important it was to have your bare foot

2434
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:27,289
touching the earth at least biology man

2435
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:34,820
like what we're [ __ ] hand sanitizing

2436
01:42:27,289 --> 01:42:36,680
all day oh my god on tour playing music

2437
01:42:34,819 --> 01:42:38,689
that's exactly what we'd all do we take

2438
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:41,720
our shoes off and try to just find grass

2439
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:43,399
and sand and dirt and get reconnected to

2440
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:45,829
the earth because it was just it through

2441
01:42:43,399 --> 01:42:48,920
you so far off michael franti style he

2442
01:42:45,829 --> 01:42:52,010
just doesn't even put on shoes yeah yeah

2443
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:54,140
if I could walk a mile in your shoes if

2444
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:57,230
you could walk a mile in my bare feet

2445
01:42:54,140 --> 01:43:00,380
that's going to his lines can I jump in

2446
01:42:57,229 --> 01:43:04,369
here for a second I want a story we're

2447
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:06,770
talking about grounding back when I was

2448
01:43:04,369 --> 01:43:10,670
learning how to grow cannabis I was

2449
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:13,160
having to do it indoors and went through

2450
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:16,340
a long steep learning curve about

2451
01:43:13,159 --> 01:43:18,500
everything from how to keep specific

2452
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:22,340
genetics alive and viable over a period

2453
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:25,539
of time to how to grow without having to

2454
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:29,029
go to the store and buy a bunch of stuff

2455
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:31,699
and I felt like I sorted everything out

2456
01:43:29,029 --> 01:43:35,779
pretty thoroughly and was getting pretty

2457
01:43:31,699 --> 01:43:39,829
good results already starting to do some

2458
01:43:35,779 --> 01:43:41,630
consulting in the Bay Area for folk who

2459
01:43:39,829 --> 01:43:46,789
were trying to grow indoors and produce

2460
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:48,800
quality of medicine but I could tell you

2461
01:43:46,789 --> 01:43:50,180
were you asked us to think about our

2462
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:54,409
relationship with the cannabis plant

2463
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:56,720
Marcus and I could tell something was

2464
01:43:54,409 --> 01:43:58,399
missing in the flowering room when I was

2465
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:03,990
in there I could just tell that they

2466
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:06,449
weren't happy and so I was eight

2467
01:44:03,989 --> 01:44:10,920
and was sitting in there with with the

2468
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:13,229
ladies and before going into meditation

2469
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:15,029
I asked him just point-blank I what I

2470
01:44:13,229 --> 01:44:17,429
ran down the whole list of all the needs

2471
01:44:15,029 --> 01:44:19,109
everything from lighting to the right

2472
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:21,690
kind of water to the right kind of soil

2473
01:44:19,109 --> 01:44:23,369
nutrients and microbiology and

2474
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:25,589
everything else that I knew of to make

2475
01:44:23,369 --> 01:44:27,090
it all happy but I could still tell it

2476
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:30,900
was missing something was missing and

2477
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:35,670
and after a few moments I got it I got a

2478
01:44:30,899 --> 01:44:37,199
simple statement we are lonely and I

2479
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:39,810
said what the hell what does that mean

2480
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:42,569
what do you mean lonely and then I

2481
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:46,050
realized that plants evolved in the

2482
01:44:42,569 --> 01:44:48,630
earth they're grounded they're hooked up

2483
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:50,730
to the mother the earth has a natural

2484
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:53,039
frequency of its own seven cycles per

2485
01:44:50,729 --> 01:44:55,889
second it's called ground you'll find it

2486
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:58,710
in every at home that's wired to code

2487
01:44:55,890 --> 01:45:01,860
the vibration of life it's the vibration

2488
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:05,670
of life and these plants were sitting on

2489
01:45:01,859 --> 01:45:07,799
tables in in bags totally disconnected

2490
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:12,090
from the earth and so I did an

2491
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:15,470
experiment I ran a length of romex wire

2492
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:18,930
which is four strands of copper and

2493
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:23,720
hooked four of them up to a water pipe

2494
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:27,210
that was I knew was good to ground and

2495
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:30,600
put the other end of each of those four

2496
01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:32,369
wires into force plants four separate

2497
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:34,079
plants just stripped the length of bare

2498
01:45:32,369 --> 01:45:38,000
wire and stuck it right into the root

2499
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:42,059
zone and had three other plants that

2500
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:45,390
were the same exact plant same exact

2501
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:48,510
conditions same everything I could do to

2502
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:52,460
make a verifiable control for the

2503
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:54,810
experiment and within a week just like

2504
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:57,720
somebody was saying earlier they put

2505
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:59,100
some microbiology in their room and saw

2506
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:01,530
a difference in a week I saw a

2507
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:03,500
difference in a week the plants were

2508
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:07,979
half again bigger than their sisters

2509
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:10,020
after a week and just to take the story

2510
01:46:07,979 --> 01:46:13,859
to the end right around the time they

2511
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:16,860
were finishing a a crew from High Times

2512
01:46:13,859 --> 01:46:19,198
was visiting the room and

2513
01:46:16,859 --> 01:46:21,328
they commented on what the heck's up

2514
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:22,948
with these four plants that stick out so

2515
01:46:21,328 --> 01:46:25,319
much from the rest of them in the room

2516
01:46:22,948 --> 01:46:28,768
and I pointed out the grounding thing

2517
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:30,868
and all of that long story short what

2518
01:46:28,769 --> 01:46:32,670
was really beautiful about it is and

2519
01:46:30,868 --> 01:46:36,630
part of why I have to tell the story is

2520
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:39,118
those four plants were the reason that

2521
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:42,538
this the cultivar known as Harlequin got

2522
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:45,058
its name because those four plants were

2523
01:46:42,538 --> 01:46:50,038
all kinds of different colors in a sea

2524
01:46:45,059 --> 01:46:51,269
of green plants that the seven plants

2525
01:46:50,038 --> 01:46:53,788
that eventually became known as

2526
01:46:51,269 --> 01:46:56,039
Harlequin were bigger than the other

2527
01:46:53,788 --> 01:46:59,698
eighty some plants that were in the room

2528
01:46:56,038 --> 01:47:02,309
but four of those seven had this insane

2529
01:46:59,698 --> 01:47:06,388
array of colors and that's where the

2530
01:47:02,309 --> 01:47:08,958
name Harlequin came to be and grounding

2531
01:47:06,389 --> 01:47:11,609
we are talking about grounding people

2532
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:13,408
grounding plants that's part of why I

2533
01:47:11,609 --> 01:47:15,988
think the regenerative agriculture thing

2534
01:47:13,408 --> 01:47:20,299
is so beautiful

2535
01:47:15,988 --> 01:47:23,899
as I try and practice what Joshua's

2536
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:27,360
workshop is about is finding that

2537
01:47:23,899 --> 01:47:30,569
microbiology and on your soil they on

2538
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,549
your land where you are because where

2539
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:35,158
nature is flourishing where you live

2540
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:37,529
that's where that microbiology is

2541
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:41,129
flourishing on soil that you have where

2542
01:47:37,529 --> 01:47:43,139
you live and so and a lot of that what I

2543
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:46,559
love about this whole line of thought is

2544
01:47:43,139 --> 01:47:49,498
that is the idea that can--it the

2545
01:47:46,559 --> 01:47:52,889
cannabis plant if we will listen and if

2546
01:47:49,498 --> 01:47:55,728
we will look it will tell us how to take

2547
01:47:52,889 --> 01:47:59,939
care of the earth that we live upon and

2548
01:47:55,729 --> 01:48:01,739
maybe eventually when farmers start

2549
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:05,369
seeing so much success with these

2550
01:48:01,738 --> 01:48:07,319
practices traditional agriculture will

2551
01:48:05,368 --> 01:48:09,268
start exploring what might be available

2552
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:11,748
there because one of the things that

2553
01:48:09,269 --> 01:48:15,659
kind of rocked my boat a little bit is

2554
01:48:11,748 --> 01:48:20,090
glyphosate I saw a study was done

2555
01:48:15,658 --> 01:48:22,469
checking alcohol alcoholic beverages

2556
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:25,708
that are available for sale they did

2557
01:48:22,469 --> 01:48:27,510
like 15 different beers and six

2558
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:29,969
different wines

2559
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:32,219
and all but one of them and several of

2560
01:48:29,969 --> 01:48:35,698
these were organic quote unquote wines

2561
01:48:32,219 --> 01:48:38,420
and beers all but one of them had

2562
01:48:35,698 --> 01:48:41,399
significant levels of glyphosate in them

2563
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:43,078
so and cannabis you can't sell cannabis

2564
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:44,819
in the California market place it's got

2565
01:48:43,078 --> 01:48:46,229
glyphosate in it so maybe cannabis is

2566
01:48:44,819 --> 01:48:48,808
going to lead us all towards a cleaner

2567
01:48:46,229 --> 01:48:53,279
life and a cleaner planet right and a

2568
01:48:48,809 --> 01:48:54,929
healing a healing yeah I'm so glad it

2569
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:56,429
also talked to you about that in here

2570
01:48:54,929 --> 01:48:58,889
and hear that story thank you so much

2571
01:48:56,429 --> 01:49:01,649
for sharing that with us and with

2572
01:48:58,889 --> 01:49:04,109
regards to the the connection the

2573
01:49:01,649 --> 01:49:07,939
energetic connection that you put with

2574
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:09,988
that copper wiring right which is so so

2575
01:49:07,939 --> 01:49:12,149
important when you're looking at the

2576
01:49:09,988 --> 01:49:14,158
different layers of true you know

2577
01:49:12,149 --> 01:49:16,469
sustainable regenerative AG to

2578
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,569
understand not only the the energetic

2579
01:49:16,469 --> 01:49:21,868
layers but the the physical layers that

2580
01:49:18,569 --> 01:49:24,899
were working with those dynamics and so

2581
01:49:21,868 --> 01:49:26,880
just as a paradigm shift that's that's

2582
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:30,000
happening right now there's so much

2583
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:32,400
thought and an avulsion on the

2584
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,729
energetics behind the cultivation right

2585
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:37,799
and and that is is really what what

2586
01:49:35,729 --> 01:49:40,488
people you know geomagnetic flux lines

2587
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:43,409
the dipoles the way that the the earth

2588
01:49:40,488 --> 01:49:45,988
energy works with all the different

2589
01:49:43,408 --> 01:49:51,299
dimensions but then but then going back

2590
01:49:45,988 --> 01:49:53,609
to the actual vitality of that plant you

2591
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:56,730
know part of it is is is that energetic

2592
01:49:53,609 --> 01:49:59,460
but but but the vitality in humans also

2593
01:49:56,729 --> 01:50:05,069
is our microbiome you know when we look

2594
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:07,349
at the the the different enzymes and

2595
01:50:05,069 --> 01:50:09,389
hormones and acids and chemicals that

2596
01:50:07,349 --> 01:50:12,029
our own microbiome is producing in our

2597
01:50:09,389 --> 01:50:15,260
body to keep us healthy to keep us

2598
01:50:12,029 --> 01:50:20,788
mentally intact to increase our own

2599
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:23,880
alkalinity pH right to order higher

2600
01:50:20,788 --> 01:50:27,238
function cells in a human body

2601
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,618
then there are human cells more microbes

2602
01:50:27,238 --> 01:50:31,678
right that's right yeah there's more

2603
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:34,229
microbes but in the human is actually a

2604
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:36,630
super organism that's you know

2605
01:50:34,229 --> 01:50:39,118
essentially an ecosystem of hundreds of

2606
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:40,980
different types of organisms and so a

2607
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:43,710
lot of what we're seeing

2608
01:50:40,979 --> 01:50:46,829
getting caused by current medical

2609
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:48,899
tradition is you know over prescription

2610
01:50:46,829 --> 01:50:53,579
of antibiotics would wipe out you know a

2611
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:56,129
broad spectrum of beneficial bacteria as

2612
01:50:53,579 --> 01:50:57,390
well as the bad bacteria which obviously

2613
01:50:56,130 --> 01:50:59,850
we want to get rid of the bad bacteria

2614
01:50:57,390 --> 01:51:03,150
but we'd prefer to out-compete the bad

2615
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:05,220
bacteria so anytime people take

2616
01:51:03,149 --> 01:51:07,279
antibiotics they don't have to follow

2617
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:09,420
that up with a rien oculi ssin of

2618
01:51:07,279 --> 01:51:11,488
probiotics that are going to be able to

2619
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:13,680
re-establish that beneficial symbiosis

2620
01:51:11,488 --> 01:51:18,509
semiotic relationship within the human

2621
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:20,670
body yeah you're sure the same things

2622
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:22,320
happens with humans same thing happens

2623
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:24,319
with plants and the better better that

2624
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:26,880
we can treat that as a biodynamic

2625
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:29,039
ecosystem the better you'll end up

2626
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:31,789
saying you know not only your cannabis

2627
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:33,869
plants flourish but you know eating your

2628
01:51:31,789 --> 01:51:37,590
berries diff you have berries on your

2629
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:39,539
farm or fruits or trees growing them

2630
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:43,050
organically symbiotically with cannabis

2631
01:51:39,539 --> 01:51:44,789
and cannabis will the cannabis terpenes

2632
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:47,159
as they evaporate off the cannabis will

2633
01:51:44,789 --> 01:51:49,800
provide anti insecticidal properties to

2634
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:53,519
the crops around it and there's a

2635
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:56,369
symbiotic relationship in an exchange so

2636
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:58,560
I think it's going to I hope and I'm

2637
01:51:56,369 --> 01:52:03,149
seeing it a bit I'm seeing new ops

2638
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:06,180
farmers and apple farmers and even wheat

2639
01:52:03,149 --> 01:52:08,460
farmers rotating into their crops

2640
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:10,530
because they think they they can get

2641
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:14,430
more money growing industrial hemp than

2642
01:52:10,529 --> 01:52:16,019
they can't growing wheat or corn and if

2643
01:52:14,430 --> 01:52:18,869
they can grow it without having to use

2644
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:21,000
the pesticide just in even in a rotation

2645
01:52:18,869 --> 01:52:22,769
where they can do a cover crop and then

2646
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,199
hemp for high value and then follow it

2647
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:27,450
up with the lower value crop and you can

2648
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:29,760
get multiple years and then instead of

2649
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:34,019
having to apply pesticides and

2650
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:36,239
fungicides and nutrients doing cover

2651
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:40,890
crops and and inoculating the cover

2652
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:42,359
crops with bacteria so it's hopefully we

2653
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:44,670
will see some positive change and I

2654
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:47,819
think that that's that's going to be the

2655
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:50,489
way that we can we can certainly

2656
01:52:47,819 --> 01:52:53,429
integrate into the existing systems of

2657
01:52:50,488 --> 01:52:54,568
Agriculture but be able to be the seed

2658
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:57,168
be the tree

2659
01:52:54,569 --> 01:52:59,489
within the rock of the foundation of

2660
01:52:57,168 --> 01:53:03,599
capitalism that allows it to grow into

2661
01:52:59,488 --> 01:53:07,068
something better we want to we want us

2662
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:09,328
our companies to go public and go into

2663
01:53:07,069 --> 01:53:10,909
international markets but at the same

2664
01:53:09,328 --> 01:53:13,798
time we want to do that sustainably

2665
01:53:10,908 --> 01:53:17,038
otherwise other people will do it more

2666
01:53:13,798 --> 01:53:19,048
efficiently so being able promote

2667
01:53:17,038 --> 01:53:22,349
sustainable agriculture and swell is

2668
01:53:19,048 --> 01:53:24,479
sustainable production efficient

2669
01:53:22,349 --> 01:53:26,399
production and then zero zero waste

2670
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:29,039
production where every part of the plant

2671
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:32,429
gets used is gonna really be able to

2672
01:53:29,038 --> 01:53:34,108
provide not only the farmers more more

2673
01:53:32,429 --> 01:53:36,359
economic means than they're seeing in

2674
01:53:34,109 --> 01:53:39,659
traditional or current agricultural

2675
01:53:36,359 --> 01:53:41,399
markets but a way more benefit to the

2676
01:53:39,658 --> 01:53:44,698
soil to the ecosystem and hopefully to

2677
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:52,679
the consumers well sad men really well

2678
01:53:44,698 --> 01:53:55,768
said awesome thank you guys so much for

2679
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:57,658
making the time and being passionate and

2680
01:53:55,769 --> 01:54:01,139
intelligent and being able to articulate

2681
01:53:57,658 --> 01:54:03,418
I I really enjoyed today's show it was

2682
01:54:01,139 --> 01:54:06,359
only a couple hours but it was good it

2683
01:54:03,418 --> 01:54:09,389
got I love the soil information I love

2684
01:54:06,359 --> 01:54:11,338
the microbiology I love the conversation

2685
01:54:09,389 --> 01:54:13,949
in general it's just an important

2686
01:54:11,338 --> 01:54:15,809
conversation and I don't think I

2687
01:54:13,948 --> 01:54:18,118
realized how important the conversations

2688
01:54:15,809 --> 01:54:19,529
that we had on here were when I was so

2689
01:54:18,118 --> 01:54:21,448
in it I was just trying to make it

2690
01:54:19,529 --> 01:54:23,938
happen but as I stepped back and I

2691
01:54:21,448 --> 01:54:26,038
looked at it and I watched it and I

2692
01:54:23,939 --> 01:54:28,409
didn't engage in it and I just let it

2693
01:54:26,038 --> 01:54:29,878
kind of dissipate I realized that this

2694
01:54:28,408 --> 01:54:31,168
is a missed conversation these

2695
01:54:29,878 --> 01:54:33,599
conversations although they are

2696
01:54:31,168 --> 01:54:36,748
happening pasturage is a really really

2697
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:39,059
good way to hit seven to 10,000 people

2698
01:54:36,748 --> 01:54:40,588
every week those are good numbers that's

2699
01:54:39,059 --> 01:54:42,628
a good amount of people for us to share

2700
01:54:40,588 --> 01:54:44,399
this conversation with and obviously

2701
01:54:42,628 --> 01:54:46,318
what Josh was doing with the

2702
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:48,209
conference's is super important to face

2703
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:50,879
to face and the seed swaps and all of

2704
01:54:48,208 --> 01:54:52,438
that is super key but we're a part of it

2705
01:54:50,878 --> 01:54:55,889
too here on hash church so I want to

2721
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:31,230
regenerative and so thank you dude and

pleasure hiring we're looking to hire

2733
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,140
hash makers Oh

2734
01:56:04,369 --> 01:56:09,420
where did they send it you could
