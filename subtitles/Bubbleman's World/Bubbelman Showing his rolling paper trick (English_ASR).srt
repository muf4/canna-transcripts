1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:05,099
hey how's it going there from fresh

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,089
penny is limited and the creators of

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:11,968
bubble bags we're here today to show you

4
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:13,289
what we do with rolling papers a lot of

5
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,350
you out there know that I smoke only

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:19,528
hash I haven't smoked herb cannabis for

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,029
over ten years close to 12 but because

8
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:23,399
I'm the distributor for the hoodlum

9
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:26,460
jackets they come with a rolling paper

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,899
insert I've got a pack right here if the

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,308
Raw's that i pulled out in one of my

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,269
jackets it's a nice raw organic the

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,879
natural way to roll

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,359
I personally don't smoke paper or glue

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,579
but what I do do with rolling papers is

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,219
I have a little little trick that I sort

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,049
of learned many many years ago you just

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,670
take a normal sized rolling paper this

19
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,169
is a king size but it should work as

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,989
well and you fold up the bottom edge

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,059
just above the amount that would be glue

22
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,320
on the top edge so that's folded up and

23
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,390
then we bend it down just to put a

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,039
crease in it we're gonna do the same

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,260
thing with the top of the glue we're

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,629
gonna bend that down and put a crease in

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,359
it and then we're gonna do the same

28
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,609
thing to the edges about the same amount

29
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,989
you know the amount of glue that's on

30
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,060
there or whatever that is a quarter of

31
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,188
an inch or something so we make that

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,780
nice and good use your nails to really

33
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:26,039
make the crease stick all right do the

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,530
other last corner here okay this one

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,990
looks pretty good I usually like to just

36
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:38,609
twist up the two corners kind of just

37
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:39,658
triangulate them there all right so this

38
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:41,849
one looks pretty good

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,090
what we do is we hold the middle of it

40
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:49,978
on our finger and we spin the rolling

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:53,070
paper spin for me spin for me it's a

42
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:55,609
little bit too creased there okay there

43
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,218
we go now we're spinning

44
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:00,560
now our spinning

45
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,599
see if I can get it on camera for you

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,329
because it really does look pretty cool

47
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,889
when you make it work

48
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:14,449
and you can easily do this at home all

49
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:18,949
right here we go spin coming back around

50
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:23,149
spin so that's the rolling paper trick

51
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:26,509
and well I've got you here I've got some

52
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,549
really nice bubble shatter this has been

53
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:31,370
curing for about five years in my bubble

54
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:34,010
box here and it is absolutely shattered

55
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:38,329
right up let me just pull out a tiny

56
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:41,139
little bit of three screens set to throw

57
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:43,939
on top I've already got some nice

58
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:46,068
shattered loaded on there it's just

59
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:50,269
obsidian block I wish you guys can see

60
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:52,159
it from where you're at I'm smoking with

67
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:10,900
years ago when I went to Germany with
