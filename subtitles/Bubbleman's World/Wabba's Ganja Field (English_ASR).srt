170
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,360
beautiful Hilltop um Mountainside ganja

171
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,718
field w who is our host has been growing

172
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
for the last 20 plus years and

173
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,839
immediately upon pulling into the field

174
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,399
I saw some really beautiful genetics um

175
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,560
kaix stacked on top of kaix very nice

176
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,360
bud structure covered in glandular

177
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,199
Tricom growth and of course coming into

178
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,080
the area the smell was just absolutely

179
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,759
incredible I'm just sitting under a

180
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,160
beautiful mango tree right now so I can

181
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,679
be in the shade and uh yeah we got a

182
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,759
couple of nice German Shepherds with us

183
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,399
here in the field and we'll probably end

184
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,600
up going over to talk to Waba at one

185
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,559
point in time ask him a couple of

186
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,159
questions how long he's been into the

187
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,239
you know growing here in Orange Hill and

188
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,919
how he discovered uh the good strains

189
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,120
that he's finally got here cuz he really

190
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,599
has definitely chosen these strains

191
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,480
they're a little bit different from what

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,839
I see everywhere and you can see behind

193
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,519
me it's uh it's a quite a nice little

194
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,959
quite a nice little field here goes over

195
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,679
to the left as

196
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:31,639
well all the way to the end and then

197
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:34,679
he's also got the next door field under

198
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,039
these two trees all plotted out it's got

199
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,120
I don't know if that's like a quarter

200
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,679
acre or something or an eth of an acre

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,360
but uh the property still goes back this

202
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,879
what is this like two acres this whole

203
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,320
thing yeah the whole the whole proper AC

204
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:53,360
all right what do you think just in the

205
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:58,120
flat area here an AC about an acre eh

206
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,120
cool beautiful so much can be done on an

207
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,920
acre I want to pull this whole place

208
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,919
next here man everything so what do you

209
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,559
think if this full place was you know

210
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,039
this whole acre was full what kind of

211
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,838
yield do you think you would be able to

212
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,199
pull

213
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,959
out well if we pull this right now in

214
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,800
this springtime when the plants get up

215
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:22,919
to 5 we're looking like 7 800

216

man I mean I'm really amazed at the

223
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,159
resin content on these plants man

224
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,720
they're just looking if you should come

225
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,000
back here two more weeks from now you

226
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,959
would see something different they would

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,120
be shining man yeah of course they're

228
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,078
going to develop more you know they're

229
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,639
just start making their buds now you

230
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,838
know I know this train I love it how

231
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,799
long youve been growing this particular

232
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,399
one

233
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,039
oh for five five years now five years

234
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,600
you acquired it just through different

235
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,799
people bag seed tourists Jamaicans no

236
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,399
man shoe seeds this one of my bre had

237
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,159
this first and then I I get it and I

238
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,679
crossed it with with that with that that

239
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,360
skunk that I had first beautiful was

240
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,359
originally a

241
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,120
blueberry so that's what give it that

242
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,278
sweet smell that fragrance you can stand

243

a distant mhm but it's a nice tasty and

244
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,000
flavor weed man when you smoke this weed

245

man it's really tasty very very

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,078
tasty I can't imagine it not being the

247
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,639
resin content looks really nice for the

248
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:37,719
level of budding that it's in right now

249
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,200
just look at my fingers from just

250
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,000
touching you see how shiny they are

251
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,959
sticky yep yeah man that's awesome and

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,200

be awesome man beautiful so what about

255
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,799

00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,439
are you adding like guos are you adding

257
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,278
any no what we do here now is just

258
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,000
chicken [ __ ] we couldn't get chicken

259
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,200

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,159
y yeah just what we do cuz the soil is

261
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,759
Rich already it's very rich soil yeah

262
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,958
man we just needed the um we just needed

263
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,879
that nitrogen that the chicken she

264
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,838
produces you know

265
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:23,120
yeah then more green leaves and nice fat

266
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:25,839
buds but this is definitely organic

267
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,440
one definitely organic you know yeah you

268
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,440
can Vibe with it right away and one of

269
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,000
the things how I know as well is that

270
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,680
you know generally when I'm in a ganja

271
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,159
field the Jamaicans aren't very good at

272
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,120
hiding the chemicals that they used so

273
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,639
they'll have the the the and the cans

274
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,440
just sitting on the field you can tell

275
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:47,720
this is a really clean clean environment

276
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
nice and then you're vegging right here

277
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,560
yeah boom these are coming up this is a

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,919
different strain though okay this one

279
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,439
right from this section this is a a part

280
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,639
of a sativa I just got it and trying it

281
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,079
you know it's not I don't know what it's

282
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,959
going to look like

283
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:06,359
my friend get this from a

284
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:09,359
sativa sativ the struct is tall

285
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,000
stretching nice yeah it's a sativa so

286
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,399
you know the sativa is always so this

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,679
whole SE the original bush bush weed you

288
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,480
look at the size of the tree plants

289
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,439
already going down there yeah exactly

290
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,000
they're stretched yeah man if you put

291
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,480
this like in June now these will go to 6

292
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
ft so yeah tell me about the the the

293
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,519
growth season here in Jamaica you have

294
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,879
two right now we we have um from

295
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:35,159
November to April that's when we get

296
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:37,360
them fast they will not go over 2 months

297
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,000
but as soon as April pass you will they

298
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,240
will go 3 months because the days are

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,759
longer we get two more hours 1 14 hours

300
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,000
of light yeah so so it brings those

301
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,519
plants more bigger you know yeah puts

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,440
them in veg doesn't force them into

303
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,480
flowering right away we do we only

304
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,240
instead of having five or six we try to

305
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,959
have only three plants cuz in June this

306
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,600
plant would be more than 5 ft wide so

307
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,638
it' be covering all this area mhm like a

308
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,320
meter square or something it's going to

309
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,839
take 3 months instead of 2 months you

310
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
know just that little extra 2 Hour 2 and

311
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,959
a half hours of ligh and change the

312
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,359
whole plant you know yeah yeah

327
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,959
I wish there was and there close to the

328
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,838
eight weeks and then you would see the

329
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,078
heel they would see the size of the buds

330
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,560

[Music]

450
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:44,759
what I could never do it that long yeah

451
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,520
I one of the this is a very good flavor

452
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,158
I can you can taste it in the back of

453
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:53,158
your mouth taste it and we didn't even

454
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:56,080
do the TP dip okay if we did the TP dip

455
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,760
it's even crazier man this is awesome

456
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,720
this is even more healthy to smoke

457
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,079
though I think this is definitely the

458
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,600
way a lot of people that are going to

459
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,319
have a problem with us smoking joints

460
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,678
and the burning aspect you know the

461
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,240
community of people here in Jamaica

462
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,759
they're like okay well we can have this

463
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,159
cannabis but I don't know about the

464
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,839
joints I think they'll be more accepting

465
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,480
of this even though it looks pretty

466
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,399
crazy it really is just a steam pipe

467
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,798
true you know and a steam pipe's just as

468
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,320
crazy you got to have bamboo you got to

469
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:22,480
have wax you got to have the little pan

470
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,079
you got to have the nail to punch the

471
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,759
holes you got to get the coconut I have

472
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,439
one don't dare you got to get the tongs

473
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,240
made like it's it's just as much stuff

474
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,840
yeah so that's true it's the same flavor

475
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,400
as the as as a bamboo smell that

476
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,079
one yeah man what kind of weed is this

477

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,240
you hit five or six of them oh you

509

510
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,720
one little dab you took I thought I feel

511
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,440
it definitely now wouldn't you say too

512
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,440
that that's the kind of like inspiration

513
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,558
that you could take right before work

514
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,320
you do a dab it will calm you down man

515
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:11,079
and just give you that

516
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:13,798
amazing power of thinking concentration

517
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,278
yeah yeah without wider concentration no

518
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:16,798
everything is just behind you just focus

519
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:19,119
on what you want to get done exactly

520
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,519
shut the world off focus on the herb and

521
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:25,239
then it's also that the whole vibe that

522
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,720
is upon you from smoking the dab comes

523
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,079
from the herb so it's this real sort of

524
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,079
