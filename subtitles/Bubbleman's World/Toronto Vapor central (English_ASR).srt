73
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,318
suspecting for yourself and for some

74
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,319
others as well yes excellent got some

75
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,238
patience and whatnot you're working with

76
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:32,318
oh yes six people

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,680
how long you been taking care of them

78
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,759
it's been about 2 years now and the

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,519
majority of

80
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:42,679
prefer

81
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:47,200
to way to go most of the people have

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:50,159
anxiety majority of it is and I do

83
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,878
I sativas isn't it interesting that

84
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,438
people that have anxieties would love

85
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:56,039
sativas people that don't have anxieties

86
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,680
often are like I don't really want to

87
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,318
hit that to but it kind of gives me an

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,920
anxiety attack but it's like the anxiety

89
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:06,759
cancels out the

90
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:10,199
anxiety I'm in the same boat I love

91
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,919
sativas for you not too many people grow

92
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,039
sativas by choice it's true especially

93
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,680
16 and 18 and 20 and 22 week flowering

94
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,519
sativas exactly uh it it goes against

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,720
the prohibition based mentality of how

96
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,959
much can I get and how fast can I get it

97
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,360
absolutely it's some Dr Ginman just

98
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:32,038
recently wow yeah that just went forever

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,240

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,400
produc just C but is fantastic C but I

102
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,240
mean really what we are doing is trome

103
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,679

pizza not the

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,478
Box the box would be more fancy if we

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,240

107
00:04:53,478 --> 00:05:00,800

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,240
good so this is a dry sift as opposed to

185
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,720
the first one which was a wet wash I

186
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,799
find it interesting sometimes when I'm

187
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,879
smoking a water hash with people and

188
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,958
they might claim that oh it has a bit of

189
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,879
a bite to it or something maybe they can

190
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,000
taste the water and that's when I like

191
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:09,159
to say oh actually that one was dry was

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,159
the dry it was never exposed

193
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:14,320
