[Music]

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,160
hey guys welcome back to Bubble Man's

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:29,038
World um today we're going to go over

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,800
part two of cleaning that sift not sure

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,320
if you remembered I cleaned this guy out

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,480
a little bit the other day it was really

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:41,200
really nasty it was uh covered in this

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:44,000
stuff here not sure what exactly this is

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,320
but it's not hash it looks quite a bit

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,558
like what you would pull out of a carpet

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,520
with one of those carpet rakes from the

12
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:55,718
70s but uh yeah

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,399
so this is not really sift that I would

14
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,320
normally clean but because I did part

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,600
one I wanted to share part two with you

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,920
guys so

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,159
I've got my screen set up and I've got

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,200
my cards for carding I've got my little

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,640
brush for brushing away the resin once

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,040
I've carded and cleaned it there's

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,359
usually a little bit left over on the

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,840
screen that I need to get away and it

23
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,560
doesn't really card up you need to

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,680
actually have the brush to to clean it

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
off you can use your uh wind you can

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,600
literally blow on it and it'll it'll

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,719
clear the screen as well so I've got a

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,919
little bit of resin in here you've seen

29
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,200
this before where I give it a little

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,439
shake and it falls little rain little

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
rain

32
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,559
so we'll just get a little bit there

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,078
I've got a variety of cards I've got a

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,719
couple of uh um paper cards that are

35
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,118
obviously a lot less uh sturdy and

36
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,239
strong than uh like a hotel entrance

37
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,759
card grabb this one out of Toronto the

38
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,478
last time we were there um so this is a

39
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,879
quite a strong plastic card and it's the

40
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,078
one that I'm going to choose to use

41
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,158
today so basically this is the thing to

42
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,639
watch this is the process and because

43
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,359
it's such a slow process

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,399
it's it's hard for people to figure out

45
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,878
how to do

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,199
it you know you want to push this

47
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,000
resin through the screen and it's

48
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,119
actually going quite

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,239
nice because there's such a small amount

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,120
of heads uh most of the contaminant will

51
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,759
of course push through the

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,680
screen and this is slow work you know

53
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,840
not not the slowest slowest work but

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,280
it's definitely fairly slow work work

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,598
what I like to do is I like to create a

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,479
pile get it all into a pile so it's

57
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:44,359
together and then I like to card it nice

58
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:48,079
and slow and hard over the screen

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,800
keeping sure that you clean the card

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,480
always this is once again lowquality

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,680
resin so it's not coming up on me I'm

62
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,679
not worried about that but say this was

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,080
Mass from the great Gardener uh that

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,719
barb is a very very tricky resin and

65
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,319
you've got to be very careful when you

66
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,280
card it in fact I could almost guarantee

67
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:08,079
that I would not be able to card the

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,519
Barb in this temperature right now uh I

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,799
usually have to go and do it in a in a

70
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,599
colder environment so you can see I've

71
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,560
carted quite a bit of that resin through

72
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,479
the screen just even in the couple of

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,039
minutes that I've been talking here and

74
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,359
that's because there's very few heads in

75
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,560
this

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,560
material

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
so we just add a little bit

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
more

79
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,280
all right and this is the slow process

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,560
this is the slow process of taking that

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
resin you can see I got a nice little

82
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,959
pile

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,158
here

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,598
right a nice little pile of

85
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,519
resin and in about 5 minutes of cing

86
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,598
I'll turn that nice little pile of resin

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,200
actually let me move that for you so the

88
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,560
light's shining down on it you see it a

89
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,158
little better without the

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,640
shadow move that shadow out

91
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:04,719
too all right give give a nice better

92
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:07,318
view of the screen so people often ask

93
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:12,000
do I need the big screen what I say to

94
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:14,318
them is the more surface area the better

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
you see how with just that tiny little

96
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,478
bit of resin I just covered a huge chunk

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,680
of the screen so this isn't an

98
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,159
impossible uh you don't need the the the

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,439
the tiniest piece of screen to do your

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,080
work it's nice to have room and that's

101
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,439
why often people think that these

102
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:35,519
screens are only uh for an industrial or

103
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:38,120
a huge grower not so if you have three

104
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,519
or four grams of dry SI to clean you can

105
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,840
do it over these screens quite

106
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:48,038
efficiently all right so you can see we

107
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:50,319
got some hairs in here a little bit of

108
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,959
contamination sometimes you'll also uh

109
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,360
realize as you're working that there's

110
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,159
parts of the screen that will stay

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,840
cleaner than other parts of the screen

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
and what I mean by that is generally we

113
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,239
work in the middle of the Stream so

114
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,000
you're going to have the majority of

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,639
your resin is going to get trapped in

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,918
this section of screen sometimes when

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm carting and I'm finding that it's

118
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:12,198
not really um

119
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,239
picking keeping the heads on top it's

120
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,360
not really pushing everything through

121
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,680
it's keeping everything on top I'll take

122
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,639
everything over to the corner and I'll

123
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,079
get into this sort of you can hear how

124
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,240
it's a different

125
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,639
sound that's because these corners of

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,680
the screens are notoriously much cleaner

127
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,319
than the center because I'm always is

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,319
working on the

129
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,319
center now if your resin isn't super

130
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,038
super

131
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,120
sticky you'll be able to card it much

132
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:45,159
the way I'm doing right now now if

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,439
you're dealing with some extremely

134
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,600
high-end

135
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,680
resin you're going to cause yourself

136
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,199
problems first of all you got to card

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,959
softer one of the things to look for and

138
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,919
this is a really important tip while

139
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:02,839
you're carding if you can see right now

140
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:05,198
I have a nice nice clean um resin bed

141
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,758
I've laid down on top of the screen it

142
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,038
allows me to find my

143
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,080
contaminant much easier by bringing it

144
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:17,439
to the surface like these little

145
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:21,000
hairs and it also allows me to look for

146
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:23,759
grooves now when you're carting as the

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,839
resin uh heats up it's going to want to

148
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,680
melt to your card and it creates these

149
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,758
little balls of resin and those little

150
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,038
balls of resin will create create little

151
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,560
Pathways in your resin as you're cing if

152
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:40,360
you're cing and you don't see these

153
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,839
smooth lines but you see instead

154
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,560
Pathways in them almost like little

155
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,918
roadways you need to lift up your card

156
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,519
and you need to clean it with your

157
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,038
fingers and those bits that you clean

158
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,240
need to go into the corner you do not

159
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,240
want those bits going back into your

160
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,840
resin it will make it literally

161
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,598
impossible to clean the rest of the

162
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,799
resin so keep that from happening keep

163
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,800
your card

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,160
clean and uh yeah I mean really I've got

165
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,079
a good I bet you I'll have another hour

166
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
before I push all this [ __ ] through this

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,240
screen so I'm not going to record the

168
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,279
whole thing but I'll come back uh here

169
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,360
and there as I'm getting down on the bag

170
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,239
and uh getting the resin piles a little

171
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
bit higher I do have um a pile of just

172
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,560
pure heads well it's probably not just

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,079
pure heads but it's pure as it's going

174
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,038
to be with this particular stuff and

175
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,038
I'll macro that for you guys just

176
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,918
dropped a little pile of it as you can

177
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:37,079
see I'm hugely worried about it um so

178
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,680
yeah we'll end up with the heads on top

179
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,359
we'll end up with some swaggle

180
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,319
underneath and I'll come back and I'll

181
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,520
show you guys uh the piles and I'll show

182
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,039
you maybe another little clip or two of

183
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:51,719
just this process of caring and if you

184
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:54,120
guys have any questions please ask me so

185
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,280
I can you know I want this to be as

186
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:01,478
simple as possible you need to apply

187
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,638
pressure different L depending on the

188
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,399
resin it's much like water hash when

189
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,840
you're wicking out moisture at the end

190
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,038
right before you're getting ready to se

191
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,399
or microplane those are the subtle

192
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,800
nuances that give people difficulties

193
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,359
those are the things that make people

194
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,478
want to ask questions how do I do this

195
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,720
how do I do that they're the

196
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,680
unknowns because they change Always you

197
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,280
can try to be ready for them but you

198
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
just never know it's based on the

199
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,839
quality of your resin and once you

200
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,759
purify resin depending on its quality

201
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,478
it's going to act a little bit

202
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,719
differently so I think I've given you

203
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,080
most of what I need to tell you today

204
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm going to continue on here and carve

205
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,959
this

206
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:46,639
resin and uh yeah you can see already if

207
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,039
you guys want to have a quick little

208
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,080
Gander that I've

209
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,079
already pushed quite a bit through you

210
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,600
see the

211
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,200
pile let me do the one arm here um you

212
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,720
can see the pile H right here so it's an

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,079
enormous amount of of contaminant that's

214
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,720
uh that's in this material like I said

215
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:10,599
maybe

216
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,240
90% it's got nasty hairs on it it's you

217
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,000
know I'm sure someone somewhere thinks

218
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,480
this is great but

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,759
uh I assure you it's not so we'll get to

220
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,399
uh we'll get to cleaning uh a lot more

221
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,919
of this powder out I've already been at

222
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:31,120
it for quite quite a while and uh I'm

223
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,120
going to be at it for quite a while more

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,240
so get that back on

225
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,200
[Music]

226
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,000
there well thanks for watching Bubble

227
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,759
man's world and we are going to be back

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,720
in a little bit here just going to do a

229
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,838
little bit more cleaning come back and

230
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,320
show you what I've done take some macro

231
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,839
photos and we'll be done part two sorry

232
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
it wasn't a higher grade resin but you

233
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
know what I'm thinking I'm showing

234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
everyone the highest grade resins and

235
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,320
the cleanest that you can get them and

236
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,159
I'm thinking that we need to start a

237
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,720
little bit more at the foundation at the

238
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,078
base of of the audience of everyone cuz

239
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,240
we don't all start with the best

240
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,599
material so why not go over something

241
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,680
that's a little bit less than uh you

242
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,639
know awesome and uh show how we can get

243
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,199
it a little closer to something

244
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,879
something really nice worst case

245
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,519
scenario once I've cleaned this out if

246
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,480
it's still unsm smokable and has a

247
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,600
terrible taste um we'll do a coconut oil

248
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,079
extraction and we'll get that resin

249
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,759
we'll get those cannaboids into a system

250
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:30,599
and we'll make them we'll make them

251
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:33,480
worthwhile so right on

252
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,560
hey guys welcome back I have got my

253
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,839
clean

254
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,559
piles I don't want to turn them too much

255
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,279
but basically this guy right here in the

256
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,039
corner he's the sort of almost the

257
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:45,958
darker one but that one is the

258
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,879
first right here is the first this is

259
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,199
the second piled into one

260
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,919
pile

261
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,839
and last but certainly not least often

262
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,879
you'll have a little bit of resin on

263
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,040
your screen still so rather than lose

264
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,679
that that

265
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,679
just brush it

266
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,919
off very good idea to clean your

267
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,560
screens I'll also take this one outside

268
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:16,159
and I'll bang It On The Ground that'll

269
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,638
loosen anything that's sort of stuck in

270
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,439
there and I guess what we're going to do

271
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,200
is go into the original bag I usually go

272
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,320
into the original bag that I was given

273
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,399
the product with with the

274
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,760
swaggles and you can see we have no

275
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,078
shortage of

276
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,519
swaggles so this is the majority of what

277
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,319
that sift

278
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,639
was my nose is so itchy from having it

279
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,278
in the air I wish literally everything

280
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,600
in my office is covered in resin right

281
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,480
now my my crop is covered in resin my

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,480
desk is covered in resin I

283
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,480
mean

284
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,959
resin all right

285
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:57,039
so hey you're always going to end up

286
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,078
with most unfortunately I mean unless

287
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm cleaning someone like Matt from a

288
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:04,479
great Gardener who's got a really nice

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,320
percentage of heads generally in his

290
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,920
sift I can get he he usually gives it to

291
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,000
me and it's already

292
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:16,519
50% heads I would say this was less than

293
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,919
5% heads potentially the lowest head

294
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,278
content I've ever seen but we could be

295
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,679
wrong I'll uh I'll give it a little way

296
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:27,879
out and we'll see exactly what we're

297
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:31,599
saying so at the end here this is one I

298
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,559
usually get the the brush really

299
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,800
working it's never going to pick up as

300
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,799
nice as a card or sorry a a card is

301
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,799
never going to pick up as nice as a a

302
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:46,000
brush the brush just basically gets

303
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,958
every drop of resin off the car off the

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,600
cardboard so and of course you can use

305
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,000
anything you want I use cardboard

306
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,199
because this is swag and I don't care

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,559
about it um if you want to use glass or

308
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,319
you want to use a plexiglass or you're

309
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,919
welcome to catch your catch with

310
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,920
whatever you like glass is really nice

311
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,879
nice it tends to be heavy and it tends

312
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:05,360
to break so you got to be careful with

313
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,679
that I like to carry my screens around I

314
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,199
like to take these screens with me when

315
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,078
I go on trips you guys have SE me

316
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,838
traveling through the airport with this

317
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:18,198
thing I always take it with me so we are

318
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,199
left with a bag of talcum

319
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:25,559
powder almost the original

320
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,920
size and we are left

321
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,759
with our couple of piles here so I'll do

322
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,439
a little macro photography show you what

323
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,759
we got here in each pile it's not going

324
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,360
to be super impressive but I want to

325
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,838
show you guys and let you know what we

326
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,240
are dealing with and what we have to

327
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,079
work with I might even take a dab I do

328
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,240
have resin all over me which is uh you

329
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,399
know it's something that the bubble man

330
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,759
deals with on a regular basis covered in

331
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,399
resin all right so I guess what we're

332
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,519
really what's left to do is have a bong

333
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:00,759
rip so I've got some of my fresh frozen

334
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,759
Astro Boy right here ready to go

335
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,679
so stoked on this fresh frozen Astro Boy

336
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,758
that I grew with my uh my med1 actually

337
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,039
a lot of people have been asking me

338
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,759
about med1 it's uh it's what I've been

339
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,879
growing with um you can get it through

340
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,278
um Green Planet they've got it sorted

341
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,720
out I'm going to have it on my website

342
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:21,519
soon because so many people are asking

343
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,800
me and I I've always liked selling

344
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,278
things that I believe in it just it just

345
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,838
makes good sense to me and a lot of

346
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:31,480
people ask me what I'm using so there it

347
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:35,320
is I'm using medic one and uh yeah good

348
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,320
old Green Planet here we

349
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,560
go well thanks for watching Bubble man's

350
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,078
world I hope these tips have helped you

351
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,119
guys out I didn't show a lot of the cing

352
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,799
because the cing is boring and it's a

353
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,000
simple process you need to be not

354
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,639
carting like

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,958
this okay but cing like

356
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,079
this you want to bend that card down and

357
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,399
you want to use some of the surface area

358
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:20,479
on the card to push those contaminants

359
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,198
through the screen it's going to be a

360
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,639
lot easier when you have a lowgrade

361
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,278
material and you just see everything

362
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,120
disappear through the screen it's not

363
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,278
really what you want to see you want to

364
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,399
see some things bouncing around and you

365
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:36,559
want to see that resin going from

366
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,759
almost like a fibrous planty material to

367
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,278
a grainy Sandy material and once you get

368
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,839
those fibers and those capitate stocks

369
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,399
and cyi hairs that cellulose material

370
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
once you break that through the screen

371
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,759
you're going to be left on top with

372
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,199
these these almost little Stone ball

373
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,440
rock type things and those are the

374
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,278
glandular triome heads and you'll see

375
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,360
that when you get your Purity up above

376
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,039
80 and

377
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,120
90% that pile will change drastically

378
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:05,399
even to the naked eye of the trained

379
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,839
hash maker okay so here we have uh quite

380
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,958
a few piles you know more than normal um

381
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,000
remember all of them combined were what

382
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:17,239
the sift was I first showed you in part

383
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,679
one cleaning out this

384
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,600
crazy carpet likee

385
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:27,599
material that is I don't even think

386
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,360
capitate stocks or cyith hairs I think

387
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,000
it's another typee type of hair that is

388
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,240
non cannabis that has contaminated this

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,519
guy's batch I have no idea what kind of

390
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,959
hair it is I've looked at it under the

391
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:45,198
microscope it's beyond strange anyway

392
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,399
after that what I did was I pushed

393
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:51,359
everything

394
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:55,318
through about a 100 Micron screen and I

395
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,800
ended up with um well it was the 107 it

396
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,639
was a it was 107 so I ended up with this

397
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,519
on the bottom this was the bottom tray

398
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,199
so this is the bunk or it was the bunk

399
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,759
and then I ended up with these on top

400
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,720
these are the same grade these are like

401
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,318
107

402
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:17,480
microns then I put everything on top of

403
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:19,720
a 70 uh Micron screen and I got this so

404
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,798
this is about as clean as I could get it

405
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,360
it still has little hairs and tiny

406
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:25,879
little pieces of contaminant that just

407
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:29,479
seemingly were impossible to clean out

408
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,240
um I haven't dabbed it uh per se but uh

409
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,558
it's not really acting usually when I do

410
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,519
this with say mats the whole thing would

411
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,678
pick up it wouldn't break like this it

412
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:43,160
would be already um stuck together and

413
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,160
same with uh uh this one over

414
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,798
here uh there we go so there's all the

415
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,600
piles you can do this with your um twoos

416
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:55,679
screen kit and you'll be left with these

417
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,158
piles and this pile all together uh you

418
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,159
can do it with your four screens uh kits

419
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,240
that I sell the wooden kits I used one

420
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,240
of the wooden frames uh just to run it

421
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,359
through super fast this this was made

422
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,440
like really quickly uh this one was the

423
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:13,519
one that took all the time so there it

424
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,400
is your

425
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,079
grades the

426
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,080
worst the second

427
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,119
worst the second

428
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:27,158
best the

429
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,158
best thanks for watching Bubble man's
