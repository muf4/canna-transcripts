dramas of car accidents let's see it

24
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,399
started with a dump truck no no it

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,680
didn't start with the dump truck I think

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,689
there's one before that oh I've been in

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,090
a lot myself to be honest but I feel

28
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,969
like they they are nothing compared so

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,130
Johnny B got smoked like less than a

30
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,109
month ago maybe two weeks ago I'll show

31
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,640
you the picture yeah it was it was L see

32
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,289
let's put it up right now so now they're

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,909
looking at the picture okay so much I

34
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,320
got t-boned you're that t-bone you can

35
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,030
see it in your car your cars I'll smash

36
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,500
the [ __ ] what he years ago let's

37
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,540
slide over to the next picture oh damn

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,280
see how it's hit on the front and I can

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,868
see that my car was t-boned on the side

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,290
and how the wheels are broken off like

41
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,000
that

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,920
I actually was crossing through an

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,319
intersection and he hit me

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,290
no brakes no brakes full want

45
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,959
acceleration as we spun through the

46
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,790
intersection I thought I hit a

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,260
people on bikes I jumped on when I

48
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,669
killed somebody because I've ever seen

49
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,519
them on the bikes going through the

50
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:19,159
intersection so just that whole slow-mo

51
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,010
action of the airbags going off and

52
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:23,150
glass flying right out of the movie geez

53
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,969
right out of a movie

54
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,430
and I came to a stop and I jumped out

55
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:30,740
tried turning off the car and oh you

56
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,599
know what what the officer said thank

57
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,460
God you were driving the Subaru was that

58
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,099
what he said yeah exactly what he said

59
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,510
so Subaru Outback full airbags went off

60
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,269
from the whole car as you can see in

61
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:42,919
this picture yeah yeah it's like come

62
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,840
easy and even have an airbag in the side

63
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,539
of the seat that went off like the whole

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,870
thing it's quite amazing actually but it

65
00:02:47,539 --> 00:03:00,739
was a hard impact and you know the next

66
00:02:50,870 --> 00:03:07,099
day I saw my doctor and then didn't even

67
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:09,650
do for about three days and it's a

68
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:18,979
weakening of not paying attention and

69
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:20,870
you know I just settled with ICBC a week

70
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:27,859
prior and I supposed to be a trial that

71
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:29,900
week but I wasn't gonna wasn't pay for

72
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,240
my house no try it

73
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,770
it'd be cool well they have to ask me

74
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,480
someone have to actually offer it first

75
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,159
you know I mean it's gonna be for sale

76
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,959
and I'm for it

77
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,150
hey Joanie become I sell you some hash

78
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,099
hey ICBC hooked me up with the check

79
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,420
oh yeah but some is what we're talking

80
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,729
about now we're talking about natural

81
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,449
medicine and full circle and it's uh you

82
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,280
know they gave me some

83
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,739
anti-inflammatories I went home and

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,099
started down with some CB Iceland you're

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,100
good to go

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:05,030
oh yeah that's what I'm talking about

87
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,890
I'm not low temps perfect low temp that

88
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,890
Oh

89
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,889
snippets

90
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:30,280
how is that wedding-cake

91
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:32,560
120 micron six star it's bubble hash so

92
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,059
the repeat now we're doing a lot of

93
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,538
people putting the dabs in the bottom

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,990
cold cold start cold starting I mean

95
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:45,099
it's I mean I I feel like I got to know

96
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,110
cold starting through the puff coke peak

97
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,760
the puffs go because that's really what

98
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:54,819
it does but I think Bobby nugs kind of

99
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,469
created the the hype on I've just seen a

100
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,629
few people like he did a couple of

101
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,850
articles and people wrote made videos of

102
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,469
them and it kind of went viral and so

103
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,510
yeah it's a great idea people that want

104
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,380
a cold start I think it's cool for me

105
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:10,569
with this unit I'm just so happy to be

106
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:13,240
able to blast yeah with the temp tech I

107
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,848
can blast my my nail without you know or

108
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,259
my banger without paying attention to

109
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:22,149
the amount of time that I'm hitting it

110
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:23,620
with and then just drop it usually I'll

111
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:25,019
be honest I usually do it for maybe less

112
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,930
than 10 seconds and when I put it down

113
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:30,848
it's usually around like 750 to 850

114
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,519
ready to go right away I like it to be

115
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:34,990
able to I have to admit I like heating

116
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,459
it passed the temperature and then

117
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,439
dropping it there's something in the

118
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,000
heat retention there that's different

119
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,219
from just heating it up to like 600

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,949
degrees in taking a DAB there's there's

121
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,110
a loss that I feel is better when I heat

122
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,639
it up past you know it's kind of funny

123
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,229
because we used like them from the

124
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,870
subtle mayor's to the details and all

125
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:53,969
these electric devices and I'm back on

126
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:59,069
my torch

127
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:01,590
I kind of like it better you keep

128
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:05,099
talking well the but I'm gonna fix my

129
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:07,109
torch what but the thing is it's what

130
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,210
I'm hitting with the torches I always

131
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,129
had the Dean yell on I come home and be

132
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:13,109
like didn't I go on and stuff like that

133
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,759
but I found that what I really want that

134
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,319
turkey hit that I can actually do a

135
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,389
lower temp table which is really

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,269
important for me I get up in the morning

137
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,800
and I want that turkey taste and you

138
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,419
know I used to turn down the Dean ale

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,740
and stuff like that but you know the

140
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,420
torch is just something that kind of

141
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,810
been working extremely well other than

142
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,250
yeah my butane but once again you know

143
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,050
there's all these different devices out

144
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,910
there that seem to work and the

145
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,840
old-school well it's not even old-school

146
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,910
I guess the old-school wouldn't be the

147
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:43,049
dropping down before I or even before

148
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,550
that in there so we're you're back and

149
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,129
ready to go by the way that was a nice

150
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,960
quick 10 second or second I was just

151
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:51,329
talking to white and I heard back to

152
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,599
that you know this I kind of liked it I

153
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:56,550
got I got like I got I got I don't have

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,860
a gmail in all my room so I have my

155
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,780
mothership outside of my garage I have

156
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:06,629
my Jessie only see my hippo sits at the

157
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:08,849
counter see I got all these little

158
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:12,810
things that I do and it's kind of funny

159
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:15,060
it's it's it's easier for me to medicate

160
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,790
that way than it is to actually like I

161
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,649
need to know I need this this is

162
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,080
important for me because I've been

163
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,120
burning the wrist

164
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:26,430
counting down with temperatures using

165
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,918
all kinds of things but the temp tech

166
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,009
for me is is something new game changer

167
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,629
I assess on the cold start and not was I

168
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:35,969
want to taint it with D 420k there a

169
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,800
couple weeks ago to me I was like okay

170
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:44,370
that's cool never done it before

171
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,780
and then seeing the temp tech is I'm

172
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,030
pretty sure that's gonna be like I'm

173
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,829
where to get this oh yeah

174
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,359
look it up for sure I've had tons of

175
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:53,668
people asking me since I did my unboxing

176
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,439
video it's just a great little tool and

177
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:58,378
for those of you that are already gonna

178
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,620
write oh for $15 you can get a laser

179
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,330
thermometer yes yes you can for $15 you

180
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,340
can get a laser thermometer and you can

181
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,680
hold it under your banger and it totally

182
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,598
works this is way more expensive but

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,478
it's a product it's a brand it's a it's

184
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,788
a unit it's got a solute out it's got

185
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,128
its little light it's if you can create

186
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:19,949
or control the emissivity levels which

187
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,509
is basically there's different

188
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,978
emissivity levels I've been learning for

189
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:26,490
different surfaces so quartz is

190
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:31,439
generally 0.3 0.9 32.9 4 I have it set

191
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:33,089
on 0.9 for right now I don't know it's

192
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,190
just like the laser is gonna hit the

193
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:37,289
surface and how it measures that surface

194
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,839
and what that surface is will change how

195
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:42,240
it measures so you tell the laser what

196
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,209
the surfaces and then accords and

197
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,829
adjusts accordingly so I didn't know I

198
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,359
still might not be explaining it there's

199
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:50,399
always some brilliant person watching

200
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,019
who if I have miss explain that to

201
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,750
Johnny be by all means write it in the

202
00:08:52,019 --> 00:09:00,179
comments I think we should just keep

203
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,789
taking dabs I don't like that what would

204
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:09,479
what would you like to get some treats

205
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:11,620
from the heavenly days that's what I

206
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,420
just hit

207
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,350
just hit that same thing some heavenly

208
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:21,589
days give thanks to heavenly days and

209
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:25,490
concentrated acts who was the producer

210

there's a lot of big trucks I saw all

213
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,909
the new stuff did that stuff going on so

214
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,590
you know for a for being in the middle

215
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,480
of nowhere which really look at can you

216
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,410
see my neighbors like I'm here in the

217
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,060
middle of nowhere

218
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:44,659
I'm literally on the side of a mountain

219
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:46,399
and there are still countless monster

220
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:50,269
trucks

221
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,659
let's see what he's doing oh he's a big

222
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,669
one

223
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,669
he's a big one you know why he's a real

224
00:09:54,789 --> 00:10:00,399
absolutely getting ready to lift all the

225
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,160
house that we have been making all month

226
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,929
long so we've got about 6,000 pounds

227
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,059
this is how we do the deliver he's going

228
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,259
to come in what's new we have to do

229
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,299
these days I mean we're getting to those

230
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:13,600
levels of hash making that the glossy

231
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:15,819
picking to the levels of how we are

232
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,740
setting years ago he said there's two

233
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,690
types of hash dealers those that require

234
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,269
forklifts and those that don't

235
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,530

teen forklift entrance team forklift

237
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:31,689
teen crane new hash tags for it well

238
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,520
it's good to see you dude it's been a

239
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,520
while since I shared a bowl with you a

240
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:53,729
little - that was around 650 I like it

241
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:58,240
to be around 850 I like of course

242
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:00,240
well I don't want to dab at 850 now now

243
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,500
we're at 850 and it'll take a few

244
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,769
seconds it'll cool so when you down but

245
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:10,589
850 a 4-1 it rips into you really quick

246
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:13,199
and as you a 4-2 it just kept it like

247
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:17,589
hardcore that's why you see my baby

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,330
anywhere they were RC - I have one

249
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:23,399
that's non job it's not chance such as

250
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:27,300
that's my I have my Chaz extra chair get

251
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,299
Go Go Johnny be

252
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,909
yeah she's a slide and she's a slip'n

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:38,280
you go sir oh yeah it's always nice to

254
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:40,469
carb friend give a little twist on the

255
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,019
directional shoutout to JP and Toro this

256
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,790
is one of my favorite bangers and carb

257
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,090
caps in fact I think I could easily say

258
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:49,500
it is my fan favorite banger and carb

259
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,100
cap I haven't yet tried the chirp

260
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,360
slurper well mine I have tried it before

261
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,000
and I haven't tried the core reactor I'm

262
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,240
not a big like half gram gram Demi I

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,429
can't it's not not of a high interest to

264
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,919
me to do such things but I love the idea

265
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:07,559
of the core reactor that big chunk of

266
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,209
course but watching one worth actually

267
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,769
heat then it goes around the outer edge

268
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,160
and there's a sentiment saw the other

269
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,340
day

270
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,689
nice yeah endless innovation and it's in

271
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,280
one with the ball bearings spinning

272
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,280
that's all here in town

273
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:31,609
yeah there we go that clean a nice like

274
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:31,609
it clean now that was tasty

275
00:12:33,438 --> 00:12:42,929
um I think it's what I just hit but if

276
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:47,028
not sure I think that's what I just hit

277
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,028
but I'll try again and I'll confirm

278
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,039
yummy showed up to the camera but really

279
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,079
close okay I'm getting up and then you

280
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,870
gotta put your hand behind it too so it

281
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:02,338
focuses on the hash yep yep yep I'm

282
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:05,549
skilled at this in the past and you can

283
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:08,519
kind of get hopefully a good look and

284
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:22,649
you get an idea there you go so it's

285
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:26,100
kind of like it's just lot going on

286
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:28,828
these days look at this amazing goodness

287
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,040
it's like really you dealing with like

288
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:34,828
really say concentrates for a pain and

289
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:39,588
really understanding how like just

290
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:42,870
natural medicine and making the house

291
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:45,930
it's funny how it came so far so quickly

292
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,278
but yet you know so much more needs to

293
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:53,128
be explained and how this works so well

294
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:53,870
the reasons why we do this that was

295
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:58,649
delicious

296
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:59,578
yeah it's so delicious the terms I

297
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,178
thought it might be a little bit

298
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:07,620
different that's why one because this

299
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:10,519
was a little special I think maybe

300
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,568
that's what that's what the big powers I

301
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,178
just thought it was the special special

302
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:17,399
and he gave me a small pile but knowing

303
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:19,649
ro he gave me the big pile of the

304
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,629
skittles so give thanks brother that's

305
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:24,659
much appreciated that was absolutely

306

obviously Johnny B's been doing tons

318
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:12,240
I've been doing tons just focused on all

319
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:14,519
things embark focused on Whistler

320
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,820
technologies and focused on travel

321
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,679
traveling a lot a lot a lot of traveling

322
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,960
so you see some pretty amazing sights

323
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,089
meters and amazing fields yeah I think

324
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,950
hopefully eventually I'll get to all the

325
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,230
videos so we had a crew come with us to

326
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,940
Spain and film a ton of stuff I put one

327
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,519
teaser up on the channel but hopefully

328
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,860
we'll get more and then I still have

329
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,899
Jamaica to post which I put one video up

330
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,600
so far but I probably have like a good

331
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,779
three or four other videos and then I

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,670
also have Colombia and I'm sure there's

333
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,309
at least you know two or three good

334
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:49,339
little clip itch videos from Colombia

335
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,869
going into the mountains in Kalka and

336
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:55,050
seeing all the coca plants and the

337
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,149
cannabis plants growing side by side it

338
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:58,620
was pretty neat for sure you would have

339
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:06,419
definitely been tripping out and loving

340
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:09,000
it licensed producers cannabis and

341
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:11,429
looking at this evaporation crisis yeah

342
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,519
it's a big problem it's uh it's funny

343
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:17,579
because you know they should honestly

344
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,590
you should be selling that data to

345
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,629
Health Canada I've been actually

346
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,340
compiling now spreadsheets had taking a

347
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,779
look at data and taking a look at who's

348
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,570
doing what and I want to know who's got

349
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,250
controlled packing rooms who's using the

350
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,800
oh there's different ceiling I'm seeing

351
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,928
so huge in abduction we learned this all

352
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,208
it'd be good to have like a like an

353
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:38,738
actual like they over regulate

354
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:42,219
everything except the important things

355
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:44,829
like regulating active water content and

356
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,139
the way you package and the SOPs package

357
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:48,938
under like make those regulations not

358
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,068
ridiculous and unreasoning here's a

359
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:52,838
great one but patient focused patient

360
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:54,789
focus so I'm gonna hit you guys in your

361
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,189
pocketbook and I'm gonna go after canopy

362
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:59,409
so they left 151 million dollars in the

363
00:16:57,188 --> 00:17:03,578
first quarter I tested all of their

364
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:04,959
cannabis at 42% 44 and 46 so here's my

365
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:07,418
question how much did they lose any

366
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,860
operation in money-wise that alone

367
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:11,500
because you're now you're looking at

368
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,740
hundreds of thousands of pounds and when

369
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,588
you're losing 8 and 10% water put that

370
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,838
in your pocket yeah and really and and

371
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:21,278
and and if you look at that then you're

372
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,438
gonna start waking up because when you

373
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:24,880
can't control a packaging room to

374
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,769
package the product you put so much

375
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,929
money into growing yeah there's a

376
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:30,009
problem 50 million dollar facility you

377
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,480
think the packaging room would be

378
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:33,069
state-of-the-art I could pretty much

379
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,558
tell you right now if you package that

380
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:37,210
62% well Jim he may be that count ups

381
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,638
are coming where I flee about 52 53

382
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,620
inside the container so you have the oxy

383
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:43,449
package about 68% and that was the

384
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,979
little test that I've learned right and

385
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,240
these little things that I hope you guys

386
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,069
serve listening and you start learning

387
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,638
the same thing yeah it's a little bit

388
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,888
complex

389
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:53,918
it's just moisture content it's active

390
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:55,898
water content as you used to do which is

391
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,850
different than moisture this is concise

392
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:59,069
is the product and the space that

393
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:01,079
surrounds the product

394
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:03,148
not just the product not just the

395
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,460
product so it's really important to

396
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:07,408
understand that I'm learning I've been

397
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,808
learning for a lot of six months and and

398
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:11,940
really understanding you know I'm seeing

399
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:13,200
not see even what what my screen users

400
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,610
are probably coming up with the better

401
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,590
products because they're doing certain

402
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:18,178
well we should do a video from my

403
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:19,798
channel dude we should do an act of

404
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,200
water video test look at the bumblebee

405
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,668
just went in the house he lives in there

406
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,490
that's awesome I have a bumblebee that

407
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,320
lives in my bird house one single

408
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,788
bumblebee he's happy that's why I put my

409
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,349
finger in there I know what you're doing

410
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:32,878
up yeah I was seeing a fee was around I

411
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:34,788
put my finger and he'll like step on my

412
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:39,319
finger and I can pull him out of that

413
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:39,319
house that probably was the be that

414
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:48,798
ready Kirsch that's my medicine

415
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:51,918
he's like Johnny B but he's bumble bee

416
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,788
bumble [ __ ] bee

417
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,669
yeah but octave water is a really

418
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:58,259
important subject and now I want to go

419
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,960
deeper into it I want to have you over

420
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,450
and I want to do like a test of two or

421
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,860
three varieties and we'll just we'll

422
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,509
walk them through it will explain the

423
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,939
difference of active water versus

424
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:10,620
moisture going as deep as we can and I

425
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,058
know he's been sharing this on his own

426
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,158
channel which you guys can check out at

427
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,778
John Barr fellow but I want the content

428
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,100
for this channel as well and Johnny B

429
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:18,750
needs another reason to come out to

430
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,459
lions baby that's right I need to sit

431
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,798
down enough to explain it because my

432
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,909
content is invented pieces of my videos

433
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,190
because I'm always doing what I'm doing

434
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:28,110
some do a full one I haven't really got

435
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,240
into the whole I've done a water testing

436
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,648
but sitting down and explaining it as in

437
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,089
let's get some canvas let's talk about

438
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:34,739
all the different seals I know what

439
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,538
companies are doing hey let's do that

440
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,250
and you can talk about all the different

441
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:39,019
paths

442
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,849
we're packaging and how it's testing and

443
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:43,190
active water and seeing what's trying on

444
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,559
fantastic stuff that was packaged almost

445
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,029
a year ago by one company it is still

446
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,039
coming in to same a little busier let's

447
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:51,950
buy a bunch of cannabis I'll pay for it

448
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:57,559
and then we will do the active water

449
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:59,390
test and then we will I guess I wouldn't

450
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:02,450
want to waste it but it would be a good

451
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,130
show to do like you know Roz and where

452
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,049
half of it is used without the

453
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,320
percentage brought up and half of it is

454
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:11,269
used to be between this and I started

455
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:15,589
I've seen we meta fiying imprecise

456
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,970
that's like that but of small and you

457
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,709
know what that'd be great because you're

458
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,710
gonna completely see me see what strains

459
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,220
are where the see the the aw is that

460
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:28,340
like 36 percent this is low don't forget

461
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,960
breadcrumbs that's really low its food

462
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:37,519
it must be like almost like powder

463
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:44,000
pastas 50:29 in it went to dust dust 29s

464
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:46,700
ridiculous they also must realize like

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,740
that seal if it's going then are the

466
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,730
terpenes consuming whatever that

467
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,289
material was that was the other thing

468
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,779
what type of seal are they using is it a

469
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:58,789
chemical glue is it something that

470
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,950
shouldn't be consumed by terpenes and

471
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,240
then inhaled by a patient see this is

472
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,880
things that I don't think they've done

473
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,589
the research on here I got something to

474
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,710
show you Johnny BAC this is what's

475
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:11,509
awesome this is why we do what we do and

476
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,950
why we get so actively involved because

477
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:15,289
it's the passion of being able to see

478
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,660
and how things react inside containers

479
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:19,819
inside different things those little

480
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,250
great products that come to you and you

481
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:23,720
get to check out new little devices and

482
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,329
stuff like that and since I have the

483
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,329
agent I have my machine in my car

484
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,250
there's no machine for this no machine

485
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:35,750
for this

486
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:39,470
well this is as simple as like going

487
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,880
like this and pushing air out then you

488
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,399
can open it it creates a small vacuum

489
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,750
it's a nice glass job right away there

490
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:47,538
you can hear it right away you can have

491
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,369
that one because you were just saying we

492
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:51,048
get these cool little products so can

493
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:53,989
Locke sent this to me and I just thought

494
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:59,240
you know what like maybe we'll have can

495
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:02,990
lock sponsor us in our testing of

496
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,548
cannabinoids water content maybe they'll

497
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,329
buy the herb they've already supplied

498
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:09,980
the containers yeah exactly so companies

499
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,678
like vivo does companies like can lock

500
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:15,829
look I like this company because a very

501
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,419
simply you can create a vacuum and you

502
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:18,079
can suck look now my button doesn't go

503
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,639
down anymore

504
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:30,829
yeah just for all the air is out now

505
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:33,888
listen absolutely so for those are you

506
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:36,740
and you notice they make it a size for

507
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:38,928
an early smoker like this is not a hash

508
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,138
jar I mean it is my ice jar don't get me

509
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:41,480
wrong

510
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:44,058
second falafel I'm gonna use hash but

511
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,159
this is a perfect jar for like a flavor

512
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:52,819
you know you got your seven grams or

513
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,830
whatever it's a nice dr or something

514
00:22:52,819 --> 00:23:01,129
down low so you know when their friends

515
00:22:54,829 --> 00:23:02,839
come over see this would keep it real

516
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,990
fresh you know although I'd have to look

517
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,788
at you know is this a PTFE is this

518
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,138
terpene resistant because this is gonna

519
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:10,579
be different you know that's gonna take

520
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,109
a look at all those things with the lid

521
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:15,859
you know all that research with it will

522
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:18,048
go yeah so I think when it come down to

523
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:20,418
me what type of plastic it is is it a

524
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:23,379
metal ready yeah exactly it's got to be

525
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:25,580
it's got to be able to withstand

526
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,028
segregation from terpenes so I'll ask

527
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:28,028
them about that

528
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,359
so yes you can have that one I like it

529
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:44,740
built-in pump twist on this milk roof

530
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:46,720
washable jar travel ready maybe you

531
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,429
could put some here maybe you can put

532
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,370
some herb in it and leave it in there

533
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,820
for like 30 or 40 days and then we could

534
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:58,028
do the active water content test okay

535
00:23:54,819 --> 00:24:03,339
how about we do this oh that goes around

536
00:23:58,028 --> 00:24:05,079
here this goes in there which fits into

537
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,148
here there you go

538
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:10,408
it's only a half size so it should be

539
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:10,408
smudged up there you go perfect

540
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,109
packaging holy [ __ ] on everything it is

541
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,740
kind of ridiculous I'm not gonna say

542
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:25,209
it's not okay so buy a gram of say some

543
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:33,250
weed from friends weed MD and the

544
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:34,929
package is this big in a box a box with

545
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,619
the container in the Box in the box

546
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:41,139
inside of plastic not too different from

547
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:43,000
this actually comes with a bag here you

548
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:44,619
go but nonetheless look this is how

549
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,509
we've come to you yeah because they put

550
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:49,058
in another box we have to make ourselves

551
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:51,038
available to the audience to do this

552
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:52,629
maybe I want to do this I want to do

553
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,069
this active water test I want to show

554
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:57,100
them what it's all about kind of get the

555
00:24:54,069 --> 00:25:00,158
model on line and so what we're gonna do

556

563
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,110
I got in trouble for saying the content

564
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,819
I know I've gotten in trouble I know

565
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:25,219
that no because but you're educating

566
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:27,169
here's one of these head researcher he's

567
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,390
the main QA guy and scientists are like

568
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,210
that really did a lot of education and

569
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:34,970
husband Brian is the head quality

570
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:37,759
control and science guy behind the team

571
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,610
of Boveda both the nvidia has created

572
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:48,109
you know that communities for all these

573
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:50,359
different he educated me saying things

574
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:52,519
wrong how you just certain things that

575
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,469
really understanding of how much water

576
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,759
is inside of a container that goes we

577
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,750
did some explaining yeah we're

578
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,309
definitely gonna have a good show on

579
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,109
this to talk more about for sure

580
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:01,609
absolutely show bring the charts that

581
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:03,049
are printed out to have more of a

582
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:04,879
discussion on looking at the charts of

583
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:07,639
what levels to look at sauce and then

584
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,020
where Bowl ticket allen to start why a

585
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,240
lot of these people i would say would be

586
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:12,799
more concerned about how much active

587
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,410
waters in the cannabis because I think

588
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:20,629
Health Canada's scared everybody away

589
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:22,650
from being being able to sell fresh when

590
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,590
it says right on the container

591
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:29,820
yeah a big run on every mechanic that's

592
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:32,069
keeping us dry dry because they're so

593
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:35,429
worried about mold they've dried it out

594
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:38,009
beyond I still see a lot of

595
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,509
consistencies between the 44 46 percent

596
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:43,710
arts but I think that just has to do

597
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:50,339
with I can see I can tell you what

598
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:52,110
provinces and I can tell you where let's

599
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:56,730
package up right across the country by

600
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:58,469
its octopus and BC seems to be the

601
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:02,360
highest set of everybody to cross camera

602
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:08,640
highest percentage the rainforests right

603
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:13,769
even when it's dry it's little things

604
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:19,890
that I've seen that's cool yeah

605
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:30,599
interesting since Christmas Christmas

606
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:54,259
Day I wasn't expecting it but it was in

607
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:54,259
my know its moisture and it's neither

608
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,970
we're definitely going to come back and

609
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:05,339
revisit this

610
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,319
I would hope yeah we should do a good

611
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,058
good video well we write it down and

612
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,058
show everything and then in the meantime

613
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:14,970
I'm gonna load up dab of strawberry

614
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:16,920
banana for Johnny we're gonna call it a

615
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,039
day so I can actually go visit Johnny be

616
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,870
without being on camera that's kind of

617
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,599
like gotta save some of our friendship

618
