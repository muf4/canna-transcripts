our panelists this morning has been a

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,269
little bit chaotic I will not lie had a

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,550
little bit of technical difficulties

8
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:26,559
with a few of the different panelists

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,849
high-pressure yet yesterday we came in

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,070
on a phone so he's not going to be able

11
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:32,109
to make it in today we're hoping for the

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,600
best with solvent zero although he could

13
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:38,409
not hear me and I'm hoping that you guys

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,329

have you in here I was very impressed

35
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,650
with the photos that you'd been posting

36
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:40,719
on on Instagram that's really kind of

37
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,580
what got you an invite in today to our

38
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:46,959
conversation on the past present and

39
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:48,969
future of oh why not have panel before

40
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,489
going live okay let's answer this

41
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:53,939
because people always love to ask this

42
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:56,589
question what happens when I go live

43
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,629
sorry when I invite the entire panel in

44
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,790
before I go live what it's done in the

45
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:02,859
past is it's locked the camera on one

46
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,469
particular person for the entire show

47
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:07,120
and it has not given me the ability so

48
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,919
what I've learned from Google and

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,979
YouTube is that I need to go live and

50
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,889
then invite the

51
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:18,290
in what's going on solvent his mind in

52
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:20,149
the house Matt in the house double Matt

53
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:21,919
in the house we got Sasquatch in the

54
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,500
house Matt and Joel are there I don't

55
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,669

57
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:29,719
very good you guys don't have a camera

58
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,459
working her way I don't know what's

59
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:34,519
going on just showing the logo here uh

60
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:39,400
yes this is why I love to do testing

61
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,400
prior to the show going live there we go

62
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:45,949
I like the lat I like the busy wall

63
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:49,459
behind you it reminds me of my busy wall

64
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:51,738
yeah yeah I just got my new office so

65
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:55,609

67
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:59,689
we can hear you perfect excellent I was

68
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:02,870
having problems with the other Matt from

69
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,549
solvent zero he's not able to hear this

70
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,409
morning I've got him on mute right now

71
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:09,019
but he's gonna try and figure it out we

72
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:11,239
got to turn to skirt in the room as well

73
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:14,090
I'm sure you guys have seen his awesome

74
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,489
photos I'm pretty sure Matt and you you

75
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:21,289
know each other at least I think I'm not

76
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:23,500
sure we met but yeah yeah good work dude

77
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:26,120
[Music]

78
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,859
excellent excellent well I got my unit

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,650
set up right here today for a little bit

80
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:33,019
of pressing just cuz I figured might as

81
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,120
well might as well when in Rome when we

82
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,340
have the when we have the rosin

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,930
conversation I've been excited to have

84
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,299
this conversation it definitely doesn't

85
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,400
have the same history as hash so we're

86
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,769
not gonna have Chris Bennett open it up

87
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,049
with 20 minutes of epic hash history I

88
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,569
am one of the few people that calls

89
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:53,419
rosin oil I know a lot of people in the

90
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:56,750
in the community called their oil hash

91
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:58,700
and maybe it's fine to do that I've just

92
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,068
kind of grew up more old-school and I've

93
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:04,818
always kind of deciphered a difference

94
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:06,589
between between oil and hash a beautiful

95
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:08,179
difference not definitely thinking one's

96
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,939
better than the other but I do see a

97
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,060
difference mainly in the sense that only

98
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:17,060
the greatest quality hash will melt into

99
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,788
a liquid whereas even the shittiest oil

100
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,189
I've ever seen in my life will also melt

101
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:23,379
into a liquid so it's not really a way

102
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:25,180
to decipher quoi

103
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,310
when it comes to oil there's different

104
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,220
ways that we decipher quality the melt

105
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,040
factor is not one of them and I often

106
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,800
see people say oh my rosin or my my BHO

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,960
is six star and I'll be like well star

108
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,819
rating is really the melt rating so I'm

109
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,120
not sure it maybe we need to come up

110
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:45,129
with a new rating for for oil that's

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,439
based more upon the quality or the

112
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:52,149
texture or the you know those sorts of

113
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,920
things but just wandering off here into

114
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,569
the live chat we got a bunch of people

115
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,100
four hundred and fifty nine people in

116
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,110
the room right now hopefully everyone

117
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,350
else is getting the link

118
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,480
I guess I'll send out the secondary link

119
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,629
to the other group of guys I had a

120
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,430
couple of reserves in place a couple a

121
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:12,069
couple of different rosin press

122
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,340
companies actually peer pressure and

123
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:17,769
evolved I sent them out a link right now

124
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:19,089
to see if they want to come in as some

125
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:22,229
of the other people are taking their

126
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:26,429
sweet time I'm really hoping that

127
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:29,620
compassion can come in because he he was

128
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,470
he was the guy that first posted rosin

129
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,050
tech online years ago it's got to be

130
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:41,020
like 12 or 13 years ago maybe more I

131
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:43,000
know the IC mag post was done on 2006

132
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:46,389
but I was certain that he had done one

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,329
prior on overgrow in like 2003 or four I

134
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,709
could be wrong about that that's why it

135
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:53,859
would be great to have him in here and

136
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:57,909
tell the story welcome Lindsay I believe

137
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,680
that is my Marcus thank you yeah well

138
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,020
you know what when other people don't

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,420
show up the reserves get the link bro so

140
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:07,359
we'll definitely go through and do sort

141
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,430
of an introduction everyone can kind of

142
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,290
at one point will kind of let each

143
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,120
person go through and talk about you

144
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,800
know the how they got turned on to

145
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,920
cannabis and how that eventually led

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,120
them into extracts ideally how it lent

147
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,280
them led them to producing rosin which

148
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,230
of course we all love to call a solvent

149
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,399
less oil

150
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,009
whereas I you know that is a misnomer

151
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,829
there's definitely hydrocarbons terpenes

152
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:35,469
present in these oils but hey I've been

153
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,949
known to use it myself there it is right

154
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,110
there the solvent list quiver

155
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,300
so we do use that term but it is a

156
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,910
misnomer kind of like strain when we're

157
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,400
talking about cultivars but it is what

158
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,170
it is I don't think we're gonna be uh oh

159
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,019
Chad's not making it in here and that's

160
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,330

164
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:05,660
three rosin press manufacturers and then

165
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,460
we've got three rosin makers so far in

166
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,050
the room right now I thought it would be

167
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,909
a good idea I know hashed Church isn't

168
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,290
really about a cover so obviously you're

169
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,910
gonna be able to mention your company

170
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,470
name you're going to be able to mention

171
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,390
the technology that you guys came up

172
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,460
with and how you guys came up with it

173
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,589
and it's obviously a positive

174
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:23,539
conversation we're not here to outsell

175
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:25,609
one another on our machines we're just

176
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,860
here to kind of share information and

177
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,660
let everyone know what's going on in

178
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:35,600
regards to rosin productions so we got

179
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,510
seven people 533 people in the room

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,220
there's honey butter rosin Co just join

181
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:43,279
what's up honey butter another dude with

182
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,260
some [ __ ] sweet wheat pictures some

183
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,629
sweet little videos always love to see

184
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:50,480
your your rosin dude how you doing

185
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,040
welcome good good thanks for having me

186
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,110
dude I love that you've got the

187
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,590
headphones on your shit's working and

188
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,780
we're dialed in so maybe maybe we'll

189
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,339
start off with some introductions I

190
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:06,799
really did want to kind of start with

191
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:10,879
the past I guess I could send Chad a

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,970
quick message to see if he is around

193
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,639
because we definitely need to we need to

194
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,530
get him in here another person I should

195
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,469
have been testing it out yesterday he's

196
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,949
saying that his plug-in is blocked right

197
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:28,430
now I don't know how to fix it sorry not

198
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,229
my computer oh well another time my

199
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,210
friend

200
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,870
alright so compassion is out we're gonna

201
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,150
have to tell the history for him I

202
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,429
suspect I still believe it was a little

203
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:43,870
bit before 2006 but let's just say the

204
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:48,109
first I see mags post that we saw was on

205
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:51,120
2006 this was compassion producing he

206
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,278
was coming out with the rosin

207
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,179
post and I don't know if any of you guys

208
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,610
remember that it was very unique it was

209
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,258
it was symbiotic for bubble bags because

210
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,889
it was all about teaching people how to

211
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,329
make oil GABA bewitch you know back then

212
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,370
we weren't really dabbing but if you

213
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:10,739
remember I was always hitting along with

214
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,360
skunkman Sam and a few others we were we

215
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,459
were kind of dabbing we were hitting it

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,350
on a stainless steel screen we were

217
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,419
wafting the flame back and forth and

218
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,339
allowing it to bubble and bubble up and

219
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:21,958
so the highest quality bubble hash of

220
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,120
course would create large big clear

221
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,508
domes and so that was the pre dab

222
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,028
dabbing Chad came up with this method

223
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:32,519
where you would take the the subpar hash

224
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:34,919
that wasn't melting he would place it in

225
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,500
a double boiler like a metal or a glass

226
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,389
bowl that was inside boiling water and

227
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,850
he would put the hash inside the bowl

228
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:46,049
and with a with a metal spoon he would

229
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:48,329
melt gently milk melt the the oils out

230
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:50,429
of the wax membranes and what would

231
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:52,948
happen was you get these oil sort of

232
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:55,258
wall it would just like coat the side of

233
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:57,120
the wall and you would go around with

234
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,399
the spoon it was a very very slow

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,990
process I would definitely say that it

236
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,089
did not take off and it was not

237
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,980
popularized in any way shape or form

238
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,990
compared to what soil grown did when you

239
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,730
first squeeze the butt or some hash

240
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,970
welcome to the room by the way soil

241
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,259
grown good timing on that just telling

242
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,750
us just telling the story about

243
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:19,589
compassion right now producing the first

244
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:23,519
rosin thread back in the mid-2000s on I

245
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:25,649
see mag and oh and overgrow and so what

246
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,578
happened was you ended up with this ball

247
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,799
of wax

248
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:30,838
after you melt it around the bowl and

249
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,149
the bowl itself you could take a razor

250
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,949
blade and you could scrape it and it

251
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:38,129
would shear off this like white

252
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:40,349
beautiful oil no one had ever seen it at

253
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,659
the time it was definitely mind blowing

254
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,920
and that to me is really you know we

255
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:47,100
could always go back a little bit

256
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:50,099
further in the past I've had people tell

257
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,409
me about pressing hash back in the day

258
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,920
and pressing it way too hot and way too

259
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,990
hard and ending up with some oil in me

260
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,149
in the end results like squeezing out of

261
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,580
the hash so I'm sure that happened in

262
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:03,500
the third world's in Lebanon

263
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,230
and in Afghanistan when they were really

264
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,710
hammering that hash down I'm certain

265
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,480
that there was product that was you know

266
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:14,090
collected and and you know treated very

267
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,740
specially but in our community the first

268
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,930
time we really heard about it was in

269
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,060
mid-2000s through compassion when he

270
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:23,750
wrote the post on rosin and then it

271
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:25,639
basically got forgotten about until and

272
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,470
you know for those of you that want to

273
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,379
say there's listen any time you give the

274
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,389
history or your story on something

275
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,769
there's always going to be someone that

276
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,990
comes in and says that's not what

277
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,819
happened this is how it was bla bla bla

278
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,509
bla bla but I don't think any of us can

279
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,070
deny that when soil grown first squished

280
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:44,629
the bud or the piece of hash I'll let

281
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,390
you tell it in your own words here in a

282
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:50,779
few minutes that that was really the

283
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:52,879
true beginning of the rosin tech it's

284
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,699
where our conversation started in hash

285
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,769
Church through soil grown and I would be

286
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,629
hard set to say that any of you that

287
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,519
have developed a machine or that have

288
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:04,070
developed techniques in regards to this

289
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,569
if you follow back your history I'm

290
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,150
quite certain it would start with an

291
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,800
Instagram post made by soil grown so why

292
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,049
don't we let soil grown give us an

293
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,309
introduction just imagine a lot of

294
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,379
people are watching that don't know who

295
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:17,599
you are let us know who you are let us

296
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:19,519
know when you got into this and give us

297
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,620
that story one more time for hash search

298
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,350
I know you've told it a few times but

299
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,570
the floor is yours my friend all right

300
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:34,009
hey what's up guys so so soil grown

301
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:36,170
basically started back in like 2013 just

302
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,279
washing hash started getting known just

303
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:44,240
washing hash and stuff

304
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:45,769
water hash and then basically got out of

305
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,129
my dispensary and then I started making

306
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,720
hash at home didn't really know much

307
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:52,939
what to do with this I just like mostly

308
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,570
made it for the head smoking it ran out

309
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,510
of my melts and that's when so back in

310
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,740
the day like the the three horse star I

311
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:03,139
would press with the hair straightener

312
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,450
between some parchment try thin it out

313
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,980
so I was able to dab it so I wasn't

314
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,230
trying to make rosin at the time but I

315
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,940
was just trying to doubt something that

316
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,899
wasn't very melty so further down the

317
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,059
road

318
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:20,299
started running out of all my full melts

319
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:23,629
wasn't enjoying dabbing three four star

320
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:27,378
melts so off she I skipped something so

321
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:29,058
back so go back in the beginning when I

322
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:31,278
used to press out the hatch accidentally

323
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:34,759
pressed it out too hard one time and I

324
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,318
noticed that there was the shiny oil on

325
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,970
the outside and all the contaminant in

326
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:40,219
the middle was nice and dry I didn't

327
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,470
think anything of it at the time so I

328
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,019
pulled it all back together repressed it

329
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,809
I was able to dab it shitty hash dabbed

330
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:52,928
it though so skip him away back ahead

331
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:55,428
ran out of all my full melts basically

332
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:58,428
that a light bulb went off in my head

333
00:13:55,428 --> 00:14:00,350
and I thought about back when I over

334
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:03,909
pressed it and you know realizing that

335
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,959
there was the shiny and then the dry so

336
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,490
when that light bulb went off in my head

337
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,229
I actually just grabbed a piece of hash

338
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,789
and I put it between a piece of

339
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:15,050
parchment paper and I pressed it on the

340
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:17,208
nail with my finger so that's when I was

341
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:20,748
actually able to see that the oil was

342
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,828
coming out of the piece of hash and so

343
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:24,579
basically once and opened up the

344
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:28,008
parchment there was tiny little drops of

345
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:31,188
rosin in it basically so I'd say for

346
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:34,720
about two three maybe a month I was

347
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:37,849
that's how I was pressing rosin and then

348
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,559
then basically I grabbed the hair not a

349
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,689
hair straightener a hair curler so I

350
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:44,149
started using a hair curler after that

351
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:46,248
and I wasn't working very well my wife

352
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,708
came in she noticed I was using her

353
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:51,079
expensive stuff she gave me some broken

354
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:53,928
hair straightener and the hair

355
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:55,849
straightener killed it so I was pressing

356
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:58,600
hash in between parchment with the hair

357
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,610
straightener no screen and I would

358
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,089
collect all the oil around the sides and

359
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,589
smack the dry and hash out the center so

360
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:10,069
that's how I was making hash rosin back

361
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:13,040
in the beginning and then from there ran

362
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:14,088
out of all my hash and another light

363
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,669
bulb went off in my head

364
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,829
so we took a bud thinking nothing was

365
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:20,028
going to happen and sure enough between

366
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:23,798
the parchment paper and the hair

367
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:23,798
straightener oil came right out

368
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:31,570
yeah it was just we were all in I was

369
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:33,579
unbelievable and then yeah and it just

370
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,800
continued evolve from there you know I

371
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,060
showed friends I posted online and stuff

372
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:42,699
and then word got around and the next

373
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:43,929
thing you know you know lots of people

374
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,790
were asking about it the next thing

375
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,739
element has Church and you know that's

376
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:49,240
when the screen came involved people

377
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,820
started pressing through screens and it

378
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,769
just kept getting better and better so

379
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,950
basically that's the story of how I

380
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:59,379
stumbled across rosin tech it's a major

381
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,209
aha moment when you really think about

382
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,830
it because anyone that's ever squished

383
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,829
with a hair straightener has known that

384
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,720
if things don't line up properly if

385
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,730
you're not hot enough if the buds not

386
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,550
good enough if the combination isn't

387
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,289
just proper you don't get anything I've

388
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:17,349
pressed many of buds where I've just

389
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:19,329
seen him a hard bud cookie come out a

390
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,850
flat cookie come out at the end and not

391
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,680
see any oil the first time Tony and I

392
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,470
went to Jamaica for the High Times

393
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,838
Cannabis Cup I would say the first six

394
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,540
to seven people that came we just had

395
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,820
the old D mail manual press there was no

396
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,939
other machine at the time it was just

397
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,190
the Harris it was basically a t-shirt

398
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,260
press but they took the plates off and

399
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,029
they put very small five inch by five

400
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,860
inch plates so it wasn't the full size

401
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:47,409
t-shirt press with the little manual

402
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,870
hand and after five or six times both

403
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:51,850
Tony and I were like listen I don't know

404
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,070
if we can keep doing this this bud

405
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,050
there's something wrong and it wasn't

406
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,170
until my friend Omar walked up to the

407
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:02,079
table and slapped his buds down that we

408
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:04,269
squished and so on this beautiful golden

409
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,740
oil come hey what's up Joel just saw you

410
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:09,670
in the corner of the screen when Matt

411
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,650
Koff there for a second and so we were

412
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,350
like oh my god thank God it works

413
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,689
because it's you know it's it's that aha

414
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:19,539
moment for you soil grown to me was a

415
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,650
major thing because and also the fact

416
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,379
that you tried it with a bud because

417
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,179
let's be honest not everyone has hash

418
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,720
and the minute you made that work with a

419
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:30,670
bud that [ __ ] was a game-changer because

420
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,549
now anyone could I I thought immediately

421
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,830
I was like oh my god like you've you've

422
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:37,769
actually saved lives in a sense because

423
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:39,599
and not in the sense like people

424
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,369
I'm sure it's very rare but we know

425
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,139
people blow up and when they burn their

426
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:46,469
houses down making oil and then making

427
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,480
butane butane was the first like I hate

428
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,160
to use the term like wildfire but it

429
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,769
really did spread like wildfire because

430
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,450
it made it made it an opportunity for

431
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,730
young people who didn't have a lot of a

432
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,950
connection to the community to suddenly

433
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,589
just be able to grab a can and grab some

434
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,259
bud and blast and have this oil well

435
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:06,480
when you squish that bud you took that

436
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:09,539
away from the BHO community in a way

437
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,880
that you offered something new up to the

438
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,680
community that to me I mean I'm not a

439
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,750
religious person but my god that was a

440
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,820
godsend for young people who were

441
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,410
otherwise I mean think of all of you

442
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:21,629
guys that are producing presses and

443
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,269
inspiring people to make this solvent

444
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,070
Latoya laz we say it really is an

445
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,319
inspiration beyond anything you can

446
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:30,599
imagine because people were blowing up

447
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,129
they were burning themselves and wearing

448
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,139
those burns for the rest of their lives

449
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,360
and let's be honest cannabis is such an

450
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,210
amazing thing that the worst thing about

451
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:42,750
cannabis should and always will be

452
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,150
the DEA not us blowing ourselves up and

453
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,549
wearing scars on our face for the rest

454
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,670
of our lives as a parent that's pretty

455
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:53,940
sickening so props to use soil grown you

456
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,620
definitely lit a fire in all of us I'm

457
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,529
sure I'm not sure anyone on the panel

458
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,569
can say that they were inspired outside

459
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:04,920
of what you did I definitely give it up

460
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:06,990
to to Tony V and to nicotine also using

461
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,350
the hair straightener to press their

462
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,480
bubbles to get it into into a dabble

463
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,219
form when they had dry powder they put

464
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,799
it in the parchment and that's what I

465
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,720
saw right before you came out and

466
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,789
started pressing I saw these guys

467
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,500
pressing bubble really lightly they

468
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:24,899
weren't making rosin they were just

469
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,670
pressing you know bubble that maybe for

470
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,200
me when people ask me how I prepared my

471
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,300
bubble I just squeeze it between my

472
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,830
fingers there I got a dab but you know

473
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,409
we're in this new world of everything

474
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:36,179
being attack and I know that I heard you

475
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,810
before mentioned that you had seen as

476
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,490
nicotine or tawny or both of them

477
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:44,490
pressing with a little hair straightener

478
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,370
that was my first rosin go ahead I'd

479
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,309
have to say a much respect to make a tea

480
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:51,750
I mean if it wasn't for seeing that how

481
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:53,369
he was pressing out his hash back in

482
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,440
the day of thinning it out I probably

483
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:58,139
wouldn't have you know press it out too

484
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,360
hard and even even came across that but

485
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,330
yeah I mean it's it's really cooked it

486
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,369
starts down I'm not that bubble hash

487
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:07,199
from where I learned it from most

488
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:10,379
nicotine you know it came from an

489
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,330
accident basically well some of the best

490
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,340
things do come from accidents I'll say

491
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:16,379
this and I'll say to all the people out

492
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,089
there who are constant like I want to

493
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,740
enter the cannabis industry I want to

494
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:21,569
start a business how do I do it I'm like

495
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,519
well you know I'll give you a little

496
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:25,559
Gary Vaynerchuk because what you need to

497
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,150
do is you need to fall on your face and

498
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,059
you need to not be afraid of making

499
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:33,240
mistakes because mistakes will lead you

500
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:35,339
to what I call the aha moment and that

501
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,019
was an aha moment soil grown had when he

502
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:38,819
slapped that button that parchment and

503
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,980
squeezed it and it was people in the

504
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:43,470
community doing and sharing things that

505
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,660
led him to be able to do that so there's

506
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,130
no single person that's innovating and

507
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,930
coming up with things we all get to

508
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,390
stand on the shoulders of giants and

509
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:54,600
that's why I'm very happy to have all of

510
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:57,000
you here today with us for this episode

511
00:20:54,599 --> 00:21:00,179
so I guess what we'll do is we'll go

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,599
through welcome Ozzie from elysian

513
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,220
research just popped into the room dude

514
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,689
well I guess I guess I'd like to do a

515
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,850
little introduction this could probably

516
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,019
take the next hour considering there's

517
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:16,319
nine of us in here and it looks like two

518
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:18,299
turns is about to rip a bowl so yeah you

519
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,859
do that you do that you rip that bowl

520
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,579
because we're gonna start with you bro

521
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:26,399
I've got you elysian Eric from peer

522
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:28,589
pressure solvent list mine I'll

523
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,450
basically let you guys know but too

524
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:32,369
turnt why don't you give us your history

525
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,460
how you got into this and how you

526
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:38,250
figured out it was your passion tell us

527
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,410
something about it so basically uh like

528
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,089
three or four years ago I started seeing

529
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,250
everybody posting like more stuff about

530
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:45,359
Rosen Tech and everything else and it

531
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,920
kind of caught my eye because I've

532
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,049
always been just one of those people

533
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,690
that want to smoke excuse me the best

534
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:53,549
quality stuff and everything else and it

535
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,680
started off with getting some bubble

536
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:57,809
hash that my friend got that sucked ass

537
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,480
honestly and he needed something to do

538
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,769
with it so I went and cleaned it up for

539
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,660
him the best I could and we got like the

540
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:05,940
old I just bought a bunch of mash them

541
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,190
and folded up over it and I use

542
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,110
without a little bit and then I took a

543
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,429
break from swishing for a little bit

544
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:13,500
with the straightener because I'd really

545
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:15,028
like I have a hard time getting into

546
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,470
things unless I have like the proper

547
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:17,940
equipment to do it so I waited until

548
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,850
like I saw some of the first presses

549
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,379
come out and everything notes and after

550
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:24,209
that I thought I got on my first press

551
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:25,469
and everything and I use that and I just

552
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,940
pretty much started getting like all the

553
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,950
best quality flour that I could and

554
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,210
experimenting and just testing stuff at

555
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,190
different temperatures I hadn't seen

556
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,528
people do stuff I mean I also do

557
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,788
construction electrical work so I like

558
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:37,679
learning a little bit of stuff from like

559
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:39,119
the end of food that I've worked in and

560
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,610
I take that and try and bring it over

561
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,138
and then a lot of the newer stuff

562
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:45,778
whenever I started in the last like 2 or

563
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:47,519
so years when I upgraded my press and

564
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:50,669
everything got a better one with more

565
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,778
pressure and everything else I I was

566
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,309
able to develop more of like a good

567
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:54,659
technique and able to find better hatch

568
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:56,278
because you know how it goes as time

569
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,389
goes on things kind of just got a little

570
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:00,538
bit better with the industry and

571
00:22:57,388 --> 00:23:02,099
everything else and so probably about

572
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:03,599
like two years ago I started doing my

573
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:07,888
first butter chips with the hash and

574
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:09,240
stuff like that and I kept trying to

575
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:11,908
find like stuff that was better than

576
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,230
what I could make and I just always

577
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,490
wanted to produce the best quality stuff

578
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,808
to smoke and then I got the point where

579
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,950
everybody wanted it and I started to

580
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:19,500
produce them for everybody else and

581
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,269
everything not and then from there just

582
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,079
kind of took off and I always just liked

583
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:24,480
to experiment with different

584
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,980
temperatures and techniques and oh I

585
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,450
honestly like a lot of the stuff that I

586
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,889
found out was found out by accident

587
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,899
that's the best way to figure things out

588
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:32,548
I've learned that's how I figured out

589
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:34,168
and make like a solvent my sauce and how

590
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:37,408
to butter things out really well and

591
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:39,179
stuff like that yeah well here's one of

592
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:42,330
your shots right here absolutely

593
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,399
breathtaking looks just beautiful super

594
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:46,288
quality definitely the shot that I was

595
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:50,819
like oh I'm inviting this guy in for

596
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:52,829
sure so what was it an Instagram post

597
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:55,470
who where did you first hear about Rosen

598
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:57,000
um I just heard some friends talking

599
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,350
about from seeing it on Instagram and

600
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,148
then I started kind of looking into it

601
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:01,859
more and researching some like forums

602
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:03,750
and stuff like that and googling it and

603
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,069
then looking through Instagram and just

604
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,388
kind of hounding every kind of thing

605
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,668
that I could find information on

606
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:10,229
Facebook and stuff like that too and

607
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:13,049
just started finding anything out that I

608
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,548
could and then I found like a lot of

609
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:16,319
stuff I got a lot of information from

610
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:17,730
Alishan actually when they posted a lot

611
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,908
of melting points and stuff like that is

612
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,489
really whenever I started

613
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:24,159
like toning a lot more and figure a lot

614
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:25,389
of stuff out because that helps a lot

615
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,649
whenever you can find out for melting

616
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:28,628
points and stuff especially with the

617
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:31,238
hash and turning it into the Rosen

618
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:33,158
oh yeah the numbers in the data are

619
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:34,538
definitely going to be helpful I love

620
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,169
the fact that you know these companies

621
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:39,940
when I just met Eric and the guys from

622
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,729
peer pressure I was really stoked on

623
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,679
their digital readout that holds all the

624
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:46,119
different pressures and like it was I'm

625
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,999
sure he'll end up talking about it at

626
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:50,858
one point in time it's definitely great

627
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:54,460
to have all these different rosin makers

628
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:57,189
as well as rosin machine makers I think

629
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,649
the combination of the two is definitely

630
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,869
how we're gonna move this forward into

631
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:03,758
you know the last hour of the show which

632
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:05,048
will be the future of rosin well get to

633
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,470
talk about where we think that's going

634
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:10,479
and yeah thanks for showing up to turn

635
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,608
to skirt I really appreciate it I guess

636
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:17,259
we'll move over next to Elysian research

637
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:20,138
you guys want to is I'm not sure if it's

638
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:23,499
you Ozzie or it's your partner yeah

639
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:24,819
Ozzie yeah okay great well right on dude

640
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:26,919
why don't you tell us a little bit about

641
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:31,839
you guys and how you came to be with

642
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:33,669
elysian research I guess

643
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,888
Instagram was actually very instrumental

644
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:40,720
and kind of making things happen forums

645
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:44,319
everything else at some point when me

646
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,839
and my me and my partner actually went

647
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,939
to a lot of stuff that slogan was

648
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:54,398
actually doing at the time so it was

649
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,229
incredibly instrumental for myself as an

650
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:57,728
engineer because you know I saw a lot of

651
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:59,979
the equipment that people were currently

652
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:02,470
using and everything and so this was

653
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:04,629
definitely an area where you know we

654
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,479
thought we can try to help out in some

655
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:11,579
sort of way and a long way doing all the

656
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:14,590
research doing all that work it was just

657
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:16,358
very important for us to share all that

658
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:21,759
information with the with the community

659
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:25,509
in general so yeah but I mean besides

660
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:27,460
that we pretty much just got started it

661
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:31,910
was all just happenstance and since that

662
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:38,650
we just met things clicked and

663
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:41,600
were both kind of on board historically

664
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:44,360
I've always been a smoker my business

665
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,549
partner is actually a farmer so that's

666
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:47,929
and being an engineer that's kind of

667
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:51,799
where we were able to come together and

668
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:56,289
actually make our current unit and sort

669
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,289
of develop all the research around it

670
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:08,599
sorry I had myself on mute while I was

671
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,799
bong ripping tell us a little bit about

672
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:18,679
your unit dude so um our current unit is

673
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:22,309
actually a 30-ton unit it's all cnc

674
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,289
machined all made of like some crazy

675
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:28,250
tool steel and whatever the hell else

676
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:30,079
you know essentially uh the whole point

677
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,900
for us was to make a medium scale unit

678
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:37,069
that can actually essentially outperform

679
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:39,860
a lot of others and essentially increase

680
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:44,629
the output and that was pretty much her

681
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:46,369
main goal in that respect and as far as

682
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,840
that's concerned I believe that we

683
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:52,669
actually we were able to kind of hit a

684
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:54,169
mark but also it was a it was very

685
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:59,120
important for us to actually keep all

686
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:01,250
the manufacturing here in the US so you

687
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,329
know doing that and actually getting all

688
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,259
that together and everything was

689
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:08,119
actually quite complicated but it was

690
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,500
nice doing so because you know obviously

691
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,989
we're able to deal with all these like

692
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,210
American suppliers and everything which

693
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,759
I mean just makes the whole engineering

694
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,360
process a lot easier

695
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:25,640
besides that I mean we're actually using

696
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:28,459
electric electronics for our you know

697
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,470
for our plants which as some of you

698
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,569
might know our electric is actually a no

699
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,180
company but they've actually designed

700
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:36,769
and they've well they've redesigned some

701
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:41,360
of their controllers to actually be able

702
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:44,480
to supply power to our unit the other

703
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,679
thing about our unit is that I mean it

704
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,930
really only uses like

705
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,340
500 watts but it's it's rated for a

706
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,779
thousand watts you know and that's one

707
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:53,929
of the nice things about actually having

708
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:55,549
a nice digital controller I mean I

709
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,670
actually don't have very much experience

710
00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:01,009
with a lot of the other machines but I

711
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,960
know that everyone has their own merits

712
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:05,119
and everyone has their own strengths you

713
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,220
know so it's it's really interesting to

714
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,959
kind of just be in this form and

715
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,200
essentially and kind of hear everybody

716
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,660
out do you have any photos or video of

717
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,250
your unit I noticed your camera's not on

718
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,440
but maybe we could just put something on

719
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,559
real quick to show people you know what

720
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,950
it actually is yeah give me one second

721
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,960
here

722
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,059
yeah because I can I can I'm not sure

723
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,890
you should be able to turn it on to

724
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:29,359
screensaver for it because it's always

725
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,880
good to for people to be able to see

726
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:35,419
elysium is one of the unique ones in a

727
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,060
sense in that it it swivels so it's

728
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,620
dripping straight down I remember the

729
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:41,960
first time I saw it I was like oh like I

730
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:44,389
just love the fact that we're attempting

731
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,120
innovation and it's not you know like

732
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,650
you just just do it just a attempt to do

733
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,959
something different and always push

734
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,060
yourself and you know for me when no one

735
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,769
else was making bags it was kind of

736
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:56,720
boring and then as everyone started to

737
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,789
make bags it became more exciting and

738
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,339
even in the 20 years that I that we've

739
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:02,779
come out with bubble bags I always ask

740
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,459
people when they design something new

741
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:07,160
like I asked when my friends started

742
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:10,100
wrapping their washers in these you know

743
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,810
in these little sort of pad and filters

744
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,279
I'm like why are you doing that they're

745
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,230
like oh just to make it colder and I'm

746
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,299
like but you understand like four

747
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,769
degrees is the perfect temperature like

748
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,750
the heads are brittle they're breaking

749
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:24,079
off like you don't need to make it minus

750
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,509
three its but at the same time what we

751
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,669
could do is make it faster you know how

752
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:31,190
could we get more of the resin off more

753
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,960
efficiently as clean and make it faster

754
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,019
so I see the same thing with rosin

755
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,390
presses you know how can we make it

756
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:40,460
faster because obviously that's the home

757
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,480
units are great and awesome but now it's

758
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:49,670
gonna be how do we make it faster did

759
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:52,309
you find that length elysian Ozzie well

760
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,930
your muted I probably muted you I'm

761
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,789
you'd everyone just so you know if your

762
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,759
mics not muted I'll end up muting it so

763
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,230
remember

764
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,839
when you go to talk next time where's

765
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:03,269
the honor all right no problem no

766
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:06,679
problem well uh well I'll have a little

767
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:09,569
rosin puff what's everyone puffing on

768
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,100
huffing on some actually I got some

769
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:16,919
where's my bike here I was thinking of

770
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:18,929
pressing from the maple butter guys this

771
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,880
is a thirty percent yield er the

772
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:23,250
squishes it looks like it's it's like

773
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:28,140
someone put subpar hash in into the

774
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:32,069
press it just go wishes absolutely

775
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,240
beautiful I have my Sasquatch m1 set up

776
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:35,099
here next to the desk

777
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,779
I love how little it is and that I can

778
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,609
just have it read in my desk and you

779
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:40,529
know people some people that haven't

780
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:42,389
seen presses think that it's rather big

781
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,500
if they've only ever used a hair

782
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,630
straightener but I'm like yeah you

783
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,720
should try and lift my v2 into your car

784
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,000
and then see how that goes and yes I did

785
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,750
carry that from my driveway up to my

786
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,279
office by myself Matt and Joel so please

787
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:00,990
that's ridiculous

788
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:03,119
we do what we got to do I like the big

789
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,430
heavy units I like the small light units

790
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,379
I love a unit that I can oh wow Chad

791
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,930
thinks he's got it one two three four

792
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,090
five six seven eight nine would that be

793
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:17,100
nice to have kitch get him into the room

794
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:20,189
and be able to tell his story of of how

795
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:22,889
he came up with it because we need to

796
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,549
hear so let me see what he's saying he

797
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:28,800
is saying I think I got it it was a test

798
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:29,579
room right do you have the actual hashed

799
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,529
Church link

800
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:33,269
okay let's send him the actual hashed

801
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:37,019
Church link because man wouldn't that be

802
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:38,940
great to get him in here there's always

803
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:41,009
a lot of my friends live like in the

804
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,420
boonies like out in the in the boonies

805
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,029
where there's like no internet

806
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,310
connection high pressure was in that

807
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:54,750
situation I think all right let's send

808
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:56,399
that to him and well Elysium is gearing

809
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,369
up and finding that why don't we move

810
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,640
over to Eric and he can tell us how he

811
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:04,529
got into this where he came about

812
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,990
finding his passion and a little bit

813
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:09,029
about peer pressure hey how's it going

814
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,500
everyone just getting over cold sorry

815
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,480
mullah raspy

816
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,308
got a lot respect for everyone on the

817
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,349
panel here thank you for the invite it's

818
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:17,849
really cool to meet a lot of the Yogi's

819
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:19,500
in the industry and people that are

820
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:21,209
putting out some terrific stuff those

821
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,630
pictures you guys were putting up before

822
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,730
looked insane so nice work I've always

823
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,230
been passionate about cannabis ever

824
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,548
since you know my mom was catching me

825
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,409
smoking in high school

826
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:33,629
pretty much just dovetailed from there

827
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,070
and after I got out of school I was

828
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,620
working at tech startups and I just

829
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:39,750
wasn't really happy so I just dropped it

830
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:43,619
and when Colorado you know did

831
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,898
recreational here in 2014 things really

832
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,878
started gearing up after that and I

833
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,648
jumped ship and worked at massroots for

834
00:33:47,878 --> 00:33:51,148
a while kind of in their heyday when

835
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:52,798
they were actually really making moves

836
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:55,739
and that was a really good experience

837
00:33:52,798 --> 00:34:00,028
but then a friend of mine Josh who's the

838
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,940
co-founder of pure pressure we just hung

839
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:05,460
out and he was telling me about rosin

840
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,379
and you know I had taken some dabs and

841
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,088
was enjoying it quite a bit and he

842
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,318
started telling me this is gonna be big

843
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,659
you know you really want to come check

844
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:15,148
this out so I went over to peer pressure

845
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,470
saw what Ben and Josh were doing and he

846
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:19,378
just really sold me on the future of

847
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,789
rosin and I just jump ship started

848
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:23,009
working with peer pressure and it's

849
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:24,659
pretty much been history ever since I

850
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,690
really love where the industry is going

851
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,000
and and what we're doing I think rosin

852
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,289
has enormous promise and it's beautiful

853
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,969
to see that there's so many different

854
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:35,878
people contributing you know tons of

855
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,500
different manufacturers boutique growers

856
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,799
and you know extraction people I think

857
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,510
rosin just gives people a lot of power

858
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,539
to make concentrates and make top-notch

859
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:48,179
stuff so you know my role at the company

860
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:50,279
is not in the engineering capacity but

861
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,769
you know we're a hundred percent USA

862
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,230
company and kind of like Ozzy was saying

863
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:56,489
I think you know having companies here

864
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,710
that are explored in cannabis

865
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:01,169
technologies is really cool I mean in

866
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,880
North America North America is gonna be

867
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,220
driving the rasen industry for the rest

868
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,780
of the world as you know Germany Spain

869
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:08,639
all these other countries start coming

870
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,550
online and we start seeing a lot of

871
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,949
growth there so I love what's going on

872
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,289
with rosin I think you know what we do

873
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:17,789
is make a press that's really geared

874
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:19,619
towards the highest quality rosin

875
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,029
possible and also like Ossie said you

876
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,769
know everyone's got a different take and

877
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,580
everyone's got a different goal with

878
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:27,289
their equipment so

879
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:29,269
happy to answer any other questions but

880
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:30,559
you know I think Ben and Josh since they

881
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:32,659
were the founders you know they have a

882
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,549
pretty interesting story where Josh was

883
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:37,099
an industry specialist he was growing

884
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,019
and blasting and tried to get into rosin

885
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:40,610
and was pretty unhappy with the results

886
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:42,469
you know using some of the very early

887
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,840
generation rosin presses like you were

888
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:46,309
discussing not getting great results and

889
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,990
then his friend

890
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:49,279
Industrial Engineer he came to him and

891
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:51,379
said hey can you just make me a better

892
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,970
rosin press these ones from overseas

893
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,530
just aren't really doing it for me and

894
00:35:52,969 --> 00:36:00,169
that's pretty much the story of peer

895
00:35:54,530 --> 00:36:03,140
pressure and how it was born very cool

896
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:05,659
dude very cool do you want to maybe show

897
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:07,190
a little quick clip or photo of the of

898
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:08,868
the peer pressure machine or I've got

899
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,670
one set up here if you want me to put it

900
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:13,130
on yeah sure that might be either

901
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,349
how to use Mike's yeah yeah this one's

902
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,660
how to use the Pikes Peak rosin press is

903
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:19,309
that a good one yeah I mean we've got if

904
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:20,920
you're looking at our YouTube channel

905
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:23,570
we've got a bunch of good videos up

906
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,820
pretty much any of them all fit the bill

907
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,490
our Instagram also has a lot of good

908
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,920
content so we've got a lot of media out

909
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:32,599
there yeah well this is to me it's

910
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,220
worthwhile I mean I know I always try to

911
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,099
make it so it's not a commercial but

912
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:39,049
these guys are all producing units and I

913
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:41,329
we can talk about them you still have to

914
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:44,420
see them and kind of get an idea I saw

915
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:47,299
both solvent 0 as well as peer pressure

916
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,800
at the lift conference like I was kind

917
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,840
of stoked on both of them for different

918
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,160
reasons you know like solvent zero

919
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,140
coming out of the commercial production

920
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,579
looking at things in a way where it's

921
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:57,139
like oh I want to create something

922
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,329
that's got a flow and that he could

923
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:01,129
really you know run through 30 40 plus

924
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:03,349
pounds in a day with it with a single

925
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:05,030
unit but then the peer pressure guys had

926
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:07,159
this really advanced like computer

927
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,650
screen that was measuring and keeping

928
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:12,289
all the recipes that you used and you

929
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,030
know his reply to how to get more out of

930
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:15,920
it was to scale up looks like you know

931
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,420
just scale up you've got like four of

932
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,550
them going and you'll have like four

933
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,630
times as much rosin so I was impressed

934
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,850
with both of them for different reasons

935
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,579
we might as well put this 3-minute

936
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:29,509
how-to video on good time for everyone

937
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:32,420
to get a dab in and I'll just figure it

938
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:37,280
out over here let me see how I can do it

939
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,710
so it's not like oh let's see what I got

940
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,910
here

941
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:44,250
okay I think we got it I think we got it

942
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:47,730
my monitor broke recently so now I'm

943
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:51,449
using this absolutely insane 40 inch TV

944
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:53,490
as my monitor and it's it's not it's not

945
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:56,118
ideal but yeah let's check this out real

946
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:56,118
quick and see

947
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:13,960
[Music]

948
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:31,469
[Music]

949
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,230
[Music]

950
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,119
[Music]

951
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:01,469
[Music]

952
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:46,510
yeah a sorry great suggestion this is

953
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:49,000
kind of one of our old videos we have a

954
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:52,359
new LCD touchscreen technology that's in

955
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,269
all of our new presses there's my finger

956
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:57,130
yeah it's quite a bit bigger you know

957
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,300
one of the things you know soil grown

958
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,940
that you're talking with with nicotine

959
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,100
being really you know influential in the

960
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,590
industry I'll just share a little story

961
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:07,389
about how we linked up with essential

962
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,369
extracts in nicotine so one of the

963
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:10,900
really key features of our presses are

964
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:13,630
dual pressure and it lets you ramp

965
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,519
pressure since it's pneumatic and the

966
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,550
essential extract came by you know there

967
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,750
in Denver and they learned about us and

968
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,950
they said hey you know another Denver

969
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,050
company and we'd love to go check out

970
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:25,118
what you guys are doing so they came by

971
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,070
and they had you know some just amazing

972
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,900
hash you know much better hash than we

973
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,059
were used to seeing from you know most

974
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,769
of our prospective customers and we're

975
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:34,269
pressing it and it just kept blowing out

976
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:35,889
bags and we thought you know what they

977
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:37,659
said we love your press and we love your

978
00:41:35,889 --> 00:41:39,250
equipment but you know if we can't get

979
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:41,409
some more control I don't think that you

980
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,030
know we're gonna be able to use it so

981
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:44,440
then Ben and Josh kind of got their

982
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,260
heads together and came up with the idea

983
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,639
to ramp the pressure with the toggle

984
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,440
switch there with the compressed air

985
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,049
input and then after that they were sold

986
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,210
and started using our press so you know

987
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,250
it's really cool how you know different

988
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:59,710
needs allow people to innovate on

989
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,929
different things you know kind of like

990
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:04,210
Ozzy was saying depending on what your

991
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:05,799
requirements are in your lab or your

992
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,260
environment you're gonna want or need

993
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,940
different things potentially so you know

994
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,340
different challenges are always gonna

995
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,780
rise and you know manufacturers are

996
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,090
trying to come up with the best

997
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,670
solutions possible for that so you know

998
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,650
recording data being able to dial in the

999
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,300
perfect press I mean that's kind of what

1000
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,220
we're really striving for more than

1001
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,700
anything is just trying to figure out

1002
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:29,108
what is the perfect press for a given

1003
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:30,669
material you know what's the best

1004
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:33,190
temperature the least amount of time

1005
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,159
pressing it floor for maximum terpene

1006
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,659
and you know preservation of your

1007
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:39,250
material itself so you know that's

1008
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,199
really what we strive for it was really

1009
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,789
cool I wasn't actually up in Canada for

1010
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,349
the lift conference the rest of team was

1011
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:45,730
and they said that they had a really

1012
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:47,380
good time meeting everyone up there I

1013
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,750
mean I think the scene is really booming

1014
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,570
in Canada and it's really cool to see

1015
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,340
where things are going so love to you

1016
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:57,280
here what everyone else is getting into

1017
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,960
and if anyone's ever in Denver love to

1018
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,690
have you by the factory you know we have

1019
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,829
people buy all the time open invite you

1020
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,780
know we're pretty much right in the

1021
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:07,299
heart of Denver so anyone that's ever

1022
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,910
interested and coming by and taking a

1023
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:12,330
DAB and checking us out anytime you're

1024
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:14,440
in Denver you know come say what's up

1025
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:17,259
awesome dude thanks for sharing yeah

1026
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,510
that's LCD screen or the screen that you

1027
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,310
the digital screen that you have in lift

1028
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,780
was much bigger for sure I was noticing

1029
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:27,219
that right away it had some more

1030
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,840
information to on it but I guess Elysium

1031
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:30,879
Ozzie you wanted me to share that

1032
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,059
picture and you can send me the link for

1033
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,490
your press right here in the chapter

1034
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:40,900
that's in this particular box top left

1035
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:42,789
blue icon and very smart as well Eric

1036
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,559
very cool that you guys are you know

1037
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:46,239
collecting that data and creating a

1038
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,119
press with as much control as possible

1039
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:52,029
ramping up and all the additional things

1040
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,269
is just its innovative right and it's

1041
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:57,040
it's one more niche aspect of the rasen

1042
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:59,320
industry and there's so many different

1043
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:02,139
ones it's such a new industry it's

1044
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,000
exciting to watch it taking off here in

1045
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:07,359
the last couple years I'm just mostly a

1046
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,460
user but I definitely do consult for LPS

1047
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,220
here in Canada as well as around the

1048
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,920
world and I'm always telling them about

1049
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:17,379
the presses that that I use and that I

1050
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,700
like so keep up the great work

1051
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,869
Ozzie did you want me to share that

1052
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:25,149
picture are you there sir

1053
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:27,190
yeah I thought I'm just hold on a second

1054
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,230
here cuz I can put it up on my screen

1055
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:37,769
the picture anyway and then you can send

1056
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:42,579
me the link so there is the elysian boom

1057
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:47,039
looks pretty beefcake come pick those

1058
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:50,259
plates they're actually 6x6

1059
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:53,440
okay good question good question right

1060
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:59,080
off the bat the true absolutely it's

1061
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:01,570
actually rated for 45 tons all right is

1062
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:03,279
that press built on a swivel so you can

1063
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:06,400
bend it all the way to where its face is

1064
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,760
straight down essentially you actually

1065
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,820
have

1066
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,060
some extensions that are attachable or

1067
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,470
removable from the actual press

1068
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:15,820
depending on my essentially what you

1069
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:18,730
what it is that you need or how what's

1070
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,830
our is that you prefer but yeah they're

1071
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,960
removable and it allows you to actually

1072
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:25,690
tip the machine over I'm gonna go ahead

1073
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:33,579
and send that link for another image of

1074
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:37,780
the actual machine tipped over alright

1075
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:42,579
did you send that to me yes one second

1076
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:44,290
here I got the first one so yeah there's

1077
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:46,358
obviously innovation going on can you

1078
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:51,090
imagine when we had hashed Church

1079
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:53,500
episode 25 we there were no machines I

1080
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:55,960
remember during that conversation it was

1081
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:59,469
a hair straightener world we were all

1082
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:02,409
rocking hair straighteners and a lot of

1083
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:05,169
large bald men were buying hair

1084
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:08,618
straighteners so i remember a lot of

1085
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:15,460
people laughing about pressing buds yeah

1086
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:15,970
i don't hear them laughing anymore now

1087
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,750
did it

1088
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:22,569
that one was a mind blower that was you

1089
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,880
know it gave me a new appreciation for

1090
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,130
Bud much the way sort of vaporizing does

1091
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,930
but being able to extract the oil off of

1092
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:31,510
bud in an instant like what an

1093
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:33,159
incredible way to test packs if you're

1094
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,020
purchasing large amounts what an

1095
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:37,539
incredible way to tell you test small

1096
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:39,159
packs if you're purchasing small amounts

1097
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:40,929
it's just such an incredible I don't

1098
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:43,779
have to trust anything you say I need to

1099
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:46,239
take a DAB I'll gladly buy a 1 gram bud

1100
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,250
before I get my ants or my pound or my

1101
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,529
10 pack or my hundred pack whatever it

1102
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:52,539
is you're looking at bottom line being

1103
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:56,760
able to test the percentage before you

1104
00:46:52,539 --> 00:47:00,670
run it is some pretty baller [ __ ] I

1105
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:04,210
would say absolutely so I have a

1106
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:06,039
question please look if you guys what

1107
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,199
you guys think the you know it back in

1108
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:09,639
the day all the Mexican do you know the

1109
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:12,399
Mexican cartels and people like that

1110
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:14,230
that were uh you know packaging up the

1111
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,480
schwag ass [ __ ] you know the stuff that

1112
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,309
like came wrapped up and like seeds all

1113
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,840
squished into it you know it you know

1114
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:22,869
I'm not like the really garbage

1115
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,160
[ __ ] Britney but earth I wonder if when

1116
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:27,489
they were pressing that because they use

1117
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,799
Jack setups to press that herb and I was

1118
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:31,719
wondering maybe like if they're laughing

1119
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,610
the whole time because they're taking

1120
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:35,889
their herb and they're smashing it up

1121
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,930
into the press and like all the goopy

1122
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:39,759
presidents just pouring out the sides of

1123
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:42,039
the press and they're probably filling

1124
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,230
up mason jars with this [ __ ] and just

1125
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:45,969
like dumping the herb off to all the

1126
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,380
Americans and I was wondering if you

1127
00:47:45,969 --> 00:47:50,049
guys thought it might be a possibility

1128
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,269
that they were making awesome before any

1129
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:56,200
of us knew what rosin was the secret of

1130
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:58,809
Mexico I would say for sure just like

1131
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:00,909
back in Lebanon with hash and twisting

1132
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,769
of the bag I'm sure the cotton bag was

1133
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:06,009
oozing resin at one point in time over a

1134
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:07,989
fire like guaranteed they were using

1135
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,520
sledgehammers to in a more archaic

1136
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:11,379
version of what you were talking about

1137
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,059
jamaica for years that's where a lot of

1138
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,470
that gum comes from the edge of these

1139
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:18,880
big hammers guaranteed there was epic

1140
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:21,549
rosin content that was coming out of

1141
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,140
there it just you know there was no way

1142
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:25,390
to popularize it there might even been

1143
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:27,400
people that knew on us on it on a small

1144
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:29,259
level but it wasn't until soil grown

1145
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,389
posted that [ __ ] on Instagram and

1146
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,690
everyone had a [ __ ] iPhone or Samsung

1147
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:35,799
in their pocket and it was like boom

1148
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:40,300
millions of people just learned about

1149
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:42,460
this just like that yeah I just noticed

1150
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,560
that like when you when you squish Doug

1151
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,720
after you're done squishing it it

1152
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,400
normally looks like the Mexican drink

1153
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,949
that they used to get on the East Coast

1154
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,010
so I feel like I've even seen that

1155
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:55,929
shimmer that shine yes outside of those

1156
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,820
bricks and I'm like men these dudes

1157
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:59,409
might have been doing it before a lot of

1158
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,730
the buzz and like they don't even know

1159
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:02,500
what the [ __ ] they were doing they were

1160
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,329
just laughing like better shake it's

1161
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,570
just what I hire the next wag has done

1162
00:49:04,329 --> 00:49:09,250
or even worse than a total harsh reality

1163
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,730
they were just tossing it out it's like

1164
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,800
oh get rid of that [ __ ] it looks ugly

1165
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:16,719
because it kind of used to be like that

1166
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,390
like people just threw everything away

1167
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:21,159
that didn't fit into the marketplace it

1168
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,259
was really a particular person that

1169
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:25,599
would only but you know like a skunk man

1170
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,190
Sam that would be like no no that's the

1171
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,559
most important thing because he doesn't

1172
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,619
think the way the market thinks he

1173
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:33,699
thinks the way like a true head thinks

1174
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,969
which is just quality

1175
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:39,849
quality quality and so give thanks to

1176
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:42,549
discuss man Sam for all he's done so why

1177
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:45,069
don't you do your uh your rosin

1178
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:48,039
introduction there solid 'less mind we

1179
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,650
are up to you right now tell us how you

1180
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:52,210
got how you fell you discovered it well

1181
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,340
pretty much I was uh back in Florida

1182
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,840
sitting at a homies house he was

1183
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:58,390
actually scrolling through Facebook and

1184
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,550
he came across the post on Facebook that

1185
00:49:58,389 --> 00:50:02,500
had somebody showing that you could

1186
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,960
squish a pod in a piece of parchment and

1187
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,090
I was laughing I'm like yeah right

1188
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,949
that's straight [ __ ] like they got

1189
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:11,559
hair straighteners squish apart get it

1190
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:13,719
dab yeah alright so we literally grabbed

1191
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:15,519
some dogs went to the store bought some

1192
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,649
parchment took his old lady's [ __ ]

1193
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,050
hair straightener then we made some the

1194
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:22,900
first button pressed man I was like wow

1195
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,760
this just made instant dance like this

1196
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,730
is like literally you went from nothing

1197
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,320
to something no purge no [ __ ] it's

1198
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:31,599
on the paper like you can take a DAB

1199
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,760
right now that pretty much opened my

1200
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,219
eyes to a lot of [ __ ] so when I moved to

1201
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,260
California I started making bubble hash

1202
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:40,509
had access to material being in Humboldt

1203
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,800
County and the bubble hash wasn't the

1204
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,750
greatest either you know I mean just

1205
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,480
like [ __ ] phil was saying like half

1206
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,400
melt garbage most the time so I was

1207
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,320
taking that stuff and I literally like

1208
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,599
for one event I used a hair straightener

1209
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,160
and I crushed out a quarter pound of

1210
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,170
rosin I made a quarter pound with my

1211
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:57,879
foot you know what I mean using my foot

1212
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,710
sticking it underneath my foot stamp it

1213
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,660
on it you know what I mean and by the

1214
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:03,579
time I was done with that I realized

1215
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,589
that the event the next day that I could

1216
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:07,809
barely walk like I was having trouble

1217
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:09,720
walking my ass cheek was locking up on

1218
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:12,400
me my thigh was I was getting like

1219
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:14,769
spasms from all this press and I did the

1220
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,849
night before so then I was like all

1221
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:17,980
right there's got to be a better way

1222
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:19,989
then you guys did the hash search then

1223
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,699
you guys showed the t-shirt press I'm

1224
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:23,709
like man I'd much rather be you know

1225
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:25,569
smashing my hand down and like pushing

1226
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:27,039
the press down than like stomping my

1227
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:29,289
foot this was before people were using

1228
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,840
clamps so I was like stomping my foot

1229
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:32,289
people were using their elbows it was a

1230
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,300
nightmare

1231
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:36,219
so the t-shirt press definitely took it

1232
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,220
to the next level and then of course the

1233
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:41,319
Sasquatch bras and pressed the v1 but I

1234
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:42,369
bought that I was [ __ ] stoked even

1235
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,340
though I had to put the plates together

1236
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:46,420
to keep him because I produce a lot so

1237
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,230
I'm the only thing that I didn't like

1238
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,159
about that press with

1239
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,480
fact that I had to put the plates

1240
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:51,759
together because I could have produced

1241
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,409
every like five or 10 presses I noticed

1242
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,270
that put the plates back together

1243
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:57,549
warming back up otherwise I wasn't

1244
00:51:55,269 --> 00:52:00,309
getting the same results but other than

1245
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:02,230
that that's like like the history for me

1246
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:04,358
man like from the foot like back in

1247
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:08,650
Florida all the way to the point where

1248
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:10,630
look now you've got the v2 at 2.5 I mean

1249
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:13,210
it's like literally I don't know man I

1250
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:15,400
can do crazy presses now like I turn the

1251
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,949
work I used to take like days to do in

1252
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,570
the hours well dude I'll tell you you

1253
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:21,460
just made me really laugh when you

1254
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:24,130
talked about the injury that you got

1255
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:26,980
because both D 420k and I both got

1256
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,380
injured making Roz and [ __ ] I did my

1257
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,840
neck and so bad it hurt for weeks I was

1258
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,579
[ __ ] squeezing that [ __ ]

1259
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,400
it was like ha I just gotta get every

1260
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:38,170
last drop out of it so my hats off to

1261
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,260
the innovators and the makers of the

1262
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:44,829
rosin process because holy [ __ ] dude

1263
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:47,800

1265

1266
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,619

1267
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,329
was [ __ ] to hurting me and I was

1268
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:57,190
crippled like you're saying walking

1269
00:52:55,329 --> 00:53:00,519
around the event like man what the [ __ ]

1270
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:02,440
is wrong with me and the whole night I'm

1271
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:03,909
taking [ __ ] are taking a little

1272
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,010
hatchback it's putting him into papers

1273
00:53:03,909 --> 00:53:08,289
sticking him in the air strength or

1274
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:10,000
standing up on it squat back down all

1275
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:12,670
this flying up and down home [ __ ]

1276
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,289
night it steppin I [ __ ] myself up but

1277
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:16,420
like I still don't even know if that was

1278
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:17,679
soil groans post or not you know what I

1279
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,690
mean I don't know if I was late to the

1280
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,519
[ __ ] party it might have even been

1281
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,409
approached that soil grown made that was

1282
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:26,079
on Facebook that someone shared and one

1283
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:28,358
of the groups resulted I'm not sure but

1284
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,400
I'm doubting it was anybody but him you

1285
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:33,519
know what I mean

1286
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,260
yeah ya know for sure I feel the same

1287
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:38,019
way obviously once we got a hold of it

1288
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:40,060
it spread so fast right it wasn't like

1289
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:42,340
this bottleneck it really went like this

1290
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:46,210
you know like well at one point in time

1291
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:49,980
with Jeff Church and Johnny B and Remo

1292
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:52,389
and dot on an errand for DNA and like I

1293
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,250

00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:06,220
straightener like the one that's as

1299
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,950

be here so I got into rosin

1331
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:39,789
about just a little over a year ago I

1332
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:42,909
wasn't really a heavy davender before I

1333
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:44,980
found out about rawson you know BHO just

1334
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:47,500
ruined my day dabbing ruined my day if I

1335
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,619
dabbed in the morning I was I mean I was

1336
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:53,889
done and I was at the healing harvest

1337
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:57,670
fest up in Layton Ville a little over a

1338
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:59,500
year ago and I saw PES bro rosin as

1339
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:02,079
their house a cool logo this stuff's

1340
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:05,380
really bright colored and uh you know

1341
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,860
they talked me into a dab and I was just

1342
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,360
floored

1343
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,480
I was like wait you can make something

1344
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:14,410
that tastes this good and there's no

1345
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,389
chemicals involved and I was I it just

1346
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:17,710
became my mission I was like I want to

1347
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:23,920
do that I want to learn more about this

1348
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:26,980
and just kind of hopped right in so I

1349
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,150
was also new to Instagram as well and I

1350
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:32,800
saw soil grown and Samba was mine to

1351
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:35,680
turn to skirt and a couple other guys

1352
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,570
and I was just like you know the little

1353
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:38,980
blackish green stuff that ran out of my

1354
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,390
hair straightener was not like what I

1355
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:45,460
was seeing online I was just you know

1356
00:56:40,389 --> 00:56:48,279
what do I got to do to produce to get

1357
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,679
this result and it's just been my

1358
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:55,720
mission since just practice practice

1359
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:57,759
practice ruined a lot of pounds wasted a

1360
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:59,619
lot of time in the car and on the

1361
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:03,010
washing machine running shitty material

1362
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:04,839
realizing that you have to run you have

1363
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:08,440
to have a great starting material that's

1364
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:10,510
the that's the main metric to it and see

1365
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,460
and how did you learn that you learned

1366
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,200
that by having not great starting

1367
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:18,429
material and that's what people should

1368
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:20,139
not be afraid to do yes yes so I put up

1369
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:23,739
some with your work for everyone to see

1370
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:28,539
while you're talking oh yeah the Kuban

1371
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:30,639
please um I want to make a giant one but

1372
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:33,039
um it's you know it's it's such a labor

1373
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:36,759
of love that having that much rosin

1374
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:37,960
around it once it's just you know you

1375
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,470
don't want it to go bad you know what's

1376
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,470
oxidized

1377
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:46,710
about quality yeah you know yes so I get

1378
00:57:45,489 --> 00:57:48,929
a lot of questions

1379
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,608
and the main thing I just want to tell

1380
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:53,368
people is like just you can save

1381
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:55,319
yourself a lot of hassle if you just

1382
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:57,630
source really good material but you're

1383
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:59,309
also gonna like be in tears when you

1384
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:02,220
ruin that good material so I think it is

1385
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:04,049
important to kind of work your way up

1386
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:05,759
just kind of like coming from the

1387
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:08,519
culinary industry you know I started out

1388
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,140
in delis and pizzerias and then I went

1389
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:12,659
to golf courses and then I finally got

1390
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:14,098
like a Bistro job and then finally into

1391
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:16,710
fine dining and stuff you have to

1392
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:19,830
develop the skill set and the respect

1393
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:21,809
and also learning a lot from your peers

1394
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,358
there's people who are doing this way

1395
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:27,088
better than you and there's something to

1396
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:30,358
it you know you can't just expect to hop

1397
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:32,489
in and make a result and I'm realizing

1398
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:35,219
you know how much work that everybody's

1399
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:36,959
put into this craft is um it's really

1400
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:39,509
cool that just you know this day and age

1401
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,858
of Instagram that you have this resource

1402
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:43,619
right at your fingertips

1403
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:45,119
and more often than not if you're

1404
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:48,838
respectful people are willing to answer

1405
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,550
your questions and you know everybody on

1406
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:52,949
this panel has probably got DMS from me

1407
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:55,640
from a year ago asking the stupidest

1408
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:55,639
[ __ ] questions

1409
00:58:56,150 --> 00:59:01,170
yeah no way to do so don't be afraid to

1410
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,960
ask the stupid questions and don't be

1411
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,700
afraid to receive the answer that's not

1412
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,010
the answer you think you're gonna get

1413
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:09,899
from your stupid question because your

1414
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:13,140
reaction to the stoop when someone

1415
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:15,269
replies to your stupid question it might

1416
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:17,159
not be the way you want it to be but I

1417
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:18,539
guarantee you there's gold nuggets in

1418
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:22,949
there nonetheless even though it might

1419
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:25,550
be hard to read yes it also might not be

1420
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:29,789
what you want to hear you know you might

1421
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:32,280
if you only have a limited view of your

1422
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:34,050
method and your technique you just you

1423
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,080
haven't literally done enough squishes

1424
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:39,539
and opens your mind to just different

1425
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:42,299
perspectives of it to unlock what it is

1426
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:44,608
that you're seeking and I you know I

1427
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:47,400
squished a lot of you know two three

1428
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:50,848
star bubble hash about a year ago and

1429
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,980
most of the spring and then when we

1430
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:56,210
started growing with the express intent

1431
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:59,280
of squishing everything that we grow

1432
00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:00,269
it's it started to click and the first

1433
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,060
time liked

1434
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:05,070
last year was was tough because you know

1435
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:07,699
I I finally grew a good crop of weed for

1436
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:10,470
once in my life and now I was about to

1437
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:13,049
offer it all up to the rosin press and

1438
01:00:10,469 --> 01:00:15,629
it came out okay but after having a

1439
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:17,610
second crop last year and everything I

1440
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:19,579
learned from the first one and just kind

1441
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:23,220
of hopping right back into processing

1442
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:25,789
after the full season crop was just it

1443
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:28,079
was cool it I learned more in the last

1444
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:30,509
three months than I did in the previous

1445
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,569
nine and now I just feel I'm at a level

1446
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:35,520
where I'm more receptive to learning you

1447
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:39,480
know I've really only been doing this a

1448
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:41,849
short time but I'm very passionate about

1449
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,309
it so what were some of your revelations

1450
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:45,779
you know not to go too into detail but

1451
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:47,909
just to give us a little bit of an idea

1452
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:51,830
some of the things that were learnt from

1453
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:51,829
the first crop versus the second crop

1454
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:59,820
executing a faster press when pressing

1455
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:01,710
flour in the first crop you know I was

1456
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:03,120
letting my material warm up too long I

1457
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:05,429
wasn't bringing the plates down far

1458
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,739
enough and I was getting a darker color

1459
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:09,419
and also where the rosin would be in

1460
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:12,029
between the parchment between the place

1461
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,130
I would notice that it had this kind of

1462
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:16,320
cooked effect and I started thinking

1463
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,849
well I want to get this stuff just warm

1464
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:21,240
enough and loose enough and then get it

1465
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:22,980
out of there and you know you can do

1466
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:27,449
that at a low temperature you can do

1467
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:29,550
that at a high temperature it's it's all

1468
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:31,919
experimentation every material is

1469
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:34,019
different as well yeah absolutely and

1470
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,450
that's you know even with such a tip

1471
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:38,579
that you just gave it's still required

1472
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:40,469
to do all the work it's not like the

1473
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:43,319
tips gonna save you doing all the work

1474
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:45,509
and learning the material you know try

1475
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,950
sifting and wet washing is not too too

1476
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:50,190
different there's different types of

1477
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:52,469
resins they all react differently and if

1478
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:55,619
you pay attention to those subtle subtle

1479
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:57,899
differences you can just you can have

1480
01:01:55,619 --> 01:02:00,359
advantages because a lot of people just

1481
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,190
aren't paying the same amount of

1482
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,740
attention I think everyone's got the

1483
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:06,539
ability it's just it's always I always

1484
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:08,279
gravitate towards people such as

1485
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:10,289
yourselves on the panel that are doing

1486
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,559
it at a high excellence a high rate of

1487
01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:15,670
excellence

1488
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:17,859
that it's it's people are tall you guys

1489
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:19,659
are really doing is a you're paying more

1490
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:21,130
attention than the average person you're

1491
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:22,808
paying attention to the material that

1492
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,849
you're even bothering running and when

1493
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:26,319
you run that material you're actually

1494
01:02:24,849 --> 01:02:28,390
paying attention to the temperature of

1495
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,458
your plate so the PSI and the materials

1496
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:32,558
being used at the times and these are

1497
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:34,929
things that if you just kind of act a

1498
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,459
little less a fare about you're not

1499
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:38,169
going to get the same results and it's

1500
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:40,028
true each little thing that you make a

1501
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:42,338
mistake along the way you can end up

1502
01:02:40,028 --> 01:02:45,219
with a sort of darker less desirable

1503
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:47,528
less chirpy material I personally never

1504
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:50,289
pressed any burnt popcorn but I did see

1505
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:52,869
it and I was like wow that is definitely

1506
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:54,549
I kind of got the idea why all these oil

1507
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:56,349
guys were like all rows and it's just

1508
01:02:54,548 --> 01:02:58,150
all burnt popcorn it's because the first

1509
01:02:56,349 --> 01:03:00,939
time they tried it they did it so

1510
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:03,579
terribly poor probably the same way they

1511
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:05,949
make oil that they ended up with this

1512
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,869
very low-quality rosin and I was like

1513
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:10,239
man I'm not seeing that at all like I

1514
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:12,278
don't see that I see like beautiful

1515
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:14,228
beautiful [ __ ] that look you know looks

1516
01:03:12,278 --> 01:03:16,869
just like the photos behind me on my

1517
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:20,108
wall super quality super Terr pritch

1518
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:22,539
grabs me I'm coughing I just don't see

1519
01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:24,788
the reality that that the heat is

1520
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:27,309
destroying all the terpenes I mean

1521
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:29,739
obviously it must be volatize insomuch

1522
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:31,449
maybe the most volatile ones are the

1523
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:34,329
harshest ones and that's why we've

1524
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:37,298
always cured them out of our but before

1525
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:39,880
we smoked because they're not super

1526
01:03:37,298 --> 01:03:42,429
enjoyable I think that as I get older I

1527
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,249
want less to do with those super caustic

1528
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:46,959
volatile early terpenes and terpenoids

1529
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:52,088
that usually are the ones that would

1530
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:55,719
cure out in your curing process so I

1531
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:58,958
guess next up we got Lindsay from the

1532
01:03:55,719 --> 01:04:02,139
gorilla rosin press fellow Canadian in

1533
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:04,708
the house you want to give us a little

1534
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:13,558
explanation as to how you got into this

1535
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:20,948
Lindsay oh you're you're also on a phone

1536
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:23,298
oh you made it now you're unmuted no I

1537
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:25,159
can't hear you again

1538
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:28,849
that's weird I heard him say of course I

1539
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:31,489
muted myself but now I don't hear maybe

1540
01:04:28,849 --> 01:04:33,380
the mic underneath is blocked sometimes

1541
01:04:31,489 --> 01:04:35,199
I actually sent out an etiquette in

1542
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,459
regards to you don't come in on a phone

1543
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:39,199
mainly because it shakes the screen

1544
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:41,629
really bad there's a lot of motion and

1545
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,188
honestly phones cause more problems than

1546
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:45,048
they then they don't usually if there's

1547
01:04:43,188 --> 01:04:48,588
a technical difficulty it'll be because

1548
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:50,929
you're in on a phone maybe try to figure

1549
01:04:48,588 --> 01:04:52,278
that out come back in on a computer if

1550
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:54,409
you've got one we definitely want to

1551
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:54,588
hear from you okay thanks oh there you

1552
01:04:54,409 --> 01:04:57,709
are

1553
01:04:54,588 --> 01:05:00,078
no hurry okay look at that dude how

1554
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,828
close was that cool yeah sorry about

1555
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:06,949
that

1556
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:08,719
I got your link this morning yeah great

1557
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:11,568
great panel I sort of been pulling

1558
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:16,068
everybody here I got into cannabis when

1559
01:05:11,568 --> 01:05:21,199
I was 14 years old you know these

1560
01:05:16,068 --> 01:05:23,808
[ __ ] joints are doing BOTS and Paul

1561
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:25,608
just taking chemistry class weed we grab

1562
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:29,929
some the equipment and four or five of

1563
01:05:25,608 --> 01:05:32,328
us would go and make pho at night so

1564
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:33,469
I've always kind of delved into

1565
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:36,679
different things

1566
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:42,648
my background is manufacturing so when I

1567
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:45,108
first saw people making a rosin I think

1568
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:46,969
I saw it on High Street early episode of

1569
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:49,788
house church and read about it in High

1570
01:05:46,969 --> 01:05:53,778
Times so I started following ice

1571
01:05:49,789 --> 01:05:54,919
sasquatch and guys like a lesion and I

1572
01:05:53,778 --> 01:05:56,239
thought you know there's nobody's doing

1573
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:59,808
this in Canada nope nobody's making

1574
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:01,849
presses so I put my first press together

1575
01:05:59,809 --> 01:06:02,899
with the canadian tire shop dress and

1576
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:06,079
some plates I got off online

1577
01:06:02,898 --> 01:06:06,888
and then I thought you know we can do

1578
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,229
better than this the heat distribution

1579
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:11,599
and pressure distribution wasn't just

1580
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:13,338
wasn't good enough so I hired a few

1581
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,459
friends that refresh professional

1582
01:06:13,338 --> 01:06:18,409
engineers and we've we've been through

1583
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:24,318
three prototypes we started at the

1584
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:27,469
beginning of 2017 then we launched in

1585
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:30,409
October with their final prototype which

1586
01:06:27,469 --> 01:06:33,259
is made with them with special alloy

1587
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:34,699
castings and has a very open concept

1588
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:36,168
because there's a bunch of things we

1589
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,579
want to add to our breasts in terms of

1590
01:06:36,168 --> 01:06:41,059
technology

1591
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:43,039
right now we're working on we source

1592
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:47,539
pressure transducers and electric motors

1593
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:50,840
for our Power Team hydraulic rams and

1594
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:52,759
we're looking at automating it but up to

1595
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,280
now it's been a hand pump which is I

1596
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,930
still feel the best way to press rosin

1597
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:01,100
just because you got you get that

1598
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:02,480
feeling you see it and you can just get

1599
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:04,369
on top of it when it needs to be and I

1600
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,500
just feel you get the highest quality

1601
01:07:04,369 --> 01:07:10,940
but at lifts people were asking about

1602
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:13,280
automating it and stuff and we already

1603
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:14,990
had we started we never used the of PID

1604
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,180
we started with the industrial

1605
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:19,659
controller from the beginning so I can

1606
01:07:17,179 --> 01:07:21,980
automate this thing you know I envision

1607
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:26,750
you know robots feeding this thing in

1608
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:29,300
the future Rasen watts yeah that's sort

1609
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:31,280
of does sort of like the way I've always

1610
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,690
envisioned making a press and that's why

1611
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,750
we made an open concept from day one

1612
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:38,659
just so you can access it and you prove

1613
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:39,309
front or back you know that's sort of my

1614
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:41,929
story

1615
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:43,940
nice dude well and where can they go

1616
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:45,559
look at the gorilla press do you have

1617
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:48,050
like a photo that you can put up on the

1618
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:50,389
screen or something in here yeah yeah

1619
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:54,620
I'll put it on the screen here in a

1620
01:07:50,389 --> 01:07:57,170
little bit but I'm evolved underscore

1621
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:59,480
cannabis on Instagram and he sent me a

1622
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:01,280
picture even actually I did you got any

1623
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:03,530
pictures I think you sent a an email the

1624
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,000
other day with a picture of it so here

1625
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:06,350
I'll just put it up real quick just so

1626
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,940
people get an idea it's nice to be able

1627
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:10,969
to see once what you're actually talking

1628
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:15,050
about so yeah so here we go this is the

1629
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:16,219
open concept kind of see a little bit of

1630
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:21,440
it actually I'm gonna have to make it a

1631
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:23,240
little smaller so there you go you can

1632
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,000
put it at all the different angles and

1633
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:28,039
it's got a good digital readout screen

1634
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,470
on there as well who'd have thought that

1635
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:32,649
it would start to get so like like from

1636
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:35,569
a hair straightener to a t-shirt press

1637
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:39,048
to like you know the hand pump

1638
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:40,850
Sasquatch m12 like the peer pressure

1639
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:43,640
dual button like it's pretty incredible

1640
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:45,200
with all of these all the different

1641
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,900
innovations that you guys are offering

1642
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:49,608
and it's it's unique as well just like

1643
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:50,118
Eric was kind of saying you know the

1644
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:54,048
magnifier

1645
01:08:50,118 --> 01:08:56,210
can kind of fix the problem for specific

1646
01:08:54,048 --> 01:08:58,158
groups of people because you know

1647
01:08:56,210 --> 01:09:00,469
certain people will grow resin that

1648
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,568
might be attuned to them it will be

1649
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,859
specific to them especially if they live

1650
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:05,839
in a place like Colorado where the

1651
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:07,670
moisture content is super low it's gonna

1652
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:09,380
be a little bit different and I want to

1653
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:12,529
get into that conversation once the rest

1654
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:13,909
of the panel has introduced themselves

1655
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:15,770
which we'll get right to but I do want

1656
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:18,318
to get into a discussion of like what

1657
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:20,779
wasn't preservation when hundreds of

1658
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,730
grams at a time the best way for us to

1659
01:09:20,779 --> 01:09:24,049
go about preserving it in the different

1660
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:26,238
environments that we are because

1661
01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:28,519
preserving in Eugene Oregon is not going

1662
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:31,818
to be the same as preserving in Denver

1663
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:33,830
Colorado just a lot of moisture content

1664
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:35,630
that can change things up it can help

1665
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:38,630
things butter out I know bubble hash is

1666
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:40,609
that way for sure so I guess I think

1667
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:43,088
Matt just turned his camera off but I

1668
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:45,020
was gonna get Matt from solvent zero to

1669
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:46,670
introduce himself

1670
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:53,900
are you there Matt or did you have to go

1671
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:57,230
oh I'm here guys perfect there we go so

1672
01:09:53,899 --> 01:10:00,049
Matt is another person I met at lyft and

1673
01:09:57,229 --> 01:10:01,968
he had a big commercial unit that

1674
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:04,130
stretch that struck my eye I was like oh

1675
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:07,069
here's like you know like definitely an

1676
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:09,199
obvious thing that's gonna an obvious

1677
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:11,769
niche in the industry that will the

1678
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:14,359
whole industry is is commercializing

1679
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:16,099
regardless even if of course you can

1680
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:18,529
take as many sasquatches or peer

1681
01:10:16,099 --> 01:10:20,119
pressure's and and go large there's

1682
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:22,579
always going to be companies that would

1683
01:10:20,118 --> 01:10:25,069
just rather get fewer units and and and

1684
01:10:22,579 --> 01:10:28,729
go really large so he had that

1685
01:10:25,069 --> 01:10:30,139
industrial commercial version of a rosin

1686
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:33,019
press and I'll let you introduce

1687
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:35,510
yourself Matt and tell us you know how

1688
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,760
you came to be how you came towards the

1689
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:40,520
cannabis and then into extract and then

1690
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:45,320
into designing or becoming a part of

1691
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:46,760
solvent 0 awesome thank you yeah first

1692
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:49,789
off just want to say thank you for

1693
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:53,650
having me on props to all you guys

1694
01:10:49,789 --> 01:10:56,929
Sasquatch soil girl installment was mine

1695
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:59,210
yeah I've been following all these guys

1696
01:10:56,929 --> 01:11:02,118
for years basically the inspiration came

1697
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:03,640
from some really good friends of mine

1698
01:11:02,118 --> 01:11:08,449
who brought this

1699
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:10,430
product to me years ago inspiration came

1700
01:11:08,449 --> 01:11:14,359
from them and came from all of you guys

1701
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:17,600
really but yeah so a friend brought this

1702
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:21,380
product to me years ago I grew up in BC

1703
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:24,289
Canada and so I've seen the industry you

1704
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:28,569
know and seen it evolve to what it is

1705
01:11:24,289 --> 01:11:31,460
today and it's still still evolving so

1706
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:35,059
basically yeah my friend brought this

1707
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:38,480
product to me years ago I was extremely

1708
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:41,050
impressed with you know what it was how

1709
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:44,809
premium it was the chirps it was just

1710
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:46,159
better than anything I'd seen and you

1711
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,720
know it was almost too good to be true I

1712
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:50,389
couldn't really believe that it was just

1713
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:55,539
heat and pressure that was producing

1714
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:58,100
this type of product I was blown away so

1715
01:11:55,539 --> 01:12:01,250
the only thing I just you know I saw

1716
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:03,460
what it took for him to to produce it

1717
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:08,479
and how long it took the time it took to

1718
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:11,689
prepare and so that sort of how solving

1719
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:14,659
zero was born years ago we just decided

1720
01:12:11,689 --> 01:12:19,039
to figure out a way to produce this

1721
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:20,269
stuff faster easier cheaper we kind of

1722
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:22,430
saw what's happening with the

1723
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:28,340
regulations in Canada and how everything

1724
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:30,530
is going recreational and basically you

1725
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:34,250
know co2 oil was kind of taking over

1726
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:38,469
because it was one of the only methods

1727
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:40,970
that's improved by the government and so

1728
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:43,699
that was sort of taking over with the

1729
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:46,880
commercial production of of extracts

1730
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:50,920
here and it's not my favorite so you

1731
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:53,989
know I saw rosin really being the future

1732
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,149
you know of extracts if there was some

1733
01:12:53,989 --> 01:12:57,859
way to produce it really quick so we

1734
01:12:56,149 --> 01:13:02,059
just decided to start building this

1735
01:12:57,859 --> 01:13:03,639
machine and that's basically how how

1736
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:06,590
this all came about

1737
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:08,750
so when you say years ago cuz soil girl

1738
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:10,520
was saying it was 2015 that he posted

1739
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:14,390
that on Instagram like how many years

1740
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:15,869
ago could it have been like two so I was

1741
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:18,480
showing rosin about

1742
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:20,399
three and a half years ago and then

1743
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,439
about two yeah it's about two years ago

1744
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,329
when we decided to you know come out

1745
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,469
with a machine that could do this on a

1746
01:13:24,329 --> 01:13:27,988
commercial scale

1747
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:30,090
I often sometimes think when we have

1748
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:31,799
these memories I don't know the history

1749
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:33,989
as well for rosin I'm just kind of

1750
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,719
paying attention like a mild historian

1751
01:13:33,988 --> 01:13:38,459
but for my own water hash history I know

1752
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,020
the history extremely well and there's

1753
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,118
often people will be like oh yeah I was

1754
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:45,389
making water hash 25 years ago I was

1755
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:47,130
like no probably like 18 years ago no no

1756
01:13:45,389 --> 01:13:50,010
it was like 25 years ago I'm like I

1757
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:52,739
don't think it's probably not like it's

1758
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:55,199
it's possible but just because really I

1759
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:57,658
mean rosin was an existing method that

1760
01:13:55,198 --> 01:14:00,689
it was on icy mag but very very very

1761
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:03,029
very different from the pressure and the

1762
01:14:00,689 --> 01:14:07,259
heat that soil grown when he released

1763
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:09,329
the rosin crackin on Instagram in 2015

1764
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:11,070
that [ __ ] right there I can't believe

1765
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:12,779
it's only been that long really like

1766
01:14:11,069 --> 01:14:14,670
when I think of all the different like

1767
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:17,158
technologies that have come out of it

1768
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:19,440
and all the conversations it's really

1769
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:21,960
quite something it blows my mind so I'd

1770
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:24,269
like to show your unit should I go on

1771
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:26,730
the website or should I sure yeah

1772
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:33,659
whatever you like okay yeah because it's

1773
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:35,569
it's a big unit it's fully hydraulic so

1774
01:14:33,658 --> 01:14:39,118
everything is from a touch of the button

1775
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:42,000
we did add a like a controlled down

1776
01:14:39,118 --> 01:14:44,118
speed feature so with the touch of a

1777
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,889
button you can bring the plate down

1778
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:49,679
little by little and it's very touchy

1779
01:14:46,889 --> 01:14:52,829
control so basically you can bring the

1780
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:54,539
plates down right till they hit the bag

1781
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:57,599
you can give it a tiny little bit of

1782
01:14:54,539 --> 01:15:00,448
pressure so they heat up they expand a

1783
01:14:57,599 --> 01:15:02,369
little bit and then you can hit it with

1784
01:15:00,448 --> 01:15:05,879
the full pressure all from a touch with

1785
01:15:02,368 --> 01:15:07,920
a button this has been crucial that

1786
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:12,510
feature is crucial for preventing the

1787
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:15,449
blowouts and yeah basically we're just

1788
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:18,300
trying to figure out how to you know get

1789
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:21,988
these out to all the L keys and and and

1790
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:25,980
just spread spread the rosin word and

1791
01:15:21,988 --> 01:15:29,178
get it out there because we see it being

1792
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:31,428
the future really of extracts

1793
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:33,319
it's a [ __ ] Terminator machine dude

1794
01:15:31,429 --> 01:15:36,908
when I just turned the video on and the

1795
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:39,408
sound came on it was like oh my gosh

1796
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:41,719
it's pretty wild I think it's great I

1797
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:44,089
love the fact that it's such a young

1798
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:47,539
industry and that you guys all have such

1799
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:49,400
a strong place by just you know all of

1800
01:15:47,539 --> 01:15:51,590
the different presses there's you just

1801
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:54,738
have little different niches almost you

1802
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:56,929
know like I could I see great success in

1803
01:15:54,738 --> 01:16:00,109
all of your futures as long as you you

1804
01:15:56,929 --> 01:16:03,350
know maintain innovation follow your

1805
01:16:00,109 --> 01:16:05,839
passion and obviously try to make it so

1806
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:08,480
even the commercial people can produce

1807
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,610
the highest quality as possible you know

1808
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:13,099
to really be able to control the

1809
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:16,519
pressure and the and the heat and the

1810
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:20,030
time that seems to be the trio for rosin

1811
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:21,080
that makes a great product so it's I'm

1812
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:23,119
sure a lot of people are going to be

1813
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:26,359
squishing a lot of product after this I

1814
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:28,519
do once we get finish up with Matt and

1815
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:30,619
Joel from sasquatch which are next up to

1816
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,179
bat I'd like to get into a good

1817
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:34,519
conversation where we actually start

1818
01:16:32,179 --> 01:16:35,779
talking about methods that we make you

1819
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,730
know like I just wanted you guys to be

1820
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:39,710
able to do all do introductions

1821
01:16:37,729 --> 01:16:41,178
introduce your instagrams and your

1822
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,920
companies and whatnot so people had a

1823
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:44,658
kind of an idea where each of you are

1824
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,520
coming from and then we could get into a

1825
01:16:44,658 --> 01:16:49,279
really great discussion we've only been

1826
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:52,690
going for an hour in 17 minutes so we

1827
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,250
still have time for a really great rasen

1828
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:57,738
conversation and in the meantime thank

1829

everybody good good it's a long time

1836
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:25,460
coming to do hash Church 2.0 the past

1837
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:27,640
present and future of rosin so right now

1838
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:30,109
we're in the the present of rosin and

1839
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:32,570
you guys are very much a part of the

1840
01:17:30,109 --> 01:17:35,420
presence of rosin so tell us tell us how

1841
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:38,059
solvent or Sasquatch rosin press came to

1842
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:38,789
be and how you guys found your passion

1843
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:42,350
in

1844
01:17:38,789 --> 01:17:44,670
in producing these presses pretty much

1845
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:46,920
guess it was it was after her hashed

1846
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:53,220
shirts really when little girl was on

1847
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:55,350
there around our cousin after that my my

1848
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:57,480
brother had you know he had introduced

1849
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:59,370
me to the YouTube channel I was like

1850
01:17:57,479 --> 01:18:02,639
holy [ __ ] what's he doing you know I

1851
01:17:59,369 --> 01:18:05,309
didn't even know he was doing it I was I

1852
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:08,460
was honestly in the Hills growing weed I

1853
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:10,140
did that for six seven years I was

1854
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:12,359
making pho to be honest I was really

1855
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:16,230
really good at making pho and I had the

1856
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:17,729
passes himself when he finished and I

1857
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:23,909
was like [ __ ] yeah let's do this

1858
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:27,599
make it happen and so I just got tired

1859
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:29,039
of grilling really and kinda hit up my

1860
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,100
cousin Joel here he's kinda like

1861
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,689
engineer type today well then good you

1862
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:36,420
know building things all this stuff like

1863
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:39,389
I'm semi good at it but didn't do it for

1864
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:41,250
a living like I said I grew weed so when

1865
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:43,260
I contacted Joey was like [ __ ] yeah

1866
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:46,430
let's do this was like we need to build

1867
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,430
a press that can actually

1868
01:18:54,130 --> 01:19:00,890
sorry guys Joel's Mike's not coming

1869
01:18:56,539 --> 01:19:02,359
through Peugeot speak up louder no I

1870
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:03,860
wasn't coming through almost at all

1871
01:19:02,359 --> 01:19:05,420
unless you can hold it right up to your

1872
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:07,609
mouth for a second and do a test that

1873
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:15,230
better oh yeah that works totally

1874
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:17,839
actually it's the beard why it almost

1875
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:21,199
died at at work the week before I don't

1876
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,180
waste water plant and we had already

1877
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:25,909
talked about I mean obviously Phil's our

1878
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:28,610
cousin he had showed us rosin never

1879
01:19:25,909 --> 01:19:30,529
smoked pho at all it gave me kind of

1880
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:32,630
like a Hmong spasm every time I smoked

1881
01:19:30,529 --> 01:19:34,519
it so it didn't ever really work for me

1882
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:38,890
and I was telling everybody they were

1883
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,890
poisoning themselves it don't smoke pho

1884
01:19:47,170 --> 01:20:00,199
yeah you know Big Ups to Phil well a lot

1885
01:19:57,979 --> 01:20:04,549
of things happen by accident you know I

1886
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:10,639
don't think there's ever not a reason

1887
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:23,659
why they make happened that way as far

1888
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:25,160
as this break I believe we built a

1889
01:20:23,659 --> 01:20:33,859
couple press and I think all we had was

1890
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:44,029
a grinder and dunno 2015 soon they

1891
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:46,460
worked fella good in there the whole

1892
01:20:44,029 --> 01:20:49,279
thing and turn it into like a temporary

1893
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:51,980
mini little metal shop little shitty

1894
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:54,649
tools at high laying around we ended up

1895
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:56,329
building 20 presses there sold them all

1896
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:59,359
at the first high time show that we ever

1897
01:20:56,329 --> 01:21:01,220
did and then after like holy [ __ ] like

1898
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:03,799
we need to build 50 or 200 of these

1899
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,689
things in this tiny little garage from

1900
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,010
very instantly like instantly

1901
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:09,619
big place and we started building

1902
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:11,599
hundreds of them and teaching everybody

1903
01:21:09,618 --> 01:21:14,839
how to press you know announced at a

1904
01:21:11,599 --> 01:21:16,900
time to ounces at a time get production

1905
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:20,029
done because that first note was really

1906
01:21:16,899 --> 01:21:21,978
pressing bounces or pressing even even a

1907
01:21:20,029 --> 01:21:25,728
quarter ounce you know like a really

1908
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:27,559
small time small scale stuff you know D

1909
01:21:25,729 --> 01:21:28,668
nail presses and t-shirt presses like

1910
01:21:27,559 --> 01:21:31,279
stuff like that

1911
01:21:28,668 --> 01:21:33,109
maybe a couple couple presents a really

1912
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:35,168
tiny plates to press small amounts of

1913
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:38,630
hash maybe like a gram or two at a time

1914
01:21:35,168 --> 01:21:41,418
so we were like [ __ ] we need to press

1915
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:43,939
you know ounces to three ounces for

1916
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:48,198
ounces now really with the 2.5 you get

1917
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:50,840
one done super super fast depending on

1918
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:54,529
what you're not afraid to do it's a nice

1919
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:55,849
bud you know swish that it's a little

1920
01:21:54,529 --> 01:22:02,478
bit of where's my bike

1921
01:21:55,849 --> 01:22:04,429
nice I gotta come back yeah you do the

1922
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:06,860
last time you were here we squished a

1923
01:22:04,429 --> 01:22:12,618
bunch of this and got that like 29 point

1924
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:14,380
something percent return yeah that was

1925
01:22:12,618 --> 01:22:27,589
funny

1926
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:29,090
absolutely and the passion for wanting

1927
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:30,650
to be healthy you're really honestly I

1928
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:33,010
stopped eating me and I stopped doing

1929
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:35,418

01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:43,498
booth with our Jamaican company

1956
01:23:41,668 --> 01:23:45,748

01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:53,368
Marley's we met the Prime Minister of

1960
01:23:49,889 --> 01:23:55,679
the country it was it was a pretty sweet

1961
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:57,898
experience all in all I'm gonna actually

1962
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,689
try and go at the end of the month at

1963
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:02,609
the beginning of February for this live

1964
01:24:00,689 --> 01:24:05,489
again yeah I just can't miss it dude

1965
01:24:02,609 --> 01:24:13,139
it's too special yeah we just moved into

1966
01:24:05,488 --> 01:24:15,178

1967
01:24:13,139 --> 01:24:17,998
good vibes charity event Oh

1968
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:20,069
basically I just had an idea my couple

1969
01:24:17,998 --> 01:24:22,559
friends have autistic children and I've

1970
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:26,308
recently become pretty good friends with

1971
01:24:22,559 --> 01:24:28,918
jinx group genetics and obviously he

1972
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:32,010
runs North West and has an autistic

1973
01:24:28,918 --> 01:24:33,658
child himself so I figured like you know

1974
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:36,389
we need to give back to the community

1975
01:24:33,658 --> 01:24:38,848
how to show the community that our

1976
01:24:36,389 --> 01:24:41,189
community is you know doing good things

1977
01:24:38,849 --> 01:24:42,989
and we want to provide and be a part

1978
01:24:41,189 --> 01:24:45,628
where a lot of mix you know our

1979
01:24:42,988 --> 01:24:47,608
community with their community and be

1980
01:24:45,628 --> 01:24:51,958
one together or not judge each other or

2010
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:08,799
worth what you think it should get and

2011

then well you always have to remove it

2012
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,710
below you always have to remind people

2013
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:13,359
when it's an auction that you're not

2014

01:27:37,179 --> 01:27:41,500
about the presence and it's all about

2049

2073
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:39,199
the press and we didn't even think about

2074
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:41,119
the rules at all like we're just like

2075

2088
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:11,180
teach people how to use those bags well

2089
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:13,459
I was not gonna be selling any bags

2090
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:15,590
especially because you think rosin

2091
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:17,989
tripped people out people used to laugh

2092
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:19,789
in my face about water hand washing the

2093
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:21,829
weed they thought it was the most

2094
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:25,430
ridiculous thing that you could possibly

2095
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:30,519
do putting herb beautiful herb into

2096
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:32,750
water and ice back in like 1998 1999

2097
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:36,110
this is this is a time where people

2098
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:38,449
throw away trim by the metric ton like

2099
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:43,099
literally this was the sound of trim

2100
01:29:38,449 --> 01:29:45,289
getting dumped beep beep beep giant

2101
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:47,240
truck backing up I'd be like oh what did

2102
01:29:45,289 --> 01:29:48,649
you do with that metric ton of trim that

2103
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:48,929
you had it's a call I got rid of it man

2104
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:51,179
I

2105
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:54,150
threw that [ __ ] out and you know as I

2106
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:56,700
started the bubble bag company that [ __ ]

2107
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:58,710
changed in a hurry because people

2108
01:29:56,699 --> 01:30:01,199
realize those abilities of trim were

2109
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:03,329
like they were just such an incredible

2110
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:05,989
value you know especially if you hit it

2111
01:30:03,329 --> 01:30:09,779
with some good trim not just some swaggy

2112
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:11,609
swaggy subpar material but and I'll say

2113
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:14,219
some of the first full melt I ever made

2114
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:16,710
was made from trim really tight to the

2115
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:19,289
bud trim that produced you know five and

2116
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:20,850
six star quality bubble hash that melted

2117
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:22,529
into a liquid and looked like stained

2118
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:26,610
glass window when I held it up to the

2119
01:30:22,529 --> 01:30:29,399
Sun it's uh it's a good thing that's for

2120
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:31,589
sure so how do you guys go about finding

2121
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:38,639
your good material solvent less Bud and

2122
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:39,960
too turnt and honey-butter easy the

2123
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:45,980
solution would be to grow it yourself

2124
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:48,300
but that's not always an option so you

2125
01:30:45,979 --> 01:30:49,889
know it's got to be in the loop you know

2126
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:52,650
the right people of know know where your

2127
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:55,170
stuff comes from it's not a it's not

2128
01:30:52,649 --> 01:30:56,670
really like a you know what am I gonna

2129
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:59,250
find this week kind of thing it's more

2130
01:30:56,670 --> 01:31:01,079
like you know you have a few people that

2131
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:05,310
you want to just stay in contact with

2132
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:06,960
and see you know yeah but it even starts

2133
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:08,700
before that in a sense because some

2134
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,460
people really what if you don't know

2135
01:31:08,699 --> 01:31:13,289
what quality herb even is I mean for me

2136
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:15,420
I always said the bags were the end of

2137
01:31:13,289 --> 01:31:18,000
God run it through the bags and if it

2138
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:20,159
comes out looking like this then you

2139
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,649
have incredible quality material because

2140
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:25,920
I just noticed most people their ability

2141
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:27,509
to perceive was below that level of

2142
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,550
being able to understand that this was

2143
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:31,230
great or something like I just saw a lot

2144
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:33,119
of people I don't know if it was a

2145
01:31:31,229 --> 01:31:34,859
cognitive dissonance or they if they had

2146
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:36,899
just never really seen what I was

2147
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:38,819
considering quality they would think

2148
01:31:36,899 --> 01:31:41,039
like a three star back in the day was

2149
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:42,179
good and everyone's probable like for me

2150
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:44,699
my company would have been way more

2151
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:49,039
successful if more people grew great

2152
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:52,079
herb I'll say that much yeah absolutely

2153
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:54,300
um I used to run around with a shrimp in

2154
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:57,390
a hair straightener and a couple rosin

2155
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:59,279
bags and I would you know if I was gonna

2156
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:01,440
go look at some material this is just

2157
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:02,550
you know last winter and I would shake a

2158
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:05,129
little out

2159
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:06,960
and press it right there on the spot and

2160
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:08,789
that was one way to tell but what I

2161
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,408
realized eventually was there's not much

2162
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:12,539
good material out there you're putting

2163
01:32:10,408 --> 01:32:14,879
yourself at the mercy of what she can

2164
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:17,429
find at the time you know you're

2165
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:23,250
probably not gonna get above a 3/4 star

2166
01:32:17,429 --> 01:32:27,750
and product sure enough really agile go

2167
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:30,328
ahead he's got the YouTube video and

2168
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:32,670
I'll just mute him um what I was gonna

2169
01:32:30,328 --> 01:32:35,189
say in regards to that was that some I

2170
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:37,078
used to do a similar thing I wasn't

2171
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:39,719
really testing for the quality of the

2172
01:32:37,078 --> 01:32:42,420
resin for me back in the day I had to I

2173
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:44,069
had to test for sulfur because everyone

2174
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,679
in the Pacific Northwest grows powdery

2175
01:32:44,069 --> 01:32:50,158
mildew like you wouldn't [ __ ] believe

2176
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:51,929
and so they would eventually especially

2177
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:55,519
in the 90s it's a lot better now that we

2178
01:32:51,929 --> 01:32:58,050
need to concentrate world but they would

2179
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,820
they would use sulfur burners and I know

2180
01:32:58,050 --> 01:33:01,710
that people are like oh use a sulfur

2181
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:03,750
burner and veg and it's fine well I've

2182
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:05,849
macro photographed many of veg plants

2183
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:09,149
and I can promise you that trichomes are

2184
01:33:05,849 --> 01:33:11,250
already on the plant from the first set

2185
01:33:09,149 --> 01:33:13,109
of two true leaves not the coddle of

2186
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:16,380
dawn the round ones but the next set

2187
01:33:13,109 --> 01:33:17,848
which is the epicotyl the first two true

2188
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:20,460
set of leaves that come out of a

2189
01:33:17,849 --> 01:33:24,300
seedling I have photographed with my

2190
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:26,399
macro camera trichomes present on those

2191
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,989
leaves so if you're worried about those

2192
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:30,269
oleoresin it's becoming contaminated

2193
01:33:27,988 --> 01:33:33,209
with sulfur which is what happens when

2194
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:34,710
you use a sulfur burner then you should

2195
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:36,840
be you should be worried about it even

2196
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:38,698
in in vegetative so I was religious

2197
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,409
about not wanting it in my product so

2198
01:33:38,698 --> 01:33:42,658
what I would do is I take a small pinch

2199
01:33:40,408 --> 01:33:45,089
of material and with a lighter I would

2200
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:47,578
light the end of it close my eyes and

2201
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:50,039
just hold the smoke under my nose gently

2202
01:33:47,578 --> 01:33:52,618
and if it smelled anything like a pack

2203
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:54,569
of matches or a single burnt match that

2204
01:33:52,618 --> 01:33:56,488
[ __ ] was like gone because I'll tell you

2205
01:33:54,569 --> 01:33:58,349
not only would it contaminate your resin

2206
01:33:56,488 --> 01:34:00,689
and make your resin literally tastes

2207
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:02,190
like matches it would also [ __ ] up your

2208
01:34:00,689 --> 01:34:04,348
bags which you know they're not cheap

2209
01:34:02,189 --> 01:34:06,058
they're an expensive tool and if you you

2210
01:34:04,349 --> 01:34:09,110
don't want to be soaking them with this

2211
01:34:06,059 --> 01:34:12,929
sulfur material that just never seems to

2212
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:14,819
disappear I've got a little something or

2213
01:34:12,929 --> 01:34:16,119
not when you said about how do we go

2214
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:20,529
about finding good material

2215
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:23,229
oh yeah pretty much working with growers

2216
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:24,759
that listen that actually give a [ __ ]

2217
01:34:23,229 --> 01:34:26,619
about what they're doing because a lot

2218
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:28,390
of growers have it in their mind that

2219
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:31,300
they already know that they're growing

2220
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:32,980
the best they're doing the best but when

2221
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:35,199
you watch their stuff or you squish

2222
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:37,359
their stuff the results don't show that

2223
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:39,729
you know what I mean like you'll get

2224
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:41,949
flower that looks really frosty frosty

2225
01:34:39,729 --> 01:34:45,789
as all hell but then you try to squish

2226
01:34:41,949 --> 01:34:47,649
it and then you get 8% 11% back and now

2227
01:34:45,789 --> 01:34:49,569
you're gonna tell the grower yo I can't

2228
01:34:47,649 --> 01:34:51,759
press the rest of this because if I do

2229
01:34:49,569 --> 01:34:53,559
it's worth less than the god just

2230
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,210
sitting here in front of me do you want

2231
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:57,220
to take that loss sometimes they'll say

2232
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:59,170
yeah they wanted his forehead stash but

2233
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:01,720
still I gotta sit here now and go

2234
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:04,359
through the agony of pressing this [ __ ]

2235
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:05,560
that's giving me nothing and when you

2236
01:35:04,359 --> 01:35:07,389
talk to the grower they don't want to

2237
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,920
hear that their buttons not good so I

2238
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:10,840
feel like the good material comes with

2239
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:13,090
the growers that actually listen to the

2240
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,760
extractors or the hash makers because we

2241
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:17,560
do know resin you understand try we

2242
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,030
understand char we understand Mel we

2243
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,950
understand lots of things that they

2244
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:22,719
don't necessarily understand they just

2245
01:35:20,949 --> 01:35:24,909
understand the plant and not really the

2246
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:27,190
resin but it's when we're extracting we

2247
01:35:24,909 --> 01:35:29,050
get a whole different sight from a whole

2248
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:32,500
different view you know we're actually

2249
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:34,600
seeing just the resin just by itself so

2250
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:36,520
like if it's a growers growing in hotter

2251
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,740
you know climates he might have bigger

2252
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,720
wax membranes and have Charlie ass hatch

2253
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:42,729
if the guys growing in cooler climates

2254
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:44,409
he might have the melting as [ __ ] ever

2255
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:47,169
you know what I mean there's all kinds

2256
01:35:44,409 --> 01:35:48,369
of [ __ ] that you know decides that I'm

2257
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:49,899
not saying it's one of the other it's

2258
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:51,609
not just hot cold it's the environment

2259
01:35:49,899 --> 01:35:53,289
it's the nutrients it's everything that

2260
01:35:51,609 --> 01:35:55,569
goes into the plant but there are a

2261
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:57,789
difference between growers who grow dry

2262
01:35:55,569 --> 01:35:59,769
resin and growers they grow the grease

2263
01:35:57,789 --> 01:36:02,350
and when you go to put it into your

2264
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:05,290
press to make rosin you don't press them

2265
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:07,150
the same and if you do you're just not

2266
01:36:05,289 --> 01:36:09,010
doing it right in my opinion because the

2267
01:36:07,149 --> 01:36:10,960
grease is you can drop the temp and you

2268
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:12,850
can you can get that ship to flow but

2269
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,369
the dry resins the [ __ ] that's like the

2270
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:17,170
tan G's the blue dream the there's

2271
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:18,880
certain varieties that when you put them

2272
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:20,980
in there you try to press a low they

2273
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,319
can't even rosin out of the bag you're

2274
01:36:20,979 --> 01:36:25,389
literally just building up a butter just

2275
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:27,309
chunk around the bag and then your

2276
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:29,250
percentages drop like a used condom

2277
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:30,630
you're looking at like

2278
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:32,699
it could have been me percent but now

2279
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:34,380
it's like 40 percent because you've got

2280
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:36,300
nothing out of it but now you've got to

2281
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,789
explain to the grower um you know the

2282
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:40,739
money has to go up or down you know

2283
01:36:38,789 --> 01:36:42,300
people do their pricing it's all on what

2284
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:44,279
the yield is compared to what the herb

2285
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:45,840
what it sold for so then you have to

2286
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:47,250
explain the grower like as long as the

2287
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,020
growers willing to like listen to you

2288
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:50,970
and hear you out and everything that

2289
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:52,470
you're saying then you're gonna have the

2290
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:54,210
greatest material you can find but

2291
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:57,510
they're stubborn guys they're always

2292
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:59,460
gonna give you the mids always ain't

2293
01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:01,739
that the truth the stubborn guys got

2294
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:05,699
stuck with the mids don't get stuck with

2295
01:37:01,739 --> 01:37:08,010
mids listen to your extractor I see the

2296
01:37:05,699 --> 01:37:10,619
exact same relationship to be honest in

2297
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:13,350
a lot of the rosin press companies where

2298
01:37:10,619 --> 01:37:16,229
you have a ganja guy and you have a

2299
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:17,970
machinist who also is into ganja but

2300
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:20,669
maybe didn't spend the last 10 or 20

2301
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:23,220
years like flipping packs or you know

2302
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:24,569
grow an herb or whatever it's sort of

2303
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:26,400
like there's these symbiotic

2304
01:37:24,569 --> 01:37:28,019
relationships that obviously happen

2305
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:30,750
between a grower and an extractor

2306
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:32,100
between a machinist and a puffer you

2307
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:33,930
know how else are you gonna know if

2308
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:36,390
you're making a great material you might

2309
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:38,520
be the greatest machinist on the planet

2310
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:39,930
but if you don't have that sort of we

2311
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,060
got to come up with a name for it - I

2312
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:44,850
want to I want it to be like the hashish

2313
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:47,430
or oil sommelier almost like the

2314
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:50,280
equivalent of a wine sommelier but in

2315
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:51,840
the cannabis world I don't know the term

2316
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:53,489
for it myself but I'm sure now that

2317
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,279
we've mentioned if someone will come up

2318
01:37:53,489 --> 01:37:57,710
with it and it'll be patented and

2319
01:37:55,279 --> 01:38:00,090
copyrighted before the end of the day

2320
01:37:57,710 --> 01:38:01,770
but it's something that should exist I

2321
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:03,420
think that we all know that there's

2322
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:06,630
levels to this [ __ ] and there's always

2323
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:08,220
certain people that once again I don't

2324
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:10,170
know if they have a stronger olfactory

2325
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:12,180
or if they're able to pay more attention

2326
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:13,980
to what's going on with all of their

2327
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:15,840
senses while they're smelling and

2328
01:38:13,979 --> 01:38:19,379
inhaling and being affected by these

2329
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:20,850
different terpenes and cannabinoids but

2330
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:23,640
it seems like there's certain people

2331
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:25,170
that just take it to that next level and

2332
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,470
those people coincidentally enough

2333
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:32,039
always have super quality product in

2334
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:33,750
their stash speaking of stash I think it

2335
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:37,319
might be time for a little rip I got

2336
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:40,949
this new nail recently the mr. hotbox

2337
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:42,868
it's kind of fun things beefcake gonna

2338
01:38:40,949 --> 01:38:46,679
be heats up in a minute

2339
01:38:42,868 --> 01:38:50,308
one minute how about that for a fast

2340
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:51,958
electric nail and I'm going to hit a

2341
01:38:50,309 --> 01:38:53,248
little maple butter they were supposed

2342
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:55,019
to come in today I'm not sure what

2343
01:38:53,248 --> 01:38:57,179
happened I'll have to give them a hit on

2344
01:38:55,019 --> 01:39:01,139
the old messenger I'm gonna hit some

2345
01:38:57,179 --> 01:39:05,519
Holy Grail dry seft rosin that's what

2346
01:39:01,139 --> 01:39:08,090
I'm gonna hit today as you can see I've

2347
01:39:05,519 --> 01:39:10,889
been hitting it pretty hard already so

2348
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:14,878
this would be the time now if you have

2349
01:39:10,889 --> 01:39:19,918
your rig to join reverend bubbleman for

2350
01:39:14,878 --> 01:39:22,559
a I'm just joking don't ask how it even

2351
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:24,300
became hash Church the word Church how

2352
01:39:22,559 --> 01:39:28,349
that became a part of it I don't even

2353
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:30,329
know but it sure has stuck in the last

2354
01:39:28,349 --> 01:39:35,159
three and a half years that we've been

2355
01:39:30,328 --> 01:39:38,340
doing this show and yeah 889 people

2356
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:40,198
almost 900 people in live want to hear

2357
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:42,300
from all of you guys and how you go

2358
01:39:40,198 --> 01:39:47,488
about making your product you know I

2359
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:49,409
liked when Eric was talking about you

2360
01:39:47,488 --> 01:39:51,299
know making sure that the pressure isn't

2361
01:39:49,408 --> 01:39:52,648
too great and I think it was Eric

2362
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:55,168
actually it might have been honey butter

2363
01:39:52,649 --> 01:39:57,209
in cooking the parchment you know almost

2364
01:39:55,168 --> 01:39:59,069
the cooked parchment look and how being

2365
01:39:57,208 --> 01:40:01,168
able to pull that back like these are

2366
01:39:59,069 --> 01:40:04,259
all just little sort of clues that tell

2367
01:40:01,168 --> 01:40:05,668
you that if you're continually cooking

2368
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:07,889
the parchment and you're pulling that

2369
01:40:05,668 --> 01:40:10,529
[ __ ] out and it's all cracked and like

2370
01:40:07,889 --> 01:40:17,038
cooked away your your you need to pull

2371
01:40:10,529 --> 01:40:18,748
back pull back hard I've noticed that if

2372
01:40:17,038 --> 01:40:20,550
you're ever pressing the outline of the

2373
01:40:18,748 --> 01:40:22,978
bag will straight cut the parchment

2374
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:25,199
where the presses where the plate is in

2375
01:40:22,979 --> 01:40:27,570
contact with it and that's definitely a

2376
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:32,638
sure sign that you're there slamming it

2377
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:33,988
down too too far yeah I've noticed also

2378
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,059
like when you're when you're folding

2379
01:40:33,988 --> 01:40:38,938
your pouches you want to get nice even

2380
01:40:36,059 --> 01:40:40,498
flap if you do fold it because otherwise

2381
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:42,749
if you just have like half of a flap

2382
01:40:40,498 --> 01:40:44,849
that pressure you know even though it's

2383
01:40:42,748 --> 01:40:46,679
the smallest amount of material it still

2384
01:40:44,849 --> 01:40:48,510
applies more pressure to that center

2385
01:40:46,679 --> 01:40:50,489
point which

2386
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:52,289
that'll that'll break into the parchment

2387
01:40:50,488 --> 01:40:54,779
or you don't get an even press I mean

2388
01:40:52,288 --> 01:40:56,460
it's it doesn't seem like much but it

2389
01:40:54,779 --> 01:40:59,609
really it is it is

2390
01:40:56,460 --> 01:41:02,850
important when you're dealing with hash

2391
01:40:59,609 --> 01:41:09,659
pressing it's like The Princess and the

2392
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:11,370
pea yeah I agree I mean you wanna never

2393
01:41:09,659 --> 01:41:12,899
under fold a bag either because that's

2394
01:41:11,369 --> 01:41:14,670
what like will help believe it blow out

2395
01:41:12,899 --> 01:41:17,039
so if you over fold I'd rather do that

2396
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:18,510
and you know sacrifice a tiny bit of yo

2397
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:19,710
the Special Attack does not like it

2398
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:22,789
really matters that much at that point

2399
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:27,149
especially if you're going for quality

2400
01:41:22,789 --> 01:41:28,590
yeah right off the wall yeah you

2401
01:41:27,149 --> 01:41:32,719
definitely don't want everyone to hold

2402
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:32,719
the bag just so that's right the [ __ ] up

2403
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:41,550
it happens though yeah [ __ ] sucks

2404
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:43,289
it does man that's why I try to only put

2405
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:45,560
enough in to make sure the fault is good

2406
01:41:43,289 --> 01:41:47,789
enough I mean you could stack bags of

2407
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,760
you pressed low enough you know you

2408
01:41:47,789 --> 01:41:54,000
don't go fast enough these bags too yeah

2409
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:56,670
yeah yeah I remember back when I was uh

2410
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,260
I was packing boughs double packing bags

2411
01:41:56,670 --> 01:41:59,699
so I pulled a pouch and I put a pouch

2412
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:01,980
inside of a pouch because of all the

2413
01:41:59,699 --> 01:42:03,960
blowouts and then it's just like I

2414
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:06,569
realized over just you know [ __ ] that

2415
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:09,689
others scream you're using you know

2416
01:42:06,569 --> 01:42:11,250
excess material excess you know paper

2417
01:42:09,689 --> 01:42:13,229
cost whatever you want to call it and

2418
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:14,640
you know just with the one screen and a

2419
01:42:13,229 --> 01:42:16,889
little bit of patience and playing with

2420
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:18,329
that heat and timing it's just no no

2421
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:25,050
need to worry you just get it to flow

2422
01:42:18,329 --> 01:42:27,659
out like butter it's why I kind of like

2423
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:29,670
the hand press as well like what Lindsay

2424
01:42:27,659 --> 01:42:31,920
was mentioned earlier what what I feel

2425
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:34,050
is that it's intuitive I have this

2426
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:36,199
intuitive press when I think when I hand

2427
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:41,430
press go ahead honey

2428
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:43,409
looked like you wanted to talk no no no

2429
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:44,789
I mean I don't I don't use the hand

2430
01:42:43,409 --> 01:42:46,469
press I played with it a lot yeah I

2431
01:42:44,789 --> 01:42:48,539
understand how people really feel it

2432
01:42:46,469 --> 01:42:50,520
when pressing the hash and all but for

2433
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:53,069
me I just I really dial it in on the

2434
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:54,780
compressor and just you know dialing

2435
01:42:53,069 --> 01:42:56,369
down the pressure like for instance I

2436
01:42:54,779 --> 01:42:59,880
can get the press down with the foot

2437
01:42:56,369 --> 01:43:01,949
pump down to just on the compressor down

2438
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:05,369
to five psi before it shuts out and does

2439
01:43:01,949 --> 01:43:07,649
nothing but just you know when I'm doing

2440
01:43:05,369 --> 01:43:09,420
water hash or anything I usually bring

2441
01:43:07,649 --> 01:43:10,348
the pressure down to like 30 psi which

2442
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:12,809
allows me to slow

2443
01:43:10,349 --> 01:43:15,708
bring the blocks down I can control you

2444
01:43:12,809 --> 01:43:18,719
know at the speed that it's dropping and

2445
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:20,969
you know the increments of you know how

2446
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:23,128
far it comes down on the on the pouch

2447
01:43:20,969 --> 01:43:25,139
cuz it gets real critical at that point

2448
01:43:23,128 --> 01:43:26,488
you know I mean it's just a matter of a

2449
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:30,328
couple centimeters and you have a

2450
01:43:26,488 --> 01:43:33,628
blowout so I really feel it personally

2451
01:43:30,328 --> 01:43:35,069
with with the foot pump and just dialing

2452
01:43:33,628 --> 01:43:36,689
it on the compressor but I mean that's

2453
01:43:35,069 --> 01:43:38,340
just how I've learned so yeah I think

2454
01:43:36,689 --> 01:43:39,929
it's all on however you learn it and

2455
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,878
just learning learning the tools of the

2456
01:43:39,929 --> 01:43:43,229
trade

2457
01:43:40,878 --> 01:43:46,800
yeah the compressor kind of scares me

2458
01:43:43,229 --> 01:43:48,840
honestly like sometimes the hash is so

2459
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,719
greasy that like if I just let the

2460
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:53,219
handle go on the [ __ ] end you know if

2461
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:54,479
I just let that handle go like sometimes

2462
01:43:53,219 --> 01:43:56,429
I have to crank it really low to the

2463
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:58,019
floor so that I don't take the risk of

2464
01:43:56,429 --> 01:43:59,760
like letting the handler go with it the

2465
01:43:58,019 --> 01:44:02,280
weight of the handle dropping you just I

2466
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,628
mean I've had some disasters man I mean

2467
01:44:02,279 --> 01:44:05,429
you're gonna have some mad skills over

2468
01:44:03,628 --> 01:44:07,738
there bro you're gonna teach me away

2469
01:44:05,429 --> 01:44:10,559
that's it dude it's really it's just a

2470
01:44:07,738 --> 01:44:12,478
matter of uh you know messing up you

2471
01:44:10,559 --> 01:44:14,070
mess up and you realize what you did and

2472
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:15,510
you figure out how to correct it and the

2473
01:44:14,069 --> 01:44:18,118
fact is is that's what I've learned on

2474
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:19,649
and it's what I like and you know I've

2475
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:20,788
played with the hand press but I feel

2476
01:44:19,649 --> 01:44:22,679
like I'm just starting back in the

2477
01:44:20,788 --> 01:44:25,018
beginning with it and when it comes to

2478
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:27,029
the foot pump I just I feel full control

2479
01:44:25,019 --> 01:44:29,039
on it whether I'm cranking it up to 90

2480
01:44:27,029 --> 01:44:31,918
psi and I'm going full speed on the bag

2481
01:44:29,038 --> 01:44:34,918
or with flour or or whether I'm doing

2482
01:44:31,918 --> 01:44:37,469
bubble hash and just dialing in my the

2483
01:44:34,918 --> 01:44:39,208
PSI and in the speed that the block

2484
01:44:37,469 --> 01:44:40,769
comes down on it's just you know I've

2485
01:44:39,208 --> 01:44:42,479
done it that way and that's how I feel

2486
01:44:40,769 --> 01:44:44,219
it so I think it's just making those

2487
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:46,109
mistakes is a good thing because the

2488
01:44:44,219 --> 01:44:47,458
more you mess up the more you understand

2489
01:44:46,109 --> 01:44:49,709
unless you're messing up on the same

2490
01:44:47,458 --> 01:44:51,389
exact thing every time then that's just

2491
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:54,658
stupid you know you're not learning

2492
01:44:51,389 --> 01:44:58,979
that's the difference between a costly

2493
01:44:54,658 --> 01:45:01,498
mistake and a valuable lesson which are

2494
01:44:58,979 --> 01:45:04,559
exactly the same experience it's just

2495
01:45:01,498 --> 01:45:09,148
how you decide to perceive them how

2496
01:45:04,559 --> 01:45:13,229
[ __ ] up is that yeah 100%

2497
01:45:09,149 --> 01:45:15,749
I find that the the two-speed hand pump

2498
01:45:13,229 --> 01:45:20,760
really makes a big difference in terms

2499
01:45:15,748 --> 01:45:22,889
of what you can feel I had to look at

2500
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:27,030
mine first it's better for sure

2501
01:45:22,889 --> 01:45:39,239
I agree you speed yeah unless you're

2502
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:41,429
using that yellow I use the foot-pumps

2503
01:45:39,238 --> 01:45:42,898
toe and I can I like it a lot I'm

2504
01:45:41,429 --> 01:45:44,219
whenever I start to see a blood happen

2505
01:45:42,899 --> 01:45:45,809
it's nice if I can just pop cool boots

2506
01:45:44,219 --> 01:45:47,878
immediately now got worried about it

2507
01:45:45,809 --> 01:45:49,619
blowing out all the way I've stuffed a

2508
01:45:47,878 --> 01:45:51,179
lot of lots that way but I've also blown

2509
01:45:49,618 --> 01:45:52,878
off more bags and you can believe I

2510
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:55,918
would like to see like dead life

2511
01:45:52,878 --> 01:46:00,059
yeah I've learn more lessons that way to

2512
01:45:55,918 --> 01:46:04,139
you like you said right here it's easy

2513
01:46:00,059 --> 01:46:05,788
to really yeah yeah I think Nessa's I

2514
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:07,708
mean with the foot with the foot pedal I

2515
01:46:05,788 --> 01:46:09,929
mean it's just necessary I'm dialing in

2516
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:12,479
your your your psi which controls the

2517
01:46:09,929 --> 01:46:14,038
speed of the blocks and I mean just

2518
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:17,159
watching the bag so having a light

2519
01:46:14,038 --> 01:46:18,509
directed on that on those blocks in the

2520
01:46:17,158 --> 01:46:20,788
bag that you're pressing I mean you

2521
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:23,579
really get to see the oil doing its

2522
01:46:20,788 --> 01:46:26,219
thing you know you watch it start to

2523
01:46:23,578 --> 01:46:28,518
come out and spread through the bag and

2524
01:46:26,219 --> 01:46:30,868
then you you know just kind of like

2525
01:46:28,519 --> 01:46:33,030
depending on the quality of hash or I

2526
01:46:30,868 --> 01:46:34,588
mean this is more for hash especially

2527
01:46:33,029 --> 01:46:37,198
like flowers a little bit easier you

2528
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:39,599
never really have blowouts I mean if you

2529
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:40,978
do just crank your psi down a little I

2530
01:46:39,599 --> 01:46:43,168
mean you're obviously pressing too much

2531
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:44,760
pressure but that's for hash

2532
01:46:43,168 --> 01:46:46,408
I mean dialing it in you're you're

2533
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,748
slowing down your blocks you can really

2534
01:46:46,408 --> 01:46:50,158
feel the increments as it goes through

2535
01:46:47,748 --> 01:46:51,238
with each drop in and then depending on

2536
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:52,078
the quality of hash that you're pressing

2537
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:54,058
that's what you really need to

2538
01:46:52,078 --> 01:46:55,679
understand is you know when you're

2539
01:46:54,059 --> 01:46:56,128
pressing your six stars and your five

2540
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:58,800
stars

2541
01:46:56,128 --> 01:47:00,538
that shit's pure oil almost I mean six

2542
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:03,538
thousand contaminant you're pressing

2543
01:47:00,538 --> 01:47:04,889
ninety ninety percent up returns you

2544
01:47:03,538 --> 01:47:08,219
know with your five stars you're getting

2545
01:47:04,889 --> 01:47:10,559
80 percent enough returns so so I mean

2546
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:12,809
it's it's it's a little harder to have a

2547
01:47:10,559 --> 01:47:14,309
blowout but then again I mean it's all

2548
01:47:12,809 --> 01:47:16,439
about patience and watching that bag

2549
01:47:14,309 --> 01:47:17,550
watching the flow you know understanding

2550
01:47:16,439 --> 01:47:19,050
what you're pressing if you're pressing

2551
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:20,309
something with a lot more contaminant

2552
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:22,498
you need to understand that you can't

2553
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:23,939
apply as much pressure because one

2554
01:47:22,498 --> 01:47:26,038
eventually you're gonna get to a point

2555
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:27,359
where all that contaminant is maxed out

2556
01:47:26,038 --> 01:47:29,518
in the bag and now you're just cresting

2557
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:31,739
that out so you're gonna get blowouts

2558
01:47:29,519 --> 01:47:35,239
with that not from pressing too quick

2559
01:47:31,738 --> 01:47:37,638
but from pressing with too much pressure

2560
01:47:35,238 --> 01:47:40,009
is everybody here using bags then

2561
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:41,659
Elysion likes the Chemex right I'm just

2562
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:46,760
wondering if anybody else has anything

2563
01:47:41,658 --> 01:47:49,549
out there different bags I use bags and

2564
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:52,280
not bags and I use a hand pump and a

2565
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:54,619
foot pump with a air compressor so I

2566
01:47:52,279 --> 01:47:57,498
just I have the a couple of them set up

2567
01:47:54,618 --> 01:48:00,589
and just have variety available to me

2568
01:47:57,498 --> 01:48:03,170
and it's yeah with with flour I like a

2569
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:06,650
good pre-press innovate sometimes yeah I

2570
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:08,359
used to press with no just for

2571
01:48:06,649 --> 01:48:10,188
production and scaling up and you know

2572
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:11,859
especially with the way the industry is

2573
01:48:10,189 --> 01:48:14,630
going out here in Southern California

2574
01:48:11,859 --> 01:48:17,268
particularly I just feel like learning

2575
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:19,340
how to scale things on a mass level and

2576
01:48:17,269 --> 01:48:21,380
maintain quality is going to be key and

2577
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:23,510
when it comes to you know pressing

2578
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:25,969
without a screen and then cleaning it up

2579
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:28,670
afterwards it's not a bad idea but the

2580
01:48:25,969 --> 01:48:31,729
fact is is you don't get to reduce the

2581
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:33,469
mass that you're pressing and you know

2582
01:48:31,729 --> 01:48:35,840
you you're taking up more space with

2583
01:48:33,469 --> 01:48:37,819
that and I feel like even to a certain

2584
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:40,069
point when you're pressing without a

2585
01:48:37,819 --> 01:48:42,708
screen you have you have that that

2586
01:48:40,069 --> 01:48:44,868
material that's still absorbing and

2587
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:46,670
maintaining a certain amount of oil

2588
01:48:44,868 --> 01:48:49,848
because you're not reducing the amount

2589
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:54,288
of space that it's taking where you go

2590
01:48:49,849 --> 01:48:55,969
the part that makes sense so you have

2591
01:48:54,288 --> 01:49:00,429
someone asked how do I know when I'm

2592
01:48:55,969 --> 01:49:00,429
getting lipids and wax in my rosin

2593
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:06,019
whenever you're pressing flour isin

2594
01:49:02,988 --> 01:49:07,938
basically yeah but you shouldn't give a

2595
01:49:06,019 --> 01:49:11,920
[ __ ] because you are more likely to

2596
01:49:07,939 --> 01:49:15,949
smoke flour anyway so like if yet rosin

2597
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:18,170
yeah with a little bit of fat on it and

2598
01:49:15,948 --> 01:49:20,029
and lipids and waxes are a lot more

2599
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:22,038
dangerous when you're smoking something

2600
01:49:20,029 --> 01:49:25,158
that's been made with a non-polar

2601
01:49:22,038 --> 01:49:28,458
solvent like BHO which removes those

2602
01:49:25,158 --> 01:49:30,649
sort of natural bronchial dilators the

2603
01:49:28,458 --> 01:49:34,130
things that sort of protect us I guess

2604
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:36,799
what did Jim fair call them the I wish I

2605
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:39,949
could remember the name allocation

2606
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:42,110
points know some technical point in the

2607
01:49:39,948 --> 01:49:45,049
lungs that cannabis protects our lungs

2608
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:47,179
from these things being but there if you

2609
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:48,610
use a non polar solvent you leave behind

2610
01:49:47,179 --> 01:49:51,158
the polar and semi

2611
01:49:48,609 --> 01:49:53,229
polar components and in those components

2612
01:49:51,158 --> 01:49:55,329
are the things that protect you from

2613
01:49:53,229 --> 01:49:57,009
things like that's lipids getting or

2614
01:49:55,329 --> 01:49:59,590
into your lungs than they should get I

2615
01:49:57,010 --> 01:50:01,210
didn't really explain it as well as I

2616
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:02,920
probably could have had I've been

2617
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:04,389
thinking about it a bit but it's

2618
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:07,149
something to look into

2619
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:10,000
fats and lipids definitely a lot more of

2620
01:50:07,149 --> 01:50:12,638
a problem when you're using a nonpolar

2621
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,420
solvent when you're extracting like hash

2622
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:18,460
or oil or smoking bud you know the the

2623
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:21,429
built-in safety mechanism is that the

2624
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:24,368
bud already contains these nucleation

2625
01:50:21,429 --> 01:50:26,289
points these components that become

2626
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:28,929
nucleation points in the lungs and they

2627
01:50:26,289 --> 01:50:31,029
sort of stop things from getting deeper

2628
01:50:28,929 --> 01:50:32,590
into our lungs than are supposed to it's

2629
01:50:31,029 --> 01:50:36,609
why it's not a very good idea to smoke

2630
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:39,279
tobacco with cannabis cannabis being an

2631
01:50:36,609 --> 01:50:41,469
expectorant it allows the lungs to open

2632
01:50:39,279 --> 01:50:43,599
up whereas the tobacco the lungs want to

2633
01:50:41,469 --> 01:50:47,529
close up you don't want tobacco to get

2634
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:52,510
deep into your lungs to cannabis can

2635
01:50:47,529 --> 01:50:54,670
help that and it's not ideal so as for

2636
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:58,060
fats and lipids as well like you can

2637
01:50:54,670 --> 01:51:00,489
notice I mean I feel like that's more of

2638
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:02,350
a future talk as far as fats and lipids

2639
01:51:00,488 --> 01:51:03,789
and rosin because I mean no one's really

2640
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:05,829
at the point of figuring out how to

2641
01:51:03,789 --> 01:51:08,769
extract them as far as I know or

2642
01:51:05,829 --> 01:51:11,170
separate them but one thing that you can

2643
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:14,920
observe when pressing is a lot of

2644
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:16,389
fluorescence and they seem to have more

2645
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:17,469
fats and lipids you'll notice it when

2646
01:51:16,389 --> 01:51:20,289
you smoke them you need to hit it a

2647
01:51:17,469 --> 01:51:22,389
little cooler otherwise you get more of

2648
01:51:20,289 --> 01:51:26,469
that char not quite char but more you

2649
01:51:22,389 --> 01:51:28,868
know it burns chars up it does Sharpe so

2650
01:51:26,469 --> 01:51:30,460
where was I going with that live rosin

2651
01:51:28,868 --> 01:51:33,009
for instance or water hash or even just

2652
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:34,810
hash rosin in particular you'll notice

2653
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:37,750
as a cleaner burn you can hit it a

2654
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:40,360
little hotter it's usually better in

2655
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:42,520
clarity some flower Rossum's though like

2656
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:45,639
a lot of oh geez that I run to run into

2657
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:49,150
or more of your your your sappy

2658
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:51,670
consistencies tend to to be able to be

2659
01:51:49,149 --> 01:51:53,888
more more resistant to heat or not

2660
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:55,389
resistant heat but less fast and lipids

2661
01:51:53,889 --> 01:51:58,300
as far as you can observe on the burn

2662
01:51:55,389 --> 01:52:01,060
and comparing like as far as dabbing and

2663
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:04,090
smoking them they

2664
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:05,590
seem to have less fats lipids because I

2665
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:07,560
feel like the food the fats lipids are

2666
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:09,640
obviously what's responsible for that

2667
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:12,250
undesirable taste when you're hitting it

2668
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:15,100
a little bit too hot and you'll notice

2669
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:17,970
you can hit live rosin hotter than you

2670
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:20,470
can flour Ross and for the most part

2671
01:52:17,970 --> 01:52:22,240
yeah there's like almost no carbon

2672
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:24,760
footprint left on the nail when you tap

2673
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:27,369
like hash frozen's and when you burn off

2674
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:28,989
a nail like not everybody has a super

2675
01:52:27,369 --> 01:52:30,760
clean meal some of us aren't scared you

2676
01:52:28,989 --> 01:52:32,469
know we'll burn a little bit off but you

2677
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:34,750
actually see the whole story when you

2678
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:36,640
take a DAB and it's wet on the nail and

2679
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:38,949
then you burn it off with a [ __ ]

2680
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:40,690
torch hash rosin normally will just

2681
01:52:38,949 --> 01:52:43,149
puddle a little bit turn a little bit

2682
01:52:40,689 --> 01:52:45,309
black and burn off God flower rosin

2683
01:52:43,149 --> 01:52:47,319
likes to really get black I mean you

2684
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:49,539
almost lift off the nail sometimes with

2685
01:52:47,319 --> 01:52:51,670
the carbon burning and flaking off and

2686
01:52:49,539 --> 01:52:53,680
the same would be a joke if you take a

2687
01:52:51,670 --> 01:52:56,020
damn of that sauce and you burn that

2688
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:59,230
excess [ __ ] off your nail it leaves the

2689
01:52:56,020 --> 01:53:01,330
exact same residuals most of time as

2690
01:52:59,229 --> 01:53:05,489
flour rosin butthat's rosin I've never

2691
01:53:01,329 --> 01:53:05,489
really seen too much residual stuff on

2692
01:53:06,670 --> 01:53:12,109
now and I agree 100% with that I mean

2693
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:13,730
especially a lot of these guys with

2694
01:53:12,109 --> 01:53:15,469
their heady glass and their expensive

2695
01:53:13,729 --> 01:53:18,289
ass cords and all that you'll notice

2696
01:53:15,469 --> 01:53:21,560
that the real picky about what's being

2697
01:53:18,289 --> 01:53:23,119
dabbed on their on their nails they

2698
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,710
don't like flowers gonna be dabbed out

2699
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:26,569
on it they notice they haven't you'll

2700
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:30,020
notice some people have the specific

2701
01:53:26,569 --> 01:53:32,329
nail just to smoke roots in but I mean

2702
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:33,739
that's really what it is it's the the

2703
01:53:32,329 --> 01:53:35,689
fats and lipids and you'll notice that

2704
01:53:33,738 --> 01:53:38,468
the flower rosin tends to do it more and

2705
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:41,119
and I would say that the majority of

2706
01:53:38,469 --> 01:53:44,630
flower rosin out there being pressed is

2707
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:46,519
is is gonna have that taste for the most

2708
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:48,260
part in is is responsible for the reason

2709
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:50,090
why there's a lot of people out there

2710
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:52,250
that have rosin as a bad taste in their

2711
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:54,020
mouth because majority of people don't

2712
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:56,179
understand quality control they don't

2713
01:53:54,020 --> 01:54:00,890
have the eye and they don't have the

2714
01:53:56,179 --> 01:54:02,359
ability to our to test it to see the

2715
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:05,329
yields to see the quality of the

2716
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:08,509
resident or the the rosin and you know

2717
01:54:05,329 --> 01:54:12,439
taste it you know experience it and

2718
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:14,690
understand every part of it to you know

2719
01:54:12,439 --> 01:54:16,460
understand all the important factors of

2720
01:54:14,689 --> 01:54:17,839
what's important in the quality of the

2721
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:21,800
flowers that you're pressing you know I

2722
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:25,279
think it really comes to working close

2723
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:27,860
with growers and people that are open

2724
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:30,170
minded and understanding you know that

2725
01:54:27,859 --> 01:54:32,210
we're extracting the plants we actually

2726
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:35,170
get to see the resin I'm starting to get

2727
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:35,170
lost with what I was talking about

2728
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:45,260
yeah with John I like to add in I'd like

2729
01:54:43,789 --> 01:54:46,908
to add in that that a that grower

2730
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:50,119
extractor relationship is something

2731
01:54:46,908 --> 01:54:52,309
that's kind of it's it's kind of new you

2732
01:54:50,119 --> 01:54:54,349
know only some people have been doing it

2733
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:56,780
on purpose for a while and now that you

2734
01:54:54,350 --> 01:55:00,350
know realizing that that's the the

2735
01:54:56,779 --> 01:55:01,819
cornerstone of your quality that I think

2736
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:03,140
growers are starting to listen more and

2737
01:55:01,819 --> 01:55:05,090
I think they're really going to start

2738
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:07,610
listening more because it's gonna be a

2739
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:09,140
matter of survival in this new market

2740
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:12,979
you know they want to do something that

2741
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:14,510
works they need to pay attention to you

2742
01:55:12,979 --> 01:55:16,750
know to their extractor to their vessel

2743
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:19,060
that gets their product to the market I

2744
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:21,460
agree especially you know

2745
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:23,350
for my own brand I'm not gonna put my

2746
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:25,480
name on anything that's not the highest

2747
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:27,430
of quality so at that point I really

2748
01:55:25,479 --> 01:55:30,459
have to have a lot to say about how the

2749
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:32,020
grows being grown and you know the

2750
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:33,970
cultivars that are being used of the

2751
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:35,440
people that are in the room it's not

2752
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:36,909
really just a relationship that's

2753
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:38,529
completely cut off that you show up

2754
01:55:36,909 --> 01:55:40,689
you're like yeah I'm just gonna process

2755
01:55:38,529 --> 01:55:42,699
whatever's in there it's like no no no

2756
01:55:40,689 --> 01:55:44,739
no there's like there's levels to this

2757
01:55:42,699 --> 01:55:46,689
[ __ ] you need to like if you have

2758
01:55:44,739 --> 01:55:49,619
something that's worth processing then

2759
01:55:46,689 --> 01:55:51,579
we can talk about a relationship but

2760
01:55:49,619 --> 01:55:54,430
before that who wants to waste their

2761
01:55:51,579 --> 01:55:55,899
time unless you haven't learned yet and

2762
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:58,119
then it's not a waste of time but once

2763
01:55:55,899 --> 01:56:01,899
you've learned it quickly becomes aware

2764
01:55:58,119 --> 01:56:03,849
to you that you know that processing the

2765
01:56:01,899 --> 01:56:05,799
wrong cultivars or the poorly grown

2766
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:08,320
right cultivars is not worth your time

2767
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:11,430
and so if you can pass that message on

2768
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:13,689
to the grower eh don't grow poor poorly

2769
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:15,490
poor cultivars that aren't going to

2770
01:56:13,689 --> 01:56:18,219
express themselves even if you grow them

2771
01:56:15,489 --> 01:56:19,899
perfectly and grow hash producing

2772
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:22,270
cultivars that will allow us to get a

2773
01:56:19,899 --> 01:56:24,099
yield and allow our relationship to to

2774
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:27,550
you know work out for everyone rather

2775
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:30,730
than then no one because water hash has

2776
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:32,710
been a tight one for years processing

2777
01:56:30,729 --> 01:56:34,599
water hash in particular rosin much

2778
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:37,090
different especially when you get a

2779
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:39,760
cultivar like the bike the whereas my

2780
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:42,699
bike which we should welcome Neil and

2781
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:45,909
John into the room they're maple butter

2782
01:56:42,699 --> 01:56:47,470
in the house so guys are you doing how's

2783
01:56:45,909 --> 01:56:49,269
it going everybody dude I'm just gonna

2784
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:49,930
press a little where's my bike here in a

2785
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:53,170
little bit

2786
01:56:49,930 --> 01:56:56,200
nice some guys everybody on the panel

2787
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:59,970
thanks for inviting us and yeah we feel

2788
01:56:56,199 --> 01:57:03,550
very uh invited on a panel of such a

2789
01:56:59,970 --> 01:57:05,440
high caliber yeah and it's funny you

2790
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:07,869
guys are talking about like the grower

2791
01:57:05,439 --> 01:57:10,929
and extract a relationship because

2792
01:57:07,869 --> 01:57:13,059
that's pretty much how me and John got

2793
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:15,240
together I mean I was most more than

2794
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:17,650
grower and he was more the extractor and

2795
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:19,809
you know we really clicked when rod

2796
01:57:17,649 --> 01:57:22,329
Rosen came together a couple years ago

2797
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:25,840
when we uh her first trip in on hash

2798
01:57:22,329 --> 01:57:27,039
Church so very honored to be here today

2799
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:29,390
awesome well why don't you guys give

2800
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:32,300
your introduction how you guys got it

2801
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:35,079
you know producing and processing and

2802
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:38,890
all of that and how you were led into

2803
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:41,000
producing Canadian artesian rosin

2804
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:44,990
basically like most of the people on the

2805
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:46,939
panel we started with dho until sort of

2806
01:57:44,989 --> 01:57:49,819
got introduced to the rosin scene and

2807
01:57:46,939 --> 01:57:51,139
started with not so much success like

2808
01:57:49,819 --> 01:57:53,750
with the hair straightener basically

2809
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:55,400
pressing whatever we could find and once

2810
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:57,560
we realized that like you said the

2811
01:57:55,399 --> 01:58:00,379
quality control when you can control

2812
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:01,820
everything from seed to oil then we have

2813
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:03,529
a lot of success squishing a lot of our

2814
01:58:01,819 --> 01:58:05,179
own flowers and then it was more finding

2815
01:58:03,529 --> 01:58:07,130
cultivars that had specific terpene

2816
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:10,880
profiles that matched what we were

2817
01:58:07,130 --> 01:58:12,710
looking for so basically it's been a you

2818
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:15,470
know a journey to find certain genetics

2819
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:16,609
that we've been working with and a lot

2820
01:58:15,470 --> 01:58:17,900
of things we've had to produce for

2821
01:58:16,609 --> 01:58:19,609
ourselves they're not necessarily cuts

2822
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:23,420
that are commercially passed around and

2823
01:58:19,609 --> 01:58:25,159
in our area there's not too much of a

2824
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:27,859
variety going around everybody seems to

2825
01:58:25,159 --> 01:58:29,149
go for the more on how much gonna get

2826
01:58:27,859 --> 01:58:31,309
and how fast can I get is sort of

2827
01:58:29,149 --> 01:58:33,289
mentality so yeah we're growing more

2828
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:35,510
like 12 weeks trains or 13 weeks trains

2829
01:58:33,289 --> 01:58:38,720
and things like that which again is not

2830
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:40,789
the typical you know yielders around

2831
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:43,010
here so and we're not really looking at

2832
01:58:40,789 --> 01:58:44,869
flower production we're more looking at

2833
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:47,210
resin production so we have certain

2834
01:58:44,869 --> 01:58:50,149
you know cultivars that are producing

2835
01:58:47,210 --> 01:58:53,239
nearly 30 percent returns on rosin and

2836
01:58:50,149 --> 01:58:57,199
things like that so yeah that's mostly

2837
01:58:53,239 --> 01:58:59,569
it genetics and impressing yeah well

2838
01:58:57,199 --> 01:59:01,670
that's definitely what attracted me to

2839
01:58:59,569 --> 01:59:04,130
you guys I'm loving the where is my bike

2840
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:06,020
I get damn near 30 percent every time I

2841
01:59:04,130 --> 01:59:09,859
press it and pressing the nugget out

2842
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:11,960
right now actually and I smoke a ton of

2843
01:59:09,859 --> 01:59:16,159
the rosin that you guys make so I'm

2844
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:21,560
always stoked on that thanks man thanks

2845
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:23,210
a lot absolutely so it is such an

2846
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:27,320
incredible thing to just be able to

2847
01:59:23,210 --> 01:59:30,319
squish a bud and get dabs like that was

2848
01:59:27,319 --> 01:59:33,259
some like that was the okay that was the

2849
01:59:30,319 --> 01:59:35,929
equivalent in bubble bags to the pulling

2850
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:37,670
of the 73 bag for the first time ever

2851
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:38,590
anyone ever seen it it's like you pull

2852
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:42,430
out that yellow

2853
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:46,989
and everyone's eyebrows would go up see

2854
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:53,800
oil squish out of a bud it is

2855
01:59:46,989 --> 01:59:56,079
unbelievable yeah it's uh anyways it was

2856
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:58,270
definitely a good genetic to have that

2857
01:59:56,079 --> 02:00:00,399
that where's my bike definitely a keeper

2858
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:02,500
it's just one that has like a really

2859
02:00:00,399 --> 02:00:03,909
intense chirping profile as well that we

2860
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:05,380
find that really follows through and

2861
02:00:03,909 --> 02:00:07,510
Ross and wears a lot of these strains

2862
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:08,829
depends one of the the cushions and

2863
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:10,180
stuff we find around here super

2864
02:00:08,829 --> 02:00:11,769
temperamental when you're using heat

2865
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:15,400
like a lot of guys we're explaining

2866
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:17,470
before there so we find the bike is

2867
02:00:15,399 --> 02:00:20,500
really like it's loud loud loud and it

2868
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:22,619
almost butters right away oh there you

2869
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,619
go

2870
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:32,520
it definitely buttered right away again

2871
02:00:33,779 --> 02:00:39,399
is everyone out there using parchment I

2872
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:42,010
know some people like the PTFE and then

2873
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:46,149
there's what's silicon paper

2874
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:48,489
yeah we're using marginal yeah I don't

2875
02:00:46,149 --> 02:00:50,379
like the PTFE I mean you can't you can

2876
02:00:48,489 --> 02:00:52,659
you can put the PTFE inside of a piece

2877
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:54,430
of parchment paper but uh it likes to

2878
02:00:52,659 --> 02:00:57,039
ripple and make it hard for collection

2879
02:00:54,430 --> 02:00:59,950
as far as like pressing on a smaller

2880
02:00:57,039 --> 02:01:01,539
scale and like flour rods and things

2881
02:00:59,949 --> 02:01:03,010
like that I mean if you're you're doing

2882
02:01:01,539 --> 02:01:07,029
more like directional flow and stuff

2883
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:10,570
like that I mean maybe but just overall

2884
02:01:07,029 --> 02:01:17,199
parchment seems to be the best thing for

2885
02:01:10,569 --> 02:01:19,559
me yeah I think that PTFE stuff kind of

2886
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:21,579
attracts a lot of things like hair dust

2887
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:24,370
anything that's in your environment

2888
02:01:21,579 --> 02:01:26,800
likes to stick to that stuff so I don't

2889
02:01:24,369 --> 02:01:30,250
really like it to be honest yeah it's

2890
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:34,230
not your psyche I'm trying just about

2891
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:37,239
everything I have a pretty open mind

2892
02:01:34,229 --> 02:01:39,459
that's a very found parchment paper to

2893
02:01:37,239 --> 02:01:45,969
speed over all the easiest thing to work

2894
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:48,569
with I haven't noticed anything that

2895
02:01:45,970 --> 02:01:48,570
I've ever made

2896
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:54,699
I'd say definitely be easy on the

2897
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:56,230
pressure I mean you don't want to be

2898
02:01:54,698 --> 02:02:01,000
blowing out your Harshman having those

2899
02:01:56,229 --> 02:02:02,468
you know those pouch and great like if

2900
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,460
you're seeing your pouch pressing and

2901
02:02:02,469 --> 02:02:05,230
they're the part from which someone was

2902
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:07,060
discussing earlier you're definitely

2903
02:02:05,229 --> 02:02:10,209
pressing too hard

2904
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:13,780
I mean lower your pressure you know

2905
02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:15,158
don't click down so many times you know

2906
02:02:13,779 --> 02:02:16,389
I mean test your yields I mean your

2907
02:02:15,158 --> 02:02:17,559
yields are gonna be the same a lot of

2908
02:02:16,389 --> 02:02:18,880
people like to just give it its all

2909
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:20,739
thinking they're getting every last drop

2910
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:23,590
of oil out without doing any

2911
02:02:20,738 --> 02:02:25,329
experimentation or you know recording

2912
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:27,010
anything and understanding that you know

2913
02:02:25,329 --> 02:02:29,889
a little bit less pressure a little less

2914
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:33,039
time does the same exact thing yeah just

2915
02:02:29,889 --> 02:02:35,440
finding that sweet spot that last bit

2916
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:37,988
that comes that out I believe is much

2917
02:02:35,439 --> 02:02:40,899
higher in fats and lipids in the the

2918
02:02:37,988 --> 02:02:42,638
initial bit that comes out to so using

2919
02:02:40,899 --> 02:02:44,799
that extra pressure to keep pressing

2920
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:48,489
until it turns brown isn't something

2921
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:50,039
that I suggest that's why I like the amp

2922
02:02:48,488 --> 02:02:52,599
um just because you get the feel for it

2923
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:57,158
ultimately I'd like to have one hand

2924
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:59,110
pump set up and then one electric pump

2925
02:02:57,158 --> 02:03:00,698
going and then once you dial it in then

2926
02:02:59,109 --> 02:03:02,019
you just produce on your electric but to

2927
02:03:00,698 --> 02:03:06,519
me the artists in the craft comes up

2928
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:08,920
with hand pump yeah I've used them both

2929
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:10,869
you could become pretty artistic with

2930
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:12,550
that foot pedal too it just depends on

2931
02:03:10,868 --> 02:03:17,368
whether you want to use your hand or

2932
02:03:12,550 --> 02:03:20,440
your foot for that connection so it's

2933
02:03:17,368 --> 02:03:23,880
definitely preferred the the hand pump

2934
02:03:20,439 --> 02:03:29,729
when I'm pressing hash and flower

2935
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:31,868
electric but they all get the job done

2936
02:03:29,729 --> 02:03:34,658
certainly pressed a lot with the hand

2937
02:03:31,868 --> 02:03:37,599
pump and the foot pump and started to

2938
02:03:34,658 --> 02:03:39,819
say I like one over the other just

2939
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:41,350
depends on what you're doing I mean you

2940
02:03:39,819 --> 02:03:43,509
definitely get me a feel from the hand

2941
02:03:41,350 --> 02:03:44,770
pump but you know if you're doing higher

2942
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:47,010
production or something like that it

2943
02:03:44,770 --> 02:03:49,960
seems like having some kind of automatic

2944
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:53,920
you know system might actually be a lot

2945
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:56,770
better yeah yeah turn to squish a pound

2946
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:58,300
of hash with a hand pump would suck ass

2947
02:03:56,770 --> 02:04:03,310
I don't know what the [ __ ] I would do

2948
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:04,690
with that ya know I just like having

2949
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:09,239
both so you could dial it in with a

2950
02:04:04,689 --> 02:04:09,238
just like your your like to repeat that

2951
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:18,070
absolutely oh go ahead actually like

2952
02:04:14,289 --> 02:04:19,779
ramping rates and determining like just

2953
02:04:18,069 --> 02:04:22,059
basically generating data to determine

2954
02:04:19,779 --> 02:04:23,529
how quickly you can actually ramp based

2955
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:26,620
on the size of filter that you actually

2956
02:04:23,529 --> 02:04:28,649
have something that I've been working on

2957
02:04:26,619 --> 02:04:32,920
recently but you end up finding that

2958
02:04:28,649 --> 02:04:35,289
each filter has a different ramp ramping

2959
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:37,090
rate essentially and so you'll find

2960
02:04:35,289 --> 02:04:40,689
obviously that will some cultures you

2961
02:04:37,090 --> 02:04:42,369
can actually increase like your ramp at

2962
02:04:40,689 --> 02:04:47,619
a rate of I don't know something like

2963
02:04:42,369 --> 02:04:52,569
like 300 to actually it would be more

2964
02:04:47,619 --> 02:04:55,479
like like about 1500 psi every minute or

2965
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:58,329
you can even like decrease it down to as

2966
02:04:55,479 --> 02:04:59,679
low as like 800 psi every minute but it

2967
02:04:58,329 --> 02:05:03,250
all really depends on the size of the

2968
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:05,520
filter that you actually have yeah I

2969
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:09,550
mean not a grown understands that the

2970
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:10,780
the pressure from the press is actually

2971
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:13,510
determined by the size of the bag

2972
02:05:10,779 --> 02:05:14,979
exactly I got a 25-ton press that's what

2973
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:16,530
I'm doing every time but it depends on

2974
02:05:14,979 --> 02:05:20,349
the side of size the bag you're using

2975
02:05:16,529 --> 02:05:22,210
mm-hmm yeah and even for like hats and

2976
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:24,640
stuff like that the quality of the hash

2977
02:05:22,210 --> 02:05:26,439
also depends on how much you know and I

2978
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:28,180
definitely kept logs of all of that too

2979
02:05:26,439 --> 02:05:30,429
I keep a log of the quality and how much

2980
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:31,719
patch I can put in each bag and I've

2981
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:33,670
been trying to make some kind of thing

2982
02:05:31,719 --> 02:05:35,469
myself with that I also like to log

2983
02:05:33,670 --> 02:05:37,000
everything in a book of every press I do

2984
02:05:35,469 --> 02:05:38,109
with the temperatures and returns and

2985
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,520
stuff like that and even if there's a

2986
02:05:38,109 --> 02:05:43,710
blowout or something to make sure to log

2987
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,710
that yeah absolutely

2988
02:05:44,189 --> 02:05:49,988
yeah we put a little calculator on there

2989
02:05:47,229 --> 02:05:53,259
our touch screen that put the bank size

2990
02:05:49,988 --> 02:05:54,789
in their bags using and the calculators

2991
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:57,280
not the exact pressure on the bag or way

2992
02:05:54,789 --> 02:06:00,010
to bring your pump to vice versa if you

2993
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:01,539
if you if you do a nice press and you

2994
02:06:00,010 --> 02:06:03,159
see where you brought your your pump

2995
02:06:01,539 --> 02:06:04,510
teach to you can calculate back

2996
02:06:03,159 --> 02:06:07,380
calculate what the pressure on the bag

2997
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:10,869
was so that you can do that every time

2998
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:12,760
yeah with the from experimenting you

2999
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:17,679
know you find your metrics you find your

3000
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:19,119
you know yeah sorry

3001
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:20,949
you find out like you know where your

3002
02:06:19,118 --> 02:06:23,609
consistencies are and then from there

3003
02:06:20,948 --> 02:06:26,138
you can scale different material

3004
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:27,759
different temperatures different amounts

3005
02:06:26,139 --> 02:06:28,510
in the bag and it's it's just kind of

3006
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:30,458
dialing it in

3007
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:33,248
I personally I'm all by feel I don't

3008
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:36,519
have any adjustment on my foot pump or

3009
02:06:33,248 --> 02:06:39,219
any gauge it's a gene I've used just out

3010
02:06:36,519 --> 02:06:41,289
of out of the box from there that's been

3011
02:06:39,219 --> 02:06:46,840
my baseline for for everything I've

3012
02:06:41,288 --> 02:06:48,368
experimented with very cool yeah it's

3013
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:50,078
it's definitely something to think about

3014
02:06:48,368 --> 02:06:52,598
where that pressure is coming down on

3015
02:06:50,078 --> 02:06:55,238
top of your screen is where you know

3016
02:06:52,599 --> 02:06:57,489
that's what you're thinking of blowouts

3017
02:06:55,238 --> 02:06:59,558
is definitely a big problem I think also

3018
02:06:57,488 --> 02:07:01,538
a big problem is potentially that a lot

3019
02:06:59,559 --> 02:07:06,880
of the screen that's being used is maybe

3020
02:07:01,538 --> 02:07:10,179
not rated for pressure or for heat yeah

3021
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:12,429
yes we just went through making their

3022
02:07:10,179 --> 02:07:15,279
own bags and just just trying to find

3023
02:07:12,429 --> 02:07:16,899
the proper material was was at or in

3024
02:07:15,279 --> 02:07:19,118
itself you know took a few months

3025
02:07:16,899 --> 02:07:21,458
especially in Canada I mean the bags

3026
02:07:19,118 --> 02:07:24,578
were reason right now come at Italy the

3027
02:07:21,458 --> 02:07:26,170
it's a polyester monofilament my note of

3028
02:07:24,578 --> 02:07:28,840
Italy like I'm sure I can do cheaper but

3029
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:30,519
it's just to me it was just the best bag

3030
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:32,920
it doesn't say any stretch I bet you

3031
02:07:30,519 --> 02:07:35,079
can't do cheaper because honestly I I've

3032
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:37,840
been doing this screen for a long time

3033
02:07:35,078 --> 02:07:40,688
that's both heat and pressure rated yeah

3034
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:43,360
it's expensive stuff and they don't they

3035
02:07:40,689 --> 02:07:45,010
don't knock it off in China well at all

3036
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:47,259
and the thing the reason why I've always

3037
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:50,079
used it is because it's like it's heat

3038
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:51,159
stamped so that the it won't ever lose

3039
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:53,349
its hold

3040
02:07:51,158 --> 02:07:55,299
if it goes in and out of water many many

3041
02:07:53,349 --> 02:07:58,929
many times it doesn't lose the actual

3042
02:07:55,300 --> 02:08:01,150
micron diameter of the of the hole it

3043
02:07:58,929 --> 02:08:03,069
keeps that whereas like some silk and

3044
02:08:01,149 --> 02:08:06,609
some other materials they don't do that

3045
02:08:03,069 --> 02:08:10,238
the more they get exposed to water and

3046
02:08:06,609 --> 02:08:11,859
whether they will lose their hold they

3047
02:08:10,238 --> 02:08:14,978
won't hold that same size that's why

3048
02:08:11,859 --> 02:08:17,408
bubble bags are warrantied for life yeah

3049
02:08:14,979 --> 02:08:19,900
one thing I count about with like a lot

3050
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:21,549
of bags suppresses that like especially

3051
02:08:19,899 --> 02:08:23,828
the TAS is that you'll actually have

3052
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:25,538
hiked the where the seams are sewn in

3053
02:08:23,828 --> 02:08:27,158
don't open up a little bit so I'd like

3054
02:08:25,538 --> 02:08:28,840
to personally double bag my stuff to

3055
02:08:27,158 --> 02:08:30,429
keep quality and all the opposing sides

3056
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:32,319
the seam so everything gets caught

3057
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:33,850
the opposite way and a couple filters

3058
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:36,009
everything but I don't really go for

3059
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:37,630
yogi there's my progress I think that's

3060
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:39,850
a very good idea with the quality that

3061
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:42,430
you're dealing with because a blowout is

3062
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:46,480
just such a bummer and to have to expose

3063
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:48,460
it to extra heat like gathering it all

3064
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:51,159
and rescreening it and trying to get it

3065
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:54,189
to press better I think it's better to

3066
02:08:51,159 --> 02:08:56,109
just you know you know make sure those

3067
02:08:54,189 --> 02:08:58,509
seams are on point or just double it up

3068
02:08:56,109 --> 02:09:01,509
on opposite sides so that you don't get

3069
02:08:58,510 --> 02:09:03,489
that in you know blowouts are a bummer

3070
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:05,590
when the hash contaminates the oil

3071
02:09:03,489 --> 02:09:08,260
especially when it's a pretty decent

3072
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:10,420
quality hash already you just get these

3073
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:14,079
kind of like chunks inside this

3074
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:19,239
beautiful oil and it's uh it's a little

3075
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:21,909
bit rough yeah no I'm not excited how do

3076
02:09:19,239 --> 02:09:23,559
you guys feel about kelan and uh like

3077
02:09:21,909 --> 02:09:26,229
the head and the tail of Raza do you

3078
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:29,620
feel that there is or isn't or you know

3079
02:09:26,229 --> 02:09:30,969
more in Flour rosin and hash rosin you

3080
02:09:29,619 --> 02:09:34,359
like to mix them do you like to keep

3081
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:36,579
them separate I definitely like to keep

3082
02:09:34,359 --> 02:09:38,409
them separate myself I just feel like

3083
02:09:36,579 --> 02:09:40,710
even from a photography standpoint

3084
02:09:38,409 --> 02:09:44,949
without if I didn't even puff it at all

3085
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:47,260
that one is just way nicer looking under

3086
02:09:44,949 --> 02:09:50,769
the lens and generally it's the one I

3087
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:53,530
also find myself puffing on more often

3088
02:09:50,770 --> 02:09:56,020
than not that early you know head of the

3089
02:09:53,529 --> 02:09:57,969
head of the the the squish compared to

3090
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:59,680
the tail and it also depends on who's

3091
02:09:57,970 --> 02:10:02,949
head and whose tail were talking because

3092
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:04,570
some people the tail is a lot and other

3093
02:10:02,949 --> 02:10:06,609
people just give it like a little tiny

3094
02:10:04,569 --> 02:10:08,920
like oh yeah that tail wasn't so bad at

3095
02:10:06,609 --> 02:10:11,349
all the end result of that squish was

3096
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:13,930
actually on point with the first one so

3097
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:19,930
I've seen both but for myself I I do

3098
02:10:13,930 --> 02:10:21,369
like the head of the squish I have

3099
02:10:19,930 --> 02:10:23,110
usually have pretty small tail on my

3100
02:10:21,369 --> 02:10:25,029
squishes and I like to cut it off a lot

3101
02:10:23,109 --> 02:10:26,469
early but then I like to do off my

3102
02:10:25,029 --> 02:10:28,179
second switches and I'll do a lot of my

3103
02:10:26,470 --> 02:10:30,130
experimentation and stuff like that with

3104
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:35,200
that it's a good way to you look for

3105
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:38,190
teeth yeah yeah I agree there you know I

3106
02:10:35,199 --> 02:10:40,210
think it's it's really that's a really a

3107
02:10:38,189 --> 02:10:42,549
tough thing for people that are making

3108
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:44,229
rosin you know it's it's it's a having

3109
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:47,708
that deciding factor of whether to

3110
02:10:44,229 --> 02:10:49,510
to put them together for some material

3111
02:10:47,708 --> 02:10:53,038
it can be a huge sacrifice and yield you

3112
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:56,229
know you're you're sacrificing quality

3113
02:10:53,038 --> 02:10:58,448
by by putting in that tail in or you're

3114
02:10:56,229 --> 02:10:59,679
you're removing that and increasing the

3115
02:10:58,448 --> 02:11:01,478
the quality you know but you're

3116
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:03,368
sacrificing your yield at that point so

3117
02:11:01,479 --> 02:11:05,380
you know at that point you know it

3118
02:11:03,368 --> 02:11:07,389
becomes uh trying to find a happy medium

3119
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:09,489
for that you know deciding on whether

3120
02:11:07,389 --> 02:11:12,219
you know maybe this micron that was

3121
02:11:09,488 --> 02:11:13,808
pressed can be mixed in the hole or you

3122
02:11:12,219 --> 02:11:16,090
know whether it's too dark and the taste

3123
02:11:13,809 --> 02:11:19,269
isn't there and it doesn't taste like

3124
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:20,498
anything that that the rest of it you

3125
02:11:19,269 --> 02:11:22,119
know it does doesn't have the same

3126
02:11:20,498 --> 02:11:23,769
terpenes as the other microns or

3127
02:11:22,118 --> 02:11:27,219
whatever the case is you know I think

3128
02:11:23,769 --> 02:11:30,789
that's uh you know that's that's a big

3129
02:11:27,219 --> 02:11:32,920
thing especially in like the whole

3130
02:11:30,788 --> 02:11:34,719
dispensary market or you know trying to

3131
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:38,349
to make a business out of it you know

3132
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:40,029
having a consistent consistent wholesale

3133
02:11:38,349 --> 02:11:42,760
number or something like that you know

3134
02:11:40,029 --> 02:11:44,349
it becomes tough because certain

3135
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:46,989
material does different things and it's

3136
02:11:44,349 --> 02:11:48,760
really it's really depending on what you

3137
02:11:46,988 --> 02:11:52,029
want your quality to be so if you want

3138
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:53,739
that super clear just bomb all the way

3139
02:11:52,029 --> 02:11:56,050
through you know some people are

3140
02:11:53,738 --> 02:11:57,279
sacrificing tail end or you know there's

3141
02:11:56,050 --> 02:11:58,630
a lot of material out there if you

3142
02:11:57,279 --> 02:12:00,069
really know what you're looking for and

3143
02:11:58,630 --> 02:12:01,719
you're working with the right rowers and

3144
02:12:00,069 --> 02:12:02,889
they're being open-minded and they're

3145
02:12:01,719 --> 02:12:05,408
cutting and they're starting new things

3146
02:12:02,889 --> 02:12:06,519
then you'll find those strains that just

3147
02:12:05,408 --> 02:12:09,399
give you great yields all the way

3148
02:12:06,519 --> 02:12:11,650
through with with quality oil I think

3149
02:12:09,399 --> 02:12:15,939
it's just you know that's another thing

3150
02:12:11,649 --> 02:12:17,859
for rosin too is having that that that I

3151
02:12:15,939 --> 02:12:21,819
for quality and knowing what to keep

3152
02:12:17,859 --> 02:12:23,439
separated and what to put together so it

3153
02:12:21,819 --> 02:12:26,078
also depends on where you're coming from

3154
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:27,728
like some people like are coming from

3155
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:29,920
the perspective of I just want to pop

3156
02:12:27,729 --> 02:12:32,409
the highest quality material that I can

3157
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:35,590
pop and other people are like I am

3158
02:12:32,408 --> 02:12:37,839
trying to do 1.3 million dollars a year

3159
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:39,849
with my new business and they're both as

3160
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:41,739
respectable I'm not putting one above

3161
02:12:39,849 --> 02:12:44,590
the other but obviously when it's a

3162
02:12:41,738 --> 02:12:47,408
business you know mixing in the tail end

3163
02:12:44,590 --> 02:12:49,150
and getting it you know or keeping it

3164
02:12:47,408 --> 02:12:50,738
separate and still being able to sell it

3165
02:12:49,149 --> 02:12:53,649
for a decent dollar it's usually gonna

3166
02:12:50,738 --> 02:12:55,598
be the bottom line and when it's you

3167
02:12:53,649 --> 02:12:56,519
know puffing for your own head the

3168
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:58,529
bottom line is

3169
02:12:56,520 --> 02:13:02,760
different it's like it's I think it's a

3170
02:12:58,529 --> 02:13:08,009
lot more you know it's a lot fewer

3171
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:12,480
things passed the test that's what I

3172
02:13:08,010 --> 02:13:14,520
would say about that yeah no III agree

3173
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:15,809
there for sure I mean there's it's all

3174
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:17,130
depends on what you're looking for and

3175
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:19,110
what you're trying to be you know and

3176
02:13:17,130 --> 02:13:20,789
there's nothing wrong with having a you

3177
02:13:19,109 --> 02:13:22,649
know having everything together still

3178
02:13:20,789 --> 02:13:26,250
makes a great quality oil I'm not saying

3179
02:13:22,649 --> 02:13:27,449
that it doesn't just like for me you

3180
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:29,880
know I have all these little globs of

3181
02:13:27,449 --> 02:13:32,189
these tail ends that I do I don't do

3182
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:33,659
anything with they're great for

3183
02:13:32,189 --> 02:13:36,000
experimentation I mean they really are

3184
02:13:33,659 --> 02:13:38,970
especially if you want to try learning

3185
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,380
like you know making sauce and THCA it's

3186
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:41,789
popular right now if you really want to

3187
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:43,619
play with that it's good learning

3188
02:13:41,789 --> 02:13:47,340
material at play with you know you have

3189
02:13:43,619 --> 02:13:49,800
less less loss in the R&amp;D but uh you

3190
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:51,900
know you know some people keep it in

3191
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:53,489
some people take it out some people I

3192
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:54,929
mean it really depends on the material I

3193
02:13:53,489 --> 02:13:57,989
think but I think that's an important

3194
02:13:54,930 --> 02:13:59,460
part of making quality rosin and rosin

3195
02:13:57,989 --> 02:14:00,989
that's going to be desirable you know

3196
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:04,529
knowing what to keep what the poll and

3197
02:14:00,989 --> 02:14:06,269
what to keep together you know whether

3198
02:14:04,529 --> 02:14:07,559
it's whether it's 5 grams on the whole

3199
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:08,790
town that you're that you're keeping

3200
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:10,500
yeah that's the tale and you know

3201
02:14:08,789 --> 02:14:13,170
sometimes it's not it's not a loss it's

3202
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:15,869
really not but I'm knowing to keep that

3203
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:18,539
out just to have that much better of a

3204
02:14:15,869 --> 02:14:21,390
product is important I think it's an

3205
02:14:18,539 --> 02:14:24,479
important part of making quality solvent

3206
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:27,329
list concentrates absolutely I

3207
02:14:24,479 --> 02:14:30,779
definitely think that for flour rose and

3208
02:14:27,329 --> 02:14:32,819
only doing like one one squish and not

3209
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:35,250
mixing in the tail and is is a definite

3210
02:14:32,819 --> 02:14:38,340
must and then when I'm doing like more

3211
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:40,739
like dry stiff draws ins or or lower

3212
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:42,539
temperature rosen's like bubble hash or

3213
02:14:40,739 --> 02:14:45,239
something then I can do to squishes and

3214
02:14:42,539 --> 02:14:47,489
I can mix them together I find I've got

3215
02:14:45,239 --> 02:14:49,199
a very similar consistency but in Flour

3216
02:14:47,489 --> 02:14:51,679
Oz and they definitely can't do it a

3217
02:14:49,199 --> 02:14:53,699
second squish and put it back in its

3218
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:57,360
contaminates the whole lot yeah it

3219
02:14:53,699 --> 02:14:59,699
affects coloration yeah I agree

3220
02:14:57,359 --> 02:15:01,289
yeah I'd say flour rosin has a bigger

3221
02:14:59,699 --> 02:15:03,929
tail in I mean I always say flower

3222
02:15:01,289 --> 02:15:05,880
Osmond is like anywhere from like a

3223
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:09,210
three to five percent tail and depending

3224
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:10,319
on the flowers and depend on how you

3225
02:15:09,210 --> 02:15:12,270
feel about it you know

3226
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:14,159
me that's what I feel in most most cases

3227
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:17,160
Flores intends to have a three to five

3228
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:18,449
percent till in you can keep it in there

3229
02:15:17,159 --> 02:15:21,239
and I'm not gonna say the rosin is bad

3230
02:15:18,449 --> 02:15:23,340
at all it's it's still quality rosin but

3231
02:15:21,239 --> 02:15:27,090
if you want to kind of improve clarity

3232
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:29,100
color a little bit of a taste for for

3233
02:15:27,090 --> 02:15:31,020
the people real picky I mean they'll

3234
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:34,650
notice the difference for people amasses

3235
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:36,810
they might not yeah it definitely

3236
02:15:34,649 --> 02:15:38,579
depends on what you're squishing and how

3237
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:42,390
hard you're pressing it as well you know

3238
02:15:38,579 --> 02:15:44,100
if you're if you're what working

3239
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:46,110
backwards from yield and working towards

3240
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:48,289
quality I think is the mindset that's

3241
02:15:46,109 --> 02:15:51,000
that's most important you know if you're

3242
02:15:48,289 --> 02:15:52,439
if your end result is to make something

3243
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,909
that's really tasty and then you're not

3244
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:55,199
going to press the very end of the bag

3245
02:15:53,909 --> 02:15:59,069
out you're not going to press it all the

3246
02:15:55,199 --> 02:16:01,289
way down and that also you know some

3247
02:15:59,069 --> 02:16:02,489
strains some strains have a big tail and

3248
02:16:01,289 --> 02:16:04,710
like you said and some don't

3249
02:16:02,489 --> 02:16:07,880
yeah but how about when you're doing a

3250
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:10,260
press and the flow that begins is dark

3251
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:12,600
and then when you leave it in there to

3252
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:14,850
get the full press done when you open

3253
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:18,060
the paper there's a blonde butter all

3254
02:16:14,850 --> 02:16:20,610
inside like what would you miss that

3255
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:22,170
when the flow is dark it's almost like

3256
02:16:20,609 --> 02:16:23,519
you're looking at this [ __ ] like man I

3257
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:26,010
don't know what the hell to do with that

3258
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:28,470
but that [ __ ] all around the bag right

3259
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:29,730
there that's a whole nother story so

3260
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:31,530
like what if it's like Dex I mean I

3261
02:16:29,729 --> 02:16:34,850
press so much different stuff that it's

3262
02:16:31,529 --> 02:16:37,500
like there's so many different results

3263
02:16:34,850 --> 02:16:39,600
I've had that I've had that happen to me

3264
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:41,819
with some recently with some bubble hash

3265
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:43,829
and I don't know that it's like for

3266
02:16:41,819 --> 02:16:46,649
instance the first the first wash I did

3267
02:16:43,829 --> 02:16:49,379
I pressed it out and just dark rosin and

3268
02:16:46,649 --> 02:16:51,149
then the second wash it kept getting

3269
02:16:49,379 --> 02:16:53,670
lighter all the way to like the seventh

3270
02:16:51,149 --> 02:16:55,500
wash it just got way lighter and I

3271
02:16:53,670 --> 02:16:57,329
didn't know what that was or really what

3272
02:16:55,500 --> 02:17:00,510
what to say about it or how to explain

3273
02:16:57,329 --> 02:17:01,979
it I don't know if that's the same thing

3274
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:03,210
I mean as far as what you're saying to

3275
02:17:01,979 --> 02:17:04,760
me it sounds like you know when

3276
02:17:03,209 --> 02:17:07,649
something comes out stable off the press

3277
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:08,819
tends to be darker not always but it

3278
02:17:07,649 --> 02:17:09,959
tends to be darker than when it's

3279
02:17:08,819 --> 02:17:12,569
buttered you know if you were to take

3280
02:17:09,959 --> 02:17:14,699
something that's clear stable and then

3281
02:17:12,569 --> 02:17:18,869
you you know you you you either whip it

3282
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:21,540
up or you allow it to naturally nucleate

3283
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:23,130
you know it's gonna lighten up yeah what

3284
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:24,240
I'm trying to say is like if you were to

3285
02:17:23,129 --> 02:17:26,039
take let's just say

3286
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:27,959
now it's a hash you put in a sack put in

3287
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:30,050
the paper you put it in the press you

3288
02:17:27,959 --> 02:17:34,289
bang it down you're going for one press

3289
02:17:30,049 --> 02:17:35,909
hello that start come out is dark you're

3290
02:17:34,290 --> 02:17:37,230
looking at like man I could have swore

3291
02:17:35,909 --> 02:17:39,840
that was gonna be way lighter than that

3292
02:17:37,229 --> 02:17:42,600
it's coming out dark not like TV remote

3293
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:44,909
dark you know we're not present here but

3294
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:45,569
you know darker of a color than you were

3295
02:17:44,909 --> 02:17:48,000
expecting

3296
02:17:45,569 --> 02:17:49,469
but yeah you let the press finish you

3297
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,610
know the press is finishing it's getting

3298
02:17:49,469 --> 02:17:51,359
to the end of the flow you're like all

3299
02:17:50,610 --> 02:17:53,640
right this is it

3300
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:56,430
you pull the pressure up pull the paper

3301
02:17:53,639 --> 02:17:58,920
out and when you open the paper up all

3302
02:17:56,430 --> 02:18:01,440
the drips are dark but everything that's

3303
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:04,049
on the paper is a light white creamy

3304
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:04,560
like blood butter you know what I'm

3305
02:18:04,049 --> 02:18:07,729
saying

3306
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:11,159
about one press you get what you get yet

3307
02:18:07,729 --> 02:18:12,689
so so so when you allow that that stable

3308
02:18:11,159 --> 02:18:14,700
part that comes through when you allow

3309
02:18:12,690 --> 02:18:17,489
it to cross over and completely butter

3310
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:19,560
does it is it an equal color it does it

3311
02:18:17,489 --> 02:18:22,020
get lighter is it is it is it comparable

3312
02:18:19,559 --> 02:18:24,059
to the butter that's on the block yeah

3313
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:25,979
what's that stuff starts to actually

3314
02:18:24,059 --> 02:18:27,539
butter up it starts to get really light

3315
02:18:25,979 --> 02:18:29,789
like it's just crazy like you can pull

3316
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:32,010
it you can literally stick your dab in

3317
02:18:29,790 --> 02:18:33,840
it and you can pull it and it gets clear

3318
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:35,819
and starts to turn in like sugar as

3319
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:37,350
you're pulling it from that darker mass

3320
02:18:35,819 --> 02:18:38,039
and if you just keep pulling it with

3321
02:18:37,350 --> 02:18:40,229
your dabber

3322
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:42,450
it's like blot it's looks exactly like

3323
02:18:40,229 --> 02:18:45,449
the buttered stuff so some stuff is just

3324
02:18:42,450 --> 02:18:48,090
weird on the press I mean at that point

3325
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:51,750
to me I would say you know you have you

3326
02:18:48,090 --> 02:18:53,579
have crystallite or it's nucleating it's

3327
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:54,870
it's turning the butter so so if you

3328
02:18:53,579 --> 02:18:57,090
think about it you know it's pressing

3329
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:59,250
off of there there's effervescence going

3330
02:18:57,090 --> 02:19:01,889
on you have all these terpenes creating

3331
02:18:59,250 --> 02:19:03,299
bubbles with the heating escaping so now

3332
02:19:01,889 --> 02:19:05,670
you have all this air trapped inside of

3333
02:19:03,299 --> 02:19:09,689
this rosin so I think when it when it

3334
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:11,819
butters up that's also responsible to to

3335
02:19:09,690 --> 02:19:14,579
some point that it why it's becoming

3336
02:19:11,819 --> 02:19:17,100
lighter you know air trapped inside of

3337
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:18,420
it then buttering up it lightens up

3338
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:22,440
compared to something that's just so

3339
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:24,120
dense it's uh I mean that's compared to

3340
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:27,690
a butter I would say stable rosin is

3341
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:30,329
more dense maybe that's why it's not as

3342
02:19:27,690 --> 02:19:33,120
light yeah it's just crazy because that

3343
02:19:30,329 --> 02:19:34,709
the rosin that flows out is that darker

3344
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:37,260
color and then all the stuff like I mean

3345
02:19:34,709 --> 02:19:38,388
sometimes it even looks like THC a it's

3346
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:40,398
so white

3347
02:19:38,388 --> 02:19:41,598
crumbly all around the whole inside

3348
02:19:40,398 --> 02:19:43,068
because you know you got your sag and

3349
02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:45,829
you have a space all the way around your

3350
02:19:43,068 --> 02:19:48,680
paper yeah based avoid I'm talking about

3351
02:19:45,829 --> 02:19:50,120
that fills but just crazy why I'm taking

3352
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:54,500
lots of pictures of it and put it on my

3353
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:56,899
histogram it's a pendulum what when that

3354
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:59,478
happens it's pretty crazy it seems like

3355
02:19:56,898 --> 02:20:02,090
you're creating two separate fractions

3356
02:19:59,478 --> 02:20:03,559
obviously yeah

3357
02:20:02,090 --> 02:20:05,090
that's what I'm thinking too but then

3358
02:20:03,559 --> 02:20:07,250
it's crazy because that second fraction

3359
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:09,978
will eventually turn into what looks

3360
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:10,430
like around the pouches it's really

3361
02:20:09,978 --> 02:20:14,840
weird

3362
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:17,270
so happening is possibly like your

3363
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:19,488
catalyst thing is like us sorry I was

3364
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:21,770
saying your catalysing the process of

3365
02:20:19,488 --> 02:20:23,090
the oxygen that kind of comes out on the

3366
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:24,738
initial plates when it sits for a little

3367
02:20:23,090 --> 02:20:26,809
bit longer and then if it matches up

3368
02:20:24,738 --> 02:20:28,430
whenever you end up like later on down

3369
02:20:26,809 --> 02:20:29,959
the road and after you whip it up like I

3370
02:20:28,430 --> 02:20:31,460
feel like it's just the same thing but

3371
02:20:29,959 --> 02:20:32,959
it just happened a lot faster because

3372
02:20:31,459 --> 02:20:35,750
the heat and everything has gotten way

3373
02:20:32,959 --> 02:20:37,728
quicker because he everybody knows and

3374
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:39,889
that helps catalyst that thca forming

3375
02:20:37,728 --> 02:20:44,738
which is what makes the butter turn into

3376
02:20:39,889 --> 02:20:44,738
a white color inside of butter rosin

3377
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:52,040
yeah I just I've seen some crazy [ __ ] on

3378
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:55,488
the press that I just can't explain

3379
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:57,920
sometimes like I don't even had thta or

3380
02:20:55,488 --> 02:21:00,590
mean around to my max it wasn't quite

3381
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:03,829
fold the papers over like straight up

3382
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:07,639
white DHEA all like form is not even

3383
02:21:03,829 --> 02:21:09,350
butter like beyond butter yeah you must

3384
02:21:07,639 --> 02:21:12,108
be pressing like real low temps then

3385
02:21:09,350 --> 02:21:15,380
right below true those presses were

3386
02:21:12,109 --> 02:21:18,350
going at like 180 to 200 degrees and it

3387
02:21:15,379 --> 02:21:20,539
was just really try resins like super

3388
02:21:18,350 --> 02:21:24,170
super dry resin you know what I mean oh

3389
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:25,729
so nice and stable resin then right yeah

3390
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:27,260
yeah I mean you could definitely call it

3391
02:21:25,728 --> 02:21:28,938
stable for sure like stuff that's really

3392
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:32,210
hard to pressed and you know on paper

3393
02:21:28,939 --> 02:21:35,420
and [ __ ] like that like yeah yeah yeah I

3394
02:21:32,209 --> 02:21:37,938
mean mediate I feel like you know I feel

3395
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:39,770
like the temperature that's the deciding

3396
02:21:37,939 --> 02:21:42,350
factor for me is when when nucleation

3397
02:21:39,770 --> 02:21:44,569
and crystallization stop occurring off

3398
02:21:42,350 --> 02:21:46,550
the block so for instance some strains

3399
02:21:44,568 --> 02:21:48,139
you can press them at 180 degrees and

3400
02:21:46,549 --> 02:21:50,539
you can get them out clear and stable

3401
02:21:48,139 --> 02:21:51,979
and then some strains they're there

3402
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:55,131
they're less viscous

3403
02:21:51,979 --> 02:21:56,539
more of a stable starting material you

3404
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:58,189
know they like the shatter or you can

3405
02:21:56,540 --> 02:22:02,211
touch them with the hand so they tend to

3406
02:21:58,190 --> 02:22:05,810
need more heat to be to to push them out

3407
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:08,149
so I feel like you know not having just

3408
02:22:05,810 --> 02:22:10,851
just having having just enough temp

3409
02:22:08,149 --> 02:22:16,190
pushes out and enough time to stop the

3410
02:22:10,851 --> 02:22:18,351
process of nucleation so therefore you

3411
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:20,060
know having just even five degrees under

3412
02:22:18,351 --> 02:22:22,060
the temp that it might need so maybe

3413
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:25,579
maybe it comes out clear and stable at

3414
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:27,560
205 degrees but at 200 degrees you know

3415
02:22:25,579 --> 02:22:30,110
it's pushing out clearance clear or

3416
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:32,890
stable rosin but inside of the blocks it

3417
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:35,450
has enough time to sit on that heat and

3418
02:22:32,890 --> 02:22:37,640
to move to the next phase it starts to

3419
02:22:35,450 --> 02:22:39,471
butter up you know and I don't know

3420
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:41,210
that's all through observations and

3421
02:22:39,470 --> 02:22:43,069
theory and things that I think and

3422
02:22:41,210 --> 02:22:48,140
that's what I tell myself and that's

3423
02:22:43,069 --> 02:22:50,239
what I feel you know but I think

3424
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:52,091
ultimately you know we got to get

3425
02:22:50,239 --> 02:22:55,761
together do it design an experiment and

3426
02:22:52,091 --> 02:22:57,351
with an analysis lab and and we get a

3427
02:22:55,761 --> 02:23:02,810
lot of answers I mean it costs a bit of

3428
02:22:57,351 --> 02:23:05,060
money but they think they do that I'm

3429
02:23:02,810 --> 02:23:06,380
really phase now I think I think that's

3430
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:08,630
gonna start happening a lot especially

3431
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:10,489
with the I mean out here there's gonna

3432
02:23:08,630 --> 02:23:12,350
be testing required on everything and a

3433
02:23:10,489 --> 02:23:13,819
lot I mean some people do it now some

3434
02:23:12,351 --> 02:23:15,829
people do it occasionally they do they

3435
02:23:13,819 --> 02:23:17,511
test stuff here in there but I mean

3436
02:23:15,829 --> 02:23:19,909
every everything we do is gonna have to

3437
02:23:17,511 --> 02:23:21,440
be tested at some point so you know

3438
02:23:19,909 --> 02:23:23,869
that's all gonna be on the paper it's

3439
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:25,819
just a matter of how how trustworthy are

3440
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:27,711
these companies and how accurate is this

3441
02:23:25,819 --> 02:23:29,949
data you know it's you're gonna have to

3442
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:33,109
connect with the right people

3443
02:23:29,950 --> 02:23:36,079
yeah yeah and as it becomes more

3444
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:37,310
mainstream in legal more States we're

3445
02:23:36,079 --> 02:23:38,181
gonna see the scientists getting into

3446
02:23:37,310 --> 02:23:41,360
this big time right

3447
02:23:38,181 --> 02:23:44,149
so do improper analysis I think that's

3448
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:45,891
that's sort of the next step for for

3449
02:23:44,149 --> 02:23:50,739
we're gonna bring the next phase of

3450
02:23:45,890 --> 02:23:53,091
rosin to I'll be and everything

3451
02:23:50,739 --> 02:23:55,310
well it sure has been moving at a quick

3452
02:23:53,091 --> 02:23:58,069
accelerated rate almost quicker than the

3453
02:23:55,310 --> 02:23:59,899
actual data itself it's just being

3454
02:23:58,069 --> 02:24:02,300
hammered out left right and center a lot

3455
02:23:59,899 --> 02:24:04,640
of people are squishing rosin both on a

3456
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:06,408
commercial level and on a just personal

3457
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:09,389
level

3458
02:24:06,408 --> 02:24:11,939
the batch that I just made the oil that

3459
02:24:09,389 --> 02:24:13,708
I just made was very lovely it's a bit

3460
02:24:11,939 --> 02:24:18,299
to get off the parchment but it's

3461
02:24:13,709 --> 02:24:21,869
absolutely stellar quality for a little

3462
02:24:18,299 --> 02:24:24,689
bug press but do you have it oh yeah I

3463
02:24:21,869 --> 02:24:27,418
do have it I did dab it and it's

3464
02:24:24,689 --> 02:24:30,449
delicious terpene alene one of my

3465
02:24:27,418 --> 02:24:36,628
favorites it's real exotic sativa sort

3466
02:24:30,449 --> 02:24:38,189
of flavor we got eleven thirty we've

3467
02:24:36,629 --> 02:24:40,169
been going for two and a half hours I

3468
02:24:38,189 --> 02:24:42,049
could easily go for another half hour or

3469
02:24:40,168 --> 02:24:45,539
we could definitely bring some other

3470
02:24:42,049 --> 02:24:47,489
other rows and conversations into play

3471
02:24:45,539 --> 02:24:49,470
here that we haven't covered a few

3472
02:24:47,488 --> 02:24:52,680
people asked how everyone goes about

3473
02:24:49,469 --> 02:24:55,318
like preserving the quality of their

3474
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:58,199
large quantities of Ross and you know

3475
02:24:55,318 --> 02:25:00,658
400 plus grams at a time how do you

3476
02:24:58,199 --> 02:25:03,629
preserve it to stay the way it is I just

3477
02:25:00,658 --> 02:25:07,408
hold like yeah : exactly

3478
02:25:03,629 --> 02:25:08,989
mason jars for the wind I say uh you

3479
02:25:07,408 --> 02:25:11,398
know for short-term storage

3480
02:25:08,988 --> 02:25:14,068
refrigeration you know back ceiling

3481
02:25:11,398 --> 02:25:16,168
stuff like that long-term storage

3482
02:25:14,068 --> 02:25:17,639
freezing as long as you're not if you're

3483
02:25:16,168 --> 02:25:19,798
gonna be freezing something it needs to

3484
02:25:17,639 --> 02:25:21,538
be airtight sealed up and at that point

3485
02:25:19,799 --> 02:25:23,100
when you transfer it like let's say

3486
02:25:21,539 --> 02:25:25,709
you're gonna consume it you want to use

3487
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:27,930
it it's in the freezer well you take it

3488
02:25:25,709 --> 02:25:30,180
out you have to let it fall out

3489
02:25:27,930 --> 02:25:31,918
you know let it get warm enough to where

3490
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:33,619
you can wipe the condensation off before

3491
02:25:31,918 --> 02:25:35,639
you open otherwise you're just gonna add

3492
02:25:33,619 --> 02:25:36,959
condensation into your hash just as if

3493
02:25:35,639 --> 02:25:38,639
you would take it out of the fridge you

3494
02:25:36,959 --> 02:25:40,350
know you open it up right away you get a

3495
02:25:38,639 --> 02:25:41,818
little sizzle on the nail because you

3496
02:25:40,350 --> 02:25:48,779
smoked it too soon you didn't let it

3497
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:51,059
warm up hmm yeah I find that preserving

3498
02:25:48,779 --> 02:25:52,859
small smaller portions is easier than

3499
02:25:51,059 --> 02:25:55,458
preserving large portions I don't like

3500
02:25:52,859 --> 02:25:57,959
to take like any big discs or chunks and

3501
02:25:55,459 --> 02:25:59,930
try and store it like that once it's at

3502
02:25:57,959 --> 02:26:02,399
that point I think getting it portioned

3503
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:05,970
you know in its parchment in its baggie

3504
02:26:02,398 --> 02:26:08,458
this package in its back seal and into

3505
02:26:05,969 --> 02:26:10,798
the refrigerator is the best way to go

3506
02:26:08,459 --> 02:26:12,479
because when you store a large piece of

3507
02:26:10,799 --> 02:26:17,129
rosin you know you have this whole big

3508
02:26:12,478 --> 02:26:18,658
thing that is gonna change and you know

3509
02:26:17,129 --> 02:26:19,200
you have to kind of see what it looks

3510
02:26:18,658 --> 02:26:21,539
like

3511
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:23,550
after it's come out of the fridge after

3512
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:25,020
you've taken it out of its baggie and

3513
02:26:23,549 --> 02:26:26,519
after it's sat on the counter for half

3514
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:27,689
an hour you might take something it

3515
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:30,930
could be something you know is really

3516
02:26:27,689 --> 02:26:33,149
really good but it needs 30 minutes 60

3517
02:26:30,930 --> 02:26:34,250
minutes to breathe and warm up and then

3518
02:26:33,149 --> 02:26:37,739
it just starts Rican

3519
02:26:34,250 --> 02:26:39,478
yeah I'd say I'd say I mean for me I

3520
02:26:37,739 --> 02:26:40,978
would say when you break it down into

3521
02:26:39,478 --> 02:26:43,469
half grams and you get all ready you're

3522
02:26:40,978 --> 02:26:45,329
actually putting it into its shortest

3523
02:26:43,469 --> 02:26:47,099
shelf life I mean that's for storage you

3524
02:26:45,329 --> 02:26:49,200
can store it cool temps and still slow

3525
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:52,319
it down I would say if you have a mass

3526
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:54,300
amount you want to store it to to ball

3527
02:26:52,319 --> 02:26:59,159
it up into a you know don't have it as a

3528
02:26:54,299 --> 02:27:02,219
slab haul it up you know remove this

3529
02:26:59,159 --> 02:27:05,069
much much oxygen as possible coldest

3530
02:27:02,219 --> 02:27:09,239
temps possible I mean you know reducing

3531
02:27:05,069 --> 02:27:11,340
surface area and and you know removing

3532
02:27:09,239 --> 02:27:12,930
oxygen and allowing the coldest

3533
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:15,120
environment I think is gonna be the best

3534
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:17,250
for storage when it comes to you know

3535
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:18,960
half cramming it up it whether it's in

3536
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:20,520
the fridge or it's in the freezer I feel

3537
02:27:18,959 --> 02:27:23,039
like it'd still be grading faster cuz

3538
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:25,590
now you you've maximized surface area

3539
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:27,120
you know you coin it out or you throw a

3540
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:32,450
glob in there but they're all half grand

3541
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:35,700
with yes plenty of oxygen surrounding it

3542
02:27:32,450 --> 02:27:37,860
is our biggest enemy so while we're

3543
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:39,360
talking about motors I wanted to do

3544
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:41,370
something that's kind of off topic no

3545
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:42,569
but with freeze dryers since you're

3546
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:44,040
saying you know you put a jar in the

3547
02:27:42,569 --> 02:27:45,840
freezer you put it in the fridge we take

3548
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:47,700
it out you need to let it get you know

3549
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:50,010
to room temp and wipe it off before you

3550
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:52,439
open it well how about freeze dryers

3551
02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:54,450
most people take this hash out of the

3552
02:27:52,439 --> 02:27:56,040
freeze dryer and it's frozen that

3553
02:27:54,450 --> 02:27:57,630
literally is coming from outer space and

3554
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:59,820
they're bringing it into a room that's

3555
02:27:57,629 --> 02:28:01,978
cold as [ __ ] and then they're [ __ ]

3556
02:27:59,819 --> 02:28:03,478
breaking it down and jarring it up or

3557
02:28:01,978 --> 02:28:05,519
putting it in their mason jars and

3558
02:28:03,478 --> 02:28:07,079
storing it back in the fridge don't you

3559
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:08,880
think there's a shitload of moisture

3560
02:28:07,079 --> 02:28:11,399
though in that hash if it doesn't

3561
02:28:08,879 --> 02:28:13,289
actually sit out back on earth you know

3562
02:28:11,399 --> 02:28:14,850
back on this planet in our normal

3563
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:16,530
environment but you with when you

3564
02:28:14,850 --> 02:28:19,500
imagine that that has would still have

3565
02:28:16,530 --> 02:28:21,239
moisture and still be wet yeah in theory

3566
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:23,189
I would say so I mean I would I would

3567
02:28:21,239 --> 02:28:24,420
imagine that pulling it from such a cold

3568
02:28:23,189 --> 02:28:25,920
environment I mean if you're pulling it

3569
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:28,620
from like a cold freeze dryer in your

3570
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:31,228
cold ass hash room it's really gonna

3571
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:33,060
help um I mean as long as you're

3572
02:28:31,228 --> 02:28:34,769
packaging it and a really cold

3573
02:28:33,059 --> 02:28:37,078
you're gonna have less condensation

3574
02:28:34,770 --> 02:28:39,270
occur I mean if it's coming from like

3575
02:28:37,078 --> 02:28:41,818
[ __ ] negative temps to a called you

3576
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:42,779
know 40 degree hash room yeah you're

3577
02:28:41,818 --> 02:28:44,728
still probably gonna have condensation

3578
02:28:42,779 --> 02:28:47,729
and at that point I would say letting it

3579
02:28:44,728 --> 02:28:49,469
sit out and air dry a little bit but I

3580
02:28:47,728 --> 02:28:51,868
feel he would help you take it into a

3581
02:28:49,469 --> 02:28:54,179
cold room I don't keep like the moisture

3582
02:28:51,869 --> 02:28:56,399
is gone I feel like it's just frozen

3583
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:58,529
but the ash it's just there and then you

3584
02:28:56,398 --> 02:28:59,879
put it into jars and you're sealing in

3585
02:28:58,529 --> 02:29:01,710
moisture and that's why a lot of this

3586
02:28:59,879 --> 02:29:03,568
stuff likes to putter like a lot of the

3587
02:29:01,709 --> 02:29:06,389
freeze drives mask you see that's on the

3588
02:29:03,568 --> 02:29:08,519
market is butter it's all buttered up

3589
02:29:06,389 --> 02:29:11,158
and appeared in the chars you know until

3590
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:12,779
it was a question yeah exactly so I feel

3591
02:29:11,158 --> 02:29:14,158
like a lot of people are packaging their

3592
02:29:12,779 --> 02:29:15,600
stuff and cold rooms and keeping

3593
02:29:14,158 --> 02:29:17,969
everything cold but they don't realize

3594
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:20,158
the hash has to eventually come to

3595
02:29:17,969 --> 02:29:22,618
Planet Earth it's gonna be introduced

3596
02:29:20,158 --> 02:29:23,850
into humidity it's gonna be introduced

3597
02:29:22,619 --> 02:29:26,220
to it you know what it means right back

3598
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:28,170
into this environment so that being said

3599
02:29:26,219 --> 02:29:30,028
no matter what I think that moisture has

3600
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:31,828
it never left so if you leave it in the

3601
02:29:30,029 --> 02:29:34,380
jar and you sell to somebody like

3602
02:29:31,828 --> 02:29:35,728
Frenchie cannoli I seem like a little

3603
02:29:34,379 --> 02:29:37,709
while ago there was some hash that was

3604
02:29:35,728 --> 02:29:38,969
like moldy in the jar well that's the

3605
02:29:37,709 --> 02:29:41,068
kind of [ __ ] that happens when you

3606
02:29:38,969 --> 02:29:43,408
[ __ ] leave moisture or you have any

3607
02:29:41,068 --> 02:29:44,698
kind of colony forming units you know

3608
02:29:43,408 --> 02:29:49,529
what I mean they're gonna grow in here

3609
02:29:44,699 --> 02:29:52,800
black mildew hash exactly and that ain't

3610
02:29:49,529 --> 02:29:58,290
that Emerald triangle funk that's that

3611
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:59,938
that's the no bueno funk yeah just a lot

3612
02:29:58,290 --> 02:30:01,350
just get a lot of freeze-dried stuff and

3613
02:29:59,939 --> 02:30:04,109
I've even freeze-dried a lot of my stuff

3614
02:30:01,350 --> 02:30:05,880
and I still feel like micro planing and

3615
02:30:04,109 --> 02:30:07,559
not putting into them extreme cold

3616
02:30:05,879 --> 02:30:10,078
temperatures and pulling a back on it

3617
02:30:07,559 --> 02:30:11,689
still drives hash better than a freeze

3618
02:30:10,078 --> 02:30:14,939
dryer like you're going for true

3619
02:30:11,689 --> 02:30:16,949
connoisseur heads - sigh - they're not

3620
02:30:14,939 --> 02:30:18,600
gonna get it in my opinion using a

3621
02:30:16,949 --> 02:30:21,000
freeze dry this [ __ ] just clumps up

3622
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:23,149
weird it's just it's just weird man it

3623
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:27,420
makes it you're Spacey it's what's weird

3624
02:30:23,148 --> 02:30:30,269
it's definitely different I prefer to

3625
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:33,449
photograph properly cured resin it shows

3626
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:35,430
up beautiful and globular and I've

3627
02:30:33,449 --> 02:30:37,649
always found that the freeze-dried stuff

3628
02:30:35,430 --> 02:30:39,658
seems to have a large amount of capitate

3629
02:30:37,648 --> 02:30:41,760
stalks even though they seem to be

3630
02:30:39,658 --> 02:30:43,500
artifacts of their our true selves they

3631
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:44,670
just seem to be almost like shadows of

3632
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:46,540
their former self

3633
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:48,940
they're still present in the

3634
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:52,840
they're very like visible and I don't

3635
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:55,930
like that either I I prefer I also am

3636
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:58,630
NOT a fan of smoking only white hash I

3637
02:30:55,930 --> 02:31:01,659
definitely liked some some some amber

3638
02:30:58,629 --> 02:31:04,000
and color to my hash I love some white

3639
02:31:01,659 --> 02:31:06,100
hash but I also love some dark ash and

3640
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:09,399
some golden and you know all the

3641
02:31:06,100 --> 02:31:11,470
different hues we're seeing that a lot

3642
02:31:09,399 --> 02:31:13,479
with the market you know people seem to

3643
02:31:11,469 --> 02:31:15,250
want to see things that are super light

3644
02:31:13,479 --> 02:31:18,010
super super clear and things like that

3645
02:31:15,250 --> 02:31:19,510
but when you look at the the growers

3646
02:31:18,010 --> 02:31:21,100
point of view it's I mean it's it's

3647
02:31:19,510 --> 02:31:23,409
they're early heads I mean that's what

3648
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:25,149
we're basically you know people are are

3649
02:31:23,409 --> 02:31:27,700
wanting to see their rows and they

3650
02:31:25,149 --> 02:31:29,170
wanted to see this clear light rosin but

3651
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:31,120
sometimes you know you get those really

3652
02:31:29,170 --> 02:31:34,000
amber heads and you can do this really

3653
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:35,590
nice dark rosin that still has so much

3654
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,870
Terps in it and things like that and a

3655
02:31:35,590 --> 02:31:39,549
lot of people are not you know they're

3656
02:31:37,870 --> 02:31:40,690
they're they're hating on the color of

3657
02:31:39,549 --> 02:31:42,750
the rose and when they're not really

3658
02:31:40,690 --> 02:31:47,829
looking at the quality of the of the

3659
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:50,110
resin it's interesting when you allow I

3660
02:31:47,829 --> 02:31:51,819
guess I would say the majority of the

3661
02:31:50,110 --> 02:31:54,280
marketplace because let's be honest the

3662
02:31:51,819 --> 02:31:57,100
majority of the marketplace on planet

3663
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:59,380
earth is not like connoisseur heads just

3664
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:02,680
like in anything that is consumed on the

3665
02:31:59,379 --> 02:32:05,199
planet from food to the clothing that we

3666
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:07,989
wear to the quality of the cars that we

3667
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:11,650
drive not everyone is driving around in

3668
02:32:07,989 --> 02:32:13,989
like a Rolls Royce you know like but

3669
02:32:11,649 --> 02:32:15,430
with cannabis there's a large group of

3670
02:32:13,989 --> 02:32:18,521
people that feel like they're trying to

3671
02:32:15,430 --> 02:32:21,670
produce the highest quality and so I

3672
02:32:18,521 --> 02:32:23,920
just think as much as it pains me to say

3673
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:26,771
it I think when this legalization thing

3674
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:28,271
finally occurs it'll be similar to all

3675
02:32:26,771 --> 02:32:30,970
the other things that are in production

3676
02:32:28,271 --> 02:32:33,700
I hope the quality sticks through but

3677
02:32:30,969 --> 02:32:35,799
you know with beer and all the other

3678
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:38,500
things that people consume on a day to

3679
02:32:35,799 --> 02:32:41,079
day basis its oh it always seems to be

3680
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:43,000
that the masses want the mediocre and

3681
02:32:41,079 --> 02:32:45,789
that only a very small percentage of

3682
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:48,579
people really want the best the best the

3683
02:32:45,790 --> 02:32:50,320
best and even the people who you'll hear

3684
02:32:48,579 --> 02:32:52,229
be like oh I need the best it's like

3685
02:32:50,319 --> 02:32:54,699
well you're not wearing like the crazy

3686
02:32:52,229 --> 02:32:56,799
$4,000 Gucci shirt like you're just

3687
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:58,659
wearing a t-shirt from Walmart but you

3688
02:32:56,799 --> 02:33:00,079
need the best resin like can you imagine

3689
02:32:58,659 --> 02:33:01,909
trying to need the best of

3690
02:33:00,079 --> 02:33:04,100
everything how [ __ ] much of an insane

3691
02:33:01,909 --> 02:33:06,379
person you would be and not living in

3692
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:08,899
the reality of what most people exist in

3693
02:33:06,379 --> 02:33:10,789
so I get that we love the highest

3694
02:33:08,899 --> 02:33:13,850
quality that we can have at least when

3695
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:15,680
it comes to resin I'm not gonna stop

3696
02:33:13,850 --> 02:33:17,450
being that way that's for sure but I'm

3697
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:21,950
not sure if it'll pass through to the

3698
02:33:17,450 --> 02:33:28,159
masses when legalization hits I wanted

3699
02:33:21,950 --> 02:33:30,470
to yeah let's I think I see a lot of Bud

3700
02:33:28,159 --> 02:33:34,159
Light out there instead of actual real

3701
02:33:30,469 --> 02:33:35,959
product you know I mean that's you know

3702
02:33:34,159 --> 02:33:37,521
that's the way I see it I mean looking

3703
02:33:35,959 --> 02:33:38,779
at Gordon Ramsay sure the guys making

3704
02:33:37,521 --> 02:33:44,780
money but he's not making that

3705
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:47,120
McDonald's money guys that's probably

3706
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:52,521
worth like you know what I mean like

3707
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:54,650
it's and imagine what McDonald's pulls

3708
02:33:52,521 --> 02:33:56,840
in just in a month of rent with like

3709
02:33:54,649 --> 02:33:58,760
35,000 locations or whatever like

3710
02:33:56,840 --> 02:34:00,920
imagine all of those locations paying

3711
02:33:58,760 --> 02:34:03,021
McDonald's rent because McDonald's

3712
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:05,810
generally owns the land that those

3713
02:34:03,021 --> 02:34:06,739
buildings go up on that's some serious

3714
02:34:05,810 --> 02:34:09,889
coin right there

3715
02:34:06,739 --> 02:34:12,139
I think I think in Canada here anyways

3716
02:34:09,889 --> 02:34:13,789
there's gonna be a sounds like there's

3717
02:34:12,139 --> 02:34:15,859
gonna be a microtome call tomorrow

3718
02:34:13,790 --> 02:34:18,170
microprocessing license available so I

3719
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:21,560
think we're gonna see dispensaries that

3720
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:23,950
have your Bud Light and then you can see

3721
02:34:21,560 --> 02:34:31,340
the dispensaries that have the good

3722
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:33,980
quality micro process and or two that

3723
02:34:31,340 --> 02:34:35,659
actually item as well it's just once

3724
02:34:33,979 --> 02:34:38,449
again now that's like gonna be five

3725
02:34:35,659 --> 02:34:41,450
maybe ten percent of the marketplace

3726
02:34:38,450 --> 02:34:43,220
maybe yeah and so that would it'll be a

3727
02:34:41,450 --> 02:34:45,200
niche that the people that want to be

3728
02:34:43,219 --> 02:34:47,810
involved in will really be fighting for

3729
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:49,940
because you know the the industry in my

3730
02:34:47,810 --> 02:34:51,289
opinion I I see everyone investing

3731
02:34:49,940 --> 02:34:53,960
millions upon millions upon millions

3732
02:34:51,290 --> 02:34:57,170
upon millions of dollars hundreds of

3733
02:34:53,959 --> 02:34:59,119
millions of dollars and to sell herb at

3734
02:34:57,170 --> 02:35:00,590
like eight and ten dollars a gram which

3735
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:02,450
are basically like exactly like

3736
02:35:00,590 --> 02:35:04,549
prohibition prices like forty five

3737
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:06,021
hundred bucks for a pound a week mail

3738
02:35:04,549 --> 02:35:08,689
order through the mail through one of

3739
02:35:06,021 --> 02:35:10,790
the legal alkies I'm kind of hoping on

3740
02:35:08,690 --> 02:35:12,630
seeing filled brown and green house

3741
02:35:10,790 --> 02:35:14,899
grown cannabis dry

3742
02:35:12,629 --> 02:35:18,509
the price of cannabis down to the point

3743
02:35:14,898 --> 02:35:20,340
where the small niche markets I don't

3744
02:35:18,510 --> 02:35:22,860
think there'll be as many people vying

3745
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:26,040
for a position once the Mart once the

3746
02:35:22,860 --> 02:35:27,989
perceived prohibition based profit drops

3747
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:30,870
out of the bottom and hopefully of this

3748
02:35:27,989 --> 02:35:32,789
industry in the very near future because

3749
02:35:30,870 --> 02:35:34,500
you know not that I don't like people

3750
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:36,510
making money I think making money is a

3751
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:38,909
great thing I just don't think it should

3752
02:35:36,510 --> 02:35:41,579
be equal to the prohibition based profit

3753
02:35:38,909 --> 02:35:44,459
margin that came before this new sort of

3754
02:35:41,579 --> 02:35:47,549
legal medical recreational market that

3755
02:35:44,459 --> 02:35:49,289
is upon us now I like that I like for

3756
02:35:47,549 --> 02:35:51,329
the prices to be cheaper three thousand

3757
02:35:49,290 --> 02:35:52,950
two thousand bucks for a pound is insane

3758
02:35:51,329 --> 02:35:55,350
like even really five hundred bucks for

3759
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:57,630
a pound is pretty costly it makes it not

3760
02:35:55,350 --> 02:35:59,760
realistic for just anyone to be able to

3761
02:35:57,629 --> 02:36:03,719
access large quantities of resin for

3762
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:05,340
themselves and you know it should be

3763
02:36:03,719 --> 02:36:07,409
available to people people that are sick

3764
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:10,439
and dying and have like stage three and

3765
02:36:07,409 --> 02:36:12,780
four cancers should have access at a

3766
02:36:10,439 --> 02:36:15,239
relatively inexpensive price certainly

3767
02:36:12,780 --> 02:36:17,670
not a hundred dollars a gram you know

3768
02:36:15,239 --> 02:36:21,020
three grand a pop for the thirty for the

3769
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:25,648
thirty grams for thirty days that's uh

3770
02:36:21,020 --> 02:36:28,950
that's it's borderline criminal just

3771
02:36:25,648 --> 02:36:31,739
from my perspective anyway so I was

3772
02:36:28,950 --> 02:36:34,079
wondering the fun if anybody out there

3773
02:36:31,739 --> 02:36:36,030
like I see the future of rosin without

3774
02:36:34,079 --> 02:36:39,148
parchment collecting collecting like we

3775
02:36:36,030 --> 02:36:43,200
do right now it's anybody else have any

3776
02:36:39,148 --> 02:36:47,039
ideas on that on parchment free rosin

3777
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:49,680
pressing absolutely yeah like ice I mean

3778
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:50,970
the way we've designed our press I left

3779
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:53,040
a big spaceman at the bottom I want to

3780
02:36:50,969 --> 02:36:55,438
put a vacuum on you there and collect it

3781
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:58,530
as a press isn't like sort of a

3782
02:36:55,439 --> 02:37:01,950
continuous batch format right yeah I

3783
02:36:58,530 --> 02:37:03,510
actually ran into a small rosin press

3784
02:37:01,950 --> 02:37:05,670
manufacturer when I was at some show

3785
02:37:03,510 --> 02:37:11,280
that had something very similar where

3786
02:37:05,670 --> 02:37:12,898
where they used a it was a form already

3787
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:16,380
within the press itself so you would

3788
02:37:12,898 --> 02:37:18,599
actually fill it press it through had a

3789
02:37:16,379 --> 02:37:20,909
great underneath that would actually

3790
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:22,829
allow the resin you know all the resin

3791
02:37:20,909 --> 02:37:25,680
to actually flow through to the bottom

3792
02:37:22,829 --> 02:37:26,579
to a small collection vessel they didn't

3793
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,819
really have it

3794
02:37:26,579 --> 02:37:30,959
quite down to the details and since that

3795
02:37:28,819 --> 02:37:33,449
you would get a lot of fountain flow

3796
02:37:30,959 --> 02:37:36,029
meaning that the resident would flow up

3797
02:37:33,450 --> 02:37:41,040
on the walls of this little sort of like

3798
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:42,659
a mold and but anyways yeah I mean it's

3799
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:44,130
definitely um I think it's definitely

3800
02:37:42,659 --> 02:37:46,500
the way to go because fewer resources

3801
02:37:44,129 --> 02:37:49,949
less material you end up using less

3802
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:56,521
material wasting no filters and you know

3803
02:37:49,950 --> 02:37:58,710
all that stuff yeah you'd have yes sir

3804
02:37:56,521 --> 02:38:00,210
be sure that you weren't contaminating

3805
02:37:58,709 --> 02:38:02,429
you know once again when we're talking

3806
02:38:00,209 --> 02:38:04,679
about I guess this is the versus the

3807
02:38:02,430 --> 02:38:06,139
commercial versus the the small batch

3808
02:38:04,680 --> 02:38:09,329
where you wouldn't want to contaminate

3809
02:38:06,139 --> 02:38:12,840
the oil with you know the batiment the

3810
02:38:09,329 --> 02:38:15,360
the end results of oil squishing out and

3811
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:16,920
contaminating the plate where you come

3812
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:19,560
and you squish your next one and at the

3813
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:21,690
start you clear off this oil that was

3814
02:38:19,560 --> 02:38:26,159
kind of left over from the the tail end

3815
02:38:21,690 --> 02:38:29,430
of your last press right it's definitely

3816
02:38:26,159 --> 02:38:31,049
more of a production you know I guess it

3817
02:38:29,430 --> 02:38:33,739
would be more more for production than

3818
02:38:31,049 --> 02:38:37,619
actually high quality you know product

3819
02:38:33,739 --> 02:38:40,739
those are always the to the the hardest

3820
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:44,250
to to marry to get you know in symbiote

3821
02:38:40,739 --> 02:38:46,979
Sicily you can up your your you know

3822
02:38:44,250 --> 02:38:50,850
commercialize your process but without

3823
02:38:46,979 --> 02:38:55,619
really lowering your quality - you know

3824
02:38:50,850 --> 02:39:00,450
noticeable levels there's maybe I can

3825
02:38:55,620 --> 02:39:02,400
after that actually I actually realized

3826
02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:03,900
that you can actually grow production

3827
02:39:02,399 --> 02:39:08,219
level you can just only grow in one

3828
02:39:03,899 --> 02:39:12,180
direction as long as say your thickness

3829
02:39:08,219 --> 02:39:14,369
are what you're a pata per ounce those

3830
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:17,040
in only one direction should be able to

3831
02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:19,710
increase flow while maintaining same

3832
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:22,080
quality that we're getting but as soon

3833
02:39:19,709 --> 02:39:23,459
as you start going this way and that way

3834
02:39:22,079 --> 02:39:26,069
with what you're putting in the plate

3835
02:39:23,459 --> 02:39:33,270
that's when your quality starts to go

3836
02:39:26,069 --> 02:39:35,020
down I would agree with that very

3837
02:39:33,271 --> 02:39:37,060
interesting

3838
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:38,828
and that's just because you get it's

3839
02:39:37,059 --> 02:39:40,568
getting too hot or you're getting like

3840
02:39:38,828 --> 02:39:44,250
what what's the main reason behind that

3841
02:39:40,568 --> 02:39:48,639
I think I think there's a limit to how

3842
02:39:44,250 --> 02:39:50,529
much plant material the rosin tries to

3843
02:39:48,639 --> 02:39:53,500
travel through to find its way outside

3844
02:39:50,529 --> 02:39:58,238
of the said filter being used yeah makes

3845
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:59,920
sense the flow hey and the type of resin

3846
02:39:58,238 --> 02:40:01,988
for that matter as well like totally

3847
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:03,520
phil was mentioning earlier about you

3848
02:40:01,988 --> 02:40:05,439
know the stuff that wants to butter up

3849
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:07,899
and not create that flow and just hold

3850
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:09,880
tough create a little plug in between

3851
02:40:07,898 --> 02:40:13,538
itself and the screen versus the stuff

3852
02:40:09,879 --> 02:40:14,769
that just saps out upon touching it you

3853
02:40:13,539 --> 02:40:16,180
don't even really need much of a

3854
02:40:14,770 --> 02:40:18,880
pre-press and you just get this

3855
02:40:16,180 --> 02:40:20,260
beautiful flow of rosin there's lots for

3856
02:40:18,879 --> 02:40:22,000
us to learn about I think Lindsey's

3857
02:40:20,260 --> 02:40:24,969
correct in the sense that a lot of this

3858
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:27,578
stuff needs to be tested like once LPS

3859
02:40:24,969 --> 02:40:29,590
and other you know federally legal

3860
02:40:27,578 --> 02:40:32,199
entities are doing this on a level where

3861
02:40:29,590 --> 02:40:34,478
you're you're adding all the data and

3862
02:40:32,199 --> 02:40:36,520
with that data extrapolating and

3863
02:40:34,478 --> 02:40:38,318
creating sort of a digital landscape to

3864
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:42,779
lead you towards you know better

3865
02:40:38,318 --> 02:40:45,488
innovation and better manufacturing I

3866
02:40:42,779 --> 02:40:46,720
really really encourage everybody out

3867
02:40:45,488 --> 02:40:49,180
there is playing with rosin if you got

3868
02:40:46,719 --> 02:40:50,828
enough material and just try some

3869
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:55,328
different crazy experiments that we did

3870
02:40:50,828 --> 02:40:57,250
I did one vacuum back I sealed it in the

3871
02:40:55,328 --> 02:41:00,068
vacuum bag some flour and it came out

3872
02:40:57,250 --> 02:41:02,318
white and it was it was incredible my

3873
02:41:00,068 --> 02:41:03,908
yield was pretty poor but I mean if we

3874
02:41:02,318 --> 02:41:06,148
just keep playing with it and keep

3875
02:41:03,908 --> 02:41:08,260
moving the pushing this forward I think

3876
02:41:06,148 --> 02:41:10,629
and I don't think anything can touch

3877
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:14,318
rosin I think from the THCA stuff we see

3878
02:41:10,629 --> 02:41:16,868
now you know it's such a diverse form of

3879
02:41:14,318 --> 02:41:18,549
extraction that I think everyone in this

3880
02:41:16,869 --> 02:41:21,640
room we can all just keep pushing it

3881
02:41:18,549 --> 02:41:23,618
like like we've been doing mm-hmm yeah I

3882
02:41:21,639 --> 02:41:27,728
think the more we explore the boundaries

3883
02:41:23,619 --> 02:41:29,529
you know the better it gets you know

3884
02:41:27,728 --> 02:41:31,568
it's exactly what we have been doing and

3885
02:41:29,529 --> 02:41:33,399
it's the reason why we are here that's

3886
02:41:31,568 --> 02:41:34,959
such a quick rate I mean you look at all

3887
02:41:33,398 --> 02:41:37,510
these other methods and how long it took

3888
02:41:34,959 --> 02:41:39,188
to get so what they are you know and

3889
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:43,238
we've we've evolved in such a quick time

3890
02:41:39,189 --> 02:41:46,059
and it's because we we we experiment we

3891
02:41:43,238 --> 02:41:48,430
try new things we make mistakes we we

3892
02:41:46,059 --> 02:41:48,859
observe the fact that the mistake we

3893
02:41:48,430 --> 02:41:51,630
made

3894
02:41:48,859 --> 02:41:53,609
you know put this put us to another

3895
02:41:51,629 --> 02:41:56,099
level you know so I think exploring

3896
02:41:53,609 --> 02:41:58,229
those boundaries and you know not being

3897
02:41:56,100 --> 02:42:00,059
so close-minded and thinking that you

3898
02:41:58,228 --> 02:42:03,000
know we've hit our max you know that's I

3899
02:42:00,059 --> 02:42:04,559
mean we thought we were you were done

3900
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:06,299
making rosin you know like we couldn't

3901
02:42:04,559 --> 02:42:08,699
believe it and then now you know we're

3902
02:42:06,299 --> 02:42:10,409
actually mechanically separating thta

3903
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:11,970
and the sauce fraction you know so

3904
02:42:10,409 --> 02:42:13,379
what's next

3905
02:42:11,969 --> 02:42:19,289
why don't we talk about that for a

3906
02:42:13,379 --> 02:42:21,029
little bit so I'll grown as well you

3907
02:42:19,290 --> 02:42:23,070
know I didn't imagine people are

3908
02:42:21,030 --> 02:42:26,370
watching that have no idea on how to

3909
02:42:23,069 --> 02:42:28,889
produce THCA using a rosin press and

3910
02:42:26,370 --> 02:42:33,060
also how to produce diamonds with

3911
02:42:28,889 --> 02:42:35,879
solvent less sauce I mean I think it's

3912
02:42:33,059 --> 02:42:39,898
just a matter of just playing with

3913
02:42:35,879 --> 02:42:42,059
temperature and time you know so you

3914
02:42:39,898 --> 02:42:45,148
just got to understand that you know

3915
02:42:42,059 --> 02:42:47,459
once once a product has crystallized and

3916
02:42:45,148 --> 02:42:50,659
nucleated or nucleating crystallized now

3917
02:42:47,459 --> 02:42:53,129
you have different melting points so

3918
02:42:50,659 --> 02:42:55,289
understanding the melting points of all

3919
02:42:53,129 --> 02:42:58,949
the cannabinoids you know gives you an

3920
02:42:55,290 --> 02:43:02,609
idea I think it's we have as far as I've

3921
02:42:58,950 --> 02:43:05,040
gone you know i i've just made you know

3922
02:43:02,609 --> 02:43:07,500
decent sauce and stuff like that I don't

3923
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:09,180
think it's I don't think it's at its

3924
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:11,329
greatest yet I think there's a lot of

3925
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:13,319
dialing in to do but I think it's just

3926
02:43:11,329 --> 02:43:15,719
you know pressing things out in

3927
02:43:13,319 --> 02:43:17,939
fractions playing with material you you

3928
02:43:15,719 --> 02:43:19,648
definitely have to experiment you you

3929
02:43:17,939 --> 02:43:22,350
can listen to what everyone says on how

3930
02:43:19,648 --> 02:43:24,299
to do it and everything but unless

3931
02:43:22,350 --> 02:43:26,189
you're you're playing with it and doing

3932
02:43:24,299 --> 02:43:27,869
it yourself and making the mistakes on

3933
02:43:26,189 --> 02:43:32,069
your own that's when you're gonna learn

3934
02:43:27,870 --> 02:43:34,260
because I mean you know I've read things

3935
02:43:32,069 --> 02:43:36,869
I've read forums I've read people doing

3936
02:43:34,260 --> 02:43:38,609
stuff and you know I try things but it

3937
02:43:36,870 --> 02:43:40,890
just gets you to a point it leads you to

3938
02:43:38,609 --> 02:43:43,700
the water but you know it's a matter of

3939
02:43:40,889 --> 02:43:47,129
you making that mistake on your own or

3940
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:50,670
or trying something sometimes you hit it

3941
02:43:47,129 --> 02:43:53,429
first try sometimes you don't but you

3942
02:43:50,670 --> 02:43:55,799
know as for making THC a you know have

3943
02:43:53,430 --> 02:43:58,530
fun with it take some you know takes

3944
02:43:55,799 --> 02:44:00,569
take some degraded rosin or some

3945
02:43:58,530 --> 02:44:02,729
buttered up rosin you know press it out

3946
02:44:00,569 --> 02:44:05,760
low temps gradually increased

3947
02:44:02,728 --> 02:44:07,648
high temps and you know once you start

3948
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:09,270
doing that you'll really understand it

3949
02:44:07,648 --> 02:44:10,738
you kind of get an understanding of what

3950
02:44:09,270 --> 02:44:13,890
it is and that's what's gonna teach you

3951
02:44:10,738 --> 02:44:15,719
you know so you got to figure it out on

3952
02:44:13,889 --> 02:44:17,340
your own I think just listening to the

3953
02:44:15,719 --> 02:44:19,438
way everybody else does it is good

3954
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:21,210
because it gives you an idea but trying

3955
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:23,068
things on your own is what's gonna get

3956
02:44:21,209 --> 02:44:24,269
you to the way you do things and you

3957
02:44:23,068 --> 02:44:25,948
just might find a better way than

3958
02:44:24,270 --> 02:44:29,488
everybody else that everybody else wants

3959
02:44:25,949 --> 02:44:31,380
to listen to so you know you know listen

3960
02:44:29,488 --> 02:44:33,510
there's a lot of information on making

3961
02:44:31,379 --> 02:44:35,998
it out there a lot it's it's pretty

3962
02:44:33,510 --> 02:44:38,340
basic but it's really it is a basic

3963
02:44:35,998 --> 02:44:40,648
process there's nothing nothing crazy

3964
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:42,809
about it it's not very technical it

3965
02:44:40,648 --> 02:44:45,510
sounds like it and it seems like it but

3966
02:44:42,809 --> 02:44:47,068
you know patience is key when it comes

3967
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:49,078
to this and that's what most people

3968
02:44:47,068 --> 02:44:51,600
don't have they want instant results and

3969
02:44:49,078 --> 02:44:55,850
that that you're not gonna get you know

3970
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:58,770
it's all about patience and that's it

3971
02:44:55,850 --> 02:45:01,680
perfect yeah excellent so yeah that the

3972
02:44:58,770 --> 02:45:03,748
basic drop really there aside from you

3973
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:05,430
know figured out on your own is just the

3974
02:45:03,748 --> 02:45:08,699
starting point is just pressing a little

3975
02:45:05,430 --> 02:45:10,770
bit of buttered out rosin or you know

3976
02:45:08,699 --> 02:45:13,078
some rosin that you have and low temp

3977
02:45:10,770 --> 02:45:14,819
pressing it's raising the temp slowly

3978
02:45:13,078 --> 02:45:16,590
but surely begin up to that point where

3979
02:45:14,818 --> 02:45:20,340
you can see these fractions occur and

3980
02:45:16,590 --> 02:45:22,078
you can extract is that on your Mike the

3981
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:25,469
guy coffee program

3982
02:45:22,078 --> 02:45:28,648
oh yeah my bad that is no that's okay

3983
02:45:25,469 --> 02:45:30,389
because I was my I'm muted every single

3984
02:45:28,648 --> 02:45:32,879
person and I'm like that motherfucker's

3985
02:45:30,389 --> 02:45:35,578
still coughing who the [ __ ] is that

3986
02:45:32,879 --> 02:45:37,139
and then I realized oh it's the only

3987
02:45:35,578 --> 02:45:39,029
Mike I didn't you but you were talking

3988
02:45:37,139 --> 02:45:41,038
at the time so it's fine and don't worry

3989
02:45:39,029 --> 02:45:42,510
he it sounds like he got a great rip and

3990
02:45:41,039 --> 02:45:46,248
that's what has church is really all

3991
02:45:42,510 --> 02:45:52,498
about having a great ripped and yeah

3992
02:45:46,248 --> 02:45:54,539
right the Savile is thta's stuff like

3993
02:45:52,498 --> 02:45:58,199
these dude how do you guys go about

3994
02:45:54,539 --> 02:46:00,479
taking a DAB once you've caramelized it

3995
02:45:58,199 --> 02:46:02,640
essentially like once you get it into

3996
02:46:00,478 --> 02:46:04,679
those rocks like and you put it into the

3997
02:46:02,639 --> 02:46:06,988
jar and you dump the Terps bag on and

3998
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:09,658
stuff how would you like like how would

3999
02:46:06,988 --> 02:46:11,728
you take a DAB if the rocks are bigger

4000
02:46:09,658 --> 02:46:13,350
than you wanted app like is this I know

4001
02:46:11,728 --> 02:46:15,389
you seen my stuff dude I got a little

4002
02:46:13,350 --> 02:46:19,199
pebbles mine look like little

4003
02:46:15,389 --> 02:46:23,769
I'm not I just in general I see people

4004
02:46:19,199 --> 02:46:27,279
[ __ ] stones like yeah how the [ __ ]

4005
02:46:23,770 --> 02:46:29,319
they can dab don't like I want a DAB I'm

4006
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:31,569
gonna find my dabbers to get into these

4007
02:46:29,318 --> 02:46:33,809
rocks I mean like how do I get a DAB

4008
02:46:31,568 --> 02:46:37,238
once you once these rocks are so here do

4009
02:46:33,809 --> 02:46:38,708
ya I mean cuz technically we call them

4010
02:46:37,238 --> 02:46:41,708
diamonds it's cool it's fun I like the

4011
02:46:38,709 --> 02:46:43,629
name I mean it's THCA regardless but I

4012
02:46:41,709 --> 02:46:46,209
mean it's it's harder than like crushing

4013
02:46:43,629 --> 02:46:48,430
down a crystal that was grown you know

4014
02:46:46,209 --> 02:46:51,640
that's actually a crystal compared to us

4015
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:53,078
taking crisp like microscopic crystals

4016
02:46:51,639 --> 02:46:54,639
melting them down into an amorphous

4017
02:46:53,078 --> 02:46:56,228
solid and now we're creating these

4018
02:46:54,639 --> 02:46:57,969
boulders and we're saturating them with

4019
02:46:56,228 --> 02:46:59,378
the terpenes so when someone goes to

4020
02:46:57,969 --> 02:47:01,148
break them that are hard they shatter

4021
02:46:59,379 --> 02:47:03,669
like glass and they get real hard to

4022
02:47:01,148 --> 02:47:05,288
break up so that's why I think you know

4023
02:47:03,668 --> 02:47:08,048
it looks really cool andand it's great

4024
02:47:05,289 --> 02:47:10,689
for the gram but it's it's that's really

4025
02:47:08,049 --> 02:47:11,829
all it is when it comes to to serving it

4026
02:47:10,689 --> 02:47:13,898
out and everything obviously you're

4027
02:47:11,828 --> 02:47:15,850
gonna have to break that down but I mean

4028
02:47:13,898 --> 02:47:17,948
for storage purposes I think it's great

4029
02:47:15,850 --> 02:47:19,328
what if you do like you did it that one

4030
02:47:17,949 --> 02:47:21,158
video though you showed everybody that

4031
02:47:19,328 --> 02:47:23,619
you could smash it into a [ __ ]

4032
02:47:21,158 --> 02:47:25,029
gazillion pieces but what if you did you

4033
02:47:23,619 --> 02:47:27,220
smash it down into that powder and then

4034
02:47:25,029 --> 02:47:29,408
you mix that powder into the Terps at

4035
02:47:27,219 --> 02:47:31,748
the same ratio that way it's actually

4036
02:47:29,408 --> 02:47:32,918
like davon boy just get a regular dab of

4037
02:47:31,748 --> 02:47:35,828
it you know what I mean like I don't

4038
02:47:32,918 --> 02:47:37,449
know maybe I'd be the way to go yeah you

4039
02:47:35,828 --> 02:47:39,548
know and at that point dude it's like

4040
02:47:37,449 --> 02:47:42,129
you're basically separating everything

4041
02:47:39,549 --> 02:47:43,539
and and if you do that you can crush it

4042
02:47:42,129 --> 02:47:45,369
down and then add it back and now you

4043
02:47:43,539 --> 02:47:45,850
just have sugar again which you can make

4044
02:47:45,369 --> 02:47:47,859
sugar

4045
02:47:45,850 --> 02:47:49,809
you know there's techniques to make that

4046
02:47:47,859 --> 02:47:51,399
consistency and you can do that without

4047
02:47:49,809 --> 02:47:52,689
separating everything and getting back

4048
02:47:51,398 --> 02:47:55,269
to that because all it is is you're just

4049
02:47:52,689 --> 02:47:59,439
making that THC a back to a microscope a

4050
02:47:55,270 --> 02:48:02,619
microscopic scale you know it's time you

4051
02:47:59,439 --> 02:48:06,970
know I don't know I think it's it's

4052
02:48:02,619 --> 02:48:08,890
it'd be better for for for like smoking

4053
02:48:06,969 --> 02:48:10,269
purposes but as far as looks you know

4054
02:48:08,889 --> 02:48:11,978
people are dude they don't get a try it

4055
02:48:10,270 --> 02:48:14,078
or smell it so you know you're gonna

4056
02:48:11,978 --> 02:48:15,849
make it as appealing as you possibly can

4057
02:48:14,078 --> 02:48:18,010
wouldn't still look good though I mean

4058
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:19,720
you've caramelized it to the point where

4059
02:48:18,010 --> 02:48:21,850
it's gonna stay classy I don't think

4060
02:48:19,719 --> 02:48:23,559
that it will break down really so I mean

4061
02:48:21,850 --> 02:48:25,510
wouldn't still kind of look good mixed

4062
02:48:23,559 --> 02:48:27,068
in like it's still gonna be crunchy it's

4063
02:48:25,510 --> 02:48:27,719
not gonna be like the regular sugars

4064
02:48:27,068 --> 02:48:30,840
that were making

4065
02:48:27,719 --> 02:48:33,028
pressin I don't know you're right you're

4066
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:35,340
right and no I mean I think it does look

4067
02:48:33,029 --> 02:48:36,899
good but you know people are so hyped up

4068
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:38,760
on this sauce dude and they gotta

4069
02:48:36,898 --> 02:48:41,129
understand it's not the same sauce as

4070
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:43,680
like these pho extractions you know you

4071
02:48:41,129 --> 02:48:45,358
get more of a less viscous sauce yeah

4072
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:47,340
you can get it to run when it's nice and

4073
02:48:45,359 --> 02:48:49,318
warm some people are getting their their

4074
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:52,079
extraction on the turf fraction down and

4075
02:48:49,318 --> 02:48:54,359
I can't say that that you know you can't

4076
02:48:52,079 --> 02:48:56,579
get some real viscous sauce out of cool

4077
02:48:54,359 --> 02:48:58,380
temp but you know over time it starts to

4078
02:48:56,579 --> 02:48:59,850
sugar up and it depends on your

4079
02:48:58,379 --> 02:49:01,379
techniques that's why patience is

4080
02:48:59,850 --> 02:49:03,450
important you know if quickly you are

4081
02:49:01,379 --> 02:49:06,028
with it then you'll notice your sauce

4082
02:49:03,450 --> 02:49:08,760
lie still sugar back up cuz you're with

4083
02:49:06,029 --> 02:49:10,380
those terpenes and that THC a present or

4084
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:12,420
with the terpenes present that THC a

4085
02:49:10,379 --> 02:49:14,549
comes out with no problem through the

4086
02:49:12,420 --> 02:49:16,648
screen at a lower temp so even though it

4087
02:49:14,549 --> 02:49:18,389
has a higher melting point the terpenes

4088
02:49:16,648 --> 02:49:20,879
are they have some kind of reaction with

4089
02:49:18,389 --> 02:49:22,799
the THC a that's allowing it to dissolve

4090
02:49:20,879 --> 02:49:23,789
through or not dissolve because it's not

4091
02:49:22,799 --> 02:49:28,648
actually dissolving but to push through

4092
02:49:23,790 --> 02:49:30,390
so you know being slow with that and

4093
02:49:28,648 --> 02:49:32,340
getting the most volatile part out which

4094
02:49:30,389 --> 02:49:35,010
are your terpenes getting those out slow

4095
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:39,779
low and slow you know patience that's

4096
02:49:35,010 --> 02:49:41,809
going to be a key part but I mean as far

4097
02:49:39,779 --> 02:49:44,550
as like packaging and looks and

4098
02:49:41,809 --> 02:49:47,039
consumption wise yeah I think having

4099
02:49:44,549 --> 02:49:49,858
small if you want like rocks or like

4100
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:51,689
diamonds keep them small so it's easy to

4101
02:49:49,859 --> 02:49:52,950
get at least a DAB size you know or you

4102
02:49:51,689 --> 02:49:54,930
can break it it's not going to shatter

4103
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:59,310
into all these pieces everywhere it's

4104
02:49:54,930 --> 02:50:00,510
gonna be easier to to [ __ ] dad yeah

4105
02:49:59,309 --> 02:50:02,219
that's the only thing I was wondering

4106
02:50:00,510 --> 02:50:04,109
because I noticed some people really put

4107
02:50:02,219 --> 02:50:06,389
boulders at these [ __ ] jars and I'm

4108
02:50:04,109 --> 02:50:08,399
just like that how the [ __ ] are you

4109
02:50:06,389 --> 02:50:10,500
gonna get a dad without breaking the jar

4110
02:50:08,398 --> 02:50:14,909
or you dapper like out how is this gonna

4111
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:17,340
work so for the the THC a by itself I

4112
02:50:14,909 --> 02:50:20,789
like to I like to leave those big though

4113
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:23,010
cuz I don't know no watch of this last

4114
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:24,960
batch I did was all little pebbles but

4115
02:50:23,010 --> 02:50:27,148
like one batch I did I just left them

4116
02:50:24,959 --> 02:50:29,459
all it's like you know to half gram

4117
02:50:27,148 --> 02:50:31,228
chunks and yeah I realize it's just like

4118
02:50:29,459 --> 02:50:32,909
man it's a pain in the ass to dab on

4119
02:50:31,228 --> 02:50:35,099
that [ __ ] dude like if you really want a

4120
02:50:32,909 --> 02:50:36,719
DAB it's like you broke the whole thing

4121
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:38,430
down to powder just to get one little

4122
02:50:36,719 --> 02:50:39,869
piece so you can actually [ __ ] put in

4123
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:44,010
the [ __ ] rig you know

4124
02:50:39,870 --> 02:50:47,521
so what's the point a hundred percent on

4125
02:50:44,010 --> 02:50:50,399
that it's all about looks do you have

4126
02:50:47,521 --> 02:50:51,720
the first thing is always presentation

4127
02:50:50,399 --> 02:50:53,190
so you know when you have the most

4128
02:50:51,719 --> 02:50:54,179
appealing thing in the crowd that's what

4129
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:55,380
people are gonna grab whether they're

4130
02:50:54,180 --> 02:50:56,550
gonna they're gonna be happier with that

4131
02:50:55,379 --> 02:50:58,889
or they're gonna be happier with the

4132
02:50:56,549 --> 02:51:01,289
person who decided that that is not the

4133
02:50:58,889 --> 02:51:02,399
best route to go and this is you know

4134
02:51:01,290 --> 02:51:05,640
because they've already been there done

4135
02:51:02,399 --> 02:51:07,020
that you know it's just it's that's it

4136
02:51:05,639 --> 02:51:10,139
people gotta learn on their own that it

4137
02:51:07,021 --> 02:51:11,670
sucks you know this is better yeah I

4138
02:51:10,139 --> 02:51:12,899
never said I mean I know some people

4139
02:51:11,670 --> 02:51:14,340
would say big enough dams that they

4140
02:51:12,899 --> 02:51:16,379
would just drop a whole diamond in there

4141
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:18,510
but I'm not that [ __ ] guy like I just

4142
02:51:16,379 --> 02:51:20,399
want a normal dad and I don't want to

4143
02:51:18,510 --> 02:51:25,771
have to work for it with the pic and an

4144
02:51:20,399 --> 02:51:27,959
accent okay crazy I kind of wanted to

4145
02:51:25,771 --> 02:51:30,540
ask everyone what they thought too as we

4146
02:51:27,959 --> 02:51:34,619
just kind of come out the third hour

4147
02:51:30,540 --> 02:51:36,900
here of the present what do you guys

4148
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:38,280
feel about the future of rosin you know

4149
02:51:36,899 --> 02:51:40,649
we're we're we had it I mean obviously

4150
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:43,440
we heard Lindsey earlier say that he

4151
02:51:40,649 --> 02:51:44,760
wants to see robots filling the you know

4152
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:47,069
which is definitely one unique

4153
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:48,719
perspective for sure but where where do

4154
02:51:47,069 --> 02:51:51,239
we see the future of Rozz and where is

4155
02:51:48,719 --> 02:51:54,779
this gonna go is this gonna this gonna

4156
02:51:51,239 --> 02:51:58,409
be become the new pharma great quality

4157
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:59,730
medicinal raw product for all of these

4158
02:51:58,409 --> 02:52:01,649
different products that are going to be

4159
02:51:59,729 --> 02:52:04,109
available in the medicinal world is it

4160
02:52:01,649 --> 02:52:05,850
going to become what's that like I said

4161
02:52:04,110 --> 02:52:07,950
a while ago you know I feel like it's

4162
02:52:05,851 --> 02:52:09,210
gonna be the standard of extraction you

4163
02:52:07,950 --> 02:52:12,510
know people are understanding that they

4164
02:52:09,209 --> 02:52:14,279
can get you know the same quality resin

4165
02:52:12,510 --> 02:52:15,750
and you know whether they want to

4166
02:52:14,280 --> 02:52:17,670
separate it you might not be growing

4167
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:19,920
crystals but I mean we can pull sauce we

4168
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:23,430
can have THC a separated from the

4169
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:28,649
terpene fraction we can get yields

4170
02:52:23,430 --> 02:52:32,310
similar to if not the same I don't see

4171
02:52:28,649 --> 02:52:34,020
why eventually I know everybody in their

4172
02:52:32,310 --> 02:52:36,779
mind wouldn't think of possibly

4173
02:52:34,021 --> 02:52:38,610
converting or going in that route or

4174
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:40,320
people that are new or coming onto the

4175
02:52:38,610 --> 02:52:42,060
scene that that's going to be the number

4176
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:45,889
one option that they're gonna go for I

4177
02:52:42,060 --> 02:52:49,709
see it being the future and the biggest

4178
02:52:45,889 --> 02:52:52,109
extraction method in the future for sure

4179
02:52:49,709 --> 02:52:53,310
most most definitely yeah I feel like

4180
02:52:52,110 --> 02:52:54,659
the the way the world

4181
02:52:53,310 --> 02:52:56,279
going right now then it would become a

4182
02:52:54,659 --> 02:52:58,771
more health-conscious becoming more

4183
02:52:56,280 --> 02:53:00,091
aware of what they eat and [ __ ] they're

4184
02:52:58,771 --> 02:53:01,860
gonna start to realize the same thing

4185
02:53:00,091 --> 02:53:03,511
with the concentrates it's like if you

4186
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:06,001
put the concentrates in front of people

4187
02:53:03,511 --> 02:53:07,440
on a table and you ask them okay this

4188
02:53:06,001 --> 02:53:09,091
one's made with heat and pressure this

4189
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:10,801
was made with water ice this was made

4190
02:53:09,091 --> 02:53:13,200
with just shaking the bun and this one's

4191
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:15,270
made with butane gas anybody in their

4192
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:16,860
right mind is not gonna pick the butane

4193
02:53:15,271 --> 02:53:18,511
gas they've never taken adapt in their

4194
02:53:16,860 --> 02:53:19,980
life they're gonna say what what do you

4195
02:53:18,511 --> 02:53:21,421
mean you made it with butane gas isn't

4196
02:53:19,979 --> 02:53:24,119
that for lighters that's gonna be

4197
02:53:21,421 --> 02:53:25,591
someone's response in my opinion so I

4198
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:27,480
don't know I feel like they're more

4199
02:53:25,591 --> 02:53:29,909
newcomers that come are gonna be mess

4200
02:53:27,479 --> 02:53:30,899
likely wanting to dab [ __ ] that's I mean

4201
02:53:29,909 --> 02:53:32,880
I've already seen a lot of people

4202
02:53:30,899 --> 02:53:34,829
convert they don't have pho at all and

4203
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:37,439
they were like believers of it I mean I

4204
02:53:34,829 --> 02:53:38,640
wasn't one time two so if I can change I

4205
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:42,021
feel like a lot of people can so I

4206
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:42,020
definitely agree were to say a bro

4207
02:53:44,091 --> 02:53:46,560
anyone else yeah and then I seen right

4208
02:53:46,021 --> 02:53:48,391
there

4209
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:50,431
Elysium put solving the sauce carts

4210
02:53:48,390 --> 02:53:52,199
that's definitely the future and it's

4211
02:53:50,431 --> 02:53:54,271
great because you know what I have not

4212
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:56,400
come out with the pen for the fact that

4213
02:53:54,271 --> 02:54:00,329
I'm not going to use vegetable glycerin

4214
02:53:56,399 --> 02:54:02,460
or propylene glass or you know just any

4215
02:54:00,329 --> 02:54:05,851
of these fillers and you know I've

4216
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:07,470
wanted to have a saltless pen but it has

4217
02:54:05,851 --> 02:54:09,181
it solvent list it might be solving this

4218
02:54:07,470 --> 02:54:10,859
but you're adding you know fillers into

4219
02:54:09,181 --> 02:54:13,171
that [ __ ] you know so so to actually

4220
02:54:10,860 --> 02:54:15,060
fractionally separate this [ __ ] and then

4221
02:54:13,171 --> 02:54:16,860
you know you can go from that process

4222
02:54:15,060 --> 02:54:18,029
and now you'll be able to make solvent

4223
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:19,819
les cartes because now you have those

4224
02:54:18,030 --> 02:54:21,631
fractions separated for you to

4225
02:54:19,819 --> 02:54:24,899
manipulate and do whatever is necessary

4226
02:54:21,630 --> 02:54:26,430
to get to that place he seems like a lot

4227
02:54:24,899 --> 02:54:30,511
of new people who might come into the

4228
02:54:26,431 --> 02:54:33,239
industry are gonna be sort of more prone

4229
02:54:30,511 --> 02:54:35,521
to using pens because just the axis and

4230
02:54:33,239 --> 02:54:36,869
how easy it actually is and the

4231
02:54:35,521 --> 02:54:39,001
discreteness you know and everything

4232
02:54:36,870 --> 02:54:41,579
else that comes along with anything so

4233
02:54:39,001 --> 02:54:45,409
in general I feel like that it's gonna

4234
02:54:41,579 --> 02:54:49,171
take a huge portion of the market I

4235
02:54:45,409 --> 02:54:51,601
think for Canada yeah yeah it's gonna be

4236
02:54:49,171 --> 02:54:52,860
huge here in Canada with the the LP

4237
02:54:51,601 --> 02:54:54,961
market I mean where they're not

4238
02:54:52,860 --> 02:54:57,060
accepting anything other than two

4239
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:58,770
extractions right now so there is a

4240
02:54:57,060 --> 02:55:00,810
demand here for dabs and things like

4241
02:54:58,771 --> 02:55:02,909
that and being that legalization is

4242
02:55:00,810 --> 02:55:06,300
coming it's it's most definitely going

4243
02:55:02,909 --> 02:55:08,450
to be the the leading leading extract

4244
02:55:06,300 --> 02:55:10,829
here

4245
02:55:08,450 --> 02:55:13,740
yeah just look at the price of a co2

4246
02:55:10,829 --> 02:55:16,799
machine comparative Osmonds

4247
02:55:13,739 --> 02:55:20,239
I know exactly dollars on joint systems

4248
02:55:16,799 --> 02:55:25,859
and you know with the hair straightener

4249
02:55:20,239 --> 02:55:28,530
I see no co2 it did 40 pounds in five

4250
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:30,270
hours I think you know we can get we can

4251
02:55:28,530 --> 02:55:32,670
get Roz in there we can make it press or

4252
02:55:30,270 --> 02:55:35,670
multiple presses or a stacked pressors

4253
02:55:32,670 --> 02:55:38,989
or some variation of a press to do that

4254
02:55:35,670 --> 02:55:43,170
no problem no problem forty pounds and

4255
02:55:38,989 --> 02:55:46,020
there's yeah there's gonna be rows and

4256
02:55:43,170 --> 02:55:47,309
extraction for use of capsules and all

4257
02:55:46,020 --> 02:55:51,840
that stuff and then there's gonna be

4258
02:55:47,309 --> 02:55:54,029
more but you know art craft approach to

4259
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:57,120
it and I think you know both aspects

4260
02:55:54,030 --> 02:55:59,340
will will be in very beneficial for for

4261
02:55:57,120 --> 02:56:01,620
the industry I think if you compare it

4262
02:55:59,340 --> 02:56:03,180
with you the the beer industry you know

4263
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:04,740
you got your your Bud Lights in your

4264
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:06,630
Coors lights and then you got your

4265
02:56:04,739 --> 02:56:08,459
Sierra Nevadas and a Syrah about is

4266
02:56:06,629 --> 02:56:10,639
grown it's kind of going a little closer

4267
02:56:08,459 --> 02:56:13,409
to Bud Light and then you got your true

4268
02:56:10,639 --> 02:56:16,709
you know classy blue color like

4269
02:56:13,409 --> 02:56:18,360
Lagunitas for example and then beyond

4270
02:56:16,709 --> 02:56:20,369
that you have your craft ales and your

4271
02:56:18,360 --> 02:56:22,860
sours those real specialty items and I

4272
02:56:20,370 --> 02:56:25,650
think rosin is going to be able to

4273
02:56:22,860 --> 02:56:28,140
provide you know for every demographic

4274
02:56:25,649 --> 02:56:30,149
with you if you want to dab and your

4275
02:56:28,139 --> 02:56:32,010
only criteria is that there's no gas in

4276
02:56:30,149 --> 02:56:33,930
it no solvent in it well then you might

4277
02:56:32,010 --> 02:56:38,190
be a Bud Light Rosen guy you know if you

4278
02:56:33,930 --> 02:56:40,680
like to drink six beers drink six you

4279
02:56:38,190 --> 02:56:42,030
know Pale Ales maybe you wanna maybe you

4280
02:56:40,680 --> 02:56:43,170
want some really good flower rosin

4281
02:56:42,030 --> 02:56:45,810
that's kind of middle-of-the-road where

4282
02:56:43,170 --> 02:56:47,940
you're at or maybe you have a special

4283
02:56:45,809 --> 02:56:49,409
occasion you wanna bust open that sour

4284
02:56:47,940 --> 02:56:51,600
you've been talking to your friend about

4285
02:56:49,409 --> 02:56:54,899
and you know get down on some whole

4286
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:58,890
plant fresh frozen you know you know

4287
02:56:54,899 --> 02:57:02,879
unicorn rosin yeah I think there's no

4288
02:56:58,889 --> 02:57:05,010
reason that products made with solvents

4289
02:57:02,879 --> 02:57:06,899
really are gonna have a long stay I

4290
02:57:05,010 --> 02:57:10,559
think rosin is definitely the future and

4291
02:57:06,899 --> 02:57:13,170
I think as people start to get a little

4292
02:57:10,559 --> 02:57:14,609
more open-minded and realized that it's

4293
02:57:13,170 --> 02:57:16,139
not just what everybody was saying a

4294
02:57:14,610 --> 02:57:19,500
year ago or just what these people are

4295
02:57:16,139 --> 02:57:20,129
saying now that it's this whole culture

4296
02:57:19,500 --> 02:57:23,459
and practice

4297
02:57:20,129 --> 02:57:25,228
that's gonna grow and evolve and you're

4298
02:57:23,459 --> 02:57:27,839
gonna see a lot of people stand out with

4299
02:57:25,228 --> 02:57:28,859
you know their own method you know

4300
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:32,280
you're also going to see a lot of people

4301
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:33,899
jump in I think trying to copycat what's

4302
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:36,030
trendy like okay I'm gonna harvest

4303
02:57:33,898 --> 02:57:38,489
everything early I my hash has to be

4304
02:57:36,030 --> 02:57:41,070
clear my hash has to be white that's

4305
02:57:38,489 --> 02:57:44,159
like man what about the guy who grew

4306
02:57:41,069 --> 02:57:46,469
Organic let it go twelve weeks you know

4307
02:57:44,159 --> 02:57:48,600
there's SC water you know the water at

4308
02:57:46,469 --> 02:57:51,840
the end of its life and it presses out

4309
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:56,010
some butyl beautiful maple syrup color

4310
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:57,180
[ __ ] rosin like it's it's yeah I just

4311
02:57:56,010 --> 02:57:59,520
I just think it's just gonna take a

4312
02:57:57,180 --> 02:58:02,030
little time and that we all have to keep

4313
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:04,409
you know just doing doing what we do and

4314
02:58:02,030 --> 02:58:05,399
we're gonna be able to show people you

4315
02:58:04,409 --> 02:58:07,350
know we have to we have to be

4316
02:58:05,398 --> 02:58:09,269
ambassadors to this we have to show

4317
02:58:07,350 --> 02:58:11,370
people our products and not just try and

4318
02:58:09,270 --> 02:58:13,560
sell them on our way of doing it but as

4319
02:58:11,370 --> 02:58:16,320
a whole a whole saltless culture I think

4320
02:58:13,559 --> 02:58:19,559
I think we can definitely take some tips

4321
02:58:16,319 --> 02:58:21,209
from how the beer industry does it and

4322
02:58:19,559 --> 02:58:23,519
we should all kind of decide where we

4323
02:58:21,209 --> 02:58:25,859
want to stand with that and you know

4324
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:27,989
sometimes you like a pilsner sometimes

4325
02:58:25,860 --> 02:58:30,960
you like a nail occasionally I like this

4326
02:58:27,989 --> 02:58:33,209
kind and if I show up to somebody else's

4327
02:58:30,959 --> 02:58:37,629
house and all their servants Bud Light

4328
02:58:33,209 --> 02:58:37,629
[Laughter]

4329
02:58:38,898 --> 02:58:45,389
large production and maintain quality

4330
02:58:42,260 --> 02:58:47,010
its quality and quality oh so fusing

4331
02:58:45,389 --> 02:58:49,079
good good good flowers good hash in

4332
02:58:47,010 --> 02:58:50,639
you're gonna get it out and it's just a

4333
02:58:49,079 --> 02:58:53,459
matter of how big you want the scale to

4334
02:58:50,639 --> 02:59:00,389
go I I don't personally like to taste a

4335
02:58:53,459 --> 02:59:03,478
lot of co2 stuff but improperly it

4336
02:59:00,389 --> 02:59:06,359
tastes great yeah so I think scaling it

4337
02:59:03,478 --> 02:59:09,889
up with quality in mind it's it's gonna

4338
02:59:06,360 --> 02:59:12,810
be easy to do and it's it's the future

4339
02:59:09,889 --> 02:59:16,049
look at that compassion made it into the

4340
02:59:12,809 --> 02:59:18,930
room thanks dude right at the end you

4341
02:59:16,049 --> 02:59:22,859
made it I don't know why am I here

4342
02:59:18,930 --> 02:59:24,960
you're here I can hear you whoa sorry

4343
02:59:22,860 --> 02:59:28,610
everybody for being late totally

4344
02:59:24,959 --> 02:59:31,409
appreciate what all you guys do

4345
02:59:28,610 --> 02:59:33,810
especially coming for I came from

4346
02:59:31,409 --> 02:59:37,351
he can't even almost call it rosin the

4347
02:59:33,810 --> 02:59:39,690
same thing completely different but but

4348
02:59:37,351 --> 02:59:41,971
the work you guys do the knowledge you

4349
02:59:39,690 --> 02:59:44,149
share I mean that's really what it's

4350
02:59:41,970 --> 02:59:48,659
about for me as far as the whole

4351
02:59:44,149 --> 02:59:49,859
cannabis industry but what what's next

4352
02:59:48,659 --> 02:59:53,460
how do we make it better

4353
02:59:49,860 --> 02:59:55,530
what's who's doing what and where can we

4354
02:59:53,460 --> 02:59:58,319
turn the corner and be curious right

4355
02:59:55,530 --> 03:00:01,079
because that was always my thing it was

4356
02:59:58,319 --> 03:00:05,279
okay this is so awesome as it is right

4357
03:00:01,079 --> 03:00:07,079
now what's next well why don't you give

4358
03:00:05,280 --> 03:00:09,329
everyone a little bit of history of when

4359
03:00:07,079 --> 03:00:11,341
you came up with that post and how you

4360
03:00:09,329 --> 03:00:13,200
kind of came up with it and explain to

4361
03:00:11,341 --> 03:00:15,601
them like they've never even heard the

4362
03:00:13,200 --> 03:00:17,159
story that you know you from my

4363
03:00:15,601 --> 03:00:19,650
perspective you're the first person I

4364
03:00:17,159 --> 03:00:21,841
ever saw in a cannabis forum talk about

4365
03:00:19,649 --> 03:00:25,739
Ross and then it seems to go back to

4366
03:00:21,841 --> 03:00:29,280
does it go back before 2006 I think it

4367
03:00:25,739 --> 03:00:32,489
was 2005 when I started working on it

4368
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:35,041
and III wanted to do a lot of research

4369
03:00:32,489 --> 03:00:37,110
on it first checking out a bunch of

4370
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:39,989
books seeing information online because

4371
03:00:37,110 --> 03:00:42,450
I didn't want to say oh I'm making a new

4372
03:00:39,989 --> 03:00:45,960
product when somebody else you know

4373
03:00:42,450 --> 03:00:48,601
maybe already had done that basically my

4374
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:50,399
background I was always into hash I grew

4375
03:00:48,601 --> 03:00:52,261
up in the Kootenays in the Nelson area

4376
03:00:50,399 --> 03:00:55,220
and I don't know if you guys know that

4377
03:00:52,261 --> 03:00:59,461
area it's pretty legendary for its

4378
03:00:55,220 --> 03:01:01,290
top-notch strains and extractions and

4379
03:00:59,460 --> 03:01:05,699
all types of stuff but I started making

4380
03:01:01,290 --> 03:01:07,859
hash at about 14 15 years of age I just

4381
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:10,051
it was like we're going to get a buzz

4382
03:01:07,860 --> 03:01:13,141
how do we get a buzz for free right were

4383
03:01:10,050 --> 03:01:15,751
kids so we'd get shake and we rub it

4384
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:18,060
over a screen and it was like it was

4385
03:01:15,751 --> 03:01:20,069
good for them I mean and people were

4386
03:01:18,060 --> 03:01:22,380
like oh you got to use five you got to

4387
03:01:20,069 --> 03:01:24,421
use bud blah blah blah and we were like

4388
03:01:22,380 --> 03:01:28,399
no look at this stuff it's really good

4389
03:01:24,421 --> 03:01:31,351
just from just from the leaves right and

4390
03:01:28,399 --> 03:01:33,210
so I went through a lot of different

4391
03:01:31,351 --> 03:01:35,041
processes trying to press trying to

4392
03:01:33,210 --> 03:01:37,979
stick cash together and stuff like that

4393
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:40,739
using oil as a median to put big bricks

4394
03:01:37,979 --> 03:01:42,270
together and stuff and and then the

4395
03:01:40,739 --> 03:01:44,460
quality just started showing up like

4396
03:01:42,271 --> 03:01:46,261
everybody's quality of trim people were

4397
03:01:44,460 --> 03:01:46,770
taking care of the butts cheering

4398
03:01:46,261 --> 03:01:48,961
everything

4399
03:01:46,771 --> 03:01:51,030
better and and then I was seeing a

4400
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:53,789
better result of hatch that I was

4401
03:01:51,030 --> 03:01:58,110
getting so my method was a bowl with

4402
03:01:53,790 --> 03:02:00,450
heat from steam and I would just take my

4403
03:01:58,110 --> 03:02:01,650
hash powder the kief and I would dump it

4404
03:02:00,450 --> 03:02:03,360
in there and I would just sort of smear

4405
03:02:01,649 --> 03:02:05,130
it with a spoon until it would stick

4406
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:07,980
together right and then I have that

4407
03:02:05,130 --> 03:02:09,090
busted out into the Grahams and and go

4408
03:02:07,979 --> 03:02:10,921
from there

4409
03:02:09,091 --> 03:02:13,110
but as the quality got really good I

4410
03:02:10,921 --> 03:02:16,140
started seeing this film build on the

4411
03:02:13,110 --> 03:02:18,271
bowl and and I kind of was like oh it's

4412
03:02:16,140 --> 03:02:20,699
just wax or whatever kind of wrote it

4413
03:02:18,271 --> 03:02:23,311
off and sort of mixed it back in the

4414
03:02:20,700 --> 03:02:25,620
best I could and until when I was

4415
03:02:23,310 --> 03:02:29,369
working at the Vic's and and the great

4416
03:02:25,620 --> 03:02:33,329
grower Gardner heard me product was

4417
03:02:29,370 --> 03:02:36,660
coming in and this one batch I think it

4418
03:02:33,329 --> 03:02:38,880
was the imposter and the [ __ ] just glued

4419
03:02:36,659 --> 03:02:41,011
right to the side of my bowl and I was

4420
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:42,569
like what the hell's going on here like

4421
03:02:41,011 --> 03:02:44,729
this is something more

4422
03:02:42,569 --> 03:02:46,921
so I scraped all the powder off and got

4423
03:02:44,729 --> 03:02:48,720
it to just that film and didn't have a

4424
03:02:46,921 --> 03:02:50,909
razor blade or anything because I wasn't

4425
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:52,890
into oil I was making full mill hashes

4426
03:02:50,909 --> 03:02:54,931
all the time so I used a butter knife

4427
03:02:52,890 --> 03:02:57,181
and scraped enough of this stuff off the

4428
03:02:54,931 --> 03:03:00,271
side of the bowl and threw it in my pipe

4429
03:02:57,181 --> 03:03:02,341
took a Pythian I almost passed out

4430
03:03:00,271 --> 03:03:04,290
because it was just it was so so much

4431
03:03:02,341 --> 03:03:07,319
stronger than I was used to right it was

4432
03:03:04,290 --> 03:03:08,940
like activating these new neurons in my

4433
03:03:07,319 --> 03:03:11,819
brain that were just waiting for this

4434
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:14,971
new cannabis excuse for II experience

4435
03:03:11,819 --> 03:03:18,060
and first thing I did is went over to I

4436
03:03:14,970 --> 03:03:20,310
was like gotta check this [ __ ] out dude

4437
03:03:18,060 --> 03:03:21,931
like here's the hash gave him the hash

4438
03:03:20,310 --> 03:03:25,199
first and it melted we're probably

4439
03:03:21,931 --> 03:03:27,601
talking four star hash for my second

4440
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:29,159
screening and then I was like try this

4441
03:03:27,601 --> 03:03:32,131
and he did the same thing coughed his

4442
03:03:29,159 --> 03:03:33,720
brains out it almost passed out and we

4443
03:03:32,130 --> 03:03:37,199
were like there's something going on

4444
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:39,390
here and getting back to all the

4445
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:40,801
research that I did the most thing I the

4446
03:03:39,390 --> 03:03:43,921
only thing I really found I forget what

4447
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:46,199
book it was mentioned was wait a minute

4448
03:03:43,921 --> 03:03:48,899
Clark but it was how they would produce

4449
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:50,641
in one of the hash countries they would

4450
03:03:48,899 --> 03:03:52,649
press and press and press and after a

4451
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:55,890
full day of pressing there would be this

4452
03:03:52,649 --> 03:03:57,899
little bit of red oil left on the press

4453
03:03:55,890 --> 03:03:59,038
that they would collect and that was

4454
03:03:57,899 --> 03:04:01,199
their sort of

4455
03:03:59,039 --> 03:04:04,668
potin really what I was Rossum really is

4456
03:04:01,199 --> 03:04:07,408
exactly what it was but it wasn't

4457
03:04:04,668 --> 03:04:09,988
considered like a byproduct of like

4458
03:04:07,408 --> 03:04:12,118
pressing pounds and pounds of hatch

4459
03:04:09,988 --> 03:04:15,509
right so it wasn't necessarily a

4460
03:04:12,119 --> 03:04:18,899
feasible product to bring to market and

4461
03:04:15,509 --> 03:04:22,408
so all I did was started figuring out

4462
03:04:18,898 --> 03:04:28,918
how to just take the cream off and get

4463
03:04:22,408 --> 03:04:31,708
production we're talking 5% oh I got a

4464
03:04:28,918 --> 03:04:34,378
gram of rosin I spent two hours and I

4465
03:04:31,709 --> 03:04:36,509
got a nice Graham puck of rosin and you

4466
03:04:34,379 --> 03:04:39,809
can see all that on my IC mag account as

4467
03:04:36,509 --> 03:04:42,929
well but but once I got it all together

4468
03:04:39,808 --> 03:04:44,998
and I figured it was worthy calling a

4469
03:04:42,929 --> 03:04:47,969
new name because it was a new process

4470
03:04:44,998 --> 03:04:50,458
for extracting something from hash and

4471
03:04:47,968 --> 03:04:53,519
it was giving people a dab experience

4472
03:04:50,459 --> 03:04:55,259
without having to go to isopropanol at

4473
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:58,319
the time which was probably being used a

4474
03:04:55,259 --> 03:05:01,828
lot more or butane and stuff like that

4475
03:04:58,318 --> 03:05:04,078
but my profs definitely go to the good

4476
03:05:01,828 --> 03:05:06,869
growers like the great gardener and the

4477
03:05:04,078 --> 03:05:09,088
people at the fix and and the

4478
03:05:06,869 --> 03:05:11,668
groundbreaking work that was done there

4479
03:05:09,088 --> 03:05:14,129
to just sort of bring it all to all this

4480
03:05:11,668 --> 03:05:17,279
in a way the dispensary Haven waited for

4481
03:05:14,129 --> 03:05:19,049
dispensaries assault this extract a

4482
03:05:17,279 --> 03:05:21,299
whole bunch of stuff sorry I'm rambling

4483
03:05:19,049 --> 03:05:23,039
on a little nervous no dude you that was

4484
03:05:21,299 --> 03:05:24,629
stellar honestly I was kind of bummed

4485
03:05:23,039 --> 03:05:26,248
out that you weren't making it at the

4486
03:05:24,629 --> 03:05:27,929
start and I was really like man what

4487
03:05:26,248 --> 03:05:32,728
will this show be without compassion

4488
03:05:27,929 --> 03:05:35,908
telling us about the OG rosin host I

4489
03:05:32,728 --> 03:05:38,248
remember the photo of the human posted

4490
03:05:35,908 --> 03:05:40,978
which I obviously will have to post here

4491
03:05:38,248 --> 03:05:42,418
as well which was you had posted a few

4492
03:05:40,978 --> 03:05:46,858
of them this one in particular was very

4493
03:05:42,418 --> 03:05:48,718
very just it was a powerful image I

4494
03:05:46,859 --> 03:05:50,158
remember because I felt like I was one

4495
03:05:48,718 --> 03:05:52,618
of the only few people at the time

4496
03:05:50,158 --> 03:05:54,628
taking pictures of really melty resin

4497
03:05:52,619 --> 03:05:57,149
with with powerful macro lenses and

4498
03:05:54,629 --> 03:05:59,369
stuff and you posted just a few pictures

4499
03:05:57,148 --> 03:06:01,318
but one of them caught my eye like

4500
03:05:59,369 --> 03:06:03,959
nobody's business I'm just trying to

4501
03:06:01,318 --> 03:06:05,849
think if it's here I know when you're

4502
03:06:03,959 --> 03:06:09,418
talking about the best word for it I

4503
03:06:05,849 --> 03:06:12,780
think is provocative it's just so like

4504
03:06:09,418 --> 03:06:14,670
what is that stuff you know like

4505
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:16,230
especially back then because and you

4506
03:06:14,670 --> 03:06:20,190
were doing the groundbreaking for the

4507
03:06:16,229 --> 03:06:23,609
the bubble hash water extraction and

4508
03:06:20,190 --> 03:06:25,649
bringing the higher quality resins to

4509
03:06:23,610 --> 03:06:28,500
the picture that didn't have to be made

4510
03:06:25,649 --> 03:06:31,379
with solvent petrochemical solvents yeah

4511
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:33,750
yeah that's the one she's a beauty it

4512
03:06:31,379 --> 03:06:34,229
looked like aids or something I don't

4513
03:06:33,750 --> 03:06:36,540
know

4514
03:06:34,229 --> 03:06:39,270
oh yeah no I right away I was like wow

4515
03:06:36,540 --> 03:06:40,860
the melt quality on this is next-level I

4516
03:06:39,271 --> 03:06:45,120
definitely have to figure this out and

4517
03:06:40,860 --> 03:06:47,280
it was sweet to be able to see to see it

4518
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:48,660
the process and the tie at the time that

4519
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:50,670
you released that it was great because

4520
03:06:48,659 --> 03:06:52,890
as I said earlier when I first released

4521
03:06:50,670 --> 03:06:54,870
the bags I didn't realize it at the time

4522
03:06:52,890 --> 03:06:56,940
but it was the small percentage of

4523
03:06:54,870 --> 03:06:58,380
people because I was always amazed

4524
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:59,640
people that have never made hash in

4525
03:06:58,379 --> 03:07:01,649
their life would just send me a picture

4526
03:06:59,640 --> 03:07:04,140
of basically what would be known as the

4527
03:07:01,649 --> 03:07:06,209
greatest quality hash in the world no

4528
03:07:04,140 --> 03:07:07,920
matter who you are and maybe just Joe

4529
03:07:06,209 --> 03:07:09,750
Blow nobody in the next day they'd be

4530
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:11,780
like one of the greatest hash makers on

4531
03:07:09,750 --> 03:07:14,521
the planet because they had the fire

4532
03:07:11,780 --> 03:07:16,170
material but that was a very very small

4533
03:07:14,521 --> 03:07:18,271
percentage of people and many of the

4534
03:07:16,170 --> 03:07:21,210
people who used my bags got two and

4535
03:07:18,271 --> 03:07:23,880
three and maybe four star but but the

4536
03:07:21,209 --> 03:07:25,109
elusive five and six stars just just

4537
03:07:23,879 --> 03:07:27,119
weren't there for them so when you

4538
03:07:25,110 --> 03:07:29,040
release this method I thought it was

4539
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:31,230
going to catch on a lot more than it

4540
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:33,750
actually did because it kind of was

4541
03:07:31,229 --> 03:07:35,819
exciting and people were doing it but it

4542
03:07:33,750 --> 03:07:38,761
didn't really catch on the way the way I

4543
03:07:35,819 --> 03:07:41,340
thought it would you know well it was a

4544
03:07:38,761 --> 03:07:43,170
lot of work right and at the time it

4545
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:44,790
took and everything and and and that's

4546
03:07:43,170 --> 03:07:46,590
why you know if you go through the posts

4547
03:07:44,790 --> 03:07:48,391
that I did do about it

4548
03:07:46,590 --> 03:07:50,549
that it was always like hey I get it

4549
03:07:48,390 --> 03:07:53,190
this is not the best method right like

4550
03:07:50,549 --> 03:07:55,709
this is I'm sharing this because there's

4551
03:07:53,190 --> 03:07:58,110
something here and if anybody figures

4552
03:07:55,709 --> 03:08:00,629
out a better way then share that

4553
03:07:58,110 --> 03:08:04,530
information for us right because because

4554
03:08:00,629 --> 03:08:07,199
this is for us you know we let's put a

4555
03:08:04,530 --> 03:08:08,880
patent on it or a trademark or whatever

4556
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:10,771
and control it no no no that's not what

4557
03:08:08,879 --> 03:08:13,140
this plant is about it's about sharing

4558
03:08:10,771 --> 03:08:16,141
and furthering all of our knowledge

4559
03:08:13,140 --> 03:08:18,989
about it right this is the biggest and

4560
03:08:16,140 --> 03:08:20,640
that's what you know publishing and

4561
03:08:18,989 --> 03:08:22,351
putting the information out to the

4562
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:23,761
public that once you've previously

4563
03:08:22,351 --> 03:08:25,569
published something it's no longer

4564
03:08:23,761 --> 03:08:27,460
patentable so you know

4565
03:08:25,569 --> 03:08:29,920
that that's the best way to do that if

4566
03:08:27,459 --> 03:08:33,520
you want to I mean it sure made sense

4567
03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:36,431
water hash how was I ever gonna sell

4568
03:08:33,521 --> 03:08:41,290
people bags if they if I would didn't

4569
03:08:36,431 --> 03:08:42,521
tell them how I got these bags and if

4570
03:08:41,290 --> 03:08:44,740
you figure it out you might get

4571
03:08:42,521 --> 03:08:46,721
something really good but I'm not going

4572
03:08:44,739 --> 03:08:49,119
to be showing you how to do it so that

4573
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:51,129
would be a little bit ridiculous anyway

4574
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:53,860
that was awesome having you give us that

4575
03:08:51,129 --> 03:08:55,779
historical context so 2005 and was it

4576
03:08:53,860 --> 03:08:57,900
overgrow that you posted it on first

4577
03:08:55,780 --> 03:09:00,971
yeah it was definitely on overgrow I

4578
03:08:57,899 --> 03:09:03,250
have reposted it on - I see Meg just

4579
03:09:00,970 --> 03:09:04,659
because what happened with og forms

4580
03:09:03,250 --> 03:09:08,101
there I just want to make sure that that

4581
03:09:04,659 --> 03:09:12,431
knowledge was still out there for sure

4582
03:09:08,101 --> 03:09:15,761
again you guys have helped take it to a

4583
03:09:12,431 --> 03:09:18,700
whole other level and I'm super grateful

4584
03:09:15,761 --> 03:09:22,090
in a market that's saturated with Petro

4585
03:09:18,700 --> 03:09:24,460
chemical based solvent based extractions

4586
03:09:22,090 --> 03:09:27,460
you know like to be able to have very

4587
03:09:24,459 --> 03:09:29,409
cheap materials at home to be able to

4588
03:09:27,459 --> 03:09:31,089
press out some things that I can have

4589
03:09:29,409 --> 03:09:32,289
some smoke is huge to me

4590
03:09:31,090 --> 03:09:36,250
you know like because I was still

4591
03:09:32,290 --> 03:09:38,230
rubbing some buds in the screen pressing

4592
03:09:36,250 --> 03:09:41,040
some of that out you know like oh my

4593
03:09:38,229 --> 03:09:43,659
ball cuz I'm like I wanted a band and

4594
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:48,551
dabbing is totally where it's at I

4595
03:09:43,659 --> 03:09:51,729
remember the hash master cut little gab

4596
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:53,920
rig you know I got one somewhere packed

4597
03:09:51,729 --> 03:09:55,930
away and and we were doing that she had

4598
03:09:53,920 --> 03:09:58,780
ten years ago at that time as well right

4599
03:09:55,931 --> 03:10:01,090
so I mean we all sort of one step we all

4600
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:04,989
work together to create a bigger picture

4601
03:10:01,090 --> 03:10:09,431
and a masterpiece really over time right

4602
03:10:04,989 --> 03:10:11,229
so yeah props to all you guys yeah well

4603
03:10:09,431 --> 03:10:12,940
that's awesome dude I am beyond stoked

4604
03:10:11,229 --> 03:10:14,229
that you managed to make it in seven

4605
03:10:12,940 --> 03:10:15,399
hundred and seventy seven people

4606
03:10:14,229 --> 03:10:17,409
watching right now I don't know why I

4607
03:10:15,399 --> 03:10:18,940
like that number but I do I get the idea

4608
03:10:17,409 --> 03:10:19,989
that solving this mind would like that

4609
03:10:18,940 --> 03:10:24,700
number as well

4610
03:10:19,989 --> 03:10:26,771
I couldn't be wrong all right cool well

4611
03:10:24,700 --> 03:10:29,920
listen guys that was really quite an

4612
03:10:26,771 --> 03:10:31,989
incredible episode if you guys feel that

4613
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:33,190
you want to talk more I can like and

4614
03:10:31,989 --> 03:10:35,860
there's things that we haven't talked

4615
03:10:33,190 --> 03:10:36,250
about I don't mind leaving you to it for

4616
03:10:35,860 --> 03:10:38,751
a little while

4617
03:10:36,250 --> 03:10:41,271
otherwise I think I'm going to call it

4618
03:10:38,751 --> 03:10:43,190
call it a day and thank everyone for

4619
03:10:41,271 --> 03:10:45,711
coming in and being a part of the past

4620
03:10:43,190 --> 03:10:47,961
present and future of Roz and hash

4621
03:10:45,710 --> 03:10:49,489
church 2.0 episode maybe we could do

4622
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:51,319
another episode where we make it more

4623
03:10:49,489 --> 03:10:52,819
