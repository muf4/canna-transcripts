it's the end of the night here but i

313
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,020
thought i'd share this as I was gearing

314
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,460
up and I was going through this product

315
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,839
grunge off friend of mine owns this

316
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,019
company it's actually quite a really

317
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,819
good product I guess I originally saw

318
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:41,240
this quite a few years ago in Amsterdam

319
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:44,389
and someone had told me that it was like

320
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,220
from a soybean oil extracted from a

321
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,370
soybean so it's a type of oil it's a

322
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,350
sort of organic cleaner works hella good

323
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,779
but how I keep my mother ship clean as I

324
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:55,219
fill it up with grunge off a little bit

325
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,559
run under the base there but that's okay

326
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:00,200
I fill it up with grunge off and I let

327
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,299
it soak overnight and then I also fill

328
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,150
up a glass and I've got the courts Bowl

329
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:07,819
and the other piece my 14 to 14 male

330
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,070
male the male and basically this just

331
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:11,450
makes it so it's real easy to clean in

332
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,189
the morning I'll show you guys will do a

333
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,440
quick rinse and everything will clean

334
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,670
out perfect and that way it makes life a

335
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,080
little bit easier for us as we're

336
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,970
traveling we're gonna have to get take

337
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,349
this to Jamaica and a couple of days you

338
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,298
want it to be clean

339
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:25,029
leave Jamaica we want to make sure that

340
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:26,869
it's clean coming back into Canada so

341
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,849
anyway thought I'd share that with you

342
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:32,859
guys have a good night people watching

343
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:32,859
old man's world and see you all
