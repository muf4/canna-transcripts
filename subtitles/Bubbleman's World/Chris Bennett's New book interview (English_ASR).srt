cat is America's we were talking a

83
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:43,209
little bit earlier off-camera in regards

84
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,310
to you know sort of how chris has been

85
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,919
able to from writing his other books

86
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,139
been able to finally compile and create

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,240
these connections that he's found over

88
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,009
the years yeah yeah well you know one

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,170
thing leads to another and having a

90
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:58,810
background with different cultures and

91
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:01,540
their historical use of cannabis it

92
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,160
helps to understand later references and

93
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,879
how they came about and stuff like say

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,430
for instance Islamic influences really

95
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,969
influenced later Europeans of cannabis

96
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,670
and you can see this in things like

97
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:18,730
magic via like magical texts like the

98
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,249
10th century Gaia al-hakim which refers

99
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,249
to can

100
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:24,109
was translated into the picker tricks in

101
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,539
the 13th century was translated into

102
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:30,318
Latin and entered Europe and it's one of

103
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:31,848
the pivotal documents of Western magical

104
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,509
traditions it was kind of starts with

105
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:38,269
this you know and that has a recipe for

106
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:41,028
instance for a pound and a bit of

107
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:43,639
Turkish resin mixed with snake blood and

108
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:46,009
other ingredients of birch in order to

109
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,549
invoke the messenger of the moon in the

110
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:52,699
pillar of smoke that forms over this

111
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:55,478
fuming pile and so you know that's what

112
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:59,209
way and then another way is in alchemy

113
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:02,118
you know figures like Abba sienna and

114
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:04,819
gabber well Nolan Arabic alchemical

115
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:07,669
figures and before them is all zero so

116
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:10,939
made reference to cannabis preparation

117
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:13,038
is the tincture and whatnot and this is

118
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:14,929
why we form these sorts of references in

119
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,438
the works of European alchemists like

120
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:21,828
Paracelsus and Cardinal who have recipes

121
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:25,669
for cannabis infusions in their works in

122
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:27,468
the Latin again so yeah you know so we

123
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:31,359
don't have any knowledge and this kind

124
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:31,360
of helps to bring all this together

125
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:45,079
Katz there's the camera sometimes yeah

126
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,728
it's very unique information that you've

127
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,019
got I have not read the book Chris was

128
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:49,668
just telling me you're the only person

129
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,548

130
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:54,649

134
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,229
Crowley and a guy who I learned while I

135
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,088
was writing this book actually lived on

136
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:10,668
my street year in North Vancouver and

137
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:13,329
decode that I grew up in I did a

138
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:15,549
cannabis ritual and

139
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:19,598

guys are gonna pick up this book and

144
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:30,310
you're going to read this information

145
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,879
it's not going to be information that is

146
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:36,190
common knowledge and like I feel like I

147
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:38,229
know a fair bit about cannabis over the

148
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,599
years I've definitely well didn't do it

149
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,639
geek tout on it pretty hard but Chris's

150
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,160
information is always stuff that's a

151
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,720
surprise to me it's always new and I you

152
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,909
know I don't actress know all the names

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,790
but over the years he's definitely

154
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:53,289
educated me too Rabelais and to Crowley

155
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:55,539
and to some of these different guises

156
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,919
connections with cannabis and I'm always

157
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:58,750
looking more forward to sort of

158
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,360
connecting more of the dots as it's done

159
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,708
through you know 11 and 12 and 13th all

160
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,169
the different centuries that this

161
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,609
information has passed through it's it's

162
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,229
incredible really well you know we're

163
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,230
I'm lucky to live in this like pivotal

164
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,600
time when things like google books where

165
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,539
they've scanned like all these Medieval

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,769
and Renaissance era manuscripts into

167
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,149
Google Books

168
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,389
and you can search through the word

169
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,578
searches and cannabis and Latin is spelt

170
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:27,009
the same way as words in English so

171
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:28,328
you're able to go back into a lot of

172
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:30,490
these variations and then when you know

173
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:32,620
other spellings that the variations that

174
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,480
as well you're able to search all these

175
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,000
documents and then it's just a matter of

176
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,490
finding out what the references say

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,070
where you can find in the identification

178
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,899
of cannabis and so I know some Latin

179
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,930
translators and hired some Latin

180
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,519
translators and was able to find a lot

181
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:50,588
of really cool old recipes and

182
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,740
information that nobody's ever really

183
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,290
written about for centuries you know so

184
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,480
it's pretty fun stuff and pretty

185
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:00,360
interesting as well

186
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,879
cannabis because I gotta give it up to

187
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,579
some of these old alchemists from back

188
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,588
in the day they really had to seek this

189
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,088
[ __ ] out oh yeah they were they were

190
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,910
they were doing a lot of experimentation

191
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:15,120
you know like a guy like Perry calluses

192
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:17,610
for instance his recipe for cannabis or

193
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,009
Academy which is a texture preparation

194
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,959
was for epilepsy and we see all these

195
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:24,809
people getting created for epilepsy now

196
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:27,388
this is like you know like 15th century

197
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,609
16th century and you know he's already

198
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,379
you know we're well aware of additional

199
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,050
qualities of this herb for that

200
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,000
particular debilitating purpose you know

201
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:39,149
we got a wondering how many feet how

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,458
many tens of thousands of people have

203
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,889
suffered between the 15th century when

204
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,689
he came up with that information to

205
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:50,060
today where it's like you know he took

206
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,060
Sanjay Gupta or whatever going on CNN

207
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:55,319
it's it's you know and it's a lot of it

208
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,360
is children suffering you know and not

209
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,040
know I guess we always feel that

210
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,570
children suffering is obviously a little

211
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,179
bit worse but suffering is suffering

212
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,100
people suffering is kind of a pretty big

213
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:06,568
down yeah well you know in the aging

214
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,110
world to treat people of something like

215
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:12,269
epilepsy it was comparable to exorcisms

216
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,789
even I was gonna say they must have

217
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:16,350
thought they were epilepsy was thought

218
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:19,769
to be demonic possession well into

219
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,839
Medieval Renaissance times so yeah you

220
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:23,909
were like a miracle cure you know you've

221
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,800
exercises demon right out of them well

222
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,328
interesting that off-camera before we

223
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,278
were talking I was started talking about

224
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:31,138
how I feel that cannabis it's this sort

225
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,809
of weather metaphorical or whether you

226
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:35,639
want to think of it as exactly that it's

227
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,739
it tends to close these you know

228
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,720
metaphorically I I this is my own

229
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,970
personal opinion but it seems to close

230
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,800
these portholes in which demons possess

231
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,209
people and whether that's you know

232
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,500
people thinking bad thoughts people

233
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,399
doing bad actions

234
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,230
you know people getting hammered

235
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,509
on different drugs when they don't seem

236
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,370
to be themselves and then the medicinal

237
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:57,069
components of cannabis helping regulate

238
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,509
and getting people try illogical

239
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,610
functions back in order getting their

240
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,250
endocannabinoids system into homeostasis

241
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,800
that really would be the opposite of you

242
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,480
know the demonic possession of epilepsy

243
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,370
and all these other ailments you know

244
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,789
it's funny because in the ancient world

245
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,740
a lot predating germ theory there was

246
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:16,750
this whole theory about different demons

247
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,190
that were present you could see that

248
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,039
they were present by different ailments

249
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,600
and symptoms and stuff like that and so

250
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,399
if anyway you know how to cough or the

251
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,930
rash on your groin but while you had

252
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:31,929
this popular demon you know and that's

253
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:34,000
scary yeah so that was but it kind of

254
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:37,959
followed a lot along the same lines as

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,210
germ theory but of like contagion and in

256
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,070
symptoms and all that type of stuff and

257
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,790
that's going back fairly far so let's go

258
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,200
back like thousands of years yeah so

259
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:48,969
yeah we're gonna hit the popco while we

260
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,440
talk a little bit more about Chris's

261
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,300
book and then we're actually going to

262
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,360
head out on the boosted boards perhaps

263
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:57,339
the evolve will make a an appearance

264
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,320
what we're gonna do the seawall see well

265
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,970
yeah for sure sounds great yeah as I was

266
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,530
saying to mark earlier I'm only doing

267
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,450
interviews about the book of people who

268
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,730
read and even read it but a hugh

269
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,050
electric skateboard and you want to go

270
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,120
for it you can rip on it electric

271
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:12,639
skateboard then i can bypass that

272
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,289
particular rule if we go for a ride so

273
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,029
well I appreciate it and I will

274
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:18,129
absolutely read your book man there's

275
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,049
you know for me there's an enormous

276
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:23,620
amount of information here that I don't

277
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,969
know and you know like you learning from

278
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,590
writing writing your books and

279
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,450
connecting things and putting the dots

280
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,370
together to be able to see these

281
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,620
different patterns I look forward to

282
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,980
that as well well you know so it's gonna

283
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,960
take obviously reading

284
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,820
it's it's this is not light reading this

285
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,220
is seriously heavy reading like that you

286
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,200
definitely have to kind of turn up the

287
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,690
intellect a little bit yeah well you

288
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,900
know it's like I'm out to prove stuff so

289
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:51,050
it's like takes references and citations

290
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:54,590
put notes and bibliographies and makes

291
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:57,849
for a slightly drier although I try to

292
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:00,889
keep it entertaining with weird facts

293
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,750
looks like a great book man what are

294
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,319
some of the highlights that you've you

295
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,730
enjoyed the book you know I love the

296
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,020
stuff about the Templars you know

297
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,500
there's been claims by a number of

298
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:15,110
authors like Robert Anton Wilson and a

299
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:28,789
doctor Libra or a book about medieval

300
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:31,789
medicine Lily and you know deseos the

301
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:33,949
Templars had this cannabis wine this

302
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:36,740
preparation of cannabis aloe in a palm

303
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,120
wine and I started digging around trying

304
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,960
to find that and I could find no

305
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,210
references to it but I did find that

306
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:47,000
cannabis was seized at two Templar sites

307
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,210
and their raids considerable amounts of

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,039
it where the form is described and they

309
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,740
had some sort of a contract with

310
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:56,360
Saracens Arabs to grow cannabis for them

311
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,610
in Spain and Arabs were particularly

312
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,500
known for growing the industrial variety

313
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:06,259
campus and what year what year this is

314
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:08,179
like 12 13 century oh wow and so it adds

315
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,419
credence to these of these claims about

316
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:12,649
the cannabis wine and also a pope who

317
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,120
was friendly with the Templars

318
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,429
temperature around for a few centuries

319
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,789
and before they were accused of their

320
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,929
heresies they were quite friendly with

321
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:24,049
every part of the Catholic Church

322
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:25,939
basically right and a pope who was

323
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:27,649
friendly with them released a medical

324
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,440
treatise that included that cannabis

325
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:35,028
infused wine for a number of ailments

326
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,670
and in the same time period mason

327
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:39,649
Villere Donna corked his Masonic Germany

328
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:42,819
he spent time in the Holy Land it had a

329
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:46,100
bunch of illustrations of different

330
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,320
masonry techniques from one of them but

331
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,690
the only page of written text and it is

332
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,360
Anna cannabis infused woman so it seems

333
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,800
likely that there was some you know

334
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,800
awareness of that that for preparation

335
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,929
coming in and there's this interesting

336
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:01,729
connection then the Templars are very

337
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:04,458
connected to the whole Grail mythology

338
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,519
and the term Grail itself has a

339
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:10,129
neurological connections to the gras

340
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,139
which is the vessel that soma and the

341
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,389
Persian counterpart soma and were

342
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,578
partaking right and it's like a holy

343
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,409
vessel where the psychoactive beverage

344
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:21,708
is taken in and there's some interesting

345
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:23,778
stuff in that in that mythology and

346
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,759
others have suggested there may be some

347
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:30,528
connection between the Grail mythology

348
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:34,039
and the hashish infusion used by the

349
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:36,320
Templars medieval sometimes enemies

350
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:39,379
sometimes allies known as the hash

351
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,720
machine a group of Islamic heretics that

352
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,458
are reputed to have used a sheesh and

353
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,528
there's controversy about that and I

354
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:48,409
answer a lot of that controversy over a

355
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:50,570
lot of the historical material and my

356
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:52,689
view on the hash machine is is this is a

357
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,220
carryover from the earlier Persian

358
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:58,190
Geraci and traditions where we read in

359
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,680
the first few centuries ADEs accounts up

360
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,000
these Persian

361
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,569
Psychonauts taking credit us appears

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,029
wine

363
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,650
and in otherworldly voyages under the

364
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:08,389
influence you know I'm talking poke

365
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,579
extracts like sometimes they drink like

366
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,380
as much as seven cups of these cannabis

367
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:14,509
infused wines and these guys would be

368
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,220
knocked out for a couple of days

369
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:17,779
and then they come back and report these

370
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,730
visionary experiences they have in

371
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:22,009
Leavenworth it was thought to be that

372
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,990
their soul had left their body that's

373
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,819
where these type of ideas came from for

374
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,670
people having drug experiences you know

375
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,710
so were you kind of along the lines of I

376
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,240
saw cops damnit speak recently and he

377
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,390
brought up terence mckenna's stoned

378
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,180
monkey theory of the sort of like how

379
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,920
consciousness got this spark yeah into

380
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,410
into really all these different things

381
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,870
that we've you know the creation of from

382
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,170
engineering and like complex

383
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:49,699
civilizations and all these different

384
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,230
all these different concepts do you kind

385
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,440
of come from the belief system that

386
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,900
psychedelics and psychoactive can assure

387
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:24,110
you know like a dr. Jasser a guy what do

388
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:25,759
i do just hit yeah it's all ceramic yeah

389
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,919
we've come a long way as we're talking

390
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,629
about the history of cannabis from you

391
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,140
know thousands of years ago as we

392
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:37,190
literally hit the most up-to-date sort

393
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:41,570
of future is a latest these guys what a

394
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:43,850
trip to try this yeah for sure

395
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:51,039
very cool so you're saying about just a

396
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:54,740
doctor Jeffrey Garten

397
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,159
cannabis be appearing at the time of the

398
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,450
Great Leap Forward many of these like

399
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,580
advancements in human culture took place

400
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,830
invention the wheel and chrome fire

401
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:04,529
these type of things you know we know

402
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:08,039
that

403
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:11,639
the natural evidence that for at least

404
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:14,129
five purposes our relationship of campus

405
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,630
goes back or twenty five thousand years

406
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:21,960
you know I mean so evidence we which

407
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,630
puts it puts its use in to get close to

408
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,650
the time period puppy great leap forward

409
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,970
in amenities like technologic very

410
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,860
cultural advancements were made you know

411
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,230
I mean they they speculate it was the

412
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,269
the ability of cannabis to cause new

413
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,519
novel ways of thinking you know right

414
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:40,230
and we know people are oh there's always

415
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,420
a group of people that are afraid of new

416
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,180
novel ways of thinking or even change of

417
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,769
any kind in general and so as you do

418
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,570
research like this does it seem as

419
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,190
though the prohibition of cannabis has

420
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:52,169
been around for almost as long as

421
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,120
cannabis there's always been people that

422
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,300
have felt greatest by other people using

423
00:19:54,119 --> 00:20:00,209
cannabis for a long time you know you

424
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:04,289
see this with the disappearance of some

425
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,720
a oma in in Persian India and also you

426
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,579
know psychoactive substances in general

427
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,950
you know it's like religions like

428
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,299
Christianity Judaism their religions

429
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,370
that you're taught you know it's not

430
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:16,259
really about your own personal

431
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:17,699
experience it's more what's the stories

432
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:20,759
in this book or this is what we believe

433
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,519
in anything that offers like a hands-on

434
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,920
experience you know type of thing or the

435
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,889
concept and there's bad lies within you

436
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,529
it's a real threat to that higher always

437
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:34,020
they seem to replace all of that with

438
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:36,450
faith yeah psycho don't you know have

439
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:40,470
your own experience like just have faith

440
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,769
yeah telling you is is accurate and that

441
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,298
it's

442
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:45,759
although you know I have known people

443
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:47,168
who have used their religious belief

444
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,179
systems to help them and I certainly

445
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:51,460
don't mock people's religious belief

446
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:54,399
systems but I guess I do mock you know

447
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,230
what I mean it's like I just see like I

448
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:58,778
take a look at the world around me and I

449
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,628
just see so much problem caused by this

450
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:03,579
stuff and so much of it seems like so

451
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:05,469
much hooey the more I you know look into

452
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:07,239
it I select I've really studied religion

453
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,129
for a long time you have you've gone in

454
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:10,629
a lot deeper than I have for sure for me

455
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:12,219
it's just not my five I'm like that's

456
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:13,868
what you want to do no problem I always

457
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,298
am refreshed by some of the things

458
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:17,259
you'll say on Facebook and in some of

459
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:24,480
your posts where you just like

460
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:24,480
no-holds-barred guy here it's like yeah

461
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,858
and it's true you know it's right up

462
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:41,138
there with it's hard to not connect

463
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:42,878
religion with prohibition because it

464
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:44,709
seems like since religion has been alive

465
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:48,849
they prohibited

466
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:50,558
thoughts experiences you know yeah

467
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,480
different different things there's

468
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,339
always putting these rules that really

469
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,589
would be construed as a type of

470
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,178
prohibition oh yeah yeah not for sure to

471
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:59,408
the extreme really and it's all part of

472
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,028
the human experience you know what I

473
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:02,169
mean like these things you know a lot of

474
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,808
these things may have served a better

475
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:06,940
purpose in their original times than

476
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:08,678
they serve us 2,000 years later and

477
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,308
people are trying to force this

478
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,559
bronze-age laws and mentality on 21st

479
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:16,599
century men it's just like you know

480
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,428
pretty ludicrous it's absolutely

481
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,869
ludicrous in that sense when you think

482
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,540
of these things that are

483
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:25,389
thousands of years old but I mean even

484
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:28,180
even when these guys wrote you know the

485
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:31,360
Constitution for you know the u.s. just

486
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:34,570
like you know 1776 or whatever that

487
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,729
thing got and that's it doesn't really

488
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:38,619
kind of you know with it like just to

489
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,589
simply record to like the gun one like

490
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:43,808
to bear arms and protect one thing used

491
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:46,659
to be like holding it and pushing it

492
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:49,509
down and now it's like submachine gun or

493
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,308
whatever yeah absolutely there's been a

494
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:53,740
lot of change maybe it might be a good

495
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:54,428
idea to update the scriptures yeah

496
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,240
absolutely

497
00:22:54,429 --> 00:23:00,190
I think the badge apples pretty well

498
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,589
taken things to the limit so if Jesus

499
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,570
doesn't show now then you know I think

500
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,189
they should probably day yeah he's got a

501
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:08,769
very short period of time to show that

502
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,840
this one I'm sure those guys that do

503
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:14,879
what they can to get Armageddon going

504
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:14,879
and in the Holy Land

505
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,779
sure well we have canvas on our side so

506
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:24,219
we're very lucky yeah well you know it's

507
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:26,649
like my whole experience with cannabis

508
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,220
actually started with the religious

509
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:32,350
experience I had in like 89 90 reading

510
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,789
the Bible and you know reading the book

511
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:37,129
of Revelation stoned and

512
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:40,029
in the last chapter about the Tree of

513
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:43,160
Life in the book of Revelation with its

514
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:44,899
many fruits is 12 matters of fruit and

515
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,970
its leaves for the end of the nations

516
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,190
and that's really what set me on my path

517
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,809
that was like the life-changing moment

518
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,930
you know what I mean so as much as I

519
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:56,269
could write it you know at the same time

520
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,920
I realize its role in the you know in

521
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,720
the collective consciousness in human

522
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:06,170
history and I think that what cannabis

523
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,299
offers just a new way of looking at that

524
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,360
whole thing and I think when you really

525
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:14,409
understand the history of cannabis and

526
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:18,469
its role in you know Hinduism and

527
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:21,200
Sikhism and Taoism in Buddhism and

528
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,690
Judaism and Christianity Islam and

529
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,350
Christianity in my arcades particularly

530
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,360
here on the western edge and you take a

531
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:32,119
look at these references to cannabis and

532
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:35,569
the way it was used it becomes as much

533
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:38,809
of a threat to fundamentalist religion

534
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:40,129
as Darwin's theory of evolution was to

535
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:42,799
the myths of Adam in the image of

536
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:47,240
creation in Genesis because it shows is

537
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:50,059
that the prophets of the Bible in this

538
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,160
case say Moses for example if we take a

539
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:54,619
look at the claims about the Hebrew term

540
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,130
kind of Boston being cannabis which have

541
00:24:54,619 --> 00:25:00,259
been around for about a century now you

542
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,790
take Moses and he's takes about nine

543
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:03,230
pounds of cannabis you know pitching in

544
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,389
but somewhere in cinnamon and some holy

545
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,710
oil and he places this on his body and

546
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,420
then he takes him in this oil and he

547
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,210
places it on the altar of incense it

548
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,430
goes outside the enclosed tent the place

549
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,350
of the meeting and he speaks to the Lord

550
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,810
of the pillar of smoke over that altar

551
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:19,939
of incense he becomes like a shaman

552
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,859
you know and Sharman's like in South

553
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,630
America and Africa today and just

554
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:25,490
executive plan actually interpreting

555
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,610
this is so going in my attention or

556
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,140
spiritualism you know a spiritual

557
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:31,969
possession or something like that and

558
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,040
this is something that these fundamental

559
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,110
religions have rallied against right

560
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,759
under they've come with

561
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:38,740
and we can see it is a medieval

562
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,740
Renaissance period of the cases of both

563
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,870
magic and alchemy and the church's

564
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,500
reaction to these things in the use of

565
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:49,719
plants and so it's a real fundamental

566
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,700
threat to it because it's like the first

567
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,159
hand experience show which is what they

568
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,740
don't offer and that's something they

569
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,190
try and suppress but it also reveals the

570
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:04,028
the originated rise to suppress honey

571
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:07,538
witchcraft stopping peyote and mushroom

572
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:12,398
adjusting religions and that so I think

573
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:15,250
it's very symbolic on a cultural level

574
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:17,619
you know yeah absolutely man it's it's

575
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,980
heavy for sure hopefully we don't have

576
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:23,288
too many more centuries of prohibition

577
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,610
and of this mentality of this group of

578
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:27,490
people that just seems to want to

579
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:29,589
prohibit this plant it just seems like a

580
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,769
great crime against humanity that has

581
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:34,808
gone on for centuries well you see what

582
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:36,159
it does get out how it blossoms you know

583
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:39,490
what I mean it's oh there must be like

584
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,230
over a hundred and fifty dispensaries

585
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,230
here in Vancouver and many of them are

586
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,899
thriving and people there are pleasant

587
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,809
and happy and all walks of life for

588
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:51,019
coming in and get

589
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:53,240
Canopus and there's almost like a

590
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:54,529
community center a type of atmosphere at

591
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,710
some of the

592
00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:00,139
people really do feel a connection over

593
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,660
this verb and it's one of the few things

594
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,870
in this world that we pass from hand to

595
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,150
hand like that and hand to mouth

596
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:09,949
in any sort of ways and it's kind of

597
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,960
like the people's natural communion you

598
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,090
know well I'll tell ya I certainly

599
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,890
experienced it at 4:20 this year with

600
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:17,480
the tens of thousands of people I don't

601
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,640
pretend to guess how many were there

602
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,160
some people say 20,000 some people say

603
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,410
50,000 some people say 100,000 there

604
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,090
were tens of thousands of people and

605
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,519
it's always such an incredible

606
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:31,639
experience on the stage watching

607
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:34,609
everyone light up right at 4:20 and see

608
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,830
this cloud of smoke rise up and it's

609
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:40,129
really quite a powerful thing I'm sure

610
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:43,279
that the same way that there is power in

611
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,770
in focus focused thought like prayer

612
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,539
yeah there you know that that's a ritual

613
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:49,879
right there you know I'm really lighting

614
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,980
up and all the positive vibes no one

615
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,960
getting hurt and no one fighting and no

616
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,960
one yeah if that was a beer garden

617
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,809
should we put it on fire well we know

618
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:08,120
that because it's happened during the

619
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:10,669
NHL city doesn't talk about because the

620
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,709
NHL pay for the the wreck of the city

621
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:16,730
but these you want to like cry the Blues

622
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:19,190
about what I said I saw a market posted

623
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,690
something recently in regards to how why

624
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,250
we need to still be able to do this

625
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,140
because it's it's that we're proud of

626
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,759
our culture yeah and it's the same way

627
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,920
pride is proud of their culture yeah

628
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,150
it's not illegal to be gay anymore but

629
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,370
it doesn't mean they can't still be

630
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,720
proud of their gay culture and they're
