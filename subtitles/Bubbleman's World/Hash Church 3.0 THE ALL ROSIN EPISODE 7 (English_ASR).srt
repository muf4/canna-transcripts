inspirational photos the stuff that gets

48
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,719
people's attentions usually that's the

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
people who are the most conscious in

50
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,878
regards to the growing of it and

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,800
creating the resin usually it's the

52
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,039
triome farmers you know if you're

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,840
growing cannabis for vegetative weights

54
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:19,878
and how much can I get and how fast can

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,800
I get it you're probably not in this

56
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,598
room right now and that's that's okay

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,040
we're not talking down on that at all

58
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,399
but this is a different game over here

59
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,519
when you're chasing the um the highest

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,519

62
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,039
from such products so I want to thank

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,680

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,640

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
don't know four or five years now uh

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,560
started kind of just growing in the LED

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,000
scene really didn't start in the and and

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,199
concentrate scene um I I was uh my wife

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,639
has has fibromyalgia which is uh which

101
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,238
is a uh basically just chronic pain if I

102
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,958
literally poke her sometimes she'll just

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,478
start crying because it it's it's so

104
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,560
extreme pain uh so flour just wasn't

105
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,039
cutting it you know we were going

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,240
through just a lot of flour and then the

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,800
lung issues that follow with that um you

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,918
know kind of made us move over into

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
looking into concentrates and whatnot of

110
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,038
course BHO was was big then so we tried

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,759
some BHO and it just you know it just

112
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,560
wasn't my deal I don't know I just

113
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,960
didn't enjoy it so I found myself going

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,439
back to flow got myself a hair

115
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,120
straightener got myself a 600 pound

116
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,918
clamp from from Home Depot uh pressed

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,600
some flour the first time and when I got

118
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,839
it when I got the the flower rosin it

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,479
was immediately I want better and I want

120
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,599
more and it just kind of be snowballed

121
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,719
from there um trying to get uh you know

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,000
better flow because I'm I'm generally

123
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,720
single Source I do watch for some

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,800
friends here and there but so it became

125
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,400
a a a a total trick to to grow the best

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,160
flow and and not just flour but I

127
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,279
consider myself a resin grower I I I

128
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,960
harvest and I and I grow resin glands

129
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,599
anymore um and and when you start when

130
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,799
you switch your mindset to that as a

131
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,439
hash maker Things become a little little

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,280
easier because you're you're you're

133
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,439
focused on for the most part that

134
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,038
glandular triome head and everything

135
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,639
follows suit from there so it was it was

136
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,159
a it was a game to try to find the best

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
flower the best Tricom head the juiciest

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,400
Tricom head because let's be honest not

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,319
all are made the same and uh from there

140
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,719
I I just started uh the freeze dryer

141
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,439
honestly changed the game with me on

142
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,000
Instagram when I when I bought purchased

143
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,079
a freeze dryer and started press in the

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,759
gold uh that i' that I've been pressing

145
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,318
for the last couple years so um it it

146
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,680
really really kind of uh woke everybody

147
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,360
up to the possibilities and uh and then

148
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,959
I started doing some online courses uh

149
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,240
for for for teaching uh hash and rosin

150
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,638
and let me preface by saying I don't

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,478
consider myself a hash maker for SE I

152
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,560
wash hash to make rosin there are hash

153
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,318
makers that wash hash for full melt hash

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,000
and my hats off to you guys I'm not that

155
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,160
guy um some of you in the house may be

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,439
both you may be six-star hash makers and

157
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,720
rousin makers and if I had two hats I'd

158
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,680
take them both off you know because

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,000
that's just more you know in the game so

160
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,560
that's who I am uh my myself I I smoke

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,918
pretty much recreationally although over

162
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,079
the years i' I've gained some more pain

163
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,598
and uh my anxiety and depression levels

164
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,079
and whatnot I think we've all kind of

165
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:43,038
went through some things like that um so

166
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,959
I I use it as a as a medication but it's

167
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,959
not necessarily for a singular ailment

168
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,719
for me it's just a better life choice

169
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,680
for me and that to me is is is a

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,840
medicinal use so I'm Pedro hi welcome

171
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
let's do this hey thanks for Sharon

172
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,799
Pedro I really appreciate it I've heard

173
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,960
uh some of that story before but I I

174
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,840
love it I love that you I love people

175
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,478
that come at this and don't get me wrong

176
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,279
I mean I came from it from another

177
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,279
perspective years ago where it was like

178
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,878
I just loved it I fell in love with it I

179
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,079
was using cannabis and then it was sort

180
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,160
of like I think I can use this to escape

181
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,279
the slave wage that I'm currently caught

182
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,680
in and create a reality that would maybe

183
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,598
allow me to also be with this plant all

184
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,680
the time but also sort of Escape that so

185
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,159
I I came into it also with a sort of

186
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,079
monetary touch in the background but I

187
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,039
always appreciate people who come in it

188
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,719
from

189
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,839
um from the health from the trying to

190
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,199
take care of you know family members and

191
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,719

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,759
Instagram it's nice to put a face with a

219
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,719
name um yeah just kind of got on

220
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,838
Instagram about a year and a half ago

221
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,519
before that I was just always doing my

222
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,760
own thing you know um hands-on

223
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,600
experience I don't like to read about it

224
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,838
I like to get my hands dirty and that's

225
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,759
pretty much how I learned growing since

226
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:53,560
I was 17 you know uh the prices of weed

227
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,399
went down so much to where it just

228
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,919
wasn't paying my bills anymore and I

229
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,159
kind of jumped into it well first you

230
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,799
know I saw I was into the butane a

231
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,958
little bit you know everybody was into

232
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,958
that a little bit we were all hitting it

233
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:10,518
on the hot nails and I liked the idea

234
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:12,278
you know of having that extract and all

235
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,959
it would ever do was choke you out at

236
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:18,600
that point because it was you know

237
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:24,799
unpurged BHO on a hot titanium nail

238
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:26,120
so the roots yeah exactly but anyways uh

239
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,559
once I actually saw the hair

240
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
straightener I think it was my

241
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,078
brother-in-law that showed me that I

242
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,399
thought he was joking at first you know

243
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:35,838
so just throw a nug in there with a hair

244
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,639
straightener and go at it um I think the

245
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,920
next day I bought a t-shirt press I

246
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,958
didn't quite ever do the hair

247
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,719
straightener I wanted to get that you

248
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,199
know t-shirt press right away and go a

249
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
little bigger so I kind of got into it

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,759
like that and and just learned a lot of

251
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,399
my tech on a t-shirt press honestly and

252
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,879
then went straight to the Long's Peak

253
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,000
which is a huge

254
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:01,000
difference and just been pressing and

255
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,519
you know refining skills but getting on

256
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,440
Instagram a year and a half ago was a

257
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,159
big thing too just to show my work and

258
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,480
to learn from a lot of other people I

259
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,958
was inspired you know rackams was doing

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,959
it a soil grown solvent list there's a

261
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,759
few people that caught my eye and just

262
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,399
being able to see their work as well and

263
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,399
see all the people you know doing the

264
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,639
same thing was

265
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,159
great I feel like you've taken it to the

266
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,838
next level though dude I think your

267
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,759
Donuts are amazing I'm really inspired

268
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,040
by those I love the way the different

269
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,439
the shapes that you're doing the molds

270
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,360
that you're playing with I think that

271
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,720
that's also uh I think that's Innovative

272
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,720
and I think believe it or not it might

273
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,360
seem like not much to you but I think

274
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,759
it's it's really quite something and

275
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,120
it's going to move Rosen you know when I

276
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,759
first saw the laser um that La laala was

277
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,799
doing where they were lasering like I

278
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,919
thought that was really cool but I I

279
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,278
really really like your methodologies of

280
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,399
coming out with the with the donuts and

281
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,200
with these different sort of you know

282
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,759
texture is everything at this point time

283
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,720
everything because we're extracting but

284
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,519
you you took it to the next level well

285
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,879
there's so many people out there making

286
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,679
you know fire hash fire rosin that it

287
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,759
was nice to set myself apart a little

288
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,679
bit and you know I'm all about quality

289
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,360
first I'm not trying to dress up a turd

290
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,000
you know it's all about the quality

291
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,320
first and then you could take that

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,519
little you know cooler approach with a

293
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,360
presentation no that's obvious it's

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,560
obvious that your stuff is quality but

295
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,720
it's also obvious that your stuff

296
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,638
doesn't look like anyone else's stuff

297
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,800
because you've managed to figure out to

298
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,120
do something just different enough yeah

299
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,919
that to me really caught my eye and I

300
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,440
just I give you two thumbs up to it I

301
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,479
hope we can talk about it a little bit

302
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,920
more later on when uh we're done going

303
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,480

304
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:51,000

306
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,759
sorry real quick I have to say that I'm

307
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,320
just a little disappointed that I

308
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,078
haven't seen uh a shot on Instagram yet

309
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,200
like an up close melt shot where

310
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,599
somebody drops an entire donut where the

311
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,720
hell is that shot

312
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,120
people it's coming it'll go into the

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,720
the hospital that's gonna be expensive

315
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680

00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,159
you in all of this yeah so we've been

326
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,879
you know consuming for a while but about

327
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,278
seven years ago we got real interested

328
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,639
in the organic food and growing

329
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,600
organically and being genetically

330
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,799
modified free and like real concerned

331
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,519
about that and then transitioned over

332
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,719
into our cannabis use and then we found

333
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,120
out it was real hard to come by or find

334
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,278
people that were concerned about those

335
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,799
things about seven years ago so we kept

336
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,600
looking trying to figure things out so

337
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,879
we moved to main three years ago and

338
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,000
considered had the same problem couldn't

339
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,559
find organic soil grown solventless

340
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,399
material like we wanted so we started

341
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,278
doing it ourselves uh we cook up growing

342
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,399
and we now run just 100% soil pots it's

343
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:18,240
all organically cultivated and mended by

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,919
H we we Brew our own tea and feed them

345
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,519
that and then we also do all our own

346
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,559
extractions washing and pressing nice we

347
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,360
use a Long Peak press we've had uh stuff

348
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,838
off you know hair straighteners and

349
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,079
everything else in between but for us

350
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,360
when we got into it we just wanted to

351
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,519
get what we wanted it was between a

352
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,959
Sasquatch and a Long's Peak but the

353
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,839
control of the Long's Peak is what won

354
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,958
us over and we've loved it ever since

355
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,160
we've been running it for about three

356
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,039
years now so and who are some of the

357
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,120
names that you could that sort of caught

358
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,319
your eye that really sort of got you we

359
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,360
got you on the list was you and then

360
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,199
soil grown solvent list for sure those

361
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,919
guys were like you know definitely

362
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,000
killing it I think first off and then

363
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,559
you know Sasquatch was car sharing a

364
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,440
bunch of stuff from all kinds of random

365
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,559
dudes out in Cali slitless mind was

366
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,800
always dropping great stuff and you

367
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,439
know kind of went from there and then I

368
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,399
think a bunch of the people in the room

369
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,120
kind of all came about around similar

370
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,440
times and kind of found everybody and I

371
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,919
think a bunch of us kind of been

372
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,600
following and chatting on you know

373
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:17,399
different levels for the last few years

374
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:22,399
now so it's awesome it's amazing it's

375
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:24,078
it's really um um this it it it's it's

376
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,480
Instagram that's really been able to

377
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,399
bring so many people together it's been

378
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,000
very unique in that sense that this

379
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,919
picture you know this simple app for

380
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,639
sharing pictures turned into this

381
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,559
incredible community of people on all

382
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,000
sides of cannabis from The Growers to

383
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,518
the organic Growers to the solvent

384
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,759
extractors to the solvent list

385
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,799
extractors it's been pretty incredible

386
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,720
to see it watch since just 10 years now

387
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,479
we've only had Instagram for 10 years

388
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,639
but it's really helped share this

389
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,639
information and inspire a lot of people

390
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,000
so thank you guys very much I guess uh

391
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,039

are you guys doing good to see y'all I

398
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,000
um I was trying to scroll back on my

399
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,120
Instagram to find the first photo that I

400
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,679
posted of uh me making

401
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,078
rosin but oh nice GNA take too long so

402
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,319
I'm not gonna do that um it was

403
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:29,439
2015 and it was flower rosin and I was

404
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:33,440
like holy [ __ ] you can make oil with 30

405
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,880
seconds with a nug and uh soil grown

406
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,440
solventless taught me on Instagram and I

407
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,720
saw him press a t-shirt press with a

408
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,720
bunch of buds on it with between

409
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,160
parchment and I was like oh my God what

410
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,639
the hell did just this just disrupted

411
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,639
everybody's uh business and uh changed

412
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,519
the

413
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,519
game um and so I was like all right so I

414
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,919
rolled a nug up and I did that and I was

415
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:59,799
like wow okay this like the hash rosin

416
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:02,599
would be even better right

417
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:06,000
um and uh you can you could just roll a

418
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,800
ball of hash in a 25 micron seve and

419
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,198
just go like that and see rosin just a

420
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,198
little bit come out the other side you

421
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:16,559
know so it's like clearly hash rosin is

422
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,519
is is better in my opinion but to each

423
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,359
his own um so yeah we figured that out

424
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,959
way back in the day that was like 2014

425
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,839
is we were probably all figuring that

426
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,559
out at the same time um yep I think that

427
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,759
was very much the year that it all sort

428
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:33,119
of blew up

429
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,000
right all yeah man and uh so I just I'm

430
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
for so everybody knows I'm my name's

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,198
Adam I I live in Humble County who's

432
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,720
been here about 10 years um yeah I I

433
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,039
just I don't have a big story or

434
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,560
anything but I used to work wash a bunch

435
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:52,519
of trim back in the day about 2012

436
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,719
2013 and then I met bio

437
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,198
Vortex uh was lucky enough to work with

438
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,800
his material and in in her nature on

439
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,359
Instagram and I just kind of rocked my

440
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,159
world just totally uh flipped it upside

441
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,120
down and showed me that you can um grow

442
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,319
cannabis without spraying pesticides and

443
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,078
fungicides and uh uh pay attention to a

444
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,720
healthy soil food web and um if you have

445
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:18,918
the space and time you know it's really

446
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,199
a efficient and uh so yeah I I I like to

447
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,160
make hash and rosin with um really clean

448
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,279
cannabis awesome that's what's up and we

449
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,880
appreciate having you here I have a

450
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,119
whole variety of people here day and you

451
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,640
know some people are like oh wow like uh

452
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,239
you know how do you get on it's like

453
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,038
well it's some people have been making

454
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
it for a very long time some people are

455
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,599
fairly new at it I love inviting a

456
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,720
variety of both I love having people

457
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,159
that are the so-called experts and have

458
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,798
been doing this since day one and

459
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,600
whatnot but I also love people who are

460
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,879
who are freshly into it and who are

461
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:56,000
fairly new into it but are the

462
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,799
Innovation P possibility for someone

463
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,319
who's new versus someone who's been

464
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:03,158
doing it forever to me is much higher

465
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,038
the possibility of someone who's coming

466
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:08,000
in new who's coming in fresh they've got

467
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,919
a different way of looking at it than

468
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,519
guys that like us who have been doing it

469
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,200
for so long sometimes we get a little

470
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,279
bit of the blinders on when we've been

471
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,279
doing this for a real long time and

472
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,798
that's why you always have to put a hand

473
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,158
out to the Next Generation coming up the

474
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,720
same way that the Giants of the

475
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,280
shoulders myself and others were able to

476
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,240
stand on they reached down their hand to

477
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,639
us we got to keep doing that for

478
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,079
everyone as well and I I I implore

479
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,360
people to not be afraid to make mistakes

480
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,558
when you're doing this because that's

481
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,399
where the Innovation comes from it's not

482
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,038
going to come from doing the same old

483
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,080
thing that you do all the time that's a

484
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,798
recipe that's dialed in over the course

485
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,678
of 10 or 15 years it's when you make a

486
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,519
mistake it's when you step out of your

487
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,159
comfort zone that you're gonna that some

488
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,879
of these Innovations are going to happen

489
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,880
and if you listen to soil grown

490
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,840
himself uh which maybe maybe now is a

491
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,760
good time for me to put that that video

492
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:05,319
on if I can if I can find it do you have

493
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,319
headphones somewhere what's

494
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,119
that did you say something Bo sorry

495
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,200
because it's gonna Reverb back to them

496
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,399
what's gonna Reverb

497
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,279
back I don't know if he's talking to me

498
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,679
or I'll just him for now yeah I think

499
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,879
he's talking to someone else so um yeah

500
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,240
let's keep going with the int

501
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,640
introductions I know a lot of more

502
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,440
people are going to talk about soil

503
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,159
grown and I have a really great clip of

504
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
soil grown but I want to listen to it

505
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,919

00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,479
hash for about 20 years um I've been

519
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:08,279
making rosin since it started to come on

520
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,120
the game um I grow my own cannabis where

521
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,440
everybody sort of started seeing me on

522
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:14,839
the Instagram world was in the borrow

523
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,600
scene uh I've been collecting borrow for

524
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:20,158
20 years as well 20 plus years as

525
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,079
well um yeah I don't know not much to

526
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,600
say I uh you know me and my wife we

527
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,240
cultivate our own cannabis and we wash

528
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,439
our own hash and we press it and we

529
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,400
share with our friends

530
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,919
and I don't have a very good picture I I

531
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,559
like your journey oh you have a very

532
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,080
good picture go on his Instagram there's

533
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,399
plenty of them I like the journey like I

534
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,678
like how you know you started you know

535
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,759
originally you were you were kind of

536
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,320
making some BHO too you were busting out

537
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,679
a little I I made a lot of B in my

538
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,879
lifetime yeah yeah not anymore my

539
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,240
machine just sits collecting dust you

540
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,440
know I what I've noticed from from Flav

541
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,359
is that when he was making BHO his herb

542
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,200
wasn't that good I'll be honest when he

543
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,158
did ditched making BHO and started going

544
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,558
down the full like I'm going to try and

545
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,400
make like H like full melt hash and like

546
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,558
great

547
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,080
rosin his herb just started getting

548
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,599
better and better and better and I mean

549
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,038
I already showed you guys you know his

550
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,879
whipped six-star bubble hash right here

551
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:22,919
that basically looks like rosin it's

552
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,840
some of the most beautiful bubblehash

553
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,080
I've ever I've ever had so Props to you

554
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,519
dude you're one of the people that has

555
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,678
been with willing to learn you know

556
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,679
sometimes people get into this

557
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,759
especially you I thought you know even

558
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,000
though you're a super humble guy you've

559
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,440
already had a position in the community

560
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,319
with your borrow collection that was way

561
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,159
way up and I saw you willing to go back

562
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:49,599
down and take each step that you needed

563
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,200
to take in your growing in your learning

564
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,480
and even now I mean with the Organic

565
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,960
Crop on the on the on the way like

566
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,278
that's another step that you're taking

567
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,440
looking to get past salt NES looking to

568
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,640
get into organic and regenerative and

569
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,159
living and I've just dude I've been

570
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,559
really impressed with your um with your

571
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,880
patience in the journey even though you

572
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:14,960
know so many people that are at so many

573
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,480
different levels you just took your

574
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,159
steps you never tried to jump above and

575
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,120
beyond what you were able to do and you

576
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:26,240
just took your steps and dude you like

577
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,359
made it to the six-star level is all

578
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,038
those are very kind words I thank you

579
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,519
yeah dude well it's a fact bro it's

580
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,640
easier to say them now that you've come

581
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,038
out the other end it would have been

582
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,038
harsh to throw you under the bus and

583
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:38,240
been like Flav just doesn't grow that

584
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,558
good of weed and uh you know like if I

585
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,960
said that three or four years ago but

586
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,798
the bottom line is you're growing great

587
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,919
herb you're making great concentrates

588
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,679
and I'm happy to have you here brother

589
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,520
thank you that kind of reminds me of um

590
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,840
I think Pedro

591
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,440
said um how he's grow grow mostly for

592
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,000
rosin and uh I I have to respectfully

593
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,880
disagree with him I think he's growing

594
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,798
for res because that rosin is going to

595
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,159
be even better if you're growing you

596
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,038
know what I mean so like I think that

597
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,360
Pedro every time he does it and he and

598
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:11,679
he smokes his rosin he's actually

599
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,199
stepping up his his resin game really

600
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,840
because your your rosin's only better if

601
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,679
your resin's is good you know it's only

602
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,519
as good as a resin exactly and you know

603
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,759
maybe I misspoke there but I definitely

604
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,359
meant to say that I was growing resin

605
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:28,839
for sure I agree 100% with

606
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,918
you all right we're gonna hear from time

607
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:32,199
hash churcher Colin from vessel life

608
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:33,720
science is going to give us a quick

609
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,278
little Lowdown on him and then we're

610
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,519
going to whip through the last uh eight

611
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:40,000
to nine people and get a full dialogue

612
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,400
going because I want to hear from all of

613
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,798
you thanks for having me brother

614
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,278
everyone can hear me all

615
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:51,000
right oh yeah perfect so my stories you

616
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:53,519
know I I it's a long one but I'll try to

617
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,880
keep it Cliff out um I started making

618
00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:01,359
hash in 99 um I met Marcus on on

619
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,440
overgrow and uh we you know I started

620
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:07,119
posting pictures and of hash and and

621
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,919
really going after making refined hash

622
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:13,038
um with the bag system and that led me

623
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,600
to you know two decades of going really

624
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,839
deep on genetic collection and

625
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,719
acquisition and growing thousands and

626
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,798
thousands of varieties to try to find

627
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:26,000
the perfect return and the perfect heads

628
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:28,398
to be be working with and you know I I

629
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,599
you know been making Ros that led to

630
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,000
rosin and you know that led to to where

631
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,038
I'm at now working in Massachusetts with

632
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,720
Happy Valley um and running the

633
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,919
solventless lab for them and designing

634
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,319
the lab out and really building the team

635
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,960
for us and you know just trying to keep

636
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,960
it as humble and as as precise as

637
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,278
possible while we uh you know build out

638
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,159
everything that we're doing here in Mass

639
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,278
but you know the one thing that I've

640
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,520
really been inspired by um over the

641
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:58,119
years is you know the different

642
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,960
varieties and the different flavors that

643
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:03,519
we get from hash and understanding what

644
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,120
carriers you know INF flavonoids pass

645
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,038
through the water and into your hash um

646
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,839
and and just selecting through varieties

647
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:14,558
that really work um so that's been a

648
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:16,839
been a passion of mine and um you know

649
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,839
it's it's been a long journey you know

650
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,918
it's it really has but I'm I'm very

651
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:23,199
thankful to uh to be where I'm at right

652
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,840
now you know it's it's it's been a long

653
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,159
time so I would only add that the photo

654
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,759
that you all shared on Instagram for

655
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:35,278
this this episode was uh seeds collected

656
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,798
bred grown processed and photographed by

657
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,519
Colin he's a man of many hats it's

658
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,679
beautiful picture of rosin there's no

659
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:47,319
doubt about it thanks dude we'll move on

660
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,399
um Great Lake sustainable dude you're

661
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:52,000
next Andy's in the house I can unmute

662
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:56,079
you

663
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,278
sweet hey I'm Andy great legs grease on

664
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:04,918
Instagram um and I started making rosin

665
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:08,839
when soil grown first posted his Tech uh

666
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,440
we pretty much uh a heavy ice RX and I

667
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,119
pretty much started squishing flowers

668
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,159
right away with a hair straightener no

669
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,199
clamp and then we figured out the clamp

670
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,720
Tech pretty quickly and then not short

671
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,640
after we started squishing some of our

672
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,000
hash um what I I I mean I remember the

673
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,038
first time trying flower rosin and one

674
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,519
thing that I remember for sure is uh

675
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:35,079
how different the effects were from Full

676
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:37,158
melt uh like because I had been making

677
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:40,480
full melt really good full melt already

678
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:42,360
for a few years and uh I remember trying

679
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,960
that first dab of flower rosin and it

680
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:48,678
was just it just had a different effect

681
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,440
on me it was it was uh it was just

682
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,399
different it it reminded me of almost

683
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:59,320
like the first time smoking cannabis

684
00:26:54,398 --> 00:27:01,798
almost um uh I do like hash rosin much

685
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:04,000
more than flower rosin um one of the

686
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,759
things I really like about flower rosin

687
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,159
is like

688
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,798
the the easiness of it as people have

689
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:15,600
already mentioned how how simple it is

690
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:18,119
to just take a nug and and squish it um

691
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,959
and a lot of times you can get with

692
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,000
really good flour you can get really

693
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,679
high yields with flour R and that's what

694
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,558
I really like about it in in for using

695
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,240
uh for capsules um so you can get viable

696
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,038
yields and it's really good in my

697
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,839
opinion for making capsules and that's

698
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:38,119
like my best use for it

699
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,879
um H hash

700
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:43,719
rosin

701
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,760
um I I F I mainly focus on making full

702
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,880
melt um but I but rosin is definitely

703
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:49,919
like a important part of the process for

704
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,120
me

705
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:58,640
because before before hash rosin really

706
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,879
uh you you know a hash maker

707
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,000
as hash makers know and some some people

708
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,159
don't know that you know some some of

709
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,079
the hash that you pull out of your bags

710
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,480
is not going to be melty some of the

711
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,798
strains you wash is not going to be

712
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,278
melty as others um different factors and

713
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:17,200
so it really plays an important role

714
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:19,919
when we have less melty hash and stuff

715
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,360
and we can for me at least I can get a

716
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,759
much better use out of that hash when I

717
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:28,719
rosin it and so I can have you know my

718
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,960
my full melt and rosin

719
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,720
uh the the Rosen hash that may not have

720
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,319
been as melty or as pure um so that's

721
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,000
really where I'm at I I love I love how

722
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:43,240
revolutionary of a tech it was I love

723
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:49,359
how quickly it took off uh I mean how

724
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:51,599
fun is it to watch uh this progress um

725
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:55,240
and that's really what I like about it

726
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:58,158
um simplic Simplicity

727
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,720
revolutionary and it just it just has a

728
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,360
a very important part plays a very

729
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,399
important part in my hash making I was

730
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,879
happy how it sort of and I don't I know

731
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,639
I'll take flak from this because I'll

732
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,559
probably say it the wrong way but how it

733
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,399
just

734
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,359
really it took a bite out of the BHO

735
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:17,839
scene like and I'm not talking about the

736
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,000
pros who are doing it right who have

737
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,678
degrees in chemistry and understand

738
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,960
what's going on I'm talking about high

739
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,159
school kids I'm talking about young

740
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,519
people who were blowing up who were

741
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,440
having all sorts of problems who blew Ro

742
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,679
their roofs off and set their houses on

743
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:37,000
fire there's blew their hands off like a

744
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:39,880
lot of bad [ __ ] like before B accidents

745
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,720
I can honestly say the worst thing about

746
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,039
cannabis was the DEA they were by far

747
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,159
the worst thing about cannabis but then

748
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:51,679
BHO came into the picture and I was like

749
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,320
damn like this [ __ ] is killing people

750
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,559
and I know it was like not an over you

751
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,398
know like 50 people a day but it was it

752
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,480
was people were definitely being

753
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,319
affected in a negative way and I because

754
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,000
I was the water has guy a lot of them

755
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:08,359
would reach out to me after they blew up

756
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,960
after they got burnt and I ended up

757
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:13,240
making friends with quite a few people

758
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,519
who blew themselves up making dho

759
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,159
because they didn't understand the

760
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,519
heaviness of the gas they didn't

761
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,960
understand that their cell phones and

762
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,960
other electronics spark invisibly that

763
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,720
you can't perceive that spark and I just

764
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,640
thought that Rosen was the most

765
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,319
incredible replacement and not only that

766
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,840
it was just as cheap like you know a

767
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,359
couple of cans of butane okay well a $10

768
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,519
hair straightener from Walmart like one

769
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:38,639
of the mini ones like what Nick was

770
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,960
originally using that soil grown saw him

771
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,759
use was one of those small tiny little

772
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,440
little little hair straighteners so it

773
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:50,000
was a pretty incredible thing to be able

774
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,360
to put into the hands of the of the

775
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,200
younger generation to be like here's a

776
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:57,678
way for you to test you know what if

777
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,880
they say that's 23% THC squish a gram

778
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,440
you should get more than 0.23 back with

779
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,559
simple math that was a nice power to put

780
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,000
into people's hands to be able to check

781
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:08,638
the quality to be able to see if

782
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,079
something that wasn't supposed to be in

783
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:13,278
that plant like something sprayed maybe

784
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:15,480
maybe a sulfur for powdery Milo or

785
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,079
something else well when you concentrate

786
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,278
that into a into a dab you'll know

787
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,158
immediately it was an incredible

788
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,960
methodology that appeared for

789
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,559
dispensaries and compassion clubs to be

790
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,038
able to test flower that was coming in

791
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,079
right away with someone who had a

792
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:32,000
sensitive bioassay ability and a hair

793
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,079
straightener and a and a rig right then

794
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,359
and there so I uh I like that point and

795
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,319
I want to talk about it a little more uh

796
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,678
but now I got to move on to the ne wow

797
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:44,200
it totally shifted and now it's all in a

798
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,480
different order so you know what we'll

799
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,000
go to heavy ice because uh I know you

800
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,558
guys are close and he's got a cat and

801
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,519
nobody else does so he uh he wins how's

802
00:31:52,558 --> 00:32:00,119
it going buddy C going good how you

803
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:03,638
doing uh well as Andy said uh and as

804
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:08,599
everybody else said 2014 was the year um

805
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:11,240
I had I had a uh my first outdoor crop

806
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,839
um in the freezer because I didn't have

807
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,120
any hashing experience then either and

808
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:19,398
uh it it didn't hash as fresh

809
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:22,239
frozen so I had a whole freezer full of

810
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,558
Blue Dream and uh from my first outdoor

811
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,558
crop and couldn't do anything with it

812
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,839
and saw soil grown do the pressing and

813
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:33,359
like went on Amazon that night and

814
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:35,079
ordered those like mesh drying racks and

815
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,199
took all the fresh frozen out of the

816
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:40,000
bags that had been in there for months

817
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,798
already put it on the drying screens and

818
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,440
and let it all dry out and trimmed it up

819
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:48,158
a little bit and you know I we made a

820
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,360
couple ounces I think of of Blue Dream

821
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,159
flower rosin back then and uh yeah that

822
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,398
that sold it for me you know we had a

823
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,960
couple little chunks of hash either from

824
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,278
the blue dream or from some other the

825
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,000
other plants that I grew and uh it was

826
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,960
amazing just to wrap up those little

827
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
little tiny balls and some 25 micron

828
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,798
mesh and get the hair straightener out

829
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,038
and squeeze it out and you had you had

830
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:16,918
like oil you had straight up oil that

831
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:19,119
was as good or better than the BHO I'd

832
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,799
been spending all my disability money on

833
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,000
at the

834
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:26,319
dispensary so yeah we just went from

835
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,278
there and uh my my focus has still

836
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,119
always been to make good hash but as

837
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:33,798
Andy said um you know if you grow a

838
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,359
whole pack of seeds and you have six

839
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:37,480
different females or eight different

840
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,759
females and you don't have a feno hunt

841
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,519
time you're still going to wash all

842
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,599
those all those plants but they might

843
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,798
not all be melty and rosin hash rosin

844
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:52,319
just made it so that you could really

845
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:54,398
make use of of all that hash still um

846
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,918
even if it was subpar taste for for

847
00:33:54,398 --> 00:34:00,158
dabbing you could you could put the oil

848
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,799
right in some coconut oil for capsules

849
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,159
and it was just everything just kind of

850
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,839
made sense like it was all part of a

851
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,039
process that already existed in the

852
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,159
universe and we were just we were just

853
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,039
going oh yeah that yeah we should do it

854
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,000
like

855
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:20,119
that you became aware that's what I

856
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,079
noticed awareness it's an awareness yeah

857
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:26,440
exactly so uh yeah this that's pretty

858
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:29,639
much it um the the Blue Dream back then

859
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,918
uh some how I think maybe John Bell had

860
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,760
been looking at my pictures on Facebook

861
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:38,598
or Instagram and uh had the Cannabis

862
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,800
culture people use one of my photos for

863
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,000
uh one of their articles and that was

864
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,679
one of the first bumps in my Instagram

865
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,679
career as well is as when that got

866
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,280
posted they had my name in there and so

867
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,240
I got you know a few thousand new

868
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,919
followers and that just made everything

869
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,918
more interesting you know to keep

870
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,440
posting information and cool pictures

871
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,400
because it got more people on board and

872
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,519
you know got more people interested in

873
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,039
solvent lists and in organic growing and

874
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,679
all the things I was trying to do and

875
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,279
focus on so uh yeah it all just kind of

876
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,598
spiraled from there well you become

877
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,760
aware you put a megaphone on that

878
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,359
awareness through your growing your

879
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,680
selections uh your processing the

880
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,598
pictures of the resin that becomes

881
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:25,000
exposed to this group of people and then

882
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,280
the Johnny bees you know they pick them

883
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,199
out and it ends up uh it's quite it's

884
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,960
it's quite a neat thing to see how the

885
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:35,639
community grows it's like wildfire and

886
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,280
flow rosin I think I prefer full Micron

887
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:41,000
uh full Micron uh rosin that's what

888
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,359
flower rosin is it's uh it's all the

889
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,320
microns well and it's also maybe some

890
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,838
Tricom types that you don't get when you

891
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,480
just hash it first oh I can promise you

892
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:53,199
there are they're called bulbous

893
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:56,240
tricomes not separate or isolate easily

894
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:59,199
or sometimes at all with uh mechanical

895
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,358
screen separation so so it's why you get

896
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,639
a different high in flower rosin and

897
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,318
it's why you get um different yields

898
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:07,639
when you make oil versus when you make

899
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:10,920
half boy you could earmark that topic

900
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:13,719
for conversation in this show uh the

901
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,838
difference between separating your hash

902
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:18,039
in screens and then pressing it or

903
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,799
dropping it all into the 45 bag like I

904
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:24,079
do and pressing it yeah whole Micron all

905
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,760
right so let's see we went through oh

906
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,440
Chris damn it damn it Bobby it's your

907
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,599
turn brother

908
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,679
hey how you doing does anyone else like

909
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,280
the guy from like King of the Hill say

910
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:37,039
that when you read his name or is it

911
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,280
just me I hope so that's kind of why I

912
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:43,239
did it um I totally get

913
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,440
that welcome well welcome Dude tell us

914
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,439
uh tell us how how things are and what

915
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,519
you're yeah thank you um yeah I started

916
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,599
in Texas obviously where the name came

917
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,119
from um Squish and flower rosin uh

918
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,200
because I was sick of smoking all the

919
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,200
BHO that was in the area super expensive

920
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,838
and just horrible you know um learned

921
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,799
about squishing flower rosing through

922
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:07,440
soil grown and you know just like

923
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,680
everyone else wanted more and wanted

924
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,760
better so after getting in out of

925
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,799
trouble in Texas a bunch moved out to

926
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,800
the Portland Oregon area and started

927
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,160
pursuing making hash um it took a little

928
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,280
while was in and out of just working at

929
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,559
dispensaries was a pury manager for one

930
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,760
for a little while and then landed with

931
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,440
a company in you know Battleground

932
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,720
Washington and started making solving

933
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,720
this hash with them after a little a

934
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:32,000
while uh and that was all strictly for

935
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:33,559
Rosen they weren't doing any you know

936
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,760
melt or anything like that it was all

937
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:38,599
production for rosin so that's kind of

938
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,640
Where it All Began There Was You Know

939
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,480
working in the legal Market making rosin

940
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,039
there um at the same time we were doing

941
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,480
a hoop house me and a good buddy of mine

942
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,838
um and uh we took that down and washed

943
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,280
it ourselves and from then on out I

944
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,759
switched and started working with

945
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,760
archive in Portland Oregon uh Burnside

946
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,880
Garden Collective is the garden that I

947
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,480
wash for um in Port Oregon and yeah we

948
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,440
uh right now we're making a lot of raw

949
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,119
in there as well we make a lot of full

950
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,880
melt um everything single

951
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,640
Source um yeah you make flower rosin as

952
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,200
well oh I did back in Texas when that

953
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:18,000
was all I could get you know was as an

954
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:20,519
option no not anymore they we smoke

955
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,679
pretty much just full Mel um I smoke

956
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,838
some rosin every now and then it's

957
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,960
really nice too um but I do prefer

958
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,078
smoking

959
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,240
resin um but since I've been having to

960
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,880
focus on making rosin so much over the

961
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:33,479
last three years that's been you know

962
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,200
it's kind of been refined big time you

963
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,800
know um we do the cold C process over

964
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:39,399
there and that's kind of how we sell all

965
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,280
our Ros and we don't release any fresh

966
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,720
press either although we we do have some

967
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,640
that we could release it's just right

968
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:49,679
now we kind of prefer to do the cold

969
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:51,078
cure um it's it's received well you know

970
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,598
well maybe we can talk about that if

971
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,880
it's not proprietary later if it is no

972
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,160
worries I don't want anyone to be

973
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,519
uncomfortable with anything but uh it's

974
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,879
great it's always nice to share

975
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,318
techniques you know well you know what I

976
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,079
always think of it like this the same

977
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:06,960
way it's always nice to share cuts and

978
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,359
people are like when people say like

979
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,199
well you know you got to like vet them

980
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:12,159
and see if they're you know like I'm

981
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,239
like you got to vet someone for a cut

982
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,799
well you know they might not be

983
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:17,559
deserving I'm like not be deserving like

984
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,119
we look at things differently because I

985
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,519
look at it like what if you gave some

986
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:25,400
like oh just a piece of [ __ ] like a

987
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:28,079
really nice Cut but somehow someone that

988
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,880
piece of [ __ ] knew really needed that

989
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,400
cut maybe even a small child with

990
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,079
epilepsy or something it's like get past

991
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,880
your own ego of sharing a cut or some

992
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,440
techniques uh you know doesn't mean

993
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,440
everything I get it if someone spent

994
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,480
like millions of dollars and paid phds

995
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,880
they bred a cultivar over the course of

996
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,719
nine years I definitely would not be

997
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,960
trying to shame those people into

998
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:56,559
sharing a cut but gez most of these cuts

999
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,519
are just uh regurgitated and passed

1000
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,078
along and then controlled people feel

1001
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:03,358
the power is in holding it and I told I

1002
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,920
told Jason King this years ago when I

1003
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,759
asked him if he could turn me on to how

1004
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,960
to do macro photography and he was like

1005
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,720
yeah I'll show you how to do macro

1006
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,599
photography as soon as you show me how

1007
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:16,078
to like manufacture and sell Bubble Bags

1008
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,760
worldwide like he was upset that I asked

1009
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,200
him like really upset and I was like all

1010
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,200
right dude like you're going to be the

1011
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:24,239
guy that kept me from learning about

1012
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,799
macro photography so then I went online

1013
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,039
to overgrow and there was this guy

1014
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,480
monkey and another guy perhaps your

1015
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:33,318
giddy Aunt from back in the late 90s who

1016
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,079
were just so kind they told me what lens

1017
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:38,719
to get what flash to get what settings I

1018
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,119
might want to put it on initially um and

1019
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:44,078
just helped me in a way that to this day

1020
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,318
I've I've I've shared every single thing

1021
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,280
I know about macro photography the

1022
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,279
equipment the settings everything that I

1023
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,839
could share because I didn't want to be

1024
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,800
that guy when this story got told that

1025
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,119
was on the wrong side of history that

1026
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,318
went fear and scarcity and decided oh I

1027
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,358
can't share this in the end Jason king

1028
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,358
is not known for macro photography his

1029
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:08,759
macro photography petered right out

1030
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:11,078
after basically I asked him he stopped

1031
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,880
doing it and he could have been the guy

1032
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:16,160
that was getting like oh and then Jason

1033
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,920
king showed me the way so I appreciate

1034
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,078
all of you for that very reason you guys

1035
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,800
share a lot of information and it's uh

1036
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,800
it's important people need it and uh the

1037
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,039
key to this is all of you are mentioning

1038
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,760
soil grown today

1039
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,079
I know and I've invited a man and I'm

1040
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,440
texting him while we're talking hoping

1041
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,599
that he'll come in because I know it

1042
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,358
would make him very happy to see what a

1043
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,760
little what a what a wildfire he set

1044
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:43,759
Ablaze and there were people that he

1045
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,960
propped uh before him but he was really

1046
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,760
this key point that allowed everyone to

1047
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,880
start thinking about something that they

1048
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,839
otherwise didn't know it wasn't in their

1049
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,480
minds and now you've got innovators

1050
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:57,239
you've got people doing different things

1051
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,039
and it's it's it's pretty incredible so

1052
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:02,719
so Props to all of you and uh after

1053
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:06,318
Bobby it's going to be uh Brian at best

1054
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:08,759
friend Farms how you doing

1055
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,960
brother ah doing well thanks for having

1056
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,599
me

1057
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,720
on um definitely excited to join in and

1058
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,039
just share and learn it's been really

1059
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,598
great the Instagram thing I started

1060
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,599
actively a little longer a few years ago

1061
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,119
but I actively got into it less than two

1062
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,318
years ago and that's kind of how I met

1063
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:30,160
everyone here more knowing who some

1064
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:34,358
characters were of course

1065
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:37,039
and yeah so just I guess with rosin it

1066
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:39,679
was probably four plus five up to five

1067
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:42,119
years ago four I'd say where we were

1068
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,598
squishing with a flower or flower with

1069
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:46,039
the hair iron as well and then it was

1070
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,400
just a really quick step into the

1071
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:52,279
sasquash actually and I worked my role I

1072
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,680
guess has been even the whole time even

1073
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,720
now more actively with the cultivation

1074
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,558
but more from the seed breeding

1075
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:01,159
angle where I'm picking out those what

1076
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,040
we were talking about for hash plants

1077
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,920
for bubble making these days and getting

1078
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,039
a list running um we're just now

1079
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,680
stepping into the Rosen here more for

1080
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:14,358
fresh frozen from hash Rosen um I don't

1081
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:16,159
know I could talk a lot about a bunch of

1082
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:18,239
the things on the way up here but we're

1083
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,960
we're basically stepping into it now

1084
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:23,318
locking into certain cultivars and

1085
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,039
really I'm looking almost like

1086
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,960
intricately for the cultivars now gas

1087
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:31,519
mask is the recent one that I BR that

1088
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,960
were just having amazing results and

1089
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,559
kind of started working with that trying

1090
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,199
to whip the bubble off the gas mask is

1091
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,079
what started that whipping the bubble

1092
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:42,719
for the bubble cream and truthfully I

1093
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,000
kind of like the bubble cream even more

1094
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,000
than the rosin for the even for my own

1095
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,639
personal

1096
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,079
music one sec I'm GNA mute that mic I

1097
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:53,759
just got to find it there's a lot of

1098
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,760
people in there

1099
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,279
oh so you started whipping the bubble

1100
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,358
thing you were one of the first people

1101
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,240
to do

1102
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,358
that I don't know if I'm one of the

1103
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:05,959
first I just kind of started this resin

1104
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,960
doesn't want to behave and like other

1105
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,880
resin on the gas mask it's like I would

1106
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,559
compare it to what I used to see for a

1107
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,519
super snow dog was actually what threw

1108
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,800
down this fresh Frozen bubble that was

1109
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,599
just white cream and you honestly

1110
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,519
couldn't do much with it it was like

1111
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,359
leave it alone get it as small as you

1112
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,079
could leave it alone and the gas mask

1113
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:27,838
has been that way too where we're taking

1114
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,400
different angles for leaving the fresh

1115
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:33,239
frozen we're kind of leaving it a little

1116
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,800
bigger chunk for the two we air dry I'm

1117
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:38,919
always doing a two we air dry and same

1118
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,920
as this bubble cream actually I think I

1119
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,680
might have pulled this one out at about

1120
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,960
10 to 12 Days on the dry this one again

1121
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:50,759
here this is almost a month on Aging

1122
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:55,079
here after it got in there and

1123
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:57,520
then I just show the rosin or

1124
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,359
actually this is the newest batch of

1125
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:03,000
bubble cream and it's a little harder

1126
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:05,838
consistency egg Yol you kind of custard

1127
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,719
or fudge on that one so I don't know

1128
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,960
interesting how each batch of resin is

1129
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:11,799
different and we're you know tweaking it

1130
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,199
a little bit that was a five minute pull

1131
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,599
right there the one I showed before the

1132
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:19,519
older is about a 20 minute wash I'd say

1152
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:13,039
point I appreciate that I did a podcast

1153
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:14,838
uh with the hashian about a month or two

1154
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,239
ago after I did a class and he kind of

1155
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:19,000
brought up the same thing and I was like

1156
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,358
man I I don't I don't really think so

1157
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,880
but I appreciate it it's have been a

1158
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:26,358
long like seven eight years or so and uh

1159
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,960
yeah man it's been a great ride but as

1160
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:32,358
far as um um you know the how I got into

1161
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,000
rosin um you know there was accidents

1162
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,880
and stuff you know like we would press

1163
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,880
out like your you brought up Nick would

1164
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,358
use like a a hair straightener and you

1165
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,640
know put bubble between two pieces you

1166
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:44,719
know a piece of parchment or whatever

1167
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,480
and flatten it and flag it out and so we

1168
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,118
would do that sometimes but forget the

1169
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,960
hair straightener was on too hot or

1170
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,599
whatever and press it super hard and it

1171
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,079
would kind of separate the oils out a

1172
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:55,680
little bit from the hash in the middle

1173
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,440
and be like wow that's that's cool but

1174
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,919
we kind of [ __ ] up our Slack a little

1175
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,358
bit you know but uh and then you know we

1176
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,599
saw it a few weeks months later um on

1177
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,679
hash church right here I think me and

1178
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:11,760
jibs were on um yeah me and jibs were on

1179
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:14,199
watching and you could barely see soil

1180
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,319
grown he was like I think Standing On

1181
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:20,439
Top of the uh t-shirt press to get as

1182
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:22,639
much pressure as he could um to get all

1183
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,720
the is as much out as he could so that

1184
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,118
that was really cool um we had a light

1185
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:30,799
bulb go off right when we saw that and

1186
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,960
um as far as jibs and I we ran a a uh

1187
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,480
hash company in Colorado medical and

1188
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,838
recreational um called the melts Tricom

1189
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,920
heavy extracts and uh he still operates

1190
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:43,480
that in Northern California but anyways

1191
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,079
we had all this 25u and 45u that was

1192
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,119
just sitting there you know when we we

1193
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,920
had no idea what to do with it and it

1194
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,039
wasn't selling so we're like oh my god

1195
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,039
let's put this between a a screen and

1196
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:56,480
press this and it was just a Eureka

1197
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:58,239
moment and I really think you know soil

1198
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,240
ground I wish she was on like you said

1199
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,879
and I've wanted to always thank him

1200
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,318
personally for just like man that was

1201
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,240
such a huge huge thing for not only my

1202
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:09,440
business but for obviously this scene in

1203
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:12,118
this community so that's kind of how I

1204
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,119
got started and um I deal mostly with

1205
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:19,559
hash rosin um I like a lot of people

1206
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:21,960
here and um got inspired by Bubble Man

1207
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,640
and other people to make full melt hash

1208
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,960
and that's kind of what I focus on and

1209
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,558
uh anything that's not full melt or

1210
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,440
things like that and even if it is full

1211
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,680
melt I'll press it and to see what I can

1212
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,880
really what gold I can get out of it um

1213
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:39,480
the consumers and patients here I I feel

1214
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:43,920
in Colorado are very picky and specific

1215
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,760
um so um we try and put out every type

1216
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,240
of

1217
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,599
consistency um I own and run a company

1218
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:54,118

1299
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:26,318
didn't see that guy for 15 years and I

1300
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:29,159
just bumped into him probably six months

1301
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:31,239
ago for the first time I I saw him face

1302
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:32,879
to face and we got to share a dab and

1303
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:34,679
and hang out for a little bit he is a

1304
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,000
really that's crazy so cool that you

1305
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:39,960
would mention him no doubt yeah so no

1306
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,480
just growing's been my passion you know

1307
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,599
I've been trying to just I've been

1308
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,480
seeking out that true turp from Harvest

1309
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:50,318
we all smell it we all wanted it and uh

1310
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,400
back to my friend giving me that Rosen

1311
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,440
dab I knew right then that was the way

1312
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,760
you know it was the first time I've ever

1313
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,519
actually tasted what I I seed out the

1314
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,880
Harvest and are you are you growing

1315
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:04,559
organically or are you uh yeah we're all

1316
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,400
organic uh we actually just got our farm

1317
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:10,839
started so we'll be single Source here

1318
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:14,039
in Oregon um so we're pretty stoked uh

1319
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:15,960
organic's been the only way I've grown

1320
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,239
for the last 10 years I started with

1321
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,679
some Advan I started with Advanced

1322
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:23,318
Nutrients like most of us you know I let

1323
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:25,558
the marketing kind of you know get me uh

1324
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:29,000
the stores you know that's quite a jump

1325
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:31,480
from uh Advan nutrients to full organic

1326
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,519
I was lucky to meet a guy James Bowman

1327
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,318
here in the Applegate Valley that just

1328
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:39,239
knew exactly what to do he used all all

1329
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:42,838
his he was growing from the land man um

1330
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:46,078
you know he had goats llamas chickens so

1331
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:49,920
he was able to teach us how to you know

1332
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,640
grow consciously basically um so ever

1333
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,599
since then that's all I've been able to

1334
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:57,118
really like grow towards is being better

1335
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:59,720
at that and um

1336
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,838
um yeah the resin the resin's just

1337
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:03,558
better that way I think we're all

1338
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:06,318
starting to figure that out um Sun grown

1339
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:08,920
is something I believe in so that's what

1340
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,400

1363
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,798
Goldilocks you're next in the the tune I

1364
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:06,480
can unmute you maybe I can't it's weird

1365
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:10,239
how I can unmute some folks but others I

1366
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,639
I had to I had myself muted all right so

1367
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:15,358
yeah um kind of same story as everybody

1368
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,039
else you know just uh gotten into the

1369
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:21,318
rosin really because we like smoking

1370
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:24,400
hash at the time and uh started pressing

1371
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:27,279
hash into rosin started doing a little

1372
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,880
flower uh rosin

1373
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,359
uh moved up to you know pressing and

1374
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,720
doing all that but for for the beginning

1375
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:36,038
it was always just for ourselves you

1376
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,759
know that's that's why I think that the

1377
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:41,319
rosin's so much different than all the

1378
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,240
other areas you don't really find many

1379
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:45,199
hash makers that like aren't smoking

1380
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,719
their product and like know exactly what

1381
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,598
they're putting out where like in a lot

1382
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,558
of other in areas of cannabis you'll see

1383
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,599
people like don't really even smoke

1384
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:57,519
their own product and um that's suspect

1385
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,599
at best

1386
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,960
yeah I think that's what's cool about

1387
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,440
rosin though is like nobody there you

1388
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,119
don't you won't find that in the hash

1389
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,079
game you know um and another thing I

1390
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,000
love about the the hash and the rosin

1391
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,920
like you were saying earlier is like

1392
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,920
there's no lying about your your flower

1393
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,680
at that point once you wash your hash

1394
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,798
and put it into rosin like you're seeing

1395
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,399
all if you're spraying things if you're

1396
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,759
doing gnarly stuff to your plants that's

1397
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,519
coming out for sure in the rosin and um

1398
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,559
I just like that purity of getting it

1399
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:31,880
down to like it's basis and I dab like

1400
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,760
heavy everybody that I'm around all the

1401
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,720
time we dab you know so like it's always

1402
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,520
constantly about getting the

1403
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:40,239
trippiest rosin that we want that we

1404
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:42,358
want to physically smoke and then trying

1405
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:45,118
to put that out on like a large scale

1406
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:48,318
now so yeah you guys aren't pressing

1407
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,720
grams over there no definitely not but

1408
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,038
we definitely started doing that you

1409
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:53,558
know just like everybody else yeah

1410
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,319

00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:21,838
in my life like that awkward high and me

1447
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:24,358
and Andy just hit it off had a great

1448
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:28,318
time and from there on out I saw it out

1449
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:30,318
to start making Buble hash and uh then

1450
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,558
the rosin came out with soil grown

1451
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,599
solence just like every one of us and uh

1452
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,000
just just started from there and then

1453
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:39,680
the jam Tech came out with a what was

1454
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,599
his name who put out the whole Tech on

1455
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:46,000
the jam but he's not really out there

1456
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:48,200

1457
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,639
Funk put out that whole story on the jam

1458
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:53,199
Tech I came became obsessed with that

1459
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:55,199
till I got that right and then I found

1460
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,519
the the consumers weren't really once

1461
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,159
the cold cure came came out the

1462
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:01,639
consumers wanted the cold cure over the

1463
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:04,759
jam so started doing that that's

1464
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:06,318
basically what I do now and then I uh I

1465
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,520
make a lot of diamonds with the TPS

1466
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,239
separating the turps and thca mechanical

1467
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:11,440
separation people seem to like that over

1468
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,000

01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,960
we're like man we we need something to

1605
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,159
make this better you know and I I was

1606
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,000
like well we need a filter that's really

1607
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:09,358
what it is it's just a filter is what we

1608
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,358
need and he's like I got a filter and he

1609
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:14,639
ran into his hash lab and grabbed the 25

1610
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:17,759
micron pressing screen and the rest is

1611
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:20,199
history man we we pressed up some you

1612
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,760
know six-star out of four star at that

1613
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:25,000
point you know it was it was amazing so

1614
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,680
yeah turn it to just get the oil out

1615
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,599
right it definitely was an amazing thing

1616
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:32,879
it still is an amazing thing after that

1617
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:35,880
episode there was not a company selling

1618
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,358
a Rosen press but after the ra the hash

1619
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,680
Church episode 25 that he came on and

1620
01:05:38,358 --> 01:05:43,798
talked about it there were machines like

1621
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:46,558
denail had a machine like a week or two

1622
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:48,759
later it was a just a t-shirt press with

1623
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,359
with an additional heater on the on the

1624
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,760
top as well as the bottom and then you

1625
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,480
know sasquash stepped it up and came out

1626
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,760
we're welders we know how to do this

1627
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,000
they they built a solid unit that thing

1628
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,278
was like

1629
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,440
Untouchable and you know pure pressure

1630
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:05,880
coming out you know after that with this

1631
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:09,079
incredibly engineered unit that had all

1632
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:11,880
of these features and emergency stops

1633
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:13,519
and plate controls and whatnot we'll get

1634
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,519
into that soon when we talk to those

1635
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:18,038
guys I want to finish the uh

1636
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:21,599
introductions off we have one left we

1637
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:23,880
have uh Mark over at covert extracts you

1638
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,359
are the last one and then I'll go

1639
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,440
through uh the companies that made it I

1640
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:31,199
don't think sasquash made it I'll see if

1641
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,679

1642
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:33,679
hear from

1643
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:40,839
them oh right they said they had really

1644
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:43,119
bad service and their internet might be

1645
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:45,119
too slow to join so that might be What's

1646
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,240
happen with them Mark are you there from

1647

about that I'm just uh kind of figuring

1655
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:06,358
out this whole Zoom thing so oh don't

1656
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:09,440
worry about it dude but um yeah I

1657
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:14,159
started growing um probably back like in

1658
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:17,200
the say the mid to late 90s and um been

1659
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:19,159
growing on and off ever since then um

1660
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:22,960
I've been growing like steadily for

1661
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:26,598
probably the past 10 years and um you

1662
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,960
know I really uh I first seen rosin I

1663
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:32,640
think on YouTube I want to say I'm not

1664
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:36,480
really sure who I first seen it from but

1665
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:38,078
uh it was it was on YouTube and and then

1666
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,838
I and then I you know got an Instagram

1667
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,880
page and I found you know soil grown

1668
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:45,239
solving L and uh solving this mind and

1669
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:50,039
um you know that's where I really

1670
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:53,759
started getting into it and uh now I uh

1671
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:56,839
now I make rosin pretty much um I make a

1672
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:00,359
lot of a lot of single Source but I also

1673
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:02,960
uh um make stuff for our team over at

1674
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:04,639
ghost budster farm and that's who we're

1675
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,798
going to be going into the legal Market

1676
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:09,598
with going forward and um yeah that's

1677
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:13,278
pretty much it I mean we uh you know I

1678
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:17,199
make a brzin kind of like

1679
01:08:13,278 --> 01:08:19,000
this kind of like that looks great fire

1680
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,318
fire yeah this is uh this was made with

1681
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,920
no oven I was kind of like trying to

1682
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:26,600
find a way to make the like sauce

1683
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,279
consistency with no OV and I found out

1684
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,640
that if you press with just a little bit

1685
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:32,759
higher temperature and you know just a

1686
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,838
quick press and then throw it onto the

1687
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:37,880
mats um you can get the same consistency

1688
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:40,119
as uh as the oven without without

1689
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,199
actually cooking it for a long time well

1690
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:43,318
that's going to be a lot of what we're

1691
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:46,399
talking about today is consistency and

1692
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:48,319
techniques and methodologies of creating

1693
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,838
these you know obviously the resin

1694
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,920
itself has its

1695
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:55,880
own subtle nuances and factors that are

1696
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,399
at play but within those you know all of

1697
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,119
these different methodologies that can

1698
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,838
bring us these different textures is I

1699
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:03,198

extracts you know like making them and

1741
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:57,399
all that [ __ ] I didn't even know much

1742
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,760
about like I I loved hash I remember

1743
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:02,198
going back to Amsterdam in like 2009 and

1744
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,800
falling in love with bubble but you know

1745
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:05,759
I didn't really know much about it so I

1746
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,520
just kind of like fell in love with

1747
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,199
concentrates out here and all I knew

1748
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:13,000
about was BHO learning how to build uh

1749
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:14,919
to blast in all that [ __ ] totally the

1750
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,920
wrong path you know later on down the

1751
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:20,719
road I [ __ ] up promised my family I'd

1752
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:23,840
never do it again and then uh one of my

1753
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:25,439
buddies had told me about [ __ ] water

1754
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,079
hash and [ __ ] so I started like

1755
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,839
researching on it and you know seeing

1756
01:11:27,079 --> 01:11:32,479
like all bubble man's threads uh Nic

1757
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,239
Matt rise just other people kind of

1758
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:37,678
popping up to there like very vague

1759
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:39,238
knowledge but it was enough to like put

1760
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,840
you on a track to like start

1761
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:45,519
experimenting and trying to figure [ __ ]

1762
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:47,960
out on your own you know and uh so like

1763
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,440
started washing trim and getting decent

1764
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:53,520
hash and just wasn't what I was seeing

1765
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:55,960
on the the internet and [ __ ] so finally

1766
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,440
started getting fresh Frozen

1767
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,079
and got a lot closer and uh you know I

1768
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:02,439
started refining that and pulling

1769
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:04,359
six-star and all that [ __ ] so later on

1770
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:06,479
down the road I run out of all my melts

1771
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:08,039
and that's what really like pushed me to

1772
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:10,079
try figuring [ __ ] out because I I

1773
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:11,719
remember doing like the Jer Michaels you

1774
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:13,600
know you throw the [ __ ] melt on the

1775
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:15,000
screen and then watch it melt through

1776
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,199
and you'd see all that [ __ ]

1777
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,359
contaminant stuck on the top but the oil

1778
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,839
would fall through always so like I

1779
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,559
would think about that all the time but

1780
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,199
nothing really came of it you know you

1781
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,760
go later on down the road I'm running

1782
01:12:24,198 --> 01:12:28,759
out of my six star melts and [ __ ]

1783
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,079
light bulb goes off in my head so I'm

1784
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,760
just thinking like okay so I I took a

1785
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:34,158
chunk of hash shoved it between a piece

1786
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,159
of Parchman and pushed it up on the

1787
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,759
enail and like till burn my finger and

1788
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:41,879
then you know I'd pull it off and I I

1789
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:44,159
looked I see oil pushing out the [ __ ]

1790
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,840
hash and

1791
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:48,279
uh Tri me out so I just kept doing it it

1792
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:52,360
took me like 10 minutes to get one

1793
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:55,399
person to dab and um and actually that

1794
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:57,238
idea came from the fact is uh when was

1795
01:12:55,399 --> 01:12:59,158
making hash I would press out like four

1796
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:01,238
star five star three star just some

1797
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:02,879
shitty [ __ ] and I pref I preferred to

1798
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:05,039
dab it so you know it wasn't the best

1799
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,440
way to do it but I remember seeing uh

1800
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,760
Nick doing using a hair straightener

1801
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,279
just to thin it out and I would mess up

1802
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,119
all the time wouldn't think anything of

1803
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,840
it you know thinking back you know you

1804
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:17,359
had that when I pressed it too hard I

1805
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,360
had the outside all oily and shiny and

1806
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:21,920
you could see the the dry

1807
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,759
flat uh contaminant in the middle well I

1808
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,719
just fold it back up do it again and dab

1809
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,320
it you know so that's where later down

1810
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:29,880
the road that light bulb kicks on and

1811
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:32,639
[ __ ] and I started doing that so I

1812
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:34,480
graduated to a uh a hair curler because

1813
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:36,319
that's all I could find in my house and

1814
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:37,839
then my wife comes out flips out on me

1815
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:40,759
and brings me an old hair

1816
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,039
straightener and uh it was on from there

1817
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,119
you know we started pressing the [ __ ]

1818
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:47,079
out of hash no screen nothing like that

1819
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:49,479
wasn't refined I would just uh pick out

1820
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:52,960
as much of the contaminant as I could

1821
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:55,599
and then uh basically ran out of my hash

1822
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,359
and we're all just sit there another

1823
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,239
light bulb goes off in the head I grab a

1824
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,479
bud and it worked with the bud so you

1825
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:03,879
know to our surprise we're [ __ ]

1826
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:05,759
amazed and next thing you know we're

1827
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:08,840
smoking flower Ros and so I remember

1828
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,400
like that night dude breaking out uh the

1829
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,119
hair straightener and the [ __ ] pound

1830
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:14,119
of weed and pressing out my first eth of

1831
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,880
rosin and it took us like four hours to

1832
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:19,238
press it out but it was [ __ ] amazing

1833
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:22,560
just the fact that we had this stable

1834
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:24,119
clear just I mean Looking Back Now to

1835
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,480
what we have now like we were calling it

1836
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:29,559
turpy but that [ __ ] was burnt popcorn

1837
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:31,799
you know but loving every bit of it

1838
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,039
so yeah I mean that's really how it

1839
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,520
begun for me and then uh you know

1840
01:14:34,039 --> 01:14:37,960
cannabis Revan came around and showed

1841
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,920
everyone the screen Tech and it just

1842
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,760
refined the [ __ ] out of it and really

1843
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,960
that was like the biggest game changer

1844
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,239
as far as refining the

1845
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,158
rosin straight up couldn't have done it

1846
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:52,799
without you soil growing standing on

1847
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:55,638
your shoulders man all love

1848
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,400

1880
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:23,559
when we did the first episode uh that we

1881
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
brought it up in uh a friend of mine had

1882
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,520
actually been like hey have you seen

1883

this Ros and [ __ ] you take flowers and

1884
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,159
you squish them with your hair

1885
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:34,520
straightener and I was like what that's

1886
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:36,079
[ __ ] so we grabbed some flour and

1887
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,480

got into the business um so when I was

1920
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:58,439
14 that's basically when when my passion

1921
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,960
for cannabis started um my mom's got

1922
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:04,678
Parkinson's Tourette's and fibromyalgia

1923
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:07,119
so seeing how it helped her um in a

1924
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:09,600
medicinal sense really sparked my

1925
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:11,800
passion and we started looking for

1926
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,719
better alternatives to the kind of the

1927
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:16,039
mids that she had access to at the time

1928
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:19,000
that were really just tearing her throat

1929
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:22,319
up um so we heard about this lady her

1930
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
name was Cheryl I think in Netherland

1931
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,840
Colorado and she taught us about RSO

1932
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,800
Rick Simpson Oil and so we started

1933
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:32,760
making that for started sourcing some

1934
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,719
real heavy indicia dominant strains um

1935
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,840
but it was just making her so sleepy and

1936
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,880
sedated that she really couldn't treat

1937
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,480
herself throughout the day with it it

1938
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,239
was mostly just at nighttime that she

1939
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:44,559
was really able to take advantage of it

1940
01:18:43,238 --> 01:18:48,439
so we started looking at other

1941
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,199
concentrates out there um found BHO kind

1942
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:53,678
of went through the whole mess of

1943
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:56,079
turning Pyrex into a a rocket uh so we

1944
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,520
had some some tough mistakes that we had

1945
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:00,679
to learn some lessons on there um you

1946
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:03,040
know we discovered solving list I found

1947
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:05,000
the guys over at peer pressure um super

1948
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:07,359
stoked to be working with them we've got

1949
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,679
an incredible team over there um it

1950
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:11,519
really all started with with Josh one of

1951
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:14,279
our owners was looking for a better

1952
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,719
solution to press rosin and so he uh

1953
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:18,759
contacted one of his friends who was an

1954
01:19:15,719 --> 01:19:21,000
engineer uh Ben briten and I don't know

1955
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:23,400
if any of you guys know Ben but he's

1956
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,520
basically the the Elon Musk of cannabis

1957
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:27,559
I mean if you could could see his vision

1958
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,560
for the future and kind of what we're

1959
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,760
looking to do with soling list is is

1960
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,199
really just scale it and automate it in

1961
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,639
every way um and really just drive that

1962
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:37,519
price point down to where it's more

1963
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:39,400
competitive with some of these other

1964
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,199
extracts out there um and that's going

1965
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:44,039
to take just improving the efficiency of

1966
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:46,359
the equipment finding better uh strains

1967
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:48,519
out there to process and that's just our

1968
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:50,559
ultimate goal to really push solving

1969
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,560
lless you know we don't care what what

1970
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,360
equipment you're using or what you're

1971
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,480
doing just as you know as long as you're

1972
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:58,039
pushing solving this forward we're uh

1973
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:00,000
we're definitely on the same

1974
01:19:58,039 --> 01:20:01,679
team awesome dude well thanks for

1975
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,800
sharing that's I didn't know that about

1976
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:06,920
your mom that's a heavy duty for sure no

1977
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,440
doubt it's neat to see all the different

1978
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:11,840
Journeys to get us all to a similar

1979
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:14,000
Place uh here on hash Church in the all

1980
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,760
Rosen episode that's where we are right

1981
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,760
now that's where we are today we got 641

1982
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,840
people watching hash Church 3.0 episode

1983
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,480
7 there's a bunch of people in the chat

1984
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,800
room we'll end up asking questions from

1985
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:31,759
them as well um I want to hear from

1986
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:34,719
Spencer Spencer's from uh access Rosen

1987
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:37,320
and I found this Rosen press to to just

1988
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:39,439
be different and to be Innovative and I

1989
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:42,039
I kind of appreciated what he was doing

1990
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:44,960
and even now looking at his H picture of

1991
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:47,479
the Rosen giant driplets dripping behind

1992
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,520
him uh tell us about yourself Spencer

1993
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:51,799
tell us about how you came to be here in

1994
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:55,560
this room today yes yes how's it going

1995
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:59,360
everybody um definitely rosin was the

1996
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:03,159
the new hype uh back in 2015 when I was

1997
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:04,198
hosting my booth at chalis um uh that

1998
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:08,799
was actually

1999
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:12,000
2017 and um I uh got in contact with

2000
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,480
Dave at Rosen Technologies who is kind

2001
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:17,039
of a company that goes undescribed when

2002
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:18,879
when learning about rosin and what I

2003
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:21,920
know that they discovered was adquate

2004
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:24,840
pounds per square inch and so they found

2005
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:28,039
quality in flower rosin at small scale

2006
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:30,800
with large pressure um because of the

2007
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:33,000
fast oil movement through the filtration

2008
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:36,480
screens and I found that to be very

2009
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,479
unique and uh and when when I was

2010
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:41,919
pressing with one of their machines at

2011
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:45,799
uh secret sessions and and high times

2012
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:48,719
and whatnot I uh I I was able to see a

2013
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:51,360
lot of different genetics and how they

2014
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:53,880
extracted and and what the oil contents

2015
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:55,039
were becoming but the problem was

2016
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:58,079
scalability

2017
01:21:55,039 --> 01:22:01,880
and I just could not process enough

2018
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:04,279
material at a large enough scale so I

2019
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:07,039
actually tried to develop some new

2020
01:22:04,279 --> 01:22:09,960
plates for that press that they were

2021
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:12,319
using and it did not work the same and

2022
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,639
so that was when a little light bulb

2023
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,880
went off in my head to say oh adequate

2024
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:20,159
pounds per square inch is is a huge

2025
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:23,119
factor with pressing flower and they

2026
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:25,158
apparently became a thing pressing hash

2027
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:27,880
where it's kind of simpler because

2028
01:22:25,158 --> 01:22:30,719
there's no plant material creating a

2029
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:33,000
separation uh between the plates so you

2030
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:36,319
don't need as much pressure to easily

2031
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:39,920
extract the oil so my whole intent for

2032
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:43,198
this was scalability I had a a nonprofit

2033
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,920
organization back in 2013 that I wanted

2034
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:49,638
to provide a quality product to all of

2035
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:52,760
my patients because I was growing

2036
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:54,719
everything uh in house for for all the

2037
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,400
patients we were a true nonprofit that

2038
01:22:54,719 --> 01:23:00,359
would not buy and sell any cannabis so

2039
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:03,519
we would just cultivate it all in house

2040
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:07,000
as as myself as a grower uh I just look

2041
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:09,880
to create quality material and uh with

2042
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,880
extracts coming into the picture um

2043
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:16,279
concentrates for for patients who needed

2044
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,920
such a high level of CHC or CBD that

2045
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:20,359
mechanical separation was kind of the

2046
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:24,639
only way to go so when when they

2047
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:27,559
released the the Press from uh rosch

2048
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:30,359
techologies uh I jumped on it and that's

2049
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:34,080
when again I just I just leaned towards

2050
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:39,119
scalability and uh creating a simple

2051
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:41,840
process from from Harvest to rosin um

2052
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:44,399
and so I began inventing I have seven

2053
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:49,360
different prototypes that essentially

2054
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:51,158
came to the v3.2 behind me and uh I

2055
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:54,679
found out that this was the most

2056
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:58,399
simplest way to uh scale up rosin in my

2057
01:23:54,679 --> 01:24:01,239
vision and so this is just my vision uh

2058
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:03,359
come to light in a machine and so I'm

2059
01:24:01,238 --> 01:24:05,718
you know now bringing it to the industry

2060
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:08,759
after I got raided in 2017 and my

2061
01:24:05,719 --> 01:24:12,279
nonprofit was completely shut down uh I

2062
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:14,719
sold my hydroponic store and decided to

2063
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:18,039
uh basically help more patients than

2064
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:22,000
what my nonprofit was helping uh by by

2065
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:24,359
providing scalable equipment to try to

2066
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,600
uh basically flood the entire industry

2067
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:30,198
indry with mechanically separated

2068
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:32,719
separated oil vers solvent based oil um

2069
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:37,158
just as everybody said like that was the

2070
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:38,920
first point of view of of bad oil it was

2071
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:40,559
something in there that none of us are

2072
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,440
really scientists that we could explain

2073
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,639
but something wasn't as clean as a

2074
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:49,118
mechanically separated oil so in seem to

2075
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:51,560
explain it right away like on day one he

2076
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:54,519
was like it's martines they're in the

2077
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:56,159
butane they're in the all the canisters

2078
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,880
it's a contaminant it ends up

2079
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,039
concentrating in the

2080
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:02,199
oil and people just didn't want to hear

2081
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:04,560
it they were like oh no this is I got

2082
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:06,599
the meritine free uh my butane is

2083
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:10,239
actually really clean it was just like

2084
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:13,320
an incredible like array of self-

2085
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:15,439
delusional um cognitive dissonance if

2086
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:17,719
you will from a big part of the

2087
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:20,039
community that claimed to be about

2088
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:22,880
patients but I think was really just

2089
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:24,960
about blasting cans of BHO through PVC

2090
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,239
pipes and selling the sludge that came

2091
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,439
out the other end and you know as Johnny

2092
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:34,279
B wrote uh on the title of one of his

2093
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:37,399
Infamous uh YouTube videos Rosen the

2094
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:39,759
death of BHO and when he wrote that like

2095
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:41,638
a lot of people were very like offended

2096
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,000
by it almost they were like whoa whoa

2097
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:47,279
whoa but man I'll tell you maybe it's

2098
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
just my feeds I don't see BHO at all

2099
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:51,639
anymore I don't see the BHO characters

2100
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,760
that were all in the community I just

2101
01:25:51,639 --> 01:25:55,520
don't see really any of them anymore

2102
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:58,719
kind of going away and I think that the

2103
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:01,199
real key to making it completely go away

2104
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,319
is creating scalable equipment like

2105
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:06,759
Cliff was saying man just creating the

2106
01:26:03,319 --> 01:26:10,399
equipment for the industry is is a start

2107
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:12,719
to providing quality oil for the entire

2108
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:15,158
world it starts with the manufacturers

2109
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:18,158
and the facilities acquiring the proper

2110
01:26:15,158 --> 01:26:20,479
equipment to create scalability uh

2111
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:22,279
regardless of what form it's from as

2112
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:25,238
long as it's from flower rosin or hash

2113
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:27,559
rosin or some type of uh hash process

2114
01:26:25,238 --> 01:26:29,678
that separates the resin gland through

2115
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:32,840
SE or whatnot we're definitely all

2116
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:36,679
interested and uh I just see that full

2117
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:39,440
melt through rosin or or a rosin product

2118
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:43,319
essentially that that has the best

2119
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:45,719
melting terms um is going to stay long

2120
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:49,719
term for we're talking past the next 10

2121
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:52,760
15 years like butane essentially had a a

2122
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:55,399
ending point so I think that with with

2123
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:58,800
rosin and hash uh it's it's all for us

2124
01:26:55,399 --> 01:27:01,158
to not only have the start in 2015 to

2125
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,279
innovate new products and and develop

2126
01:27:01,158 --> 01:27:06,519
new

2127
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:08,319
equipment but to continue past uh seeing

2128
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:11,159
no ending

2129
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:12,840
point yeah indeed well let me just check

2130
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:15,839
out the entire room here to make sure

2131
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:18,199
nobody knew snuck in while I was

2132
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,600
uh I wish I could have played that video

2133
01:27:18,198 --> 01:27:22,960
of you soil grown telling the story from

2134
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,960
years ago but I'll have to I'll have to

2135
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,840
figure it out later it's it doesn't come

2136
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,198
out with any audio but now I really kind

2137
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:31,159
of want to open it up to discussion you

2138
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:33,638
know I think one of the most important

2139
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:37,359
discussions uh leads into techniques and

2140
01:27:33,639 --> 01:27:39,679
techniques basically equals textures I

2141
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:43,079
mean right isn't that really what

2142
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:44,639
techniques sort of basically absolutely

2143
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:46,000
creating textures you're creating oh I

2144
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:47,920
want textures

2145
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
consistencies exactly and everyone's

2146
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,920
trying to come up with kind of new

2147
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,359
versions of these things and I have to

2148
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,480
say through all of the experimenting and

2149
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:58,799
all of the mistakes that have been made

2150
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:03,079
some pretty some pretty beautiful things

2151
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:06,400
have come up I think you know the the

2152
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:09,679
figuring out of thca or you know the

2153
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:13,279
separation of the THC from the turps you

2154
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:16,639
know having it crash inside the jar both

2155
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:18,719
those techniques seem to be also once

2156
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:21,239
again spread like wildfire give people

2157
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:23,639
that ability to go home and sort of try

2158
01:28:21,238 --> 01:28:26,118
things I just wanted to open that up how

2159
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:29,039
some of you got turned on to that some

2160
01:28:26,118 --> 01:28:30,599
of the things you did that were mistakes

2161
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:35,399
that led to doing things that were

2162
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:38,079
correct if anyone has a story like that

2163
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:39,759
can everything's been by mistake for me

2164
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,559
oh my bad dude no you're good I just

2165
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,000
wanted to say like from from the per

2166
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,880
like try to think of the person's

2167
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,319
perspective that has never made anything

2168
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:50,400
like this or or um maybe even indulged

2169
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:53,118
on anything like the the even the end

2170
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:56,118
product like what exactly are we doing

2171
01:28:53,118 --> 01:28:57,839
here we're taking two heated plates and

2172
01:28:56,118 --> 01:29:00,118
you know like they don't even I I just

2173
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,360
wanted to could we start at that like

2174
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:04,559
before we start explaining consisten and

2175
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:06,479
like you I think it's a good idea why

2176
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,239
don't you start like just like like what

2177
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:09,638
you were saying the simple thing we're

2178
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:15,039
using heat and

2179
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:17,840
pressure yep we're using either flour or

2180
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:20,880
hash we're hitting that flour or hash

2181
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:23,239
with heat and pressure with originally a

2182
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,279
flat iron or a hair straightener which

2183
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:29,319
led into t-shirt presses modified which

2184
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:30,759
led into presses modified into fullblown

2185
01:29:29,319 --> 01:29:34,960
Ros

2186
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:38,800
machines um and we're extracting the

2187
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:41,198
Active Components the Cannabis flour or

2188
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:45,360
hash the resin

2189
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:47,839
glands um into an a refined

2190
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:50,719
oil and that's right so we're refining

2191
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,960
the oil so like maybe just maybe we

2192
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,319
shouldn't be saying that we're curing it

2193
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,198
because it's too heated plates are

2194
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:58,439
initiating all the consistencies even

2195
01:29:56,198 --> 01:30:01,559
fresh press the consistency of fresh

2196
01:29:58,439 --> 01:30:04,079
press That's initiated by two really hot

2197
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:07,679
plates guys like let's not let's be real

2198
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:10,000
it's true but the turfing print outs

2199
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,880
before and after like the changes are

2200
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,679
minimal surprising way the assumptions

2201
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,840
once again from the BHO Community who

2202
01:30:14,679 --> 01:30:18,800
were like oh my God like they're using

2203
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:21,159
heated plates we have nothing to worry

2204
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,880
about it's like no it's coming out

2205
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:25,559
really great like the consistencies are

2206
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,440
are similar to the to the hydrocarbon

2207
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,360
extracts I'm just trying to I'm just

2208
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:30,638
trying to say like people like need to

2209
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:33,079
understand that that aren't making it

2210
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:35,560
because they're buying things that say

2211
01:30:33,079 --> 01:30:37,118
cold cured or heat cured or whatever if

2212
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,239
you're if you're curing the rosin

2213
01:30:37,118 --> 01:30:42,559
afterwards you're slowing down the off

2214
01:30:39,238 --> 01:30:47,399
gassing of turpen to allow it to harden

2215
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:50,119
and it will save tpes more so than

2216
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:52,439
wouldn't you yeah the act of pressing

2217
01:30:50,118 --> 01:30:55,719
rousin itself is not curing rousin I'll

2218
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:57,638
agree with you there it's after yeah I

2219
01:30:55,719 --> 01:30:59,239
would agree as well it's a postprocess

2220
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:02,000
that you know that you you go through

2221
01:30:59,238 --> 01:31:04,519
after the actual process and which gives

2222
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,560
at that title yeah a lot a lot of people

2223
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:09,800
here on the chat actually mentioned that

2224
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:12,840
they offer a fresh press a cold cure

2225
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,960
right yeah a warm cure an oven cure the

2226
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:17,719
curing is nothing to do with the Press

2227
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,960
it's all postprocessing well let me just

2228
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:23,319
say I don't mind that at all and and

2229
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:24,960
like people can call that makes sense

2230
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:26,880
you know that what you guys just said it

2231
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,118
totally makes sense so if if that is the

2232
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,840
word that people want to use I think

2233
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:34,880
that's great um because my word that I

2234
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,639
use is is fig you know very figurative I

2235
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,480
use the word bloom because anything that

2236
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:41,039
I make is coming off of two really hot

2237
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:42,879
plates and what it does after that you

2238
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:45,479
know that was the initiation of the

2239
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:48,560
consistency whatever consistency I made

2240
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:51,039
right you know a jar yeah like you know

2241
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,679
it came down the temps a little bit but

2242
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:54,439
you know still a little bit above room

2243
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:57,079
temp you know if you're trying to make

2244
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:58,599
the um whatever consistency you're

2245
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:00,198
trying to make you know like people put

2246
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,239
it in the oven blah blah blah I don't

2247
01:32:00,198 --> 01:32:07,079
want to be I I don't want to be the guy

2248
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:09,158
that defines the term that I just open

2249
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:11,600
open the content up a little bit perhaps

2250
01:32:09,158 --> 01:32:13,519
we could use an analogy you know it's

2251
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,480
it's like recordings you know making

2252
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,199
music where you could have a recording

2253
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:19,439
and then you have you have genres and

2254
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:22,000
then sh sub genres I think that those

2255
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:25,158
the recording is like the process the

2256
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,118
genre is the cold cure and this case and

2257
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:29,799
then you take it a step further and you

2258
01:32:27,118 --> 01:32:31,599
have harmonics and the timing in which

2259
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:34,320
all the things come together the the

2260
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,159
screen you use the timing the Heat and

2261
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:38,319
all these things that you you you apply

2262
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,799
to this but then your genres are

2263
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:42,399
different you know you have hip-hop you

2264
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:45,679
have Jazz you have you know so on and so

2265
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,198
forth so if you want to take that in I

2266
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,520
think that's a good analogy that you

2267
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:50,839
could you could think about moving

2268
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:52,960
forward as as you know it's it's trying

2269
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:54,880
to better understand in a human sense

2270
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,600
what we're actually doing to give to

2271
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:00,480
someone so what is this thing yeah it's

2272
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:02,520
rosin but it's you know I cold cured it

2273
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:05,759
so therefore it's a process in which it

2274
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:07,480
went through to give you the cold cure C

2275
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:11,360
so I think we can look at it in that

2276
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:13,799
that manner and really apply this uh

2277
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:16,399
these same analogies in that way if you

2278
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:19,360
will curing of rosin to me is much in

2279
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:21,399
the same sense is is carrying a flower

2280
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:23,158
you know you're actually maturing the

2281
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:25,319
resin glands you're allowing them to

2282
01:33:23,158 --> 01:33:28,719
potentially oxidize to mature for the

2283
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:31,399
tricomes or for the for the tpes to to

2284
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:33,679
progress um I mean that's that's curing

2285
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:36,118
to me and there's different ways to skin

2286
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:39,840
a cat so to speak uh to get you know

2287
01:33:36,118 --> 01:33:41,679
different um results from curing well

2288
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:43,480
just to be the person on the other side

2289
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:46,520
that like keep in mind to like people

2290
01:33:43,479 --> 01:33:49,839
that have never made it before um to

2291
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:52,000
them to them they're like okay so are

2292
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,279
you using dry material okay so you cured

2293
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,920
the material the the the flower you

2294
01:33:54,279 --> 01:33:58,479
cured it then you made the

2295
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:00,440
hash or are you using fresh frozen okay

2296
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:02,718
so you're using you know but so let's

2297
01:34:00,439 --> 01:34:03,879
let's say you are using dry material and

2298
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:07,319
you're teaching someone that's never

2299
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:10,760
made it before that's cured material and

2300
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:12,439
then you're refining the oil of a cured

2301
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,360
cured resin the C the resin's cured

2302
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,279
you're find you're refining cured resin

2303
01:34:14,359 --> 01:34:18,118
already and then you're curing that

2304
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:20,198
cured cured cured resin you know what

2305
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:21,559
I'm saying like that's what like from a

2306
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:23,319
perspective I think it would just be

2307
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,440
developing at that point you know the

2308
01:34:23,319 --> 01:34:26,799
resin is just developing I think most

2309
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:29,319
people that are talking about curing the

2310
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,520
resin glands aren't aren't and maybe I'm

2311
01:34:29,319 --> 01:34:32,039
totally wrong on this but the people

2312
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:35,800
that are talking about curing rousin

2313
01:34:32,039 --> 01:34:37,840
aren't washing dried cured flour we're

2314
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:39,679
we're washing either fresh frozen or in

2315
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,400
my case I've I've moved to more of a

2316
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:44,719
four five six day dry so curing of the

2317
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:47,079
of the resin glands has not taken place

2318
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:49,279
prior to me pressing the rosin so it's a

2319
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:51,679
necessity you can smoke fresh press

2320
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:53,800
rosin it's not a problem um but it's I

2321
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:55,639
didn't mean to be that linear about it

2322
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,920
was just an example I mean like let's

2323
01:34:55,639 --> 01:34:59,760
say fresh frozen okay like that freezer

2324
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,359
is drying out that material so when did

2325
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:04,000
you get that material how dry you know

2326
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:05,359
what I mean like it's these are all data

2327
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,158
anything it doesn't matter so like the

2328
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:11,198
point is that two heated plates refined

2329
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:12,399
oil and so like I mean maybe the word

2330
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:14,079
cure shouldn't be the word but it

2331
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:15,679
doesn't matter people can use that word

2332
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:18,000
because it makes sense if you want to

2333
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:21,639
explain it that way totally fine I use

2334
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,079
the word bloom because I'm really te and

2335
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:25,719
when you expose coffee to heat just a

2336
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:27,840
little bit of heat right it like muffin

2337
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:28,800
up just like B in the in the vacuum oven

2338
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,119
like back in the day you're making

2339
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:33,239
chatter it muffin up and it starts to

2340
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:36,118
bloom right so like I'm just putting a

2341
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:39,959
word on a process that I don't feel like

2342
01:35:36,118 --> 01:35:41,079
explaining in depth to people I just I I

2343
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:43,639
that's just

2344
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:46,639
branding and I mean then the rosin

2345
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:49,760
blooms in a jar you know all that all

2346
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:52,319
that is all that is is your brand want

2347
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:54,360
you're you're blooming it for your brand

2348
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:57,118
you know and and the reality is there's

2349
01:35:54,359 --> 01:36:01,039
a rainbow of different types of rosin

2350
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:02,799
out there you know I I prefer to run dry

2351
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:04,719
trims still I mean I'm probably one of

2352
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:07,679
the last holdouts that loves the dry

2353
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:11,279
trim but I'm all about that cured resin

2354
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:13,800
head you know and then that that that

2355
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:16,359
rosin that that's made from that cured

2356
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,719
bubble hash it goes through another

2357
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:20,839
process where where I'm changing the

2358
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:23,960
texture so that it's going to be a more

2359
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:26,039
desirable product for the end consumer

2360
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,480
you know and so so there's there's all

2361
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:28,960
these things that that can go down if

2362
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:31,559
you want to just call it Bloom that's

2363
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:34,560
cool but the reality is you know did you

2364
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:37,280
dry your plants afterwards yes or no

2365
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,480
that's one thing right how long did you

2366
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:41,880
dry them for how did you dry them for

2367
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:44,559
did you dry them in cold dark or was it

2368
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:47,118
a quick dry did you then just hold them

2369
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:49,440
in a a sealed container or was it able

2370
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:50,920
to offgas fully there's all of these

2371
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,000
things under the rainbow and they're all

2372
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,920
going to create different wonderful

2373
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:59,399
products so that was very well said and

2374
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,880
what's cool about like what we do is

2375
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:02,439
it's like a branding thing like you said

2376
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,079
you know what I mean everybody can stamp

2377
01:37:02,439 --> 01:37:06,000
their own label on it call it what you

2378
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:07,840
want like covert's got his new uh I

2379
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,760
think he calls them the asteroids or the

2380
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,520
Space Balls what's said

2381
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:14,760
uh rackams you got the zombie rosin you

2382
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,199
know I mean every everybody's got their

2383
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,560
own thing they want to coin it their own

2384
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:19,759
thing and that's fine you know I mean as

2385
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:20,960
long as you can explain it properly and

2386
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,199
give the the

2387
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,158
consumer a reasonable explanation for

2388
01:37:23,198 --> 01:37:27,238
what's going going on then I say Call It

2389
01:37:25,158 --> 01:37:29,920
Whatever you want yeah definitely we can

2390
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:33,118
I mean you know yeah I can agree with

2391
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:37,600
that I and I and I agree with I I do

2392
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:40,279
wash cured resin um and I I can uh agree

2393
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:43,880
with Pedro and and I also wanted to say

2394
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:46,279
that I I uh I I like to store my rosin

2395
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:47,760
in a cold environment to preserve it I

2396
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:50,238
just wanted to mention that that's

2397
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:52,440
mainly my like I'm not necessarily like

2398
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:54,718
there's definitely a change going on

2399
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:57,359
over time and so that's why I definitely

2400
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:59,319
could say it falls under curing but I I

2401
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:00,519
don't pres I don't store it in a cold

2402
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:04,599
environment

2403
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:06,719
to parse cure it I I I do it to preserve

2404
01:38:04,599 --> 01:38:09,639
it it's funny that's kind of like one of

2405
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:11,399
my mistakes if you will is I was the

2406
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:13,760
same way you know I used to keep it in

2407
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:15,279
in the freezer to preserve it like long

2408
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,679
term you know if I wanted to keep it you

2409
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:20,118
know six8 10 months or so which I now

2410
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:24,000
think is incorrect but when I put it in

2411
01:38:20,118 --> 01:38:25,598
the refrigerator to kind of as a St area

2412
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,279
you know most of my Rous unfortunately

2413
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:29,719
sits on the desk here I smoke it rather

2414
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:31,158
quickly I I put it in in containers that

2415
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:34,319
I that I go through it rather quickly so

2416
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:36,118
I use my little six can refrigerator uh

2417
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:37,679
it's it's it's kind of a a warm

2418
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:40,000
refrigerator if you will just keeps

2419
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,239
things rather cool I just kept it in

2420
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,039
there because I like to keep my rosin

2421
01:38:41,238 --> 01:38:47,678
cool for preservation and then I noticed

2422
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:49,198
the change I noticed the the buttering

2423
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,719
and I noticed the pooling of the turps

2424
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:53,039
on the top I noticed the separation I

2425
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:55,920
noticed the nucle nucleation I always

2426
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:58,039
say that word wrong um but I started not

2427
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:00,760
noticing a change and that was what

2428
01:38:58,039 --> 01:39:03,840
turned me on to the curing and that was

2429
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:05,639
what I guess I'll just maybe I termed it

2430
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,960
or maybe I whatever made up the word I

2431
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:11,359
don't know but I cured I I figured I

2432
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:14,399
cured my rosin I was aging it I was it

2433
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:16,759
was changing it was it was

2434
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:19,598
morphing well I definitely I definitely

2435
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:21,840
agree with that and I I use uh the same

2436
01:39:19,599 --> 01:39:23,960
kind of refrigerator as you described I

2437
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:27,079
don't store it in the the Freez I don't

2438
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:30,399
like the how much condensation and how

2439
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:32,880
aggressive the uh freezer is it like

2440
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:35,000
dries things out can I'll use the

2441
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,760
freezer only for complete uh

2442
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,359
preservation in my opinion the

2443
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:41,119
refrigerator I would say is still in a

2444
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:43,639
sense curing because there's still

2445
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:46,479
oxidation occurring you know it's it's

2446
01:39:43,639 --> 01:39:48,639
super slowed down process at that point

2447
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:50,799
but you know like like Pedro was saying

2448
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:52,800
you know it's it's still changing and

2449
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,920
it's doing it at such a slow rate you

2450
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,599
know when we have it out of the

2451
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:58,079
refrigerator and when we're doing our

2452
01:39:55,599 --> 01:40:00,400
manipulation process we're in a sense

2453
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,198
just speeding up oxidation you know when

2454
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:04,319
we're when we're applying heat to it

2455
01:40:02,198 --> 01:40:06,079
we're just speeding up that process and

2456
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:07,799
that's why it gets to a point where you

2457
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:09,479
know you really have to monitor it when

2458
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,440
you're looking for a certain texture

2459
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:13,559
consistency but when it's in the fridge

2460
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:15,799
there is no monitoring you have a hell

2461
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,119
of a lot more time to see what's going

2462
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:19,039
on but when you're trying to store

2463
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:21,000
things in the refrigerator you can't

2464
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,719
expect it to look exactly the same when

2465
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,198
you go to it and you're going to package

2466
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,039
it or something you have bulk material

2467
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:28,519
and now it's it's time to package and

2468
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:30,039
you want it to be fresh pressed but now

2469
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:32,280
there's nucleation occurring throughout

2470
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:34,800
it and it's not what you wanted it to be

2471
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:36,679
so I I I really believe in the fact that

2472
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,800
the freezer is the best way for storage

2473
01:40:36,679 --> 01:40:42,480
to to almost completely stop oxidation

2474
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:44,440
and and the refrigerator it's it's great

2475
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:45,879
storage short term you know uh it'll

2476
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:47,598
keep fresh fresh looking good for a

2477
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:49,440
short time but you will see nucleation

2478
01:40:47,599 --> 01:40:51,760
occur and stuff and it's it's really

2479
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:53,960
strain dependent you know 100% there's

2480
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:57,199
strains that are super stable and just

2481
01:40:53,960 --> 01:41:00,439
seem to hold very well and stay stay

2482
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:03,079
clear and uh fresh press looking but you

2483
01:41:00,439 --> 01:41:04,479
know some strains you as everyone knows

2484
01:41:03,079 --> 01:41:06,599
you know they just they nucleate

2485
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,718
regardless of refrigeration or what you

2486
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:11,119
did just depends on what temperature

2487
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:13,118
you're pressing at also I just wanted to

2488
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:14,759
say it reminds me of Chef good chefs

2489
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:16,519
will know I mean I'm not a chef I don't

2490
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,039
I don't want to speak for other chefs

2491
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:20,719
but uh uh then they know that the the

2492
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:23,319
rice is better to make fried rice with

2493
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:24,599
day old rice because like that fridge

2494
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:26,279
definitely is doing something you know

2495
01:41:24,599 --> 01:41:27,599
what I mean it's preserving obviously

2496
01:41:26,279 --> 01:41:29,319
but there's some there's stuff going on

2497
01:41:27,599 --> 01:41:32,000
in the fridge you know it makes a better

2498
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:34,679
fried rice day old um but that's just

2499
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,279
like a totally ridiculous example um I I

2500
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:38,199
just wanted to say that like from my

2501
01:41:36,279 --> 01:41:40,238
opinion from from my perspective of how

2502
01:41:38,198 --> 01:41:42,479
I make it like shout out lent plates I I

2503
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,799
just make they have got I've got good

2504
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,559
feedback with them and uh never had a

2505
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,679
problem with the plates but anyways I

2506
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,679
squeeze the rosin right I make the I

2507
01:41:48,679 --> 01:41:52,560
make the hash I put in a jar and then I

2508
01:41:50,679 --> 01:41:54,480
actually just leave it a little bit

2509
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,280
above you know seed mat to be honest

2510
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:59,118
with you I put it on a seed mat I wrap

2511
01:41:56,279 --> 01:42:01,439
it in aluminum uh a friend of mine

2512
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:03,399
showed me so that that be kind of a good

2513
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:06,000
idea just because of the photo oxidation

2514
01:42:03,399 --> 01:42:10,238
you know I want to kind of limit that if

2515
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:12,359
you can um so I just from like a totally

2516
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:13,839
crude way of doing what I'm doing I just

2517
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:15,519
explaining from my perspective could

2518
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,480
picture two PE picture people that are

2519
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,760
just growing six plants and they don't

2520
01:42:17,479 --> 01:42:20,678
follow all this stuff and they're just

2521
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:22,159
like okay how can I refine my hash right

2522
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:24,158
so it's like that's how I'm kind of

2523
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:26,399
doing it and so anyway

2524
01:42:24,158 --> 01:42:29,118
um I put it on a seed mat and I let it

2525
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:33,198
Bloom because I don't I don't let that

2526
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:35,238
that uh top it's a seal J jar you know

2527
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:36,759
so um what am I getting at here so

2528
01:42:35,238 --> 01:42:38,839
anyway so I get at it a couple days

2529
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:40,360
later I don't I don't pop the seal and

2530
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:43,719
then when you pop that seal you notice

2531
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:45,559
it's like because there's like CO2 or

2532
01:42:43,719 --> 01:42:48,480
whatever else is being released right so

2533
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:51,480
it's like it's blooming almost in yeah

2534
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:53,919
turs pressure from right so like but

2535
01:42:51,479 --> 01:42:56,359
when you're when you're melting the the

2536
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,359
the resin on nail that the bubbling

2537
01:42:56,359 --> 01:43:03,519
that's CO2 being released if I'm

2538
01:42:58,359 --> 01:43:05,039
mistaken it's TPS and CO2 anyways so

2539
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,599
anyways

2540
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:09,319
like um so that's what I do I just leave

2541
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:10,840
it on there for like sometimes it's two

2542
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:13,399
days it depends on like what you guys

2543
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:16,239
were saying some of some of that

2544
01:43:13,399 --> 01:43:18,079
stuff wax out quicker and so like a

2545
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:21,319
banana G is kind of like the best

2546
01:43:18,079 --> 01:43:25,198
example is stuff with lming I heard from

2547
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:27,238
uh uh people that make salvin X Murphy

2548
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:30,319
Murray um I think that's her Instagram

2549
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:34,399
name Murphy Murray um she uh told me

2550
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:37,000
that loning actually extracts um that

2551
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:40,198
that that tpine extracts the I mean

2552
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,639
melts the can or somehow extracts canabo

2553
01:43:40,198 --> 01:43:45,799
more right so it's like does l with

2554
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:48,400
loning I believe uh loning hash oil or

2555
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:50,800
something like that that was he was

2556
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,519
doing that years and years ago yeah so

2557
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,400
these consistency like like for example

2558
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:56,400
I had a one seed plant we weren't able

2559
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:58,000
to keep unfortunately but it made oil

2560
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:59,479
that like whenever I pressed into the

2561
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,679
Ros and there was nothing you could do

2562
01:43:59,479 --> 01:44:02,799
you could put it in the oven nothing you

2563
01:44:00,679 --> 01:44:04,800
could do to make it wax out at all it

2564
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,560
was just a oil there's nothing you could

2565
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:09,400
do to do anything to it to make it turn

2566
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:12,280
into what I would say that I make on on

2567
01:44:09,399 --> 01:44:13,598
the regular which is like um what I was

2568
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:15,158
trying to say earlier I just leave it in

2569
01:44:13,599 --> 01:44:17,000
a jar for two days and then I pop the

2570
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:18,799
seal and then I stir just a little bit

2571
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,760
and then it all kind of

2572
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,360
conglomerates you know other people do

2573
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:23,599
it a lot of people do it I don't know if

2574
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:25,839
they do it just like me but that's how

2575
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:27,360
I'm doing it I just wanted to talk about

2576
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,119
that that's what I mean by like for

2577
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:30,799
sharing dude we're gonna we're g to move

2578
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:33,479
on from this conversation and kind of

2579
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:36,960
get into a little a little bit of sort

2580
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:38,718
of textures and uh Tech you know

2581
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,198
methodologies to get to those particular

2582
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:42,719
temperat because there is certain resin

2583
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:44,198
that like you say it's just gonna

2584
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:46,800
nucleate right away it's just gonna

2585
01:44:44,198 --> 01:44:48,960
butter out we had it in the hash world

2586
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:52,119
forever because it was even worse than

2587
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:55,000
the hash world because water also tended

2588
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:57,039
to do the same thing so you had water

2589
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,800
being left in the hash making it kind of

2590
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:01,639
butter out and weaken and get funky but

2591
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:03,599
then you had people drying their hash to

2592
01:45:01,639 --> 01:45:05,800
Perfection but it was really high toen

2593
01:45:03,599 --> 01:45:07,920
and really high THC and it would

2594
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:10,760
basically sugar out and crash right

2595
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:13,719
within itself you guys figure out any

2596
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:17,760
ways to sort of recognize those

2597
01:45:13,719 --> 01:45:19,480
things be I mean would I would I feel

2598
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:23,960
like you know that would be moisture

2599
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:26,399
which is um you know presenting oy which

2600
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,880
is speeding up oxid oxidation and you

2601
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:31,799
know it's just kind of that sense of uh

2602
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,599
which is is inducing nucleation so I

2603
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:35,560
just feel like that's kind of what's

2604
01:45:33,599 --> 01:45:37,840
going on but in the same with any kind

2605
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:40,280
of oil whether it's you know bubble hash

2606
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:43,400
which which has more plant particulate

2607
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:46,359
which is able to absorb and hold on to

2608
01:45:43,399 --> 01:45:50,000
moisture better than like a a a pure oil

2609
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:51,839
rosin which um you know it's it's it's

2610
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,679
that's more like inducing nucleation

2611
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,560
through things like heat and and oxid

2612
01:45:54,679 --> 01:45:58,840
oxidation on that sense but I feel like

2613
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,119
it's it's oxidation inducing nucleation

2614
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:03,639
and that's where you get that crumbled

2615
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:08,359
up sugar or you know shit's caking up on

2616
01:46:03,639 --> 01:46:10,560
you yeah i' agree man 100% And it's also

2617
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:12,839
you know the way the flower was grown

2618
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,520
before it was extracted you

2619
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:17,599
know what they did and didn't do you

2620
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,440
know you know every time you started

2621
01:46:17,599 --> 01:46:23,159
100% if you get below that 10% mark on

2622
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:24,678
on the cultivation side It's just tough

2623
01:46:23,158 --> 01:46:26,359
you know you're going to have a lot more

2624
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:27,960
waxes and a lot more stuff in there that

2625
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:30,639
are undesirable in terms of from the

2626
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:32,399
head itself and that's the biggest thing

2627
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:34,800
I always try to tell cultivators out

2628
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:36,519
there you have to really be careful what

2629
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:39,000
you're feeding your plants and when

2630
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:41,000
you're feeding it as well and how much

2631
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,679
you're feeding it it's all together it's

2632
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,880
not one after the other or it's not a

2633
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,158
singular thing it's it's a trifecta you

2634
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:50,520
have to really bring together so I

2635
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:52,279
totally agree on that man I'm we're

2636
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:54,080
talking about preservation right now

2637
01:46:52,279 --> 01:46:56,359
right like at at the end of the day

2638
01:46:54,079 --> 01:46:59,559
we're talking about preservation and uh

2639
01:46:56,359 --> 01:47:02,039
shell fly I mean that's what what our

2640
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:04,679
end goal is right at what point does it

2641
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:07,000
become de degradation I mean is that

2642
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:09,679
oxidation causing

2643
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:12,238
degradation I think so I think that the

2644
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:14,520
less oxidation you can introduce and you

2645
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:16,678
know if you can do hermetically sealed

2646
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,480
jars after you're done and you know you

2647
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:20,560
can off gas as much as you can to get

2648
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:24,238
that steal on there to try to bring it

2649
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:25,960
to the to you know the C as we see it in

2650
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:28,000
the lab that's you know it's a tall

2651
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:29,679
order you know it's not the easiest

2652
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,359
thing I think that's where these

2653
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,599
consistencies came from right in a sense

2654
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:34,880
a lot of people in mistakes were trying

2655
01:47:33,599 --> 01:47:37,239
to see how long they could preserve

2656
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,679
their product for which ended up turning

2657
01:47:37,238 --> 01:47:40,279
into a different consistency because

2658
01:47:38,679 --> 01:47:42,840
they stort it different than this person

2659
01:47:40,279 --> 01:47:44,840
or that person I had I think that's

2660
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:47,159
pretty cool I had a fail over the last

2661
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:49,440
year uh that that kind of falls into

2662
01:47:47,158 --> 01:47:51,839
these conversations a little bit um I I

2663
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:53,519
took about a half pound of some really

2664
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,800
good rosin that I had

2665
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:58,520
and just not knowing the consistencies

2666
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:00,159
not knowing changes not knowing what was

2667
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:02,520
going to happen I wrapped I wrapped it

2668
01:48:00,158 --> 01:48:08,158
in parchment paper I vacuum sealed it I

2669
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:10,520
put it in a uh uh a sealed PVC container

2670
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:12,920
capsule and prepper style I buried it in

2671
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:16,639
my backyard for a period of about six or

2672
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:18,719
eight months um you know just rainy day

2673
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:21,000
type stuff and you know you guys all

2674
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:26,399
know we all put stuff in in different

2675
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:28,880
places you know so anyways uh that was

2676
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:30,759
this last year's Harvest and spring come

2677
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,760
up Upon Us couple you know about a month

2678
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:35,760
ago and uh so I went out and I I was

2679
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:37,159
like man it's it's about time to big dig

2680
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,119
this up I think and just see you know

2681
01:48:37,158 --> 01:48:40,559
see what's going on and I could use the

2682
01:48:39,118 --> 01:48:42,479
stash anyways you know so it's time to

2683
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,840
start bringing it in and preparing it

2684
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:47,479
and when I brought it in and opened the

2685
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:49,279
PVC container um by the way did I did I

2686
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:51,000
say it was it was vacuum sealed wrapped

2687
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:54,800
in parchment vacuum sealed buried on the

2688
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:57,639
ground um and so I opened up the PVC

2689
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:00,760
container pulled out the vacuum sealed

2690
01:48:57,639 --> 01:49:03,679
uh you know baggie and I immediately

2691
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:07,320
noticed that there was uh moisture

2692
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:10,599
leaking from the from the inside from

2693
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:12,158
the parchment paper and just me knowing

2694
01:49:10,599 --> 01:49:14,480
the rosin that I've seen you know that

2695
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:16,559
i' had in here immediately knew that it

2696
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:19,319
was bleeding turpins just just knew it

2697
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,440
was bleeding Turpin so I peeled I peeled

2698
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:22,880
open the first one and they were all

2699
01:49:20,439 --> 01:49:25,879
wrapped in you know 1 o little little

2700
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:28,920
pucks and I immediately open it up and

2701
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:32,880
uh it was a nightmare to collect the

2702
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:34,480
Turin were just everywhere um for every

2703
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:38,840
for every ounce that I had I ended up

2704
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:41,238
collecting about 24 to 25 grams of rosin

2705
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,760
uh and the rest was uh was pretty much

2706
01:49:41,238 --> 01:49:45,079
just turpins that I had to try to

2707
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,119
collect and spread amongst everything so

2708
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:48,079
on that

2709
01:49:46,118 --> 01:49:49,158
fail you know if you're going to do any

2710
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:50,519
kind of cold caring or anything

2711
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:52,719
definitely make sure it's not kind of a

2712
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:55,920
GL a glass jar I recommend glass High

2713
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:59,079
highly recommend glass and um that that

2714
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:01,000
was my fail and really what turned me on

2715
01:49:59,079 --> 01:50:03,399
to holy [ __ ] this is curing this is

2716
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,920
separating this is nucle ising or

2717
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:09,519
whatever I can't say that word right and

2718
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:12,719
um but it was in a sealed environment so

2719
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:16,080
the oxidation was very very

2720
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:16,079
limited that's my

2721
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:24,519
story great start hey Johnny B I think

2722
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:26,920
how you doing dude D how's going man I

2723
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:28,560
you know I'm loving listening and and

2724
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:30,399
just that little story there I see the

2725
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:32,840
separation a lot on the turfs on the

2726
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:34,960
elide of things that I've stored I have

2727
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:36,800
I have jars dated right now from March

2728
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:40,599
2008 I'm going to look at and stuff like

2729
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,599
that but moisture is such a huge role of

2730
01:50:40,599 --> 01:50:44,840
me really looking at humidity moisture

2731
01:50:42,599 --> 01:50:46,920
water activity and how it plays a key

2732
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:49,078
role in in storing hash Ros and

2733
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:51,960
everything pretty much and pressing R we

2734
01:50:49,078 --> 01:50:53,799
haven't even talked about it yet pardon

2735
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,239
me we Haven haven't mentioned it yet the

2736
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:57,639
one thing that didn't get mentioned was

2737
01:50:55,238 --> 01:51:00,198
moisture content moisture content yeah

2738
01:50:57,639 --> 01:51:02,039
waiting for it it's all Theo moisture

2739
01:51:00,198 --> 01:51:03,879
and really I've seen such a difference

2740
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:06,479
even like just stuff I just recently

2741
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:08,520
pressed and um like we're talking about

2742
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:10,879
it some's buttering out some's not some

2743
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:13,000
is and it's really comes down to

2744
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:16,440
moisturize you really see some dries out

2745
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,880
quicker some doesn't some it Lids some

2746
01:51:16,439 --> 01:51:20,399
the way I cure the way I store really I

2747
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,279
see moisture playing a key role in

2748
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:24,039
everything we're talking about it has a

2749
01:51:22,279 --> 01:51:25,960
lot to do with temperature also like if

2750
01:51:24,039 --> 01:51:28,359
you press it at a lower temperature

2751
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:30,319
it'll butter up faster and if you press

2752
01:51:28,359 --> 01:51:32,118
it at a hotter temperature it'll it'll

2753
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:34,719
stay stable longer and it'll stay like

2754
01:51:32,118 --> 01:51:37,118
more like fresh press I like a hot short

2755
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:38,920
press right so for me I would always

2756
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:41,399
like press a couple times and I saw in

2757
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:43,880
the beginning I'd go like a seven from

2758
01:51:41,399 --> 01:51:46,078
soy I remember what he was doing and I

2759
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:48,199
mean I was a big big fan thank you for

2760
01:51:46,078 --> 01:51:50,799
showing me that technically me changeed

2761
01:51:48,198 --> 01:51:52,759
my life um but I was I was always

2762
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,920
looking at the shorter longer presses

2763
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,199
stuff like

2764
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:59,399
that and then for me pressing on day

2765
01:51:57,198 --> 01:52:01,638
four day five curing and pulling the

2766
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:03,319
pulling that prop that point the turps

2767
01:52:01,639 --> 01:52:05,480
right there and that moisture plays a

2768
01:52:03,319 --> 01:52:07,039
key role and I really saw that by

2769
01:52:05,479 --> 01:52:09,598
pressing stuff all the way through the

2770
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:11,078
drawing process even using B pressing

2771
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:13,360
all the different moisture levels all

2772
01:52:11,078 --> 01:52:16,039
the way down we see the more contaminant

2773
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:17,880
because I'm always a fresh press um I

2774
01:52:16,039 --> 01:52:20,639
like the the different humidity levels

2775
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,199
around the 67 Mark for me or relative

2776
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,118
humidity in the room gives me a really

2777
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:27,519
nice press to 72 is those days and that

2778
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:30,078
moisture is really what i' be really

2779
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:32,520
paying attention at right now

2780
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:36,639
so come to the part of the video where

2781
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:38,920
we all need to hold up what uh what

2782
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:40,159
we're smoking to the camera I squeeze

2783
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,199
this in really quick because I didn't

2784
01:52:40,158 --> 01:52:46,559
want to B butcher Murphy Murray's words

2785
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:48,319
as I shouted her out um I totally don't

2786
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:50,079
know this stuff obviously as well as her

2787
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:52,078
and I hope that she is not going to care

2788
01:52:50,078 --> 01:52:54,118
that I'm quoting her we were in a group

2789
01:52:52,078 --> 01:52:56,359
of people we're talking about limine I

2790
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:58,359
just wanted to say this really quick um

2791
01:52:56,359 --> 01:53:01,319
it's fun fact the reason Citrus flavors

2792
01:52:58,359 --> 01:53:02,639
contain more waxes is because omegas are

2793
01:53:01,319 --> 01:53:06,238
very

2794
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:08,560
soluble in limine so that batch doesn't

2795
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,919
necessarily have to contain more waxes

2796
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:13,360
in the original plant matter but they

2797
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:15,440
will be easier to extract because the

2798
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:18,319
tpin are behaving like the solvents they

2799
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:21,319
are and extracting more waxes get those

2800
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:23,319
hashes up so yeah I just that that's

2801
01:53:21,319 --> 01:53:25,000
what I butchered earlier no problem

2802
01:53:23,319 --> 01:53:26,319
thanks for sharing dude get your hash up

2803
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,158
you gotta have something here I got

2804
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:30,158
kenberry diesel here all right that was

2805
01:53:28,158 --> 01:53:33,799
great info man I appreciate you uh

2806
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:37,799
telling everyone I got some Happy Valley

2807
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:40,159
hash right here oh [ __ ] Square wave and

2808
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,159
some

2809
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:50,960
garlic garlic ridiculous dude GMO

2810
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:53,239
man yeah and then I have some uh stuff I

2811
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:57,960
made at home here which is uh

2812
01:53:53,238 --> 01:54:02,799
triangle cush times sherbet which

2813
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:04,078
is I think it's time for a dab yeah yeah

2814
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:06,159
want to real quick give everybody kind

2815
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:08,880
of just a little warning that I've seen

2816
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:11,118
in the past mistake that that that took

2817
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,560
place another real quick little story

2818
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:15,000
we're talking about cold curing

2819
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,920
especially and taking our jars from the

2820
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,118
refrigerator and out and maybe storing

2821
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:21,760
them in and dabbing them and whatnot

2822
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:23,759
it's very important I've found to and

2823
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:26,199
even in in High Desert condition that I

2824
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:29,079
am here with very low relative humidity

2825
01:54:26,198 --> 01:54:31,118
um to let your jar warm up to room

2826
01:54:29,078 --> 01:54:32,920
temperature before you open it if you

2827
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:35,039
pull your jar right out of the

2828
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:37,480
refrigerator and open it and then put it

2829
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:39,760
backens you have condensation inside the

2830
01:54:37,479 --> 01:54:41,399
jar the freezer and yeah especially out

2831
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,800
of the freezer and wipe it with a paper

2832
01:54:41,399 --> 01:54:46,799
towel let it warm and then wipe it again

2833
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:48,520
and yeah I've we definitely got to teach

2834
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,679
consumers that it's super important

2835
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:51,400
because they're like you know they'll go

2836
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:53,440
for a dab it's sizzling they're like

2837
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:56,198
what the [ __ ] I thought was solventless

2838
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:57,678
what make that happen and I A buddy of

2839
01:54:56,198 --> 01:54:59,519
mine actually brought a jar over that I

2840
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:00,920
had pressed for him and he was like hey

2841
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:03,000
why does this there's like a doughnut

2842
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:04,440
shape where the outer the outside of the

2843
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,880
rosin was a different color than the

2844
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:08,759
inside of the rosin and uh and I asked

2845
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,560
him we finally deducted that he was

2846
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,360
pulling it in and out of the

2847
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:14,039
refrigerator sometimes the freezer to

2848
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:16,479
dab it and he was getting oxygen or

2849
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:19,479
oxidation uh condensation and it was

2850
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:22,479
literally mold he his

2851
01:55:19,479 --> 01:55:24,638
R yeah so it's very important you guys

2852
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:25,839
very important to let it warm up to room

2853
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:27,520
temperature if you're going to store it

2854
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,440
in the refrigerator prior to that's

2855
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:32,000
another tip good tip for people that are

2856
01:55:30,439 --> 01:55:35,158
just starting out and pressing their

2857
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,078
hash wet if they if if somebody does if

2858
01:55:35,158 --> 01:55:39,158
somebody's hearing a Sizzle while

2859
01:55:37,078 --> 01:55:41,439
they're pressing stop because your

2860
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:42,920
shit's not dried yet remember we used to

2861
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:44,879
talk about pressing back on the hair

2862
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:47,279
straight like listen for the

2863
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:50,319
sizzle it was like what are we what are

2864
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:52,800
we doing it's

2865
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:56,198
working I hear something yeah that's a

2866
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:59,360
bad sound uh so the right

2867
01:55:56,198 --> 01:56:01,519
there yeah I just take I just take my

2868
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:04,118
you know I put the

2869
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:06,040
personal I just I put my personal stash

2870
01:56:04,118 --> 01:56:08,880
in the fridge and then I freeze bulk

2871
01:56:06,039 --> 01:56:10,760
stuff with his little o it as possible

2872
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,599
right in the freezer and then whatever I

2873
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:15,679
take out of the fridge I wait I make

2874
01:56:12,599 --> 01:56:17,960
some coffee I fry an egg and then I then

2875
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:21,800
I pop that

2876
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:23,319
seal I would say it's to uh always like

2877
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:25,760
uh if you're to put anything in the

2878
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:27,319
freezer to store it to make sure yeah

2879
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,920
you have it in a sealed jar but make

2880
01:56:27,319 --> 01:56:31,759
sure it goes into a plastic bag all the

2881
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,560
way sealed or vac sealed or something

2882
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:36,800
like that even recently about two weeks

2883
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:39,599
ago at single Source I had my standup

2884
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:42,239
freezer with all my jars go out in it

2885
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:44,000
and uh like Adam was saying earlier you

2886
01:56:42,238 --> 01:56:46,359
can get condensation built up in your

2887
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,520
freezer I had some of that leak on top

2888
01:56:46,359 --> 01:56:52,359
of all my jars but all safe thankfully

2889
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:54,040
because of the bag um and all that stuff

2890
01:56:52,359 --> 01:56:55,198
so that's that's a good tip for sure

2891
01:56:54,039 --> 01:56:57,039
yeah that's a good tip for everyone

2892
01:56:55,198 --> 01:57:00,439
always make sure you got sealed bags for

2893
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:01,760
your that's a hash maker tip right there

2894
01:57:00,439 --> 01:57:03,559
yeah the other thing I've been doing

2895
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:08,000
guys is I've been induction sealing my

2896
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:11,760
jars so I got these these little tops

2897
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,520
here nice and these go right on top yep

2898
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,239
you just induction seal that right on

2899
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,159
top think about it like peanut butter

2900
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:19,000
we've been doing that with single Source

2901
01:57:17,158 --> 01:57:21,319
jars as well too it takes like two

2902
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,039
seconds man a little induction sealer

2903
01:57:21,319 --> 01:57:25,238
yeah boom and you just you just do it

2904
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:27,238
and then you know I have stuff that I've

2905
01:57:25,238 --> 01:57:29,678
been testing I've still got induction

2906
01:57:27,238 --> 01:57:31,399
sealed from a year and a half ago I'm

2907
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:33,880
going to wait another month and crack it

2908
01:57:31,399 --> 01:57:36,039
open but I can already see it per it's

2909
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:39,039
it's fine it's you know as if I just put

2910
01:57:36,039 --> 01:57:42,039
it in there dude I love so I'm gonna get

2911
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:44,800
on that hey so I just want to you know I

2912
01:57:42,039 --> 01:57:46,960
think it's just to share that I I think

2913
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:49,239
about preservation a lot and it's one of

2914
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:50,760
those things where I you know I go to a

2915
01:57:49,238 --> 01:57:53,399
lot of dispensaries all over the place

2916
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:55,360
just to kind of who what who's doing

2917
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:56,839
what and and every time I crack a jar

2918
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:58,920
it's like hit or miss some people that

2919
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:01,239
are really have super flame and I know

2920
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:04,158
they're really talented by the time I

2921
01:58:01,238 --> 01:58:06,759
get it it's just not the same I think

2922
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:11,000
that is what Johnny B talks about that

2923
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:14,639
moisture content and it it it speaks to

2924
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,800
what is the glue that was used to seal

2925
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:20,359
that thing on top of the jar in the

2926
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:22,880
first place and was it mixture of the of

2927
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:25,118
the moisture content and the tur off

2928
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:28,719
gassing from the product mixing into

2929
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:31,158
that little space slowly deading that

2930
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:33,480
glue and releasing that seal because

2931
01:58:31,158 --> 01:58:36,279
it's definitely happening with flour

2932
01:58:33,479 --> 01:58:37,598
here in the Canadian um program in in

2933
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:40,519
our

2934
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:43,560
legal the sometimes the seals the flour

2935
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:45,639
just comes so dry that you know no

2936
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:47,679
company was drying their herb that dry

2937
01:58:45,639 --> 01:58:50,880
to sell it's just that it was on the

2938
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:54,639
shelf for a long time or it was in for a

2939
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:58,920
long time the off ging or consuming that

2940
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:58,920
seal I ask every LP No One Ever

2941
01:58:59,399 --> 01:59:04,759
Knows you know that you that you're

2942
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:07,639
sealing the gar because tpin consume all

2943
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:11,199
sorts of things particular in particular

2944
01:59:07,639 --> 01:59:13,199
they're cost moisture T's gone moisture

2945
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:14,839
the less you have in the jars as well

2946
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:18,118
you know people are putting a gram in

2947
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,440
these giant jars and it oxidizes a lot

2948
01:59:18,118 --> 01:59:22,598
quicker a lot more oxygen present to it

2949
01:59:20,439 --> 01:59:24,319
yeah yeah so you need to fill the jar as

2950
01:59:22,599 --> 01:59:26,199
much as you can especially for long-term

2951
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:28,759
storage I'm not afraid to put three

2952
01:59:26,198 --> 01:59:31,198
grams in a little s mil jar you know

2953
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:35,199
five grams in there and people use these

2954
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:36,799
one o jars like this and they put a gram

2955
01:59:35,198 --> 01:59:39,638
in there or three grams in there it's

2956
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,960
just they oxidize way quick if you think

2957
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:44,000
about it look at it like a a a two liter

2958
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:46,319
of soda you know when it's full there's

2959
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:48,439
very little head of oxygen in there it

2960
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:51,158
maintains its carbonation it gets

2961
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:52,638
cracked open half of it gets poured out

2962
01:59:51,158 --> 01:59:54,279
and then now there's a huge head of

2963
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:56,319
oxygen in there which allows that

2964
01:59:54,279 --> 01:59:58,078
carbonation to fill you know because

2965
01:59:56,319 --> 01:59:59,799
it's it's it's really empty space so

2966
01:59:58,078 --> 02:00:02,639
that carbonation fills it you crack it

2967
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:04,360
open and now that that gas is gone and

2968
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:06,639
in a sense that's Turpin that's what's

2969
02:00:04,359 --> 02:00:08,078
happening with our concentrates yeah

2970
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:09,880
that's a good analogy right there

2971
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:11,920
actually and I notic that on the batter

2972
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:13,880
and the cold cure that like that

2973
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:16,319
oxidizes more than anything that's you

2974
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:18,520
know a lot of my favorite is the jam

2975
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:20,880
because it keeps that I leave mine at a

2976
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:23,560
you know room temp for weeks and it

2977
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:25,400
keeps that same consistency and somebody

2978
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:26,960
gets in there it's still nice and sugary

2979
02:00:25,399 --> 02:00:29,238
and wet and turpy and it doesn't have

2980
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:32,000
any color discoloration so yeah that's

2981
02:00:29,238 --> 02:00:34,118
that's why Jam's my favorite as far as

2982
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,679
you know getting it to the consumer a

2983
02:00:34,118 --> 02:00:37,158
month down the road when it's in their

2984
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:39,440
hands they still open it same

2985
02:00:37,158 --> 02:00:42,279
consistency it's not you know got that

2986
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:45,198
dark kind of crust on not crust but you

2987
02:00:42,279 --> 02:00:47,639
know that oxidization layer on the jam

2988
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:50,319
seems to hold up well so stored this one

2989
02:00:47,639 --> 02:00:52,840
right here for two months looks

2990
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:55,479
beautiful that's why I like in my bulk

2991
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:57,279
jars at work um filling them as much as

2992
02:00:55,479 --> 02:01:00,118
possible you know leaving a really small

2993
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:01,840
room for oxidation to happen so you

2994
02:01:00,118 --> 02:01:03,399
really can avoid that um and and we

2995
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:06,639
store everything in a cold environment

2996
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:08,759
in a in a small black box so the jars

2997
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:10,800
are in a room that's 48 degrees 50

2998
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:13,320
degrees at best and they never really

2999
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:15,320
see light until they're getting packaged

3000
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:17,759
and they go immediately out you know to

3001
02:01:15,319 --> 02:01:18,840
the shops and we make sure they go to a

3002
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:21,320
fridge or somewhere that's going to be

3003
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:23,078
stored cold yeah so that's definitely

3004
02:01:21,319 --> 02:01:25,039
full press reservation I have people

3005
02:01:23,078 --> 02:01:28,319
asking me all the time how should I cure

3006
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:30,078
my bubble uh not as much with Rosen more

3007
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:32,279
more with hash and I'm always like I'm

3008
02:01:30,078 --> 02:01:35,118
always like very simply well do you fall

3009
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:37,319
into the school of I want to preserve it

3010
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:40,598
so it's exactly like it is now for as

3011
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:43,840
long as possible or I want things to

3012
02:01:40,599 --> 02:01:45,719
change and there's really like it's it's

3013
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:47,199
kind of a one or the other for most

3014
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:50,359
people and the

3015
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:53,799
Instagram methodology of popularizing

3016
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:55,960
this and driving it to those very pretty

3017
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:58,960
pictures with that very light colored

3018
02:01:55,960 --> 02:02:00,639
hash seems very much in line with

3019
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,639
preserve the whole thing I want it to be

3020
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:04,239
exactly how it was when you took the

3021
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:05,920
picture I don't want to get it and be

3022
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:07,198
like oh it's different like it's it

3023
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:09,158
doesn't look like that anymore

3024
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:11,799
something's changed and that's

3025
02:02:09,158 --> 02:02:15,279
interesting that um we've really done a

3026
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:18,159
full 180 from the sort of from the from

3027
02:02:15,279 --> 02:02:21,279
the the original the ogs who were more

3028
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:23,198
like um cure cure you want to cure your

3029
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:25,920
even when I first learned about cured

3030
02:02:23,198 --> 02:02:29,158
resin I couldn't believe the difference

3031
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:32,480
of puffing dabbable cured full melt dry

3032
02:02:29,158 --> 02:02:35,039
sift um with no monot Turpin like those

3033
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:37,879
are the same tpin we would evaporate off

3034
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:42,279
and cure in the flower process in the

3035
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:44,520
70s 80s and 90s and 2000s and those tpin

3036
02:02:42,279 --> 02:02:46,639
are are fairly rough on the throat and

3037
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:49,480
when you when you relieve the plant of

3038
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:51,920
them a new bouquet of sesquiterpenoids

3039
02:02:49,479 --> 02:02:53,959
can uplift and kind of get under your

3040
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,480
nose and it's a different flavor profile

3041
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:59,639
and it's that cured herb well we've

3042
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:01,839
really flipped it on on on hash now it's

3043
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:04,159
like let's do some fresh frozen let's

3044
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:06,880
freeze dry it let's hit it with super

3045
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:11,519
low temp rosin but then keep it cold and

3046
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:14,319
and I appreciate both sides but I wonder

3047
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:16,599
if one will dissipate with if the old

3048
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:18,719
will go to the point where we can barely

3049
02:03:16,599 --> 02:03:22,039
find it like even having Brian talk

3050
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:23,960
about air dry was got me all excited

3051
02:03:22,039 --> 02:03:25,760
today because that's you know soon to be

3052
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:28,719
considered also a very old school

3053
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:31,400
methodology it's uh it's very neat to

3054
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:33,800
hear uh to hear that

3055
02:03:31,399 --> 02:03:36,399
difference man air drying is a tough

3056
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:39,199
thing nowadays you know you're trying to

3057
02:03:36,399 --> 02:03:41,359
pass a microbial test um you know it's

3058
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:43,879
it's really tough there there's yeast

3059
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:46,399
and bacteria there's things that live on

3060
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:49,520
Plants you know um especially if they're

3061
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:52,479
grown Outdoors uh you know and and

3062
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:54,840
indoors really for that matter so it's a

3063
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:56,799
tough thing you know you've got to that

3064
02:03:54,840 --> 02:04:00,000
freeze dryer is your best friend to help

3065
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,800
you you pass those uh microbial tests if

3066
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,719
you're a business for sure if you're

3067
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:06,960
just a random person um very different

3068
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:09,679
so I think a lot of people in the in the

3069
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:11,760
bubble world that aren't necessarily in

3070
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:13,920
the business have felt like they need to

3071
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:16,039
get themselves a freeze dryer because

3072
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:19,480
that's you know all all the Instagram

3073
02:04:16,039 --> 02:04:21,319
hash is freeze dried I definitely from a

3074
02:04:19,479 --> 02:04:23,279
business perspective yeah you definitely

3075
02:04:21,319 --> 02:04:25,599
have to have one just like you should

3076
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:27,359
probably have an autoclave to clean all

3077
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:28,960
the components of your water hash

3078
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,479
equipment probably you shouldn't be

3079
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:33,599
using plastic washers and such uh you

3080
02:04:31,479 --> 02:04:36,598
should have stainless steel and and and

3081
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:38,199
be able to Absolut properly because

3082
02:04:36,599 --> 02:04:40,400
everything changes when you go from like

3083
02:04:38,198 --> 02:04:43,558
Joe Blow I'm at home just making my own

3084
02:04:40,399 --> 02:04:45,920
hash to I am entering the marketplace

3085
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:48,079
and I'm going to make also you know the

3086
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,800
the freeze dryer is also like really

3087
02:04:48,078 --> 02:04:52,920
necessary for anything that's not dried

3088
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:54,800
cured trim you know if you're running

3089
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:56,599
fresh Frozen I mean sure people have

3090
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,159
been microplaning and doing things like

3091
02:04:56,599 --> 02:05:02,119
that and bless all the people that have

3092
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:04,558
gotten to the the cured Mt without

3093
02:05:02,118 --> 02:05:06,799
having the freeze dryer but it the

3094
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:10,360
reality is man like that stuff is all

3095
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:14,199
fresh it's it's really susceptible to

3096
02:05:10,359 --> 02:05:15,558
mold yeah the free drers have been huge

3097
02:05:14,198 --> 02:05:19,479
when it comes to processing a ton of

3098
02:05:15,559 --> 02:05:22,800
material at a time too um big time there

3099
02:05:19,479 --> 02:05:25,479
days that we'll do 20 grams you know in

3100
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,719
the cold room and thinking about having

3101
02:05:25,479 --> 02:05:29,879
to go and and see that and everything

3102
02:05:27,719 --> 02:05:31,880
and put it on racks would be a nightmare

3103
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:34,159
um but I do have a friend up in Seattle

3104
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:35,639
that does it Head Hunter extracts you

3105
02:05:34,158 --> 02:05:38,279
should check him out he washes for

3106
02:05:35,639 --> 02:05:40,118
consolation cannabis oh yeah yeah he's

3107
02:05:38,279 --> 02:05:41,439
air drying a lot of stuff you know what

3108
02:05:40,118 --> 02:05:43,920
I mean and he's having to take it

3109
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:45,399
through testing and and all that and he

3110
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,880
does a really great job so feel free to

3111
02:05:45,399 --> 02:05:48,359
check that guy out if you're interested

3112
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,039
in learning how to do air drying

3113
02:05:48,359 --> 02:05:52,439
techniques on a legal Mass scale you

3114
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:54,479
know yeah

3115
02:05:52,439 --> 02:05:56,319
Gold Leaf up here is also doing that

3116
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:58,598
same thing they've been they've never

3117
02:05:56,319 --> 02:06:01,118
been on the freeze dry tip they you know

3118
02:05:58,599 --> 02:06:04,239
they um

3119
02:06:01,118 --> 02:06:06,719
yeah freeze really allowed it to scale

3120
02:06:04,238 --> 02:06:09,799
and that's the you know when I started

3121
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:12,679
in the late 9s you know it was it's all

3122
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:15,360
I had it's all there was it was just air

3123
02:06:12,679 --> 02:06:17,118
dry everything and you know we didn't at

3124
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:19,679
the time when I started it was it was

3125
02:06:17,118 --> 02:06:22,439
like patties it wasn't even we weren't

3126
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:23,239
even at the point of of of compling yet

3127
02:06:22,439 --> 02:06:26,158
at

3128
02:06:23,238 --> 02:06:29,078
that yeah it was just like you know

3129
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:31,479
you're yeah you put it exactly you put

3130
02:06:29,078 --> 02:06:33,519
it into a ball a mixture of like all

3131
02:06:31,479 --> 02:06:36,799
these techniques you know what I mean it

3132
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:38,280
wasn't where we're at now so it's finger

3133
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:40,480
my point

3134
02:06:38,279 --> 02:06:42,000
is you know we' we've gotten to this

3135
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:43,479
place and I don't think one is better

3136
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,639
than the other I just think they're

3137
02:06:43,479 --> 02:06:48,238
they're they're tools that you can you

3138
02:06:45,639 --> 02:06:51,039
can really apply to the same methodology

3139
02:06:48,238 --> 02:06:54,479
well get phenomenal definitely easier

3140
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:56,078
and better from a perspective of don't

3141
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:59,039
have the time the energy and the

3142
02:06:56,078 --> 02:07:01,840
awareness that Head Hunter and the other

3143
02:06:59,039 --> 02:07:04,039
was mentioned uh you know that there's a

3144
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:05,800
there's a deeper level of of awareness

3145
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:10,078
that needs to be occurred now where

3146
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:13,039
you're like okay like maintain free

3147
02:07:10,078 --> 02:07:14,158
water hats that were air like 20 kilos

3148
02:07:13,039 --> 02:07:16,599
at a

3149
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:17,519
time yeah that's and then you have all

3150
02:07:16,599 --> 02:07:19,800
the

3151
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:23,400
microbal aspects that you have to fight

3152
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:25,480
against and it's it's T man you really

3153
02:07:23,399 --> 02:07:26,799
gota know got pictures of his room uh

3154
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:28,638
you guys should check it out he's got a

3155
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,239
lot of pictures and videos and stuff of

3156
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:33,719
the room he works in and it's very

3157
02:07:30,238 --> 02:07:36,799
impressive setup is sick it's it's a you

3158
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:39,359
know it was really one of the it is the

3159
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:42,800
best facility I've seen yet honestly I

3160
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:45,558
got T A couple years ago Head Hunter

3161
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:48,440
extracts he works for constellation

3162
02:07:45,559 --> 02:07:52,559
cannabis he's the lab manager that

3163
02:07:48,439 --> 02:07:54,238
processes K helped build that place

3164
02:07:52,559 --> 02:07:57,279
yeah getting the tour of that cold room

3165
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:59,919
was pretty cool um it's it's very very

3166
02:07:57,279 --> 02:08:02,279
legit they got everything you need for

3167
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:04,639
sure how do you think how do you guys uh

3168
02:08:02,279 --> 02:08:06,639
think this all reflects on the press the

3169
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:08,359
freeze-dried method versus the air dried

3170
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:10,400
method you think there's much of a

3171
02:08:08,359 --> 02:08:12,000
difference as far as the amount of

3172
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:15,118
oxidation that's already

3173
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,800
happened darker darker rosin with the

3174
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:19,598
air dry I would say you know the freeze

3175
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:21,679
dryer is going to get you that really

3176
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:24,199
it's going to preserve that color which

3177
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:26,719
is so important to so many people in the

3178
02:08:24,198 --> 02:08:29,519
market is to have that really light

3179
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:32,279
blant just beautiful rosin even though

3180
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:35,960
some darker rosins can be just amazingly

3181
02:08:32,279 --> 02:08:38,158
tasty absolutely that to me I like and

3182
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:40,520
fresher fresher tpin actually because in

3183
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:41,479
the drying process you're also curing so

3184
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:43,880
you're you're getting a little bit of a

3185
02:08:41,479 --> 02:08:46,399
cured resin there so there's a little

3186
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:49,719
bit of a fresher taste um you know when

3187
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:51,879
you use a a freeze dryer and then myself

3188
02:08:49,719 --> 02:08:55,000
because I've failed so many times at at

3189
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:56,800
at at drying hash air drying hash

3190
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,039
there's a moisture content thing as well

3191
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:00,320
there's a too soon you know so it kind

3192
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:02,198
of takes that guess work out of there

3193
02:09:00,319 --> 02:09:03,840
I've actually pressed hash before that

3194
02:09:02,198 --> 02:09:06,319
wasn't fully dry and ended up with wet

3195
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:08,840
rosin and it's a it's a disappointment

3196
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:11,158
you know so my hats off to you guys that

3197
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:14,078
air dry because it's it is an old school

3198
02:09:11,158 --> 02:09:16,879
technique as far as I'm concerned uh and

3199
02:09:14,078 --> 02:09:18,639
I can't do it so just wanted to say

3200
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,520
think from a lab perspective bought a

3201
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:22,400
freeze dryer yet I do look into

3202
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:24,159
investing in one of those especially

3203
02:09:22,399 --> 02:09:26,479
next season just to make it more

3204
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:28,158
efficient because obviously I I believe

3205
02:09:26,479 --> 02:09:30,558
it's more efficient to make hash with

3206
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:32,598
the freeze dry dry hash just want to

3207
02:09:30,559 --> 02:09:35,199
make it very clear that I I do I've done

3208
02:09:32,599 --> 02:09:40,639
a lot you know I've I've dried fields of

3209
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:42,919
resin and um my Max is 250 grams um you

3210
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:45,480
know I'm not I'm not putting thousands

3211
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:47,158
of grams in a freeze dryer and doing it

3212
02:09:45,479 --> 02:09:49,479
you know like I've never made that much

3213
02:09:47,158 --> 02:09:51,519
Ash I've always done it in increments

3214
02:09:49,479 --> 02:09:54,678
you know I if I was going to I could do

3215
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:56,880
400 grams but I would hate my life so I

3216
02:09:54,679 --> 02:09:59,840
want to live my best life so I'm I'm

3217
02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:03,679
staying at 250 that's my max out and

3218
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:05,920
Grading all R hashes is quite the task

3219
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:08,719
but you can get it done I I dry little

3220
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:11,039
dollops that I've dried evenly and kept

3221
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:13,840
cold I believe that there's a window

3222
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:15,319
where you Ru the hash if you're grading

3223
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:17,199
too late I feel like the majority of

3224
02:10:15,319 --> 02:10:19,479
people that have tried to dry in the

3225
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:21,598
past throughout history have used the

3226
02:10:19,479 --> 02:10:24,078
microflame as an you need to work your

3227
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:26,279
mic uh your microphone's coming in

3228
02:10:24,078 --> 02:10:28,158
people say they can't hear you but that

3229
02:10:26,279 --> 02:10:30,719
kind of reminded me of uh Goldilocks

3230
02:10:28,158 --> 02:10:33,558
you're doing things on a larger scale

3231
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:35,439
what uh what kind of uh kind of

3232
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:37,079
obstacles are you bumping into turning

3233
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:39,638
all that you're doing bubble hash into

3234
02:10:37,078 --> 02:10:42,078
Rosen or yeah yeah so what I would say

3235
02:10:39,639 --> 02:10:44,159
is I would say the um freeze dryer is

3236
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:45,920
the most important thing for doing just

3237
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:47,719
getting everything the same every time

3238
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:49,039
you know in a la in a lab setting you

3239
02:10:47,719 --> 02:10:52,760
want to be able to

3240
02:10:49,039 --> 02:10:54,679
control all of your everything you can

3241
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:57,520
so you can replicate the same thing over

3242
02:10:54,679 --> 02:11:01,679
and over with the same strains and and

3243
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:03,599
um so I think the freeze dryer is like

3244
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:05,520
number one in that process you know so I

3245
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:08,800
can just you could be pumping out hash

3246
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:11,840
so that's that's that deal for us and

3247
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:14,360
then um yeah I'm like more of a large

3248
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,719
scale I think it's all about just having

3249
02:11:14,359 --> 02:11:19,078
a system where everything's running

3250
02:11:17,719 --> 02:11:22,599
consistently through you're not ever

3251
02:11:19,078 --> 02:11:25,039
storing anything until it's into like

3252
02:11:22,599 --> 02:11:26,920
it's it's either in hash form or it's

3253
02:11:25,039 --> 02:11:30,078
being pressed directly into rousin and

3254
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:31,800
then being cured from that point um I

3255
02:11:30,078 --> 02:11:33,479
know a lot of people have used uh the

3256
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:38,199
heat mats in the

3257
02:11:33,479 --> 02:11:41,479
past um with the jams and the other

3258
02:11:38,198 --> 02:11:44,719
things I I I uh we we did too it's

3259
02:11:41,479 --> 02:11:46,558
always been with um experimentation but

3260
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:50,158
I've always wanted to get like as exact

3261
02:11:46,559 --> 02:11:52,079
as possible so we have um incubators

3262
02:11:50,158 --> 02:11:53,759
actually that we use for the jars when

3263
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:55,799
we're when we're going to do curing like

3264
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:57,480
that so we can have it like fine tuned

3265
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:01,279
to an exact temperature for an exact

3266
02:11:57,479 --> 02:12:05,198
amount of time um and I find I find that

3267
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:06,719
helps a lot um it's on a large scale

3268
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:08,519
it's all about being able to do the same

3269
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:10,279
thing over and over and over and what

3270
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:13,480
you like what kind of numbers are you

3271
02:12:10,279 --> 02:12:17,118
rocking you're using a Whistler Tech w

3272
02:12:13,479 --> 02:12:19,598
three a 300 WT right yeah yeah yeah so

3273
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:22,238
we'll W we'll run like about 40 pounds

3274
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:25,719
uh like a wash you know

3275
02:12:22,238 --> 02:12:29,158
about um and then that'll process

3276
02:12:25,719 --> 02:12:31,760
through and on a given day I mean we're

3277
02:12:29,158 --> 02:12:35,359
processing about 300 pounds of rosin on

3278
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:38,960
a daily basis it depends

3279
02:12:35,359 --> 02:12:42,479
on Rin no not a Rin we're we're

3280
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:44,158
processing like three to 800 pounds I'm

3281
02:12:42,479 --> 02:12:47,279
sorry no

3282
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:49,479
no the hash through I mean we'll we'll

3283
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:53,238
press out like five six pounds a day you

3284
02:12:49,479 --> 02:12:56,598
know uh d that's still a lot brother

3285
02:12:53,238 --> 02:12:59,759
what kind of you get out of we got two

3286
02:12:56,599 --> 02:13:01,639
sasquash m1's that we use and it's like

3287
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:04,480
I try to have everything di as dialed as

3288
02:13:01,639 --> 02:13:07,559
possible you know um we'll Rock ma

3289
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:08,959
multiple machines at the same time um I

3290
02:13:07,559 --> 02:13:11,000
don't know that I would call A lot of it

3291
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:12,520
moisture content because with the freeze

3292
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,840
dryer you're getting all that moisture

3293
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:17,800
out I think a lot of the curing process

3294
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:20,119
is t wait a second that's wrong

3295
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:21,880
information you're not [ __ ] hash John

3296
02:13:20,118 --> 02:13:24,558
not weed

3297
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:27,039
oh even with the so I think I think

3298
02:13:24,559 --> 02:13:29,199
moisture is extremely important to talk

3299
02:13:27,039 --> 02:13:31,319
about with flour pressing flour all day

3300
02:13:29,198 --> 02:13:32,919
all day because when it comes to Hash I

3301
02:13:31,319 --> 02:13:35,840
mean we're getting all the moisture out

3302
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:38,599
for the most part in the hash and it's

3303
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:40,239
all basically the same so I I think what

3304
02:13:38,599 --> 02:13:43,000
whoever was saying something about lemon

3305
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:45,519
or whatever um different Tarpin are have

3306
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,399
different volatilities so I think that

3307
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,679
has a lot to do with it I don't I don't

3308
02:13:47,399 --> 02:13:51,479
think I think the point is get all the

3309
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:53,158
moisture out of your hash before you

3310
02:13:51,479 --> 02:13:56,118
press

3311
02:13:53,158 --> 02:13:59,439
it uh I will I will say a lot of people

3312
02:13:56,118 --> 02:14:02,679
are um producing wet hash so with a

3313
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:04,519
freeze dryer it all depends on how

3314
02:14:02,679 --> 02:14:06,399
you're you know you're rocking your

3315
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:08,000
freeze dryer and what temperatures

3316
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:10,118
you're using and things like that you

3317
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,399
know definitely you obviously producing

3318
02:14:10,118 --> 02:14:14,839
that much constantly know how to get

3319
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:16,960
your hash you know to what you need to

3320
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:18,480
get it but uh unfortunately there's lots

3321
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:21,520
of people who are misinformed with the

3322
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:23,158
freeze dryer even and uh are trying to

3323
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,800
you know dry at much too low

3324
02:14:23,158 --> 02:14:26,839
temperatures and not achieving triple

3325
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:29,239
points absolutely anytime you buy any

3326
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:32,920
equipment the equipment is not going to

3327
02:14:29,238 --> 02:14:34,759
save you in any terms of making anything

3328
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:37,440
ever you still have to know how to run

3329
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:40,039
the equipment and to do it correctly

3330
02:14:37,439 --> 02:14:42,039
definitely always I'll always say that

3331
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:43,439
I'll say yeah moisture content real

3332
02:14:42,039 --> 02:14:47,118
quick sorry moisture content is

3333
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:48,479
definitely 100% like the number one

3334
02:14:47,118 --> 02:14:49,839
variable and I think we've all been

3335
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:51,879
taught that since the beginning like

3336
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:54,440
once again I learned from watch watching

3337
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:57,118
Bubble Man videos and I you know I used

3338
02:14:54,439 --> 02:14:59,839
to grate everything and I was from the

3339
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:01,839
microp plane so we were always competing

3340
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,480
with fresh frozen trying to get that dry

3341
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:06,920
with a microplane you know so I'm

3342
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:10,000
talking more of a post post press post

3343
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:12,239
press I don't know that it's about moist

3344
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,158
content at that point I'm saying post

3345
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:15,359
press production when you're talking

3346
02:15:14,158 --> 02:15:17,158
about their different texts and your

3347
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:18,839
different curing and your oxidation and

3348
02:15:17,158 --> 02:15:21,399
all that I think it I don't I don't

3349
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:23,880
think moisture content is coming into it

3350
02:15:21,399 --> 02:15:26,799
as much unless you're introducing the

3351
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:29,199
fridge and and storing it incorrectly I

3352
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:31,840
think it's more so tpin and than the

3353
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:33,839
volatility of different tpes react

3354
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:35,440
absolutely um let me just throw in

3355
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,559
something I had a headphone issue sorry

3356
02:15:35,439 --> 02:15:39,319
about that um hope everybody can hear me

3357
02:15:37,559 --> 02:15:41,199
this time make it quick I'll make it

3358
02:15:39,319 --> 02:15:42,599
real quick I just wanted to say from a

3359
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:44,118
perspect from a person's perspective

3360
02:15:42,599 --> 02:15:45,559
that can't afford a freeze dryer they're

3361
02:15:44,118 --> 02:15:46,839
just growing six plants legally in

3362
02:15:45,559 --> 02:15:48,400
California wherever you are I don't know

3363
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:50,199
the legal limit on your plant account

3364
02:15:48,399 --> 02:15:52,399
anyways you're doing a really small

3365
02:15:50,198 --> 02:15:54,558
batch it is possible to get dry hash I

3366
02:15:52,399 --> 02:15:56,839
just want to say if you keep that room

3367
02:15:54,559 --> 02:15:58,360
cold and you dollop out the hash really

3368
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:01,639
nice and evenly and that that you're

3369
02:15:58,359 --> 02:16:03,399
drying those dollops cold and then you

3370
02:16:01,639 --> 02:16:04,960
take out each dollop one by one and you

3371
02:16:03,399 --> 02:16:06,679
dry that with a microplane and instead

3372
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,880
of using the microplane as an emergency

3373
02:16:06,679 --> 02:16:10,639
tool like most people did you know they

3374
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,039
try to se first or do whatever but it's

3375
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:13,400
like no I mean like you know especially

3376
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:15,078
if it's fresh frozen you're going to

3377
02:16:13,399 --> 02:16:16,719
just have a hell of a time and you're

3378
02:16:15,078 --> 02:16:18,399
wasting a lot that's a lot of money so

3379
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:20,279
like I in my opinion I want to dry it I

3380
02:16:18,399 --> 02:16:21,558
don't care if I'm shredding heads at

3381
02:16:20,279 --> 02:16:24,158
this point you know you're so small

3382
02:16:21,559 --> 02:16:26,480
scale let's just keep that in mind let's

3383
02:16:24,158 --> 02:16:28,519
dry that that really resin really

3384
02:16:26,479 --> 02:16:31,319
quickly I can get it dry in 10 to 12

3385
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:33,120
hours I scrape it right up it's in a jar

3386
02:16:31,319 --> 02:16:36,079
it's cold you know what I'm saying like

3387
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:38,319
so just just you know the Layman at home

3388
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:40,359
that is watching this you can dry hash

3389
02:16:38,318 --> 02:16:41,558
without a freeze dryer it is awesome to

3390
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:44,000
buy a freeze dryer especially if you're

3391
02:16:41,558 --> 02:16:46,638
making hash on a large scale just like I

3392
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,200
was saying I max out at 250 my wrists

3393
02:16:46,638 --> 02:16:49,679
start hurting you know I get the 40

3394
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:51,639
Micron and I'm like I want to throw this

3395
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:54,040
in the trash but don't throw it in the

3396
02:16:51,638 --> 02:16:56,839
trash you know so anyways that's all I

3397
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:58,359
wanted to say guys well let's freeze

3398
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:00,120
dryer because someone did have a

3399
02:16:58,359 --> 02:17:01,639
question you know they said okay well

3400
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:03,240
like does anyone want to drop some

3401
02:17:01,638 --> 02:17:05,438
knowledge on the freeze dryer does

3402
02:17:03,239 --> 02:17:07,599
anyone H have any settings they want to

3403
02:17:05,439 --> 02:17:09,519
share or any any tricks and tips they've

3404
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:10,880
learned with the freeze dryer because

3405
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:12,800
that's what someone's specifically

3406
02:17:10,879 --> 02:17:15,398
asking for in chat if anyone wants to

3407
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:17,478
share you're up I mean the only thing

3408
02:17:15,398 --> 02:17:19,439
that you really gotta be sure of the

3409
02:17:17,478 --> 02:17:21,519
main thing is that like everybody knows

3410
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:24,519
the the sell the Shelf it's the Shelf

3411
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:26,000
limit you got to drop that to 30 degrees

3412
02:17:24,519 --> 02:17:28,359
or else you're going to cook your hash

3413
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,959
which I'm sure maybe every one of us has

3414
02:17:28,359 --> 02:17:32,318
unfortunately done and I did you know

3415
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:35,239
but that's the main thing you got to

3416
02:17:32,318 --> 02:17:36,718
draw drop that shelf limit to 30 and you

3417
02:17:35,239 --> 02:17:38,558
got to save the setting which is pain in

3418
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:39,799
the ass but call the customer service

3419
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:42,638
they'll walk you through it yeah it's

3420
02:17:39,799 --> 02:17:45,759
pretty simple my settings are shelf

3421
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:50,159
shelf limit is actually at 40 on mine um

3422
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:51,559
I us do yeah I usually do a and but it's

3423
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:53,000
interesting to hear different people's

3424
02:17:51,558 --> 02:17:55,518
because I I love to hear this especially

3425
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:59,000
from this over here I think I think

3426
02:17:55,519 --> 02:18:03,760
mine's at 35 actually you got 60 oh okay

3427
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:06,000
my oh 60 wow 50 50 oh wow okay sh 50 and

3428
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:07,960
actually you know the unit has issues if

3429
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,760
you set it lower than that my unit

3430
02:18:07,959 --> 02:18:13,239
specifically like that's you know it's

3431
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:16,159
an earlier one and I feel like uh it

3432
02:18:13,239 --> 02:18:18,879
it's got it throws this error where it

3433
02:18:16,159 --> 02:18:20,119
can't detect the temperature I think for

3434
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:21,199
those of us that have freeze dryers

3435
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:22,800
let's go through that let's go through

3436
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,920
what we have for a freeze dryer and what

3437
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:28,000
those couple little settings are and and

3438
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:30,398
also to add to that what vacs are people

3439
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,638
using sure there you go so I have an oil

3440
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:36,478
vac small pharmaceutical freeze dryer my

3441
02:18:33,638 --> 02:18:38,438
shelf limit is set to 40 my freeze time

3442
02:18:36,478 --> 02:18:40,318
is for the most part generally just

3443
02:18:38,439 --> 02:18:42,280
straight nine hours I I do have the

3444
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:44,519
ability to drop that a little bit but

3445
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:46,800
that's a that's a whole another story um

3446
02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:48,960
the the central dry portion of the

3447
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:52,039
freeze dryer is automatic it's you can't

3448
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:55,478
change that my final dry is generally 14

3449
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:58,120
hours done and done um yeah that's my

3450
02:18:55,478 --> 02:19:01,239
settings I run a medium pharmaceutical

3451
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:04,639
two of them so seven trays in each one

3452
02:19:01,239 --> 02:19:06,359
um set them to 30 degrees each um and it

3453
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:09,438
all depends on tray thickness too on how

3454
02:19:06,359 --> 02:19:11,200
fast those trays are going to dry um uh

3455
02:19:09,439 --> 02:19:12,840
so we we do a lot of processing so you

3456
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:14,479
lay thicker trays sometimes those do

3457
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:16,478
need to dry for a little bit longer than

3458
02:19:14,478 --> 02:19:18,079
some of the smaller trays that only have

3459
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:20,279
you know 100 grams on them or something

3460
02:19:18,079 --> 02:19:23,079
like that um but yeah I like to run them

3461
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:24,880
at 30 degrees um the dry I pre-freeze

3462
02:19:23,079 --> 02:19:26,239
the slab so I don't do the the freeze

3463
02:19:24,879 --> 02:19:28,159
setting really I do get the freeze

3464
02:19:26,239 --> 02:19:29,760
dryers cold um so they're nice and

3465
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:31,359
Frozen inside but I don't freeze the

3466
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:33,398
trays in there I freeze them in a chest

3467
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:37,439
freezer or in the big fre a whole

3468
02:19:33,398 --> 02:19:38,718
another story same yeah for sure um and

3469
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:41,280
then you can uh slide them into the

3470
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:43,598
freezer when they're ready and you know

3471
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:45,599
do the drying process then um and I've

3472
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:48,159
got experience running the oiless pumps

3473
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:51,079
and the oil pumps with the Harvest Right

3474
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:53,000
units um but yeah dry times can vary

3475
02:19:51,079 --> 02:19:55,439
anywhere between from like 12 to 18

3476
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,439
hours depending on the thickness of the

3477
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:58,960
tray itself now what's the main

3478
02:19:57,439 --> 02:20:01,120
difference between the pharmaceutical

3479
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:03,559
and the the

3480
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:06,880
regular the big difference I found too

3481
02:20:03,559 --> 02:20:08,279
though was I was working in a facility

3482
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:10,759
where the power would go out every now

3483
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:12,840
and then and we were using a whole unit

3484
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:15,120
there the power went out and when I came

3485
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:17,520
back the next day it was concrete all

3486
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:19,479
the hash was like concrete the the unit

3487
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:21,800
will Resort back to the hottest settings

3488
02:20:19,478 --> 02:20:24,679
when it turns back on so the sh the

3489
02:20:21,799 --> 02:20:26,840
shelves are at like 125 degrees you can

3490
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:28,318
actually set that setting so that that

3491
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:32,239
doesn't happen because it's the same

3492
02:20:28,318 --> 02:20:32,239
exact happen to me that thing is

3493
02:20:32,639 --> 02:20:37,959
gone you if you have the old unit you

3494
02:20:35,478 --> 02:20:39,719
can definitely set that limit down uh

3495
02:20:37,959 --> 02:20:41,079
you know just just call up tech support

3496
02:20:39,719 --> 02:20:42,719
and they'll they'll walk you through

3497
02:20:41,079 --> 02:20:44,719
putting it to that so when the power

3498
02:20:42,719 --> 02:20:48,478
fails and it comes back on it's not

3499
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:52,119
gonna go to 125 yeah good to know that

3500
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:52,119
we've all done that

3501
02:20:56,359 --> 02:21:00,079
will not do

3502
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:01,479
that I've seen some weird stuff with

3503
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:04,280
some of the Farm School units but you

3504
02:21:01,478 --> 02:21:06,959
can also buy um tray conversions kits

3505
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:08,560
for for smaller if you need more tray

3506
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:10,839
space or something and you already have

3507
02:21:08,559 --> 02:21:13,079
a smaller medium um you can get

3508
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:17,000
conversion kits that will add you extra

3509
02:21:13,079 --> 02:21:18,959
trays so you don't have there's a lot of

3510
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,879
oh wow that's awesome you can get a you

3511
02:21:18,959 --> 02:21:23,679
can actually get a seven tray kit yeah

3512
02:21:21,879 --> 02:21:25,519
so you see how much space there is in

3513
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:27,800
between there so you can shrink those

3514
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:30,200
trays in half and have double the trays

3515
02:21:27,799 --> 02:21:31,799
in there call Harvest Right and they'll

3516
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:33,840
set you up with that I've done that

3517
02:21:31,799 --> 02:21:35,279
before myself yeah visited the Harvest

3518
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:37,520
Right headquarters when I was having

3519
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:38,880
problems with mine um kind of a little

3520
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:40,840
bit of a horror story but I I put my

3521
02:21:38,879 --> 02:21:43,239
freeze dryer in my car and drove to

3522
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:45,120
their headquarters pulled up in the back

3523
02:21:43,239 --> 02:21:46,959
it's my unit it was a little bit of a

3524
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:48,160
nightmare but in the process we formed a

3525
02:21:46,959 --> 02:21:49,879
little bit of a relationship and I

3526
02:21:48,159 --> 02:21:53,280
actually got to ask a bunch of questions

3527
02:21:49,879 --> 02:21:56,000
and supposed ly and I'm not I don't know

3528
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:57,280
much about the freeze dryers but besides

3529
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,040
um you know just the different shelving

3530
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:03,000
units that they have you know stock um

3531
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:04,319
the the pharmaceutical or the uh yeah

3532
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:07,318
the pharmaceutical one will come with

3533
02:22:04,318 --> 02:22:08,799
the Shelf limit set at 40 standard and

3534
02:22:07,318 --> 02:22:10,199
by the way you can change your Perman

3535
02:22:08,799 --> 02:22:11,599
permanent settings from your current

3536
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:13,000
settings I don't know if you guys know

3537
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,840
that there's buttons there's

3538
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:17,239
miscellaneous buttons in Upper rightand

3539
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:20,159
corners and [ __ ] yeah little butt might

3540
02:22:17,239 --> 02:22:21,879
be showing those things right now so um

3541
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:23,799
what was I getting at Oh supposedly

3542
02:22:21,879 --> 02:22:25,239
there's there's higher grade

3543
02:22:23,799 --> 02:22:26,959
instrumentation devices in the

3544
02:22:25,239 --> 02:22:28,760
pharmaceutical units whatever the hell

3545
02:22:26,959 --> 02:22:30,239
that means yeah that's what I was going

3546
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:32,478
to say is that there's better software

3547
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:34,079
in the pharmaceutical versions um and

3548
02:22:32,478 --> 02:22:36,679
just to touch on freeze dryers real

3549
02:22:34,079 --> 02:22:38,000
quick too there's um another company

3550
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:40,079
well there's multiple companies right

3551
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,359
now working on multiple different freeze

3552
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:45,719
dryers and stuff um I've been working on

3553
02:22:42,359 --> 02:22:48,600
this one by a company called lab conco

3554
02:22:45,719 --> 02:22:50,519
and it has like say uh you know with the

3555
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:52,399
Harvest Right mostly especially with the

3556
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:55,479
home edition you can't like you set it

3557
02:22:52,398 --> 02:22:57,239
one variable temperature um for your for

3558
02:22:55,478 --> 02:23:00,318
your shelves this one you can change it

3559
02:22:57,239 --> 02:23:02,719
by the minute by 30 seconds by whatever

3560
02:23:00,318 --> 02:23:04,879
you want you can ramp it up and down can

3561
02:23:02,719 --> 02:23:06,719
you change individual shelves

3562
02:23:04,879 --> 02:23:09,039
temperatures there's also probes that

3563
02:23:06,719 --> 02:23:10,478
you can freeze inside of your patties so

3564
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:13,200
you have like a little probe that comes

3565
02:23:10,478 --> 02:23:15,278
out right you put your Patty right on

3566
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:16,640
top of it and you freeze it like that

3567
02:23:15,279 --> 02:23:18,800
and then you throw those into your

3568
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:21,680
freeze dryer and uh it'll actually tell

3569
02:23:18,799 --> 02:23:23,159
you the moisture content and actually

3570
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:25,398
you know like it tells you a bunch of

3571
02:23:23,159 --> 02:23:27,639
different variables dude sounds amazing

3572
02:23:25,398 --> 02:23:31,039
it comes with an Edwards pump as well um

3573
02:23:27,639 --> 02:23:32,840
they just hit MJ Biz this last uh this

3574
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:35,240
last one I think the only problem that

3575
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:37,719
I've seen with it so far is that say

3576
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:40,478
with the Harvest Right it gets freezing

3577
02:23:37,719 --> 02:23:44,278
cold you know within you know say like

3578
02:23:40,478 --> 02:23:47,000
-30 to70 on some of the units I've seen

3579
02:23:44,279 --> 02:23:48,600
Fen height this one has a huge coil in

3580
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:51,040
it but it doesn't get the environment

3581
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:53,318
that cold so getting your getting your

3582
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:55,960
shelf temperature below 40 45 or

3583
02:23:53,318 --> 02:23:57,519
whatever your ambient temperature is is

3584
02:23:55,959 --> 02:24:00,079
really hard to do so what I was getting

3585
02:23:57,520 --> 02:24:02,600
at is that freeze drying technology has

3586
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:05,719
been around obviously longer than we've

3587
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:07,399
been drying hash with it um there's tons

3588
02:24:05,719 --> 02:24:09,039
of different types that you can check

3589
02:24:07,398 --> 02:24:10,398
out and like do lots of different thing

3590
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:11,800
I think where the Harvest Right is

3591
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:13,959
better is like what I brought up it

3592
02:24:11,799 --> 02:24:16,318
keeps the environment like freeze or

3593
02:24:13,959 --> 02:24:17,759
cold or colder and preserves your tpin

3594
02:24:16,318 --> 02:24:19,039
and they don't change or cure or

3595
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:22,760
anything like that and you can get that

3596
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:24,880
beach sand consistency you know um but

3597
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:27,600
as far as like variable temperatures I I

3598
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:29,759
don't I think telling everybody that 30

3599
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:31,640
or 40 degrees is the way to do it is

3600
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:34,639
kind of a farce to be honest because you

3601
02:24:31,639 --> 02:24:36,799
can get your hash done obviously at any

3602
02:24:34,639 --> 02:24:38,799
different temperature it's just what you

3603
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:40,278
think is the best marketable way to put

3604
02:24:38,799 --> 02:24:43,239
out your hash you know that's all I want

3605
02:24:40,279 --> 02:24:45,920
to get out is like well you could cook

3606
02:24:43,239 --> 02:24:47,279
it at 90 degrees and get it into a

3607
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,398
grease if you're just going to press it

3608
02:24:47,279 --> 02:24:51,159
into rosin anyways it won't necessarily

3609
02:24:49,398 --> 02:24:53,278
affect your color too much if it's fresh

3610
02:24:51,159 --> 02:24:55,119
frozen and things like that you know

3611
02:24:53,279 --> 02:24:57,479
it's just how long and how far you want

3612
02:24:55,120 --> 02:25:00,120
to take to like for me it takes about 20

3613
02:24:57,478 --> 02:25:02,278
hours I do depending on once again if

3614
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:04,840
it's a summer if it's summer and I live

3615
02:25:02,279 --> 02:25:06,800
in Colorado there's not a lot of um

3616
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:08,559
moisture ambient moisture outside or

3617
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:11,879
anything like that so I'd like to keep

3618
02:25:08,559 --> 02:25:13,760
it a little like more stable so I'll dry

3619
02:25:11,879 --> 02:25:15,959
my hash at 60 plus degrees in the

3620
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:19,000
Harvest Right just because so when it

3621
02:25:15,959 --> 02:25:20,799
comes out Mount that it's more stable

3622
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,719
like you know but in the in the win when

3623
02:25:20,799 --> 02:25:25,719
there's it's cold out in Colorado right

3624
02:25:22,719 --> 02:25:27,478
now it's snowing still um but you can

3625
02:25:25,719 --> 02:25:29,358
get away with drying your Hash a lot

3626
02:25:27,478 --> 02:25:32,239
colder and it's staying stable for

3627
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:34,720
longer because of the ambient moisture

3628
02:25:32,239 --> 02:25:36,279
and everything around you temperature

3629
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:38,599
you don't feel like that's pulling more

3630
02:25:36,279 --> 02:25:40,760
turps the hotter you dry it correct I

3631
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:42,880
mean we know that it pulls turps freeze

3632
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:44,279
dryers do period so correct yeah so

3633
02:25:42,879 --> 02:25:46,000
that's what I'm getting at it's all

3634
02:25:44,279 --> 02:25:47,680
variable of what you think is best and

3635
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,359
what you want to give to your consumer

3636
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:53,159
so for me once again I want the most

3637
02:25:50,359 --> 02:25:55,399
stable resin with no moisture in it and

3638
02:25:53,159 --> 02:25:58,279
then to press that and refine it from

3639
02:25:55,398 --> 02:26:01,519
there and even so say refining your your

3640
02:25:58,279 --> 02:26:03,279
rosin from cold cure to any type of oven

3641
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:06,120
Tech or mechanical separation like

3642
02:26:03,279 --> 02:26:09,000
rackin does all those tpin are going to

3643
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:10,520
change you know um from all those

3644
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:12,000
different processes and I know that

3645
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:14,279
because I do testing I should probably

3646
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,079
post more of it but you you can see a

3647
02:26:14,279 --> 02:26:18,560
tpine difference in all different types

3648
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:22,760
of tping from a cold cure from the same

3649
02:26:18,559 --> 02:26:24,600
strain to a oven Tech to the full m and

3650
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:26,800
everything so once again I think it's

3651
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:30,559
all good like as long as it's a stable

3652
02:26:26,799 --> 02:26:31,799
product and you have a great you know uh

3653
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:33,559
knowledge behind it and you're putting

3654
02:26:31,799 --> 02:26:35,679
out something good for your end consumer

3655
02:26:33,559 --> 02:26:37,239
patient all of it's all good you you

3656
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:38,639
definitely freaking should pet some post

3657
02:26:37,239 --> 02:26:40,959
some more that testing I know people are

3658
02:26:38,639 --> 02:26:42,439
just would just jump all over the

3659
02:26:40,959 --> 02:26:43,839
testing they're really looking at yeah

3660
02:26:42,439 --> 02:26:45,680
because it's a lot of information people

3661
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:47,600
think with the ovente tech that you're

3662
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:49,800
burning off all your tpin no they

3663
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:52,720
they're changing I don't you are burning

3664
02:26:49,799 --> 02:26:54,920
off some of of them for for sure like

3665
02:26:52,719 --> 02:26:55,719
aot bubble man's talked about it before

3666
02:26:54,920 --> 02:26:58,359
with

3667
02:26:55,719 --> 02:27:00,920
like T beans changing it's definitely

3668
02:26:58,359 --> 02:27:02,200
happening your 20-hour freeze dry uh

3669
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:04,239
kind of impressed me of course you said

3670
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:06,960
you're up in 50 you said your shelf dump

3671
02:27:04,239 --> 02:27:08,959
was it all depends like I said so that's

3672
02:27:06,959 --> 02:27:11,559
about my average you know I like to keep

3673
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:13,519
it 40 or below but it all depends like

3674
02:27:11,559 --> 02:27:16,519
how often you change out your oil as

3675
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:18,960
well or if you have a oil this my free

3676
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:21,640
my cycle almost every time is 30 hours

3677
02:27:18,959 --> 02:27:23,799
30 to 32 hours yeah I like to like when

3678
02:27:21,639 --> 02:27:25,920
I leave at for the day I come back the

3679
02:27:23,799 --> 02:27:28,559
next day around like noon you know or

3680
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:31,239
something my my B will be done is there

3681
02:27:28,559 --> 02:27:33,318
anybody yeah yeah would would you say

3682
02:27:31,239 --> 02:27:35,359
that the the the water content the

3683
02:27:33,318 --> 02:27:38,079
amount of water that's in your hash and

3684
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:39,960
in those trays is the same every time

3685
02:27:38,079 --> 02:27:43,719
and is that giving you your steady

3686
02:27:39,959 --> 02:27:45,559
consistent 30 hours or is it is your I I

3687
02:27:43,719 --> 02:27:47,639
think my my final dry is what's really

3688
02:27:45,559 --> 02:27:50,760
giving me my my my consistent 30 hours

3689
02:27:47,639 --> 02:27:53,159
my my consistent 9h hour freeze usually

3690
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:56,680
just to make sure [ __ ] is frozen and

3691
02:27:53,159 --> 02:27:58,359
then the consistent 14-hour uh freeze at

3692
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:00,079
the end or the dry at the end is

3693
02:27:58,359 --> 02:28:02,439
important to me I've just pulled some

3694
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:03,520
hash out before um like like I said I

3695
02:28:02,439 --> 02:28:04,720
pulled some hash out that's got a little

3696
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:06,359
bit of the moisture on the bottom you

3697
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:07,920
know the pucks are still a little bit

3698
02:28:06,359 --> 02:28:09,318
Frozen together got a little moisture

3699
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:11,439
content in them and I don't ever want

3700
02:28:09,318 --> 02:28:13,159
that to happen again so and I like I

3701
02:28:11,439 --> 02:28:14,920
like a very high tarpine content so I

3702
02:28:13,159 --> 02:28:17,719
leave my shelf Lim at 40 I run it for a

3703
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:19,600
full 30 hours you know but is there any

3704
02:28:17,719 --> 02:28:20,679
anybody else on the on the the panel

3705
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,120
here that has a freeze dryer that wants

3706
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:23,760
to go the what their settings are and

3707
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:25,319
stuff because I'd like to hear that if

3708
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:28,120
they

3709
02:28:25,318 --> 02:28:29,840
do so I have a I have a freeze dryer in

3710
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:31,359
our Labs all right we have three of them

3711
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:33,799
that we're using they're all scientific

3712
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:36,920
Harvest rights but I've modified one

3713
02:28:33,799 --> 02:28:39,679
with a lavoid pump uh to get more

3714
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:43,439
precise and quicker reaction times out

3715
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:45,439
of the cycles and it's um it's really

3716
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:46,880
worked out and I I'd suggest you know

3717
02:28:45,439 --> 02:28:48,960
there's a lot of modifications you can

3718
02:28:46,879 --> 02:28:51,599
do to these things Harvest rights pumps

3719
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:53,000
are not the best pump in my opinion I

3720
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:55,880
think they're really

3721
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:58,079
slow yeah I didn't I don't want to not

3722
02:28:55,879 --> 02:29:02,000
trying to trash anybody

3723
02:28:58,079 --> 02:29:05,200
but that's good that's good to hear I

3724
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:07,719
really the laid is more like a you know

3725
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:10,479
bringing a machine gun to a knif fight

3726
02:29:07,719 --> 02:29:13,000
um so it's uh I would say look into that

3727
02:29:10,478 --> 02:29:14,679
company uh for all you guys out there

3728
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,079
you know the Harvest rate means really

3729
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:19,359
well but it it just falls into black in

3730
02:29:17,079 --> 02:29:21,359
terms of like the quality of the pump

3731
02:29:19,359 --> 02:29:24,800
and how quickly turns in on its cycling

3732
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:26,399
times so you know I'm doing 72h hour

3733
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:28,799
drive times personally guys because I'm

3734
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:32,599
trying to preserve every Stitch of those

3735
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:35,358
chines and I'm doing um I actually can't

3736
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:36,840
talk about how the each setting is made

3737
02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:40,079
but what I can say is that they're long

3738
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:42,398
run times and it's it's really cold um

3739
02:29:40,079 --> 02:29:44,359
so you know that's some of y'all if we

3740
02:29:42,398 --> 02:29:45,959
can take it offline I'll I'll get deep

3741
02:29:44,359 --> 02:29:48,279
onto that but it's but I can say it's

3742
02:29:45,959 --> 02:29:51,438
like you know it's below 30 it's never

3743
02:29:48,279 --> 02:29:55,239
going above 60 and and you know it's

3744
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:56,840
it's um it's long it's long run times so

3745
02:29:55,239 --> 02:29:58,398
I've experimented with that a lot too

3746
02:29:56,840 --> 02:30:01,520
the long dry times and a really really

3747
02:29:58,398 --> 02:30:03,318
cold temp in the freeze dryer y um yeah

3748
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:05,319
and sometimes the results are exactly

3749
02:30:03,318 --> 02:30:08,039
the same as running the freeze dryer at

3750
02:30:05,318 --> 02:30:10,199
my normal settings um all strain

3751
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:12,240
dependent and you know tray dependent

3752
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:14,120
how how thick those trays are really has

3753
02:30:12,239 --> 02:30:16,799
a lot to do with how quick that is going

3754
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:19,079
to dry as well yeah yeah I agree so

3755
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,478
you're essentially flattening the curve

3756
02:30:19,079 --> 02:30:23,000
you're essentially fat flattening the

3757
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:25,079
curve right in a sense if you will yeah

3758
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:26,559
the process of the sub the sublimation

3759
02:30:25,079 --> 02:30:28,799
process you're flattening that curve and

3760
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:31,119
the pro that time that it takes to

3761
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:33,478
finish that process exactly that's

3762
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,960
that's that's the ideology behind it and

3763
02:30:33,478 --> 02:30:37,799
and you know you can all take that base

3764
02:30:35,959 --> 02:30:39,478
knowledge and and go head first into

3765
02:30:37,799 --> 02:30:42,358
that with with those dry times because

3766
02:30:39,478 --> 02:30:44,278
it's it's real helpful to know that you

3767
02:30:42,359 --> 02:30:46,399
can go that long and get that quality

3768
02:30:44,279 --> 02:30:48,760
back it's it's kind of like wait am I

3769
02:30:46,398 --> 02:30:52,039
waiting too long um but you know like it

3770
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:55,318
was just mentioned you know it's from

3771
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:57,359
Dam body Bobby it's it's all strength

3772
02:30:55,318 --> 02:30:59,278
dependent everything is you know it's I

3773
02:30:57,359 --> 02:31:01,520
don't it's you know like we were talking

3774
02:30:59,279 --> 02:31:03,640
about delaminating before you know it's

3775
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:05,760
why I don't press a lot of Jack career

3776
02:31:03,639 --> 02:31:07,920
anymore it's just too soupy I can't

3777
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:10,159
really do anything with it you know what

3778
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:13,200
I mean I love it it's awesome from from

3779
02:31:10,159 --> 02:31:15,079
my head but but in terms of a a scalable

3780
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:16,840
Cult of Arts it's a tough one to work

3781
02:31:15,079 --> 02:31:20,799
with in terms of what we're

3782
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:22,719
doing yeah so

3783
02:31:20,799 --> 02:31:24,438
for me I use a medium

3784
02:31:22,719 --> 02:31:27,438
pharmaceutical

3785
02:31:24,439 --> 02:31:29,079
um I dry in the freezer so I pre I pre-

3786
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:30,600
dry I don't use the free sometimes I use

3787
02:31:29,079 --> 02:31:32,439
the freeze dryer to freeze in if it's

3788
02:31:30,600 --> 02:31:34,318
open but most of the time I'll just have

3789
02:31:32,439 --> 02:31:36,359
the the freezer and there's also some

3790
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:38,920
Hardware you can get for the freezer by

3791
02:31:36,359 --> 02:31:41,079
cool right and basically you can modify

3792
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:42,600
like an upright freezer and it just

3793
02:31:41,079 --> 02:31:44,039
creates all kinds of slots for you to

3794
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:46,840
throw your trays in so you can have a

3795
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:47,960
cycle of uh trays ready to just rock in

3796
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:49,680
the freeze dryer that way you're not

3797
02:31:47,959 --> 02:31:50,358
running life on your freeze dryers you

3798
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:53,639
know

3799
02:31:50,359 --> 02:31:56,239
um using it as a like a you know flash

3800
02:31:53,639 --> 02:31:58,478
freezer rather than letting it focus on

3801
02:31:56,239 --> 02:31:59,879
just straight drying and I feel like

3802
02:31:58,478 --> 02:32:04,559
you're just going to get more life and

3803
02:31:59,879 --> 02:32:08,039
use out of it um but yeah I dry anywhere

3804
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:10,079
from 35 to 45 usually depending on the

3805
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:13,000
thickness of the hash the strains that

3806
02:32:10,079 --> 02:32:15,318
I'm running um depending on like you

3807
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,559
know what it is if it's like a full spec

3808
02:32:15,318 --> 02:32:19,278
like a second you know a Second Spin

3809
02:32:17,559 --> 02:32:20,519
full spec or if it's like just some

3810
02:32:19,279 --> 02:32:22,439
straight 90

3811
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:25,079
full trays of just 90 in like one

3812
02:32:22,439 --> 02:32:28,559
machine so really like there's so many

3813
02:32:25,079 --> 02:32:30,520
variables to like dry time and and temp

3814
02:32:28,559 --> 02:32:33,199
and stuff like that you know especially

3815
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:35,200
dry time like you know I I'll still and

3816
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:36,800
and I'll check it throughout the cycle

3817
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:38,880
like uh you know I let it do its whole

3818
02:32:36,799 --> 02:32:41,639
dry cycle but once it gets up in the the

3819
02:32:38,879 --> 02:32:43,438
final dry you know I'll I'll pop it open

3820
02:32:41,639 --> 02:32:45,079
I'll check the top sometimes I'll flip

3821
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:47,079
the bottom see how it's going like if

3822
02:32:45,079 --> 02:32:49,439
there's no ice because usually the ice

3823
02:32:47,079 --> 02:32:50,920
sublimates to the top and you'll you'll

3824
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:52,239
you'll you you have like the ice patties

3825
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:54,520
towards the bottom so you can really

3826
02:32:52,239 --> 02:32:56,039
check once the ice is gone not

3827
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:57,600
everywhere and you don't really want to

3828
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:59,800
you know [ __ ] with it too much but you

3829
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:02,159
know I'll check through out and then

3830
02:32:59,799 --> 02:33:04,199
uh basically give it a little bit more

3831
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:05,719
time once I see that it's like it looks

3832
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:09,520
fully dry to me I'll give it a little

3833
02:33:05,719 --> 02:33:11,519
bit more dry time and that's it for me

3834
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:13,359
you know once I break it out you know I

3835
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:15,720
feel like uh once once you pull them out

3836
02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:18,399
the freeze dryer you definitely want to

3837
02:33:15,719 --> 02:33:20,318
want to get that uh that parchment paper

3838
02:33:18,398 --> 02:33:22,439
with the hash off the tray quick because

3839
02:33:20,318 --> 02:33:24,119
you know you got a super cold metal

3840
02:33:22,439 --> 02:33:26,680
that's going to condensate quickly in

3841
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:29,040
that ambient temperature that or in that

3842
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:30,680
whatever room you're pulling it in and

3843
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:32,000
uh you know obviously if you're pulling

3844
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:34,000
it out in your cold room it's probably

3845
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,840
going to be fine but you know just to

3846
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:38,079
reduce condensation and things like that

3847
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:39,960
get it off that freeze dryer tray but

3848
02:33:38,079 --> 02:33:41,159
for the most part that's that's that's

3849
02:33:39,959 --> 02:33:43,278
what I

3850
02:33:41,159 --> 02:33:45,840
do yeah that's a really good point to

3851
02:33:43,279 --> 02:33:47,600
mention is to take the um the sheets off

3852
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:49,840
the freeze dry tray because they will

3853
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:51,640
develop moisture quicker than you think

3854
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:53,960
and that parchment will suck up the

3855
02:33:51,639 --> 02:33:55,358
moisture pretty quickly um even if you

3856
02:33:53,959 --> 02:33:57,278
are in a cold environment so it's best

3857
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:59,040
to transfer it onto some clean parchment

3858
02:33:57,279 --> 02:34:00,720
if you can pretty quickly or put it in

3859
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:03,120
the jar like you were saying yeah yeah

3860
02:34:00,719 --> 02:34:04,438
that as a desicant you know it starts to

3861
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:07,160
absorb it and then that's just G to

3862
02:34:04,439 --> 02:34:09,000
transfer into your super hash then you

3863
02:34:07,159 --> 02:34:11,039
spend all that time growing the material

3864
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,559
drying it washing it and stuff just to

3865
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:14,080
have a product that you're not happy

3866
02:34:12,559 --> 02:34:15,079
with and you know that's really upseted

3867
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:17,159
when you're when you're working this

3868
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:18,520
hard to create these kinds of products

3869
02:34:17,159 --> 02:34:19,920
because it's a lot harder than it is to

3870
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:22,079
do the hydrocarbons you know you know

3871
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:25,318
it's put a lot more love and care into

3872
02:34:22,079 --> 02:34:26,719
these things I take myb in the details I

3873
02:34:25,318 --> 02:34:28,439
take my TR straight from the freeze

3874
02:34:26,719 --> 02:34:30,358
dryer right back to the chest freezer

3875
02:34:28,439 --> 02:34:31,040
again until I'm ready to to press the

3876
02:34:30,359 --> 02:34:33,359
the

3877
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:34,880
hash yeah keep you're keeping that tray

3878
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:36,800
cold either way but you know once you're

3879
02:34:34,879 --> 02:34:38,199
getting it off that tray you know once

3880
02:34:36,799 --> 02:34:39,519
you're taking that tray out and you're

3881
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:41,479
you're ready to work with that hash you

3882
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:44,399
want to get it off that tray so that way

3883
02:34:41,478 --> 02:34:45,840
that quick just no condensation anywhere

3884
02:34:44,398 --> 02:34:47,398
you know get that tray back wherever it

3885
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:49,359
needs to go throw it back in the freezer

3886
02:34:47,398 --> 02:34:51,599
keep them cold wipe it down whatever you

3887
02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:55,399
got to do with it you know is anyone

3888
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:57,040
using a a a like a a seeve to run their

3889
02:34:55,398 --> 02:34:58,680
their freeze dried hash through to break

3890
02:34:57,040 --> 02:35:00,840
it up put it put it back to like a

3891
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:02,960
powder and you know what's your favorite

3892
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:04,520
tech to do that time yeah I've been

3893
02:35:02,959 --> 02:35:06,119
doing it personally but I I just was

3894
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:07,120
curious to see if anybody else has been

3895
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:09,880
doing

3896
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:12,680
that gonna be released yeah I think

3897
02:35:09,879 --> 02:35:14,559
that's a good a good method anyways

3898
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:16,079
because you know that way you're you're

3899
02:35:14,559 --> 02:35:17,879
you're basically breaking up all the

3900
02:35:16,079 --> 02:35:20,359
clumps just that even if there was that

3901
02:35:17,879 --> 02:35:22,639
minute amount of moisture in it just

3902
02:35:20,359 --> 02:35:24,479
just allowing it to expose to that air I

3903
02:35:22,639 --> 02:35:28,439
feel like that's just going to kind of

3904
02:35:24,478 --> 02:35:30,119
uh like let that uh uh evaporate quickly

3905
02:35:28,439 --> 02:35:32,040
because there's not there's if there's

3906
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:34,000
any moisture at all and and it allows

3907
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:36,439
you to see every bit of the hash so if

3908
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:37,879
there is any like little Ice Crystal

3909
02:35:36,439 --> 02:35:39,800
somewhere on the bottom because you felt

3910
02:35:37,879 --> 02:35:43,239
like you dried long enough but you just

3911
02:35:39,799 --> 02:35:45,799
did a [ __ ] 400 gram [ __ ] run in a

3912
02:35:43,239 --> 02:35:48,199
a medium freeze dryer or you or you

3913
02:35:45,799 --> 02:35:49,920
maxed out the trays you know so you're

3914
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:51,520
really

3915
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:53,279
like running some new [ __ ] like it's the

3916
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:56,200
most you pushed or you're you're doing a

3917
02:35:53,279 --> 02:35:57,520
different sized run you know you still

3918
02:35:56,200 --> 02:36:00,920
running through that seed is going to

3919
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:02,439
let you see if there's anything like ice

3920
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:05,520
crystals and [ __ ] like that I have seen

3921
02:36:02,439 --> 02:36:07,318
some people uh I have some seen some

3922
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:09,439
people use uh just two butter knives and

3923
02:36:07,318 --> 02:36:12,199
just chop it up like with chopsticks man

3924
02:36:09,439 --> 02:36:14,200
just just it's easier to put in the bags

3925
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:17,040
when it's either sifted or broke up into

3926
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:18,960
smaller CH but Clos to the S like butter

3927
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:20,640
anyways it's not like you're really sff

3928
02:36:18,959 --> 02:36:23,079
and you're just like jum and flower

3929
02:36:20,639 --> 02:36:24,318
through it you could put in a jar and

3930
02:36:23,079 --> 02:36:25,879
shake it as well but like you were

3931
02:36:24,318 --> 02:36:27,760
saying the SE is like the last line of

3932
02:36:25,879 --> 02:36:29,318
defense in case there is a little ice

3933
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,398
chunk or you know a little piece of

3934
02:36:29,318 --> 02:36:33,799
contaminant that sees like your last

3935
02:36:31,398 --> 02:36:36,119
line of defense it's a good good yeah

3936
02:36:33,799 --> 02:36:37,920
you'll see it really fast line of

3937
02:36:36,120 --> 02:36:41,079
quality control allows you to almost see

3938
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:42,920
like every bit of it in a in a in a like

3939
02:36:41,079 --> 02:36:44,719
I use a really wide seeve you know I

3940
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:47,719
don't use like the the

3941
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:49,920
traditional um bow seeve at the bottom

3942
02:36:47,719 --> 02:36:52,559
you know like how it's just like a bowl

3943
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:54,279
you know I use a flat big old 16inch

3944
02:36:52,559 --> 02:36:57,000
seeve so I'll dump it in there over a

3945
02:36:54,279 --> 02:36:59,279
big ass sheet of parchment paper and uh

3946
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:01,200
you know I'll just I'll I'll run my hand

3947
02:36:59,279 --> 02:37:03,640
through it and Shake It Up you know I'll

3948
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:05,560
lightly press on it with the glove and

3949
02:37:03,639 --> 02:37:07,000
then it kind of smashes everything in

3950
02:37:05,559 --> 02:37:08,119
Shake It Up and let everything fall

3951
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,120
right

3952
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:12,760
through some people might not know

3953
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:14,920
either is that the if you're seen and

3954
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:17,279
you have ice chunks that pop up you can

3955
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:19,279
actually toss those back on your tray

3956
02:37:17,279 --> 02:37:21,040
with parchment back in the machine and

3957
02:37:19,279 --> 02:37:24,640
add more dry time and finish those

3958
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:26,960
chunks off yeah AB had to do that I've

3959
02:37:24,639 --> 02:37:28,719
had to do that before for sure yeah I

3960
02:37:26,959 --> 02:37:30,599
just feel like if that happens it's like

3961
02:37:28,719 --> 02:37:32,119
a [ __ ] there's got to be moisture in the

3962
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:34,399
hash even though you don't see the

3963
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:36,319
moisture in the hash there's an ice

3964
02:37:34,398 --> 02:37:38,358
chunk right there dude there's got to be

3965
02:37:36,318 --> 02:37:41,920
moisture in that hash and all that hash

3966
02:37:38,359 --> 02:37:43,279
needs to be dried yeah I agree see I've

3967
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:44,639
definitely done that where I've seed it

3968
02:37:43,279 --> 02:37:47,159
and found a little ice chunk and got

3969
02:37:44,639 --> 02:37:48,760
really paranoid and and put the hash all

3970
02:37:47,159 --> 02:37:50,439
of it right back in the freeze dryer on

3971
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:52,960
some trays you know until the end of the

3972
02:37:50,439 --> 02:37:55,159
day and and then seed it again to make

3973
02:37:52,959 --> 02:37:57,239
sure that there was no more chunks of

3974
02:37:55,159 --> 02:37:59,439
ice in there I mean in that in that

3975
02:37:57,239 --> 02:38:02,079
sense you could also just [ __ ] see it

3976
02:37:59,439 --> 02:38:03,960
up real like fine on a big ass sheet of

3977
02:38:02,079 --> 02:38:06,719
parchment throw it on like the bun racks

3978
02:38:03,959 --> 02:38:09,519
and just line it you know it's gonna be

3979
02:38:06,719 --> 02:38:11,119
fine yeah absolutely just I just wanted

3980
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:12,000
to say from a person's perspective it's

3981
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:17,079
never

3982
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:19,040
free res um I was confused like why s

3983
02:38:17,079 --> 02:38:21,439
something that that I thought you know I

3984
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:21,439
thought it was

3985
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:24,719
that I see

3986
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:31,200
like a lot of the samples that I saw

3987
02:38:28,959 --> 02:38:34,959
over to

3988
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:37,159
point grab the headphones bro can't hear

3989
02:38:34,959 --> 02:38:40,478
you sorry

3990
02:38:37,159 --> 02:38:42,559
dude Y no this isn't exactly for like

3991
02:38:40,478 --> 02:38:44,239
I'll be honest this isn't exactly this

3992
02:38:42,559 --> 02:38:46,318
particular show hash church right off

3993
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:48,279
the bat there's very few Layman watching

3994
02:38:46,318 --> 02:38:51,639
hash Church kind of the headiest of the

3995
02:38:48,279 --> 02:38:55,680
headyy T this show and this is a special

3996
02:38:51,639 --> 02:39:00,278
show on techniques going into rosin that

3997
02:38:55,680 --> 02:39:03,079
people have Acquired and um achieved

3998
02:39:00,279 --> 02:39:06,120
course of the last however many years

3999
02:39:03,079 --> 02:39:08,359
five plus years and that's that's what

4000
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:10,319
this conversation is kind leading us

4001
02:39:08,359 --> 02:39:12,318
towards right now absolutely I just

4002
02:39:10,318 --> 02:39:14,519
wanted to say people are doing that se

4003
02:39:12,318 --> 02:39:17,359
Tech because it's it's a smart way of

4004
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:20,640
not overdrying your hash but also making

4005
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:23,399
sure that it's dry enough to to product

4006
02:39:20,639 --> 02:39:26,358
out you know to to

4007
02:39:23,398 --> 02:39:28,959
to so I had a question guys I I wanted

4008
02:39:26,359 --> 02:39:30,239
to to ask it to to further what I was

4009
02:39:28,959 --> 02:39:33,000
saying with the reason I brought up this

4010
02:39:30,239 --> 02:39:35,478
Eve is um what what microns is everyone

4011
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,040
mixing together you know you know I'm

4012
02:39:35,478 --> 02:39:41,519
personally only doing 120 and 73 right

4013
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:44,399
now and then 4525 and then 90 is is is

4014
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:45,840
just ch you know that goes to jars and

4015
02:39:44,398 --> 02:39:48,680
I'm I'm curious to see what everyone

4016
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:49,880
else's thoughts are and what you know M

4017
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:54,079
you guys are doing

4018
02:39:49,879 --> 02:39:58,679
I like the 120 90 depends sometimes the

4019
02:39:54,079 --> 02:40:03,639
150 sometimes the 70 never the 40 uh

4020
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:05,680
never the 25 180 is rare uh it depends

4021
02:40:03,639 --> 02:40:08,959
depends on the strain depends on you

4022
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:08,960
know like the method and stuff

4023
02:40:10,398 --> 02:40:14,920
too you know who smokes 40 you Carol

4024
02:40:13,879 --> 02:40:21,318
[ __ ]

4025
02:40:14,920 --> 02:40:21,318
Baskin yes she does all day to the Dome

4026
02:40:21,639 --> 02:40:26,519
well you guys I agree with

4027
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:28,720
interrupt you guys are gonna think that

4028
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:31,079
I'm [ __ ] Carol Baskins then because

4029
02:40:28,719 --> 02:40:35,519
almost every single time oh no that I

4030
02:40:31,079 --> 02:40:38,879
wash I will use the 220 the 160 drop to

4031
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:41,159
the 45 and then the 25 and I'll always

4032
02:40:38,879 --> 02:40:43,398
press my 45 it's always if the materials

4033
02:40:41,159 --> 02:40:45,478
fire you know sometimes that full range

4034
02:40:43,398 --> 02:40:47,559
of microns can be really really good

4035
02:40:45,478 --> 02:40:49,719
yeah that's you can't deny that every

4036
02:40:47,559 --> 02:40:51,199
time you see I'm just talking homie

4037
02:40:49,719 --> 02:40:53,199
about that yesterday dude there's some

4038
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,720
strains that are just gold all the way

4039
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:57,279
through yeah and and it might not be

4040
02:40:55,719 --> 02:40:59,358
gold as far as like the way it's

4041
02:40:57,279 --> 02:41:01,040
yielding and and it might not be like

4042
02:40:59,359 --> 02:41:02,640
the Melt that you want to put out but as

4043
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,920
far as when it when you press it into

4044
02:41:02,639 --> 02:41:08,278
rosin the tpin that are present and and

4045
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:09,960
just the way the know the color when it

4046
02:41:08,279 --> 02:41:12,279
hits the nail you know it doesn't darken

4047
02:41:09,959 --> 02:41:15,478
up and it's just like it's still fire

4048
02:41:12,279 --> 02:41:18,120
dude and and I've seen I've seen 25 do

4049
02:41:15,478 --> 02:41:19,639
that even though that 25 like it's just

4050
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:21,240
it's a totally different Tech and the

4051
02:41:19,639 --> 02:41:23,879
way I'll judge a lot of these too is

4052
02:41:21,239 --> 02:41:25,478
like you'll notice like when if anybody

4053
02:41:23,879 --> 02:41:26,719
like still will Taff andhole [ __ ]

4054
02:41:25,478 --> 02:41:28,039
because I'll still like taffle throw it

4055
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:29,799
in the jar when I'm going to try to

4056
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:33,160
manipulate for some type of consistency

4057
02:41:29,799 --> 02:41:34,840
or some [ __ ] but um like the way the 40

4058
02:41:33,159 --> 02:41:38,079
looks like the the creaminess of it

4059
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:40,760
compared to like how fire like a 90 70

4060
02:41:38,079 --> 02:41:43,000
uh a 120 the 40 looks more matte and

4061
02:41:40,760 --> 02:41:45,040
more [ __ ] uh my boy called it

4062
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:47,439
yesterday D it's more like cran wax it's

4063
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:49,399
just like it looks really soft yeah it's

4064
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:51,000
it's it's not that great but in some

4065
02:41:49,398 --> 02:41:52,639
strains even though it's like that the

4066
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:57,279
turs that are there and the [ __ ] like

4067
02:41:52,639 --> 02:41:59,760
that it's it's it's good to

4068
02:41:57,279 --> 02:42:01,200
me to me when I tell people you know if

4069
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:02,318
you and this is where I kind of was

4070
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:04,439
talking a little bit earlier and I think

4071
02:42:02,318 --> 02:42:08,199
it got a little misconstrued but when I

4072
02:42:04,439 --> 02:42:10,800
say I grow for rosin I'm growing resin

4073
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:12,760
for rosin but I'm growing for the end

4074
02:42:10,799 --> 02:42:15,000
game is rosin my end game isn't hash I

4075
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:18,318
don't keep very much hash to smoke it's

4076
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:20,120
just not what I do if I was keeping hash

4077
02:42:18,318 --> 02:42:23,039
for smoke I would certainly throwing in

4078
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:25,120
the 120 and the 90 and the 73 to find

4079
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:27,279
out which one was the the most preferred

4080
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:29,960
smoke but I'm not in it for that I'm in

4081
02:42:27,279 --> 02:42:32,120
it for Rosen I drop it all to the the 45

4082
02:42:29,959 --> 02:42:35,239
now here's the other kicker I will press

4083
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:37,680
the 25 I will press the 160 I mix those

4084
02:42:35,239 --> 02:42:39,840
together and on my on my page I jokingly

4085
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:41,639
call that my food grade hash and most

4086
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:44,359
people are like holy that's really food

4087
02:42:41,639 --> 02:42:46,239
grade hash Pedro and it is it really is

4088
02:42:44,359 --> 02:42:49,359
it just doesn't have uh for the most

4089
02:42:46,239 --> 02:42:51,239
part the thca content the tpin aren't

4090
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:53,840
there it's darker and I do for the most

4091
02:42:51,239 --> 02:42:55,680
part decarb it and eat it nice yeah we

4092
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:58,279
do a lot of the same stuff um over at

4093
02:42:55,680 --> 02:43:00,960
Burnside Garden Collective um we like to

4094
02:42:58,279 --> 02:43:04,120
package and sell anywhere from 149 down

4095
02:43:00,959 --> 02:43:06,639
to 90u and you know take the 150 and the

4096
02:43:04,120 --> 02:43:08,560
70 and blend those two together for you

4097
02:43:06,639 --> 02:43:12,478
know a product that's not as expensive

4098
02:43:08,559 --> 02:43:13,959
as the first pull 149 through 90 um and

4099
02:43:12,478 --> 02:43:16,438
like everyone else was saying certain

4100
02:43:13,959 --> 02:43:19,478
strains are going to put out some really

4101
02:43:16,439 --> 02:43:21,920
fire Micron ranges like sometimes the 89

4102
02:43:19,478 --> 02:43:23,358
through the 40 can be really fire if

4103
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:25,960
you're leaving that together or if you

4104
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:27,359
separate out the 40 you can use that for

4105
02:43:25,959 --> 02:43:29,398
Edibles or you know there's lots of

4106
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:31,279
different things you can do with that um

4107
02:43:29,398 --> 02:43:34,119
and certain strains like lemon peel you

4108
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:35,960
can catch 219 down to 40 and you

4109
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:38,399
wouldn't even know it you know it tastes

4110
02:43:35,959 --> 02:43:40,519
just like the 90 and the 140 and you

4111
02:43:38,398 --> 02:43:42,559
know it tastes all the same um so

4112
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:44,279
certain strains do carry that turpine

4113
02:43:42,559 --> 02:43:47,119
content throughout the resin all the way

4114
02:43:44,279 --> 02:43:49,920
through um but it is it is fun to see

4115
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:51,479
which strains put out you know

4116
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:53,318
heaviest in what microns you know I've

4117
02:43:51,478 --> 02:43:57,239
seen at our farm a lot of the stuff

4118
02:43:53,318 --> 02:43:59,840
dumps real hard in 179 down to 90 and

4119
02:43:57,239 --> 02:44:01,959
the 70u and the 40u and the 180 is

4120
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:05,079
pretty much non-existent um you know

4121
02:44:01,959 --> 02:44:06,959
very small amounts even on8 ,000 grams

4122
02:44:05,079 --> 02:44:09,559
of material being washed you'll only

4123
02:44:06,959 --> 02:44:12,398
pull you know five 10 grams of that and

4124
02:44:09,559 --> 02:44:15,760
the majority of the resin sits in you

4125
02:44:12,398 --> 02:44:17,398
know the the 150 the 120 the 90 all in

4126
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:20,318
the all in the microns that we consider

4127
02:44:17,398 --> 02:44:22,920
to be the best that we enjoy smoking

4128
02:44:20,318 --> 02:44:24,760
ourselves yeah that's awesome that's

4129
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:26,318
yeah that's that's like myself you when

4130
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:28,239
you find those varieties you just want

4131
02:44:26,318 --> 02:44:31,439
to hang on to them forever you know it's

4132
02:44:28,239 --> 02:44:34,159
why I've had like four main stays in my

4133
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:36,479
my library for pretty much two decades

4134
02:44:34,159 --> 02:44:38,079
at this point and then I inch out and I

4135
02:44:36,478 --> 02:44:40,799
try new things for a while and then I'll

4136
02:44:38,079 --> 02:44:42,559
start new stuff but it's it's hard just

4137
02:44:40,799 --> 02:44:45,079
to break away from those ones that do

4138
02:44:42,559 --> 02:44:47,519
really well in the garden in the wash on

4139
02:44:45,079 --> 02:44:51,279
the plates um yeah it takes a lot of

4140
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:53,120
work to find those for sure you Gott big

4141
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:55,200
time yeah and then you have to give them

4142
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:57,600
to other other Growers and have expect

4143
02:44:55,200 --> 02:45:00,159
them to grow them the same way yeah

4144
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:02,920
it'll never really really tough yeah

4145
02:45:00,159 --> 02:45:04,799
it's it's you're you're so true it's

4146
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:06,719
I've found that it's overall plant

4147
02:45:04,799 --> 02:45:08,000
Health it's how you get you know the

4148
02:45:06,719 --> 02:45:09,920
plant you got to keep the plant Health

4149
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:12,159
really high because the resin is GNA

4150
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:13,439
derives from the the plant health so how

4151
02:45:12,159 --> 02:45:16,318
you get it there you just want to make

4152
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:18,000
keep the plant Health as as high as

4153
02:45:16,318 --> 02:45:20,359
possible so when you go to process that

4154
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,719
and turn it into hash or full melt or or

4155
02:45:20,359 --> 02:45:23,840
you're going to press it into rosin that

4156
02:45:21,719 --> 02:45:25,559
you can achieve the highest quality the

4157
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:27,120
whole time you got to handle everything

4158
02:45:25,559 --> 02:45:29,398
correctly from the flower when you're

4159
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:31,240
harvesting it to when you're washing the

4160
02:45:29,398 --> 02:45:33,478
material to how long you're washing it

4161
02:45:31,239 --> 02:45:35,239
the environment how you're drying it you

4162
02:45:33,478 --> 02:45:37,959
know there's there's humongous amounts

4163
02:45:35,239 --> 02:45:39,959
of variables and small things that go

4164
02:45:37,959 --> 02:45:42,159
into doing all those that everyone does

4165
02:45:39,959 --> 02:45:44,438
differently and you know we're all

4166
02:45:42,159 --> 02:45:46,680
achieving very similar but very

4167
02:45:44,439 --> 02:45:48,639
different resins even from the same

4168
02:45:46,680 --> 02:45:50,279
strains because everyone's room their

4169
02:45:48,639 --> 02:45:52,398
Environ their techniques they're all

4170
02:45:50,279 --> 02:45:53,920
different um so being able to share

4171
02:45:52,398 --> 02:45:56,239
those things with everyone on a large

4172
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:57,960
scale is pretty cool because you know

4173
02:45:56,239 --> 02:46:01,239
everyone could get a little bit better

4174
02:45:57,959 --> 02:46:03,959
at what they're doing and and develop a

4175
02:46:01,239 --> 02:46:08,478
little bit more absolutely

4176
02:46:03,959 --> 02:46:09,639
man Pedro we grow strictly for rosin so

4177
02:46:08,478 --> 02:46:11,119
we're yeah we're pretty much probably

4178
02:46:09,639 --> 02:46:13,478
the only ones here in the oddballs out

4179
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:17,479
so we grow strictly from ra for Rosen we

4180
02:46:13,478 --> 02:46:22,079
grow outdoor sunr non- Greenhouse we dry

4181
02:46:17,478 --> 02:46:24,639
cure 90 95% of our Harvest to you know

4182
02:46:22,079 --> 02:46:26,799
almost bone dry and then B cure it and

4183
02:46:24,639 --> 02:46:29,039
then we actually do primarily all Blends

4184
02:46:26,799 --> 02:46:31,039
and we'll blend first through third wash

4185
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:33,279
together generally for most cases and we

4186
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:35,399
individually collect all all use of the

4187
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:38,840
bags check each one but then you know

4188
02:46:35,398 --> 02:46:40,519
we're doing a 45 to a 159 primarily

4189
02:46:38,840 --> 02:46:42,040
depending on the actual strains and

4190
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:43,640
we'll mix them back together so that way

4191
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:45,120
you're getting different strains and

4192
02:46:43,639 --> 02:46:46,719
different use all together so you're

4193
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:49,000
getting a very nice variety of

4194
02:46:46,719 --> 02:46:51,039
everything at once and it's creating

4195
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:52,159
nice even experience for our clients and

4196
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:53,880
for ourselves and that's kind of what

4197
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:55,439
we're going for is you know we want that

4198
02:46:53,879 --> 02:46:58,039
nice Full

4199
02:46:55,439 --> 02:47:01,159
Experience we're not certain

4200
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:04,600
strength uh right now we've got like 36

4201
02:47:01,159 --> 02:47:06,719
different ones so we kind of cherry-pick

4202
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:09,200
what we want to mix together and see

4203
02:47:06,719 --> 02:47:11,840
what works we're doing I think 20 new

4204
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:13,240
ones this C types you have certain types

4205
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:15,920
that you go back to that you find

4206
02:47:13,239 --> 02:47:18,398
because your son grown here in Maine and

4207
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:19,398
not with coer over you obviously must

4208
02:47:18,398 --> 02:47:21,760
have some

4209
02:47:19,398 --> 02:47:23,398
successful that'll we stay away from

4210
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:25,760
long running sativas since we're doing

4211
02:47:23,398 --> 02:47:26,799
sunr you know which is a downside but

4212
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:28,000
you know that's one of the only things

4213
02:47:26,799 --> 02:47:29,358
and the other big thing that we stay

4214
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:31,398
away from is just things that'll promote

4215
02:47:29,359 --> 02:47:33,720
Bud rot and you know two things that

4216
02:47:31,398 --> 02:47:35,799
grow two giant size of nugs that you

4217
02:47:33,719 --> 02:47:38,199
know will promote mold we have a high

4218
02:47:35,799 --> 02:47:39,799
humidity low temperature here so we're

4219
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:42,399
fighting

4220
02:47:39,799 --> 02:47:44,000
that are you obviously going for like

4221
02:47:42,398 --> 02:47:45,599
are you going for TP forward because

4222
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:48,680
like part of the conversation the back

4223
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:52,279
to Bobby was talking about the quality

4224
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:54,800
of the cultivar and the cultivation so I

4225
02:47:52,279 --> 02:47:56,840
totally agree with that and in your when

4226
02:47:54,799 --> 02:47:58,920
your sun grown no cover not indoors

4227
02:47:56,840 --> 02:48:00,600
you're exposed are you guys finding that

4228
02:47:58,920 --> 02:48:04,520
you're following these certain pathway

4229
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:06,399
for not just the um cultivar in terms of

4230
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:09,439
production for resin but more for the

4231
02:48:06,398 --> 02:48:11,519
tarpine profile not necessarily we're

4232
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:13,318
going a broad spectrum so I'm not

4233
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:15,359
necessarily of the fan of like you know

4234
02:48:13,318 --> 02:48:17,318
I want every tpine off the plant you

4235
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:19,239
know I'm I'm in the saltless mind camp

4236
02:48:17,318 --> 02:48:21,359
but there's a bunch of volatile

4237
02:48:19,239 --> 02:48:23,359
and the Cannabis and the hash and the

4238
02:48:21,359 --> 02:48:24,439
flour and the rosin that you know some

4239
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:26,040
of these things we're going to find out

4240
02:48:24,439 --> 02:48:28,120
down the road may or may not cause

4241
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:30,000
problems to us because tpin by

4242
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:32,960
themselves are not necessarily meant for

4243
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:35,799
us so you know we're a fan of a nice

4244
02:48:32,959 --> 02:48:37,199
high-end THC content we want some CBDs

4245
02:48:35,799 --> 02:48:39,119
in there and then you know we want a

4246
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:40,920
blend of tpin we don't want just one or

4247
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:44,040
two tpin you know I want to see you know

4248
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:45,879
three four Tarpin seven Tarpin so we'll

4249
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:47,640
blend two or three different strains

4250
02:48:45,879 --> 02:48:49,759
together to make our rosin so we're

4251
02:48:47,639 --> 02:48:51,799
getting a nice complex profile that we

4252
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:53,279
were that we're going for because you

4253
02:48:51,799 --> 02:48:54,879
know it's all about that experience and

4254
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:55,880
then we want something that's uplifting

4255
02:48:54,879 --> 02:48:57,559
and then you know it's going to carry

4256
02:48:55,879 --> 02:48:59,920
you for a nice little

4257
02:48:57,559 --> 02:49:00,959
while but you know we're not concerned

4258
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:02,359
about the genetics because the

4259
02:49:00,959 --> 02:49:04,159
environments our big thing that we're

4260
02:49:02,359 --> 02:49:05,680
fighting here and I think you know if

4261
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:07,079
with an outdoor with an indoor grow

4262
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:08,479
becomes a way different Beast because

4263
02:49:07,079 --> 02:49:10,680
like you're creating a similar

4264
02:49:08,478 --> 02:49:12,318
environment in the same place but if

4265
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:14,120
you're talking about growing plants you

4266
02:49:12,318 --> 02:49:16,000
know growing here versus Colorado will

4267
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:18,279
never produce the same plant because

4268
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:20,120
geographically GPS wear at a different

4269
02:49:18,279 --> 02:49:21,560
elevation a different moisture content

4270
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:23,279
and literally a different place on the

4271
02:49:21,559 --> 02:49:25,119
globe and the environment that the

4272
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:27,520
plant's exposed to here will be

4273
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:28,840
different and those stressors and those

4274
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:30,279
factors will create different tur

4275
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:31,880
profiles every year that some people

4276
02:49:30,279 --> 02:49:33,840
will miss out on because they're not you

4277
02:49:31,879 --> 02:49:35,519
know battling those elements at the same

4278
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:38,079
time like we'll get different colors and

4279
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:40,279
deeper darker purples gets into the

4280
02:49:38,079 --> 02:49:43,000
terroir and you see lavender for

4281
02:49:40,279 --> 02:49:44,800
instance produces incredibly in this one

4282
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:47,159
region I believe it's in France and

4283
02:49:44,799 --> 02:49:50,879
maybe Germany has the second one but it

4284
02:49:47,159 --> 02:49:53,200
just seems to create a tpine profile B

4285
02:49:50,879 --> 02:49:55,039
based on that terroir that is unique and

4286
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:57,439
special and recognized by the rest of

4287
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:59,359
the world and cannabis will be no

4288
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:03,279
different it'll be very interesting to

4289
02:49:59,359 --> 02:50:05,920
find what cultivars shine where under

4290
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:08,399
which conditions you know how it's being

4291
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:11,920
grown all all of these different things

4292
02:50:08,398 --> 02:50:14,840
are uh you know what would give us the

4293
02:50:11,920 --> 02:50:17,079
outcome yeah exactly I mean it's similar

4294
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:18,880
to Growing wine or tobacco in a lot of

4295
02:50:17,079 --> 02:50:20,120
essenes in you know agriculture because

4296
02:50:18,879 --> 02:50:22,519
that's what it all starts at is the

4297
02:50:20,120 --> 02:50:24,000
farming so whatever creates that is

4298
02:50:22,520 --> 02:50:25,319
going to start driving some different

4299
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,920
things up in regions especially if

4300
02:50:25,318 --> 02:50:28,600
you're talking about outdoor Greenhouse

4301
02:50:26,920 --> 02:50:29,960
primarily you know at some point

4302
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:31,399
hopefully we'll start getting data

4303
02:50:29,959 --> 02:50:33,119
because you're collecting it as well as

4304
02:50:31,398 --> 02:50:35,119
a couple other people you know we'll

4305
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:37,079
know different cultivars you death

4306
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:38,319
better in certain regions and exposed to

4307
02:50:37,079 --> 02:50:39,879
different environments whereas the

4308
02:50:38,318 --> 02:50:41,639
indoor guys can kind of run whatever

4309
02:50:39,879 --> 02:50:43,119
they want but the outdoor and the

4310
02:50:41,639 --> 02:50:44,519
greenhouse guys can start getting some

4311
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:46,239
unique things once we get some more of

4312
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:47,319
this data log to understand what grows

4313
02:50:46,238 --> 02:50:50,639
in the

4314
02:50:47,318 --> 02:50:50,639
regions check out

4315
02:50:50,879 --> 02:50:54,959
he's he's a big check out Kush Kirk down

4316
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:58,238
in southern Oregon he's a big breeder

4317
02:50:54,959 --> 02:50:59,438
and he does everything in hoop houses um

4318
02:50:58,238 --> 02:51:01,478
you know he does a lot of stuff in the

4319
02:50:59,439 --> 02:51:03,318
Open Fields he doesn't he doesn't cover

4320
02:51:01,478 --> 02:51:06,478
him up and some of the resin that he

4321
02:51:03,318 --> 02:51:07,959
produces from that farm is is so unique

4322
02:51:06,478 --> 02:51:09,760
um some of the most flavorful resin

4323
02:51:07,959 --> 02:51:11,559
you'll ever try in your life and not

4324
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:14,079
only that it's some of the melti resin

4325
02:51:11,559 --> 02:51:15,799
I've ever seen personally and he's a

4326
02:51:14,079 --> 02:51:17,639
good example of someone doing a really

4327
02:51:15,799 --> 02:51:20,318
good job of using you know the natural

4328
02:51:17,639 --> 02:51:22,159
elements to grow very high quality resin

4329
02:51:20,318 --> 02:51:24,920
that's not lacking in quality he's all

4330
02:51:22,159 --> 02:51:26,079
about finding the best genetics the best

4331
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:28,398
plants that are going to work in his

4332
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:30,079
environment that he can breed to create

4333
02:51:28,398 --> 02:51:33,680
really Superior hash trads to share with

4334
02:51:30,079 --> 02:51:35,680
everyone else yeah that's

4335
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:37,880
amazing I was going to say on the on the

4336
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:39,398
East Coast just to kind of duvail off

4337
02:51:37,879 --> 02:51:41,799
what what they were talking about you

4338
02:51:39,398 --> 02:51:43,760
know because we're I I've spent my

4339
02:51:41,799 --> 02:51:45,719
majority of my time bouncing between the

4340
02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:48,960
two coasts but I I'm very much from the

4341
02:51:45,719 --> 02:51:50,799
east coast and grown a lot here um we'

4342
02:51:48,959 --> 02:51:52,959
have such a different environment and

4343
02:51:50,799 --> 02:51:55,519
the same cultivars that are grown in in

4344
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:57,478
southern Oregon or even Northern Cali

4345
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:59,359
and in areas like that just don't

4346
02:51:57,478 --> 02:52:01,000
respond the same way as they as they do

4347
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:03,680
out here you know we have we have blue

4348
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:05,680
or light so our cannabinoid profil is

4349
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:07,800
going to be different um our turpine

4350
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:10,439
profiles are much different so the light

4351
02:52:07,799 --> 02:52:12,679
spectrum is much different out here and

4352
02:52:10,439 --> 02:52:15,040
those plants grow totally not totally

4353
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:17,639
differently but they express traits in a

4354
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:19,640
in a very different manner um in finding

4355
02:52:17,639 --> 02:52:21,559
the ones that really treat truly work

4356
02:52:19,639 --> 02:52:23,920
through the whole season all the way to

4357
02:52:21,559 --> 02:52:26,719
like a really cold you know end of the

4358
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:28,639
October you know into November is is is

4359
02:52:26,719 --> 02:52:32,199
really a tall order man it's it's really

4360
02:52:28,639 --> 02:52:34,039
hard for us so it's um you

4361
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:37,079
know

4362
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:38,640
there yeah you know I mean you guys

4363
02:52:37,079 --> 02:52:41,279
you're so far north that you can't even

4364
02:52:38,639 --> 02:52:41,278
hit October

4365
02:52:41,478 --> 02:52:46,719
31st flit of snow outside so we can't

4366
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:49,279
even go out until like May and then it

4367
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:53,879
like we got our first Frost I want to

4368
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:55,760
say September 28th last year yeah

4369
02:52:53,879 --> 02:52:59,238
yeah

4370
02:52:55,760 --> 02:53:01,318
outside so it's yeah what's up buddy hey

4371
02:52:59,238 --> 02:53:03,840
Colin I have grown plants on both coasts

4372
02:53:01,318 --> 02:53:05,840
that I bred on both coasts um I could

4373
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:09,159
name a couple types like the strawberry

4374
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:12,880
angel food that I have yeah is was bred

4375
02:53:09,159 --> 02:53:14,879
in southern humble actually 15 miles on

4376
02:53:12,879 --> 02:53:17,278
the east side of Southern humble near

4377
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:19,719
Garberville and I've also repeated that

4378
02:53:17,279 --> 02:53:21,279
type out here where the seeds were bred

4379
02:53:19,719 --> 02:53:23,719
out there and then launched out here

4380
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:25,720
propagated three years ago and it's one

4381
02:53:23,719 --> 02:53:28,760
of the shiniest beautiful healthy

4382
02:53:25,719 --> 02:53:30,760
vigorous types it's resistant it did

4383
02:53:28,760 --> 02:53:32,478
like it made a pathway from where it was

4384
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:36,000
good out there to here as a really

4385
02:53:32,478 --> 02:53:37,719
sativa poly hybrid and I have several

4386
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,318
types that have done that that actually

4387
02:53:37,719 --> 02:53:42,679
I think a lot of it's the like um where

4388
02:53:40,318 --> 02:53:45,478
Kush Kirk is open field pollination or

4389
02:53:42,680 --> 02:53:48,079
sungrown breeding primarily or only it's

4390
02:53:45,478 --> 02:53:49,799
that y I believe that with breeding it's

4391
02:53:48,079 --> 02:53:52,398
the it's taking on a lot of the elements

4392
02:53:49,799 --> 02:53:54,438
and it's also resisting naturally where

4393
02:53:52,398 --> 02:53:56,719
like skunkman Sam brought up even last

4394
02:53:54,439 --> 02:53:59,479
week how those types will show you but

4395
02:53:56,719 --> 02:54:01,000
they're far and few between and instead

4396
02:53:59,478 --> 02:54:03,318
of where we're following the name and

4397
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:06,079
the turp so much and a lot of indoor

4398
02:54:03,318 --> 02:54:08,879
breeding and a lot of indoor Focus it's

4399
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:11,680
actually not the plant speaking truly in

4400
02:54:08,879 --> 02:54:13,559
its natural setting and then breeding

4401
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:15,880
through those into the Next Generation

4402
02:54:13,559 --> 02:54:18,719
which can naturally resist those

4403
02:54:15,879 --> 02:54:20,920
elements and then still be health

4404
02:54:18,719 --> 02:54:23,199
vigorous resin producing and then tur

4405
02:54:20,920 --> 02:54:25,120
profile on top of it is the new kicker

4406
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:26,960
so that's a lot of boxes to check but

4407
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:29,920
that's why those special types are

4408
02:54:26,959 --> 02:54:32,039
special yeah and the the the acclimation

4409
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:33,719
aspect too of the plants themselves and

4410
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:35,560
some varieties are going to acclimate

4411
02:54:33,719 --> 02:54:39,599
much quicker than others as well which

4412
02:54:35,559 --> 02:54:45,119
is a whole variable on itself you know

4413
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:45,120
that's yeah you know so that's really

4414
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:53,000
cool yes so what do you so I was gonna

4415
02:54:49,680 --> 02:54:54,439
say um rackams brought up uh bag types

4416
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:56,359
and what everyone's kind of kind of

4417
02:54:54,439 --> 02:54:58,639
leaning towards in terms of pressing is

4418
02:54:56,359 --> 02:55:00,640
there anyone that's uh wants to share

4419
02:54:58,639 --> 02:55:02,879
any any info on on things that they're

4420
02:55:00,639 --> 02:55:06,959
using in terms of parchments or

4421
02:55:02,879 --> 02:55:08,599
uh or bags I get all my screens through

4422
02:55:06,959 --> 02:55:10,559
the hash

4423
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:13,000
Depot good friend of mine out here in

4424
02:55:10,559 --> 02:55:15,478
Portland um yeah he makes raos and

4425
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:18,040
screens and many different sizes custom

4426
02:55:15,478 --> 02:55:19,639
sizes seen that everywhere yeah he's

4427
02:55:18,040 --> 02:55:21,000
he's a good friend man he's a great guy

4428
02:55:19,639 --> 02:55:23,119
he's you know he's a good dude to

4429
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:24,879
support in his screens I love him he

4430
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:28,120
gets them to me sometimes overnight when

4431
02:55:24,879 --> 02:55:31,519
I need him so I'm try those ones out I

4432
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:33,439
use the rosin uh rosin Evolution um I

4433
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:35,238
usually use like the 25 I've been

4434
02:55:33,439 --> 02:55:37,040
experimenting with like the 15 Micron

4435
02:55:35,238 --> 02:55:39,318
and stuff like that I was gonna ask him

4436
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:42,120
about Micron size is what you guys like

4437
02:55:39,318 --> 02:55:44,000
like because I love you like the 15

4438
02:55:42,120 --> 02:55:47,319
because I like the 25 I see a lot of

4439
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:49,359
like 37 and stuff so 15 e curious guys

4440
02:55:47,318 --> 02:55:52,318
yeah I was curious about the the screen

4441
02:55:49,359 --> 02:55:56,279
size yeah 25 over here

4442
02:55:52,318 --> 02:55:59,000
37 yeah it depends like anywhere from 35

4443
02:55:56,279 --> 02:56:01,000
down to 15 but mostly like 25 double

4444
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:03,040
wraps I usually I'll double bag

4445
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:05,040
everything if I'm doing like a

4446
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:08,200
mechanical separation I like to Triple

4447
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:11,600
bag and I'll usually you know I'll start

4448
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:13,840
from low low to High Why triple bag with

4449
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:15,880
mechanical separation for this I don't

4450
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:17,760
know it's just something I like um I

4451
02:56:15,879 --> 02:56:18,920
really like the fact of like the that

4452
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:20,800
third layer

4453
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:22,680
I like to just rip everything off so

4454
02:56:20,799 --> 02:56:24,398
that way like any dust matter that's hit

4455
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:27,760
it or anything that's stuck to that now

4456
02:56:24,398 --> 02:56:30,639
I got two clean bags makes sense that

4457
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:33,600
second bag is more of a catch of like um

4458
02:56:30,639 --> 02:56:35,398
like any if any a like it really depends

4459
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:38,040
on the process you know it's like a lot

4460
02:56:35,398 --> 02:56:40,000
of timing and and and change of pressure

4461
02:56:38,040 --> 02:56:41,720
and temperature and it really depends on

4462
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:43,840
how slow you do the process and how you

4463
02:56:41,719 --> 02:56:46,079
ramp up the temperature and the the

4464
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:48,760
pressure and U you know sometimes like

4465
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:50,478
certain strain it's it's really big

4466
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:52,478
learning process because strains are are

4467
02:56:50,478 --> 02:56:54,719
really different and I feel like that

4468
02:56:52,478 --> 02:56:57,079
second bag is like the the secondary

4469
02:56:54,719 --> 02:56:58,559
catch for any anything that makes it

4470
02:56:57,079 --> 02:57:00,079
through because even though it's on low

4471
02:56:58,559 --> 02:57:02,439
temp when you're applying pressure with

4472
02:57:00,079 --> 02:57:05,879
temperature and tpin I feel like Turin

4473
02:57:02,439 --> 02:57:07,600
and THC the tpin act as a solvent very

4474
02:57:05,879 --> 02:57:10,519
much at that point because you know

4475
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:13,040
that's where the uh thca you know starts

4476
02:57:10,520 --> 02:57:14,399
to push through but you know so that's

4477
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:17,080
where you got to really watch like

4478
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:18,840
temperature and pressure um but I feel

4479
02:57:17,079 --> 02:57:20,439
like that that second back pretty much

4480
02:57:18,840 --> 02:57:22,120
is going to catch what falls through

4481
02:57:20,439 --> 02:57:24,800
there it's not going to make it down to

4482
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:27,680
the third bag and so you know I'll

4483
02:57:24,799 --> 02:57:30,719
basically just rip off that third bag as

4484
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:33,120
like a um you know a protective bag any

4485
02:57:30,719 --> 02:57:34,358
kind of like dust if anything happens to

4486
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:37,239
it if I set

4487
02:57:34,359 --> 02:57:39,318
it anything period you know regardless

4488
02:57:37,238 --> 02:57:41,279
like it's mostly for dust so like I'll

4489
02:57:39,318 --> 02:57:43,159
pull that [ __ ] off like anything out of

4490
02:57:41,279 --> 02:57:45,720
the air I just like it to be as clean as

4491
02:57:43,159 --> 02:57:47,079
possible it's it's more more in the head

4492
02:57:45,719 --> 02:57:50,000
probably you could probably be just fine

4493
02:57:47,079 --> 02:57:52,318
with two or even but I just feel like oh

4494
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:55,279
I like the three I'm I'm All listening

4495
02:57:52,318 --> 02:57:56,879
to you I'm like three time clean right

4496
02:57:55,279 --> 02:57:59,880
whatever I just I do the same thing when

4497
02:57:56,879 --> 02:58:01,478
I Mo I do it three times over like you

4498
02:57:59,879 --> 02:58:03,478
take that down that extra half I like

4499
02:58:01,478 --> 02:58:05,920
the idea behind it yeah you want that

4500
02:58:03,478 --> 02:58:08,879
you want that Epic no blowouts nothing I

4501
02:58:05,920 --> 02:58:11,359
use 2 exactly and that's another thing

4502
02:58:08,879 --> 02:58:13,079
too is like reinforcement in that screen

4503
02:58:11,359 --> 02:58:14,920
because you're really applying it's like

4504
02:58:13,079 --> 02:58:17,238
crushing a rock dude once you start to

4505
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:20,439
get the [ __ ] turfin out of there it

4506
02:58:17,238 --> 02:58:22,760
starts to become a real solid like form

4507
02:58:20,439 --> 02:58:24,920
in there you know you've got a thca

4508
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:27,840
Patty and now you're applying pressure

4509
02:58:24,920 --> 02:58:29,318
to that so you need that like uh uh when

4510
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:31,880
you're when you're starting to get on

4511
02:58:29,318 --> 02:58:34,278
like the wicking process or like certain

4512
02:58:31,879 --> 02:58:37,639
different processes of it you you start

4513
02:58:34,279 --> 02:58:40,520
to apply a shitload of

4514
02:58:37,639 --> 02:58:42,238
pressure yeah man I don't I don't single

4515
02:58:40,520 --> 02:58:44,238
bag anything anymore I haven't done that

4516
02:58:42,238 --> 02:58:45,840
in years I mean I try it every so often

4517
02:58:44,238 --> 02:58:48,920
I'm like oh maybe I could do this 30

4518
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:50,478
gram Patty without double in it and it

4519
02:58:48,920 --> 02:58:52,200
always just starts to bubble out and

4520
02:58:50,478 --> 02:58:55,039
I'll stop The Press immediately and then

4521
02:58:52,200 --> 02:58:57,239
wrap it up you know it's just it always

4522
02:58:55,040 --> 02:59:00,160
teaches me not to do it you know I use a

4523
02:58:57,238 --> 02:59:03,520
WP for my thca and I like to use a five

4524
02:59:00,159 --> 02:59:06,079
Micron wrap um sometimes

4525
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:07,880
double you know but the five Micron

4526
02:59:06,079 --> 02:59:11,719
really helps I think keep the

4527
02:59:07,879 --> 02:59:15,639
THC a in the wrap and the TPS it keeps

4528
02:59:11,719 --> 02:59:19,199
really you know uh really runny like you

4529
02:59:15,639 --> 02:59:21,398
like it you know uh low viscosity so

4530
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:25,479
it's helped a lot with

4531
02:59:21,398 --> 02:59:28,879
that Micon or yeah the five

4532
02:59:25,478 --> 02:59:31,000
Micron it or just a five I could do it

4533
02:59:28,879 --> 02:59:32,679
with just the five but to keep that

4534
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,920
perfect little shape like you were

4535
02:59:32,680 --> 02:59:36,639
saying you're putting a lot of pressure

4536
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:40,760
on it like so gr was saying um so I wrap

4537
02:59:36,639 --> 02:59:42,079
you know the 25 over it usually but I

4538
02:59:40,760 --> 02:59:43,920
could I've done it with just the five

4539
02:59:42,079 --> 02:59:45,760
Micron wrap as well a nice clean

4540
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:47,680
separation and I've been separating like

4541
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:48,600
150 using the stainless steel five

4542
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:52,279
micron

4543
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:56,600
no no just 100 uh just the nylon sheets

4544
02:59:52,279 --> 03:00:00,040
they're 12 by 12 yeah nice so I use uh

4545
02:59:56,600 --> 03:00:03,279
Rosen Evolution washbags and hash bags

4546
03:00:00,040 --> 03:00:06,279
and then I use a 55 pound parchment from

4547
03:00:03,279 --> 03:00:09,120
from black lab yep and but I get I get

4548
03:00:06,279 --> 03:00:12,040
it all from Rosen Evolution and pretty I

4549
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:13,800
used to press the 37 uh you know then

4550
03:00:12,040 --> 03:00:16,880
then I started doing a double 37 inside

4551
03:00:13,799 --> 03:00:19,478
a 160 uh and then I just kind of finally

4552
03:00:16,879 --> 03:00:22,799
ended up landing on a double 25 inside

4553
03:00:19,478 --> 03:00:25,959
of a 160 the two 25s act as my

4554
03:00:22,799 --> 03:00:28,799
filtration and the 160 acts as my my

4555
03:00:25,959 --> 03:00:31,599
strength you know uh I just I've landed

4556
03:00:28,799 --> 03:00:33,799
on that after so long I hate blowouts

4557
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:35,559
nobody's ever watched me live and had a

4558
03:00:33,799 --> 03:00:37,719
blow out sometimes I'll just end the

4559
03:00:35,559 --> 03:00:40,278
stream I start swearing I'm just I'm not

4560
03:00:37,719 --> 03:00:41,760
a not a happy camper when it happens so

4561
03:00:40,279 --> 03:00:44,760
I've just given up on it and I just

4562
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:46,238
double bag 25 then inside a 160 every

4563
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:49,079
single

4564
03:00:46,238 --> 03:00:50,840
time that's cool one thing I can help

4565
03:00:49,079 --> 03:00:52,359
say to avoid blowouts is like the heat

4566
03:00:50,840 --> 03:00:54,159
soak I don't know if anyone else is like

4567
03:00:52,359 --> 03:00:56,479
really given a good little small heat

4568
03:00:54,159 --> 03:00:57,760
soak before they squish but your pouch

4569
03:00:56,478 --> 03:00:59,238
in there yeah give yourself a little

4570
03:00:57,760 --> 03:01:01,559
heat soak and when you start seeing the

4571
03:00:59,238 --> 03:01:04,119
rosin come out always

4572
03:01:01,559 --> 03:01:05,639
just what I've always explained to

4573
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:07,279
everybody and it's a really good analogy

4574
03:01:05,639 --> 03:01:10,159
and everybody's really grasped on to it

4575
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:12,159
is when we're pressing rosin well with

4576
03:01:10,159 --> 03:01:14,119
hash and with with flower but when we

4577
03:01:12,159 --> 03:01:16,079
pressing pressing rosin you have to

4578
03:01:14,120 --> 03:01:17,720
think of the Tricom heads as little

4579
03:01:16,079 --> 03:01:19,520
little beach balls right and they they

4580
03:01:17,719 --> 03:01:21,519
all have a little bit of different oil

4581
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:24,960
inside them and what we're trying to do

4582
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:27,600
is we're trying to exert pressure and

4583
03:01:24,959 --> 03:01:29,799
and and and heat we're trying to melt

4584
03:01:27,600 --> 03:01:31,960
the oil and press the oil out of the

4585
03:01:29,799 --> 03:01:33,639
bags we're not trying to go super fast

4586
03:01:31,959 --> 03:01:36,079
super quick and press that hash out of

4587
03:01:33,639 --> 03:01:38,840
the bag that's that's counterintuitive

4588
03:01:36,079 --> 03:01:41,000
Slow and Low get the oil to melt it from

4589
03:01:38,840 --> 03:01:44,040
inside those glandular heads and press

4590
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:46,279
the oil out that was inside those heads

4591
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:48,479
so my problem is this is if I don't

4592
03:01:46,279 --> 03:01:50,760
double bag and and the the heads are too

4593
03:01:48,478 --> 03:01:52,519
good I just get slipped bags man they're

4594
03:01:50,760 --> 03:01:54,719
just it's like a slip and slide the

4595
03:01:52,520 --> 03:01:56,359
thing wants to slide out I haven't had

4596
03:01:54,719 --> 03:01:58,478
that for a while but I do remember that

4597
03:01:56,359 --> 03:02:00,238
yeah well that's like with like grease

4598
03:01:58,478 --> 03:02:02,478
and stuff when you're pressing like six

4599
03:02:00,238 --> 03:02:04,920
star five and a half star five star

4600
03:02:02,478 --> 03:02:06,358
whatever like the bags want to do that

4601
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:08,279
but you know what like that's where

4602
03:02:06,359 --> 03:02:10,318
that's where like Bobby was saying with

4603
03:02:08,279 --> 03:02:12,079
the the heat soak you know like what I

4604
03:02:10,318 --> 03:02:14,318
was having problems with that on the go

4605
03:02:12,079 --> 03:02:15,879
pressure on the long speak but you know

4606
03:02:14,318 --> 03:02:18,159
then I started really like dialing in

4607
03:02:15,879 --> 03:02:20,599
the machine and like you know you can

4608
03:02:18,159 --> 03:02:22,760
you can almost stop the plates so I I'll

4609
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:24,720
bring them down like as slow as they can

4610
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:26,120
and they'll sit there on that six-star

4611
03:02:24,719 --> 03:02:27,358
so that way you have to almost let it

4612
03:02:26,120 --> 03:02:30,520
leak out

4613
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:32,159
itself before you start doing

4614
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:34,560
it right

4615
03:02:32,159 --> 03:02:38,398
on material the more it's gonna want to

4616
03:02:34,559 --> 03:02:41,959
slip too so yeah it's a good

4617
03:02:38,398 --> 03:02:43,318
thing it's aough thing to deal but it's

4618
03:02:41,959 --> 03:02:46,278
yeah it could have worse

4619
03:02:43,318 --> 03:02:48,199
problems problem when I'm pressing my

4620
03:02:46,279 --> 03:02:50,200
six-star too I like to pre Grease the

4621
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:51,840
patties and not just put it as beach

4622
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:53,720
sand in the pouch and then do a

4623
03:02:51,840 --> 03:02:55,478
directional fold I like to prease the

4624
03:02:53,719 --> 03:02:57,719
patties to where it's like a pretty

4625
03:02:55,478 --> 03:03:00,159
stable you know sheet that almost looks

4626
03:02:57,719 --> 03:03:02,238
exactly like the pouch it's going into

4627
03:03:00,159 --> 03:03:05,000
and then I'll fold it in half I used to

4628
03:03:02,238 --> 03:03:07,279
be a huge fan of using the prepress I

4629
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:09,520
mean I used to I do it by hand yeah I

4630
03:03:07,279 --> 03:03:13,640
used I do it by hand I I don't like the

4631
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:16,359
prepress yeah yeah I Do by hand but I've

4632
03:03:13,639 --> 03:03:18,719
it feels cool too it feels good it's

4633
03:03:16,359 --> 03:03:21,479
it's just not productive

4634
03:03:18,719 --> 03:03:23,519
prepress is for material that's not good

4635
03:03:21,478 --> 03:03:25,639
you know that doesn't just finger press

4636
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:28,439
like the good stuff that we're

4637
03:03:25,639 --> 03:03:29,719
pressing it's six star you don't need a

4638
03:03:28,439 --> 03:03:32,159
you don't need all that and when you

4639
03:03:29,719 --> 03:03:34,318
start putting six star and and higher

4640
03:03:32,159 --> 03:03:36,719
melting has you know prepress it'll

4641
03:03:34,318 --> 03:03:38,760
actually start melting in the prepress

4642
03:03:36,719 --> 03:03:41,079
just from the pressure so you

4643
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:42,960
really that's my problem man I'll put it

4644
03:03:41,079 --> 03:03:45,000
on there and it'll just like I can't

4645
03:03:42,959 --> 03:03:48,719
even get my fingers off it it's like

4646
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:50,359
just want the so back to my man back to

4647
03:03:48,719 --> 03:03:52,599
the explanation I just said you know

4648
03:03:50,359 --> 03:03:54,120
I've gotten away from doing the prepress

4649
03:03:52,600 --> 03:03:55,559
and everything I was losing a lot of

4650
03:03:54,120 --> 03:03:57,720
material on the inside of the pre-press

4651
03:03:55,559 --> 03:03:59,238
it was just an extra step it was time

4652
03:03:57,719 --> 03:04:00,879
blah blah blah so I just started

4653
03:03:59,238 --> 03:04:02,879
scooping it directly into the bags and

4654
03:04:00,879 --> 03:04:04,799
again low and slow you're you're letting

4655
03:04:02,879 --> 03:04:06,238
the Press I don't want to do it with my

4656
03:04:04,799 --> 03:04:08,438
hands because that just seems like

4657
03:04:06,238 --> 03:04:11,199
caveman style I'm putting in the press

4658
03:04:08,439 --> 03:04:13,279
and I'm letting the Press melt the heads

4659
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:15,000
and then I'm pressing the oil out you

4660
03:04:13,279 --> 03:04:17,479
know from there

4661
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:19,600
so when you when you don't prepress you

4662
03:04:17,478 --> 03:04:21,879
know like the pre-press whether it's

4663
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:24,200
it's with the puck or or the puck maker

4664
03:04:21,879 --> 03:04:26,278
or by hand I think the pre-press allows

4665
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:27,800
the hash to kind of fill those Pockets

4666
03:04:26,279 --> 03:04:29,720
so that way you know you kind of have a

4667
03:04:27,799 --> 03:04:31,639
consistent size when you put it in the

4668
03:04:29,719 --> 03:04:33,199
Press so that way you know a lot of

4669
03:04:31,639 --> 03:04:35,079
times too especially if you're pressing

4670
03:04:33,200 --> 03:04:37,359
like you know five star and above like

4671
03:04:35,079 --> 03:04:39,000
some super grease if you're just if

4672
03:04:37,359 --> 03:04:40,840
you're just putting a a glob in there

4673
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:42,439
and throwing it in there nine out of

4674
03:04:40,840 --> 03:04:44,600
tenen times it's going to work its way

4675
03:04:42,439 --> 03:04:46,238
off the blocks and and you're G to have

4676
03:04:44,600 --> 03:04:48,600
to flatten it out it's like the goal is

4677
03:04:46,238 --> 03:04:51,039
to get it as even in pocket in every

4678
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:53,520
corner and press that out real slow you

4679
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:55,600
know let it kind of like just soak on

4680
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:57,880
the heat work its way and then bring

4681
03:04:55,600 --> 03:05:00,559
those blocks down slow because it gets

4682
03:04:57,879 --> 03:05:01,959
there's a every type of rosin has its

4683
03:05:00,559 --> 03:05:04,079
own challenges you know when you're

4684
03:05:01,959 --> 03:05:05,919
working with like you know more of like

4685
03:05:04,079 --> 03:05:07,760
a full spectrum like where there's a lot

4686
03:05:05,920 --> 03:05:09,079
more plant particulate and everything's

4687
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:11,840
kind of just a mass you know you got

4688
03:05:09,079 --> 03:05:13,840
your 150 all the way down to your 40 you

4689
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:15,960
know you have more plant mass for to

4690
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:17,960
create a shape not want to slide off

4691
03:05:15,959 --> 03:05:20,000
your blocks are able to stick to it and

4692
03:05:17,959 --> 03:05:21,599
then now you have now you get into more

4693
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:24,159
of the challenge of like how much

4694
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:26,680
pressure can I apply where I'm I I

4695
03:05:24,159 --> 03:05:29,119
before I start pulling out undesirable

4696
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:31,000
oil where where you know this is my head

4697
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:32,960
and then this is my tail like you know

4698
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:34,840
if I press every bit of the oil out

4699
03:05:32,959 --> 03:05:38,079
right now I'm gonna have

4700
03:05:34,840 --> 03:05:41,040
one decent good oil but at the same time

4701
03:05:38,079 --> 03:05:43,359
I can improve and refine by separating

4702
03:05:41,040 --> 03:05:45,399
not applying so much pressure leaving

4703
03:05:43,359 --> 03:05:47,640
that last you know let's just say out of

4704
03:05:45,398 --> 03:05:49,599
that bag whatever you press you pulled

4705
03:05:47,639 --> 03:05:51,559
10 grams of rosin out well rather than

4706
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:54,359
pulling 10 grams out you leave that tail

4707
03:05:51,559 --> 03:05:56,079
end which is probably only like a gram

4708
03:05:54,359 --> 03:05:58,399
so you know you're you're leaving a

4709
03:05:56,079 --> 03:06:00,840
minute amount just to improve the

4710
03:05:58,398 --> 03:06:02,199
quality of your rosin tremendously so

4711
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:04,000
you know there's different challenges

4712
03:06:02,200 --> 03:06:06,200
from the six star all the way down to

4713
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:08,238
the full spectrums and [ __ ] like that

4714
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:10,000
you know it's just it's it's it's it's

4715
03:06:08,238 --> 03:06:11,719
learning how to use your equipment

4716
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:13,279
whether those blocks are going down too

4717
03:06:11,719 --> 03:06:15,398
fast or whether it's like okay I can't

4718
03:06:13,279 --> 03:06:17,200
be using a Pneumatic press I need to

4719
03:06:15,398 --> 03:06:19,199
shift over to a hand press and I really

4720
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:21,040
need a guide it down you know like

4721
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:23,760
there's people pressing at 90 degrees

4722
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:25,560
120 degrees they need blocks that they

4723
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:27,079
have full control with they can't be

4724
03:06:25,559 --> 03:06:28,719
pneumatics you know they need to be

4725
03:06:27,079 --> 03:06:31,079
doing hand press or something that they

4726
03:06:28,719 --> 03:06:33,318
can really gauge and dial down for a

4727
03:06:31,079 --> 03:06:34,959
long period of time so we all have our

4728
03:06:33,318 --> 03:06:37,079
our our different ways of getting there

4729
03:06:34,959 --> 03:06:39,438
they're very unique very cool very

4730
03:06:37,079 --> 03:06:41,398
similar qualities but I think it really

4731
03:06:39,439 --> 03:06:43,680
comes down to techniques and

4732
03:06:41,398 --> 03:06:46,398
Equipment yeah it's all different

4733
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:49,600
for I agree the weed too you need to

4734
03:06:46,398 --> 03:06:52,920
have good good have good resin yeah your

4735
03:06:49,600 --> 03:06:54,840
resin well that's the number one the

4736
03:06:52,920 --> 03:06:56,600
number one soil you brought up a really

4737
03:06:54,840 --> 03:06:58,639
good point the TA The Head and the tail

4738
03:06:56,600 --> 03:07:00,680
end aspect really isn't talked about

4739
03:06:58,639 --> 03:07:02,079
much within the Rosen conversation I'm

4740
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:04,800
glad you brought that up because it's

4741
03:07:02,079 --> 03:07:07,398
something you know in my lab we we talk

4742
03:07:04,799 --> 03:07:10,759
about a lot and it's you know that's the

4743
03:07:07,398 --> 03:07:14,358
differentiation between in our

4744
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:17,040
opinion phenomenal and and really good

4745
03:07:14,359 --> 03:07:18,640
you know and and it's you know you like

4746
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:20,359
you're saying you can't inch it into

4747
03:07:18,639 --> 03:07:23,840
that phenomenal area you just have to

4748
03:07:20,359 --> 03:07:26,720
pay attention and be okay with like not

4749
03:07:23,840 --> 03:07:28,200
getting everything or separating that

4750
03:07:26,719 --> 03:07:29,840
you know and understanding that there

4751
03:07:28,200 --> 03:07:32,880
isn't real loss it's more about

4752
03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:34,840
redirecting it to other areas you know I

4753
03:07:32,879 --> 03:07:36,278
mean it's like what do you start

4754
03:07:34,840 --> 03:07:37,799
consider a loss because like if you

4755
03:07:36,279 --> 03:07:39,600
press out all the oil and then you throw

4756
03:07:37,799 --> 03:07:41,559
your bags away there's a loss right

4757
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:43,559
there because essentially that can be

4758
03:07:41,559 --> 03:07:45,680
turned into something else it's just at

4759
03:07:43,559 --> 03:07:48,039
what point do you look at something as a

4760
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:49,760
loss like just look at it as something

4761
03:07:48,040 --> 03:07:51,680
that can build up and become useful

4762
03:07:49,760 --> 03:07:53,439
towards something else and and keep your

4763
03:07:51,680 --> 03:07:55,559
Rin something that's going to be

4764
03:07:53,439 --> 03:07:57,479
extremely desirable because if if you

4765
03:07:55,559 --> 03:08:00,559
smoke it without that tailing and you

4766
03:07:57,478 --> 03:08:02,760
feel in in in your heart that it's like

4767
03:08:00,559 --> 03:08:04,359
man this is so good it's so much better

4768
03:08:02,760 --> 03:08:06,960
than if I just add this in but you're

4769
03:08:04,359 --> 03:08:08,439
looking at this as dollars then that's

4770
03:08:06,959 --> 03:08:10,358
what that's where you're gonna lose

4771
03:08:08,439 --> 03:08:12,800
you're you're gonna you know you're

4772
03:08:10,359 --> 03:08:12,800
stepping

4773
03:08:12,959 --> 03:08:17,919
over you're stepping over dollars to

4774
03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:19,040
pick up pennies so it's it's it's just

4775
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:20,960
really

4776
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:23,760
about you know what do you want

4777
03:08:20,959 --> 03:08:26,679
sacrificing want your product to be

4778
03:08:23,760 --> 03:08:30,639
you're sacrificing that minute amount of

4779
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:32,318
tail end yield for the end quality

4780
03:08:30,639 --> 03:08:34,398
you're keeping your quality High I've

4781
03:08:32,318 --> 03:08:35,559
always said that the reason we're doing

4782
03:08:34,398 --> 03:08:36,719
this is because we want to smoke the

4783
03:08:35,559 --> 03:08:38,680
best of the best that's why we're

4784
03:08:36,719 --> 03:08:40,679
separating this you know so it kind of

4785
03:08:38,680 --> 03:08:43,159
comes down to time temperatures

4786
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:44,439
pressures you know and then like like

4787
03:08:43,159 --> 03:08:46,478
everybody was just hinting at not

4788
03:08:44,439 --> 03:08:49,760
wasting the product so you know I'll

4789
03:08:46,478 --> 03:08:52,119
only press you know to exert or to get

4790
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:55,079
extract excuse me um what I want to

4791
03:08:52,120 --> 03:08:58,040
smoke all of my hash little pucks and

4792
03:08:55,079 --> 03:09:01,079
stuff get set aside and the wife usually

4793
03:08:58,040 --> 03:09:03,600
processes that with uh with ethanol or

4794
03:09:01,079 --> 03:09:05,200
Ever Clear down into RSO or something so

4795
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:07,600
we don't have a hell of a lot of waste

4796
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:09,640
we try to we try to use it all but if

4797
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:13,079
I'm going to leave a

4798
03:09:09,639 --> 03:09:15,639
gram of rosin in a bag because I want to

4799
03:09:13,079 --> 03:09:17,799
only extract the good I'll get that gram

4800
03:09:15,639 --> 03:09:19,478
out later I'll eat it later I'll I I

4801
03:09:17,799 --> 03:09:21,119
will enjoy it medically one way or

4802
03:09:19,478 --> 03:09:23,760
another

4803
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:25,920
right yeah and what soil was saying is

4804
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:28,000
like yeah you're right man that's

4805
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:30,000
that's that's that's where you got to

4806
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:31,680
make that decision man and that's it's

4807
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:33,000
it's you're stepping over over you're

4808
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:34,960
just stepping over stepping over

4809
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:38,520
everything to pick up what

4810
03:09:34,959 --> 03:09:40,159
for another 60 bucks or something yeah

4811
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:42,600
FR

4812
03:09:40,159 --> 03:09:44,879
could it's the premium product man let's

4813
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:47,640
face it yeah and that's kind of how I

4814
03:09:44,879 --> 03:09:49,438
look at it on the the the the aspect of

4815
03:09:47,639 --> 03:09:51,398
like when it it first it starts with the

4816
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:54,520
water hash you know if if we're talking

4817
03:09:51,398 --> 03:09:57,278
about hash rosing you know because like

4818
03:09:54,520 --> 03:09:58,880
you know the 40 Micron can be good but

4819
03:09:57,279 --> 03:10:00,520
most of the times if you really just

4820
03:09:58,879 --> 03:10:03,438
separate it you know isolate those

4821
03:10:00,520 --> 03:10:04,880
microns and and look and see how much

4822
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:06,600
weight there is of each Micron you're

4823
03:10:04,879 --> 03:10:08,639
really not losing much by separating

4824
03:10:06,600 --> 03:10:11,479
that 40 Micron yeah you're really not at

4825
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:13,159
all the 25 if you're doing a really good

4826
03:10:11,478 --> 03:10:15,840
job on your refining process and your

4827
03:10:13,159 --> 03:10:17,478
agitation and and doing things properly

4828
03:10:15,840 --> 03:10:19,600
material is handled properly you get

4829
03:10:17,478 --> 03:10:22,199
minimal 25 depending on the material

4830
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:24,640
when you're working with dry trim things

4831
03:10:22,200 --> 03:10:26,560
like that uh there tends to be more but

4832
03:10:24,639 --> 03:10:29,599
from from my experience and and I'm used

4833
03:10:26,559 --> 03:10:32,318
to working with indoor fresh Frozen um

4834
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:35,840
you know I get very minimal 25 very

4835
03:10:32,318 --> 03:10:39,398
minimal 40 and and for the most part

4836
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:43,079
there's usually not that much 70

4837
03:10:39,398 --> 03:10:44,439
so fun say that heads we're we're

4838
03:10:43,079 --> 03:10:46,600
separating at Happy Valley we're

4839
03:10:44,439 --> 03:10:48,920
separating every single Micron and I

4840
03:10:46,600 --> 03:10:51,399
haven't I still just not letting go of

4841
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:54,760
like the my old school method of like I

4842
03:10:51,398 --> 03:10:56,398
gotta know what's in every Micron yeah

4843
03:10:54,760 --> 03:10:57,680
and every it's funny you say that

4844
03:10:56,398 --> 03:11:00,039
because like every

4845
03:10:57,680 --> 03:11:03,079
variety Rosetta Stone will give me a lot

4846
03:11:00,040 --> 03:11:05,680
of 45 25 c99 gives me barely anything in

4847
03:11:03,079 --> 03:11:08,840
terms 45 25 but it's all in the 90 and

4848
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:11,439
and the 120 and the 70 you 73 I mean so

4849
03:11:08,840 --> 03:11:12,719
it's you know it's it's uh it's like

4850
03:11:11,439 --> 03:11:15,120
we're saying we going back to the the

4851
03:11:12,719 --> 03:11:17,559
variable of of the cult ofar but it's

4852
03:11:15,120 --> 03:11:19,840
for me the 45 and the 25 reason I

4853
03:11:17,559 --> 03:11:22,439
brought up earlier was because I I think

4854
03:11:19,840 --> 03:11:24,600
that like you're insinuating is there's

4855
03:11:22,439 --> 03:11:27,359
a place for all these Micron

4856
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:29,800
sizes in the lineup of of the quiver you

4857
03:11:27,359 --> 03:11:32,200
know like you can offer the the head

4858
03:11:29,799 --> 03:11:35,000
what they want and also 45 and 25 can be

4859
03:11:32,200 --> 03:11:36,800
good for thca it's got a lot of you know

4860
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:38,040
cake batter in there man you can knock

4861
03:11:36,799 --> 03:11:40,398
you could actually throw a little of

4862
03:11:38,040 --> 03:11:44,040
that in there and allow stuff to cake

4863
03:11:40,398 --> 03:11:46,680
back up and you know you're not hurting

4864
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:48,319
the overall material you know you're

4865
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:50,120
you're at blending you know what I mean

4866
03:11:48,318 --> 03:11:51,398
if you will so I just think it's

4867
03:11:50,120 --> 03:11:55,000
important for everyone to think about

4868
03:11:51,398 --> 03:11:58,318
the Micron sizes as as tools that all

4869
03:11:55,000 --> 03:12:02,159
can be Blended in a in in in ways as a

4870
03:11:58,318 --> 03:12:05,439
you know as any chef would yeah we take

4871
03:12:02,159 --> 03:12:07,559
all our 219 down to the 180 and then the

4872
03:12:05,439 --> 03:12:08,600
you know the the 89 down to 40u and save

4873
03:12:07,559 --> 03:12:10,959
that all for

4874
03:12:08,600 --> 03:12:13,559
Edibles yeah everything else is is

4875
03:12:10,959 --> 03:12:15,199
either full melt or it's raos and grade

4876
03:12:13,559 --> 03:12:16,680
you know or both you know just

4877
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:19,159
everything else is separated for edible

4878
03:12:16,680 --> 03:12:21,720
quality not not necessarily just Edibles

4879
03:12:19,159 --> 03:12:24,559
because I mean the tpine fraction may

4880
03:12:21,719 --> 03:12:26,679
not be that great from the 40 and the 25

4881
03:12:24,559 --> 03:12:29,199
but the thca fraction that can come from

4882
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:30,639
it can be incredible it really once it's

4883
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:32,840
cleaned up and when when you're talking

4884
03:12:30,639 --> 03:12:34,799
about the 180 150 like first through

4885
03:12:32,840 --> 03:12:36,960
third spin or first through second

4886
03:12:34,799 --> 03:12:38,719
depending on how it degrades sometimes

4887
03:12:36,959 --> 03:12:41,679
those can be fired so the rosin that

4888
03:12:38,719 --> 03:12:44,559
comes off of them are good Absolut you

4889
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:47,520
know stra dependent definitely strain

4890
03:12:44,559 --> 03:12:49,238
dependent you know but it doesn't neily

4891
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:51,279
have to go to Just Edibles it can still

4892
03:12:49,238 --> 03:12:53,398
be used in the refinement of rosin you

4893
03:12:51,279 --> 03:12:56,319
know mechanical no I just say in our in

4894
03:12:53,398 --> 03:12:58,079
our situation where we are in Oran we

4895
03:12:56,318 --> 03:13:00,760
can't our option is either do rosin or

4896
03:12:58,079 --> 03:13:02,120
do Edibles or do full melt so to provide

4897
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:03,478
we're just trying to provide another

4898
03:13:02,120 --> 03:13:05,160
option out there keep your rosin as

4899
03:13:03,478 --> 03:13:08,840
quality as possible and and put

4900
03:13:05,159 --> 03:13:08,840
everything else towards

4901
03:13:09,120 --> 03:13:13,960
yeah I like that sizes that people

4902
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:15,439
aren't talking about is you only

4903
03:13:13,959 --> 03:13:16,759
experience that partly when we start

4904
03:13:15,439 --> 03:13:18,479
discussing the difference between fresh

4905
03:13:16,760 --> 03:13:20,079
Frozen and dry because when we're

4906
03:13:18,478 --> 03:13:21,559
talking about fresh frozen you guys are

4907
03:13:20,079 --> 03:13:22,959
still having swellen heads because

4908
03:13:21,559 --> 03:13:25,159
there's still moisture left in those

4909
03:13:22,959 --> 03:13:27,278
heads so when you get something down to

4910
03:13:25,159 --> 03:13:29,079
a bone dry and a nice full dry you're

4911
03:13:27,279 --> 03:13:30,600
going to get more of a separation of all

4912
03:13:29,079 --> 03:13:31,680
those Tricom heads I'm sure you're GNA

4913
03:13:30,600 --> 03:13:32,880
have a couple that are going to shrink

4914
03:13:31,680 --> 03:13:34,359
down a little bit more than you might

4915
03:13:32,879 --> 03:13:37,119
want but you're going to get a better

4916
03:13:34,359 --> 03:13:38,399
profile of what actually each layer is

4917
03:13:37,120 --> 03:13:39,800
because when it's fresh frozen you still

4918
03:13:38,398 --> 03:13:41,398
have the moisture content in each layer

4919
03:13:39,799 --> 03:13:42,759
of the head so you're gonna have swollen

4920
03:13:41,398 --> 03:13:44,639
heads in some of those areas that might

4921
03:13:42,760 --> 03:13:46,120
not even be that full melt and that's

4922
03:13:44,639 --> 03:13:47,559
what some people are experiencing these

4923
03:13:46,120 --> 03:13:49,880
days when they're saying oh I got six

4924
03:13:47,559 --> 03:13:53,920
star but it's really not we call that

4925
03:13:49,879 --> 03:13:57,719
faux melt yeah fo melt you run fresh

4926
03:13:53,920 --> 03:14:00,120
frozen you definitely use a microplane

4927
03:13:57,719 --> 03:14:02,799
shred those heads up get that little bit

4928
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:07,000
oil on the outside so when a flame

4929
03:14:02,799 --> 03:14:07,000
gets it's melted it's

4930
03:14:09,760 --> 03:14:13,478
not the heads after they're separated

4931
03:14:12,040 --> 03:14:15,120
are very similar to the heads like when

4932
03:14:13,478 --> 03:14:16,318
they're on the plant you don't really

4933
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:18,520
want to touch them too much you don't

4934
03:14:16,318 --> 03:14:20,278
want to disturb them too much it just

4935
03:14:18,520 --> 03:14:22,680
you know it starts the the degradation

4936
03:14:20,279 --> 03:14:25,520
process on them at that point um so

4937
03:14:22,680 --> 03:14:28,159
leaving your your resin as untouched as

4938
03:14:25,520 --> 03:14:30,238
possible is best you know I would agree

4939
03:14:28,159 --> 03:14:31,799
I I look at it like grapes as a you know

4940
03:14:30,238 --> 03:14:33,238
as a wi you know someone stepping on

4941
03:14:31,799 --> 03:14:35,199
grapes to make wine or something you

4942
03:14:33,238 --> 03:14:37,238
don't want to damage Those Grapes before

4943
03:14:35,200 --> 03:14:38,319
you go and you squish your grapes you

4944
03:14:37,238 --> 03:14:40,879
know

4945
03:14:38,318 --> 03:14:43,920
it's them they start to mature and

4946
03:14:40,879 --> 03:14:45,920
oxidize quick to make a vintage blind

4947
03:14:43,920 --> 03:14:47,840
you don't have a controlled condition so

4948
03:14:45,920 --> 03:14:49,680
like a vintage grow doesn't have an

4949
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:51,680
indoor grow they grow outside without a

4950
03:14:49,680 --> 03:14:53,159
tar because what they're looking for is

4951
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:55,600
the grapes that survive you're looking

4952
03:14:53,159 --> 03:14:59,520
for grapes that have survived a drought

4953
03:14:55,600 --> 03:15:00,960
or heavy storms and you know it kind of

4954
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:03,680
hopefully genetics will get there in a

4955
03:15:00,959 --> 03:15:06,719
hundred years

4956
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:09,600
right but that's where that comes from

4957
03:15:06,719 --> 03:15:12,119
is that stress yep and that's where it's

4958
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:16,520
you know it's G to be expressed

4959
03:15:12,120 --> 03:15:18,640
more sure yeah you know I I again I come

4960
03:15:16,520 --> 03:15:20,560
from the traditional like air dry method

4961
03:15:18,639 --> 03:15:22,639
I never even had any of this stuff

4962
03:15:20,559 --> 03:15:26,159
coming up like there was no tutorials

4963
03:15:22,639 --> 03:15:28,318
there was no there was like weird forums

4964
03:15:26,159 --> 03:15:30,760
and chat rooms you could go in and most

4965
03:15:28,318 --> 03:15:32,639
of them were cultivators and not even

4966
03:15:30,760 --> 03:15:36,199
hash makers you know Marcus was one of

4967
03:15:32,639 --> 03:15:38,719
the first people I met that I could talk

4968
03:15:36,199 --> 03:15:40,640
to and he had so much knowledge because

4969
03:15:38,719 --> 03:15:42,799
of Sam and all the people that he was he

4970
03:15:40,639 --> 03:15:46,039
was working with so it was

4971
03:15:42,799 --> 03:15:48,920
um it's amazing to see all of this up

4972
03:15:46,040 --> 03:15:48,920
the amazing

4973
03:15:49,359 --> 03:15:56,040
the clar much thanks yeah Rob and um you

4974
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:57,920
know I guess what I'm saying is that

4975
03:15:56,040 --> 03:15:59,479
there's there's no wrong way to do this

4976
03:15:57,920 --> 03:16:01,159
and there's there's a lot of technique

4977
03:15:59,478 --> 03:16:03,398
and there's a lot of passion behind all

4978
03:16:01,159 --> 03:16:06,318
these these ways to get there and it's

4979
03:16:03,398 --> 03:16:07,478
it's really um there's a lot of of

4980
03:16:06,318 --> 03:16:09,238
different textures and different

4981
03:16:07,478 --> 03:16:11,039
profiles that you can get and it's

4982
03:16:09,238 --> 03:16:13,719
there's really no wrong way it's there

4983
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:15,319
just a just several ways that's the

4984
03:16:13,719 --> 03:16:17,039
greatest thing is it's you know

4985
03:16:15,318 --> 03:16:18,398
everybody can like a different thing and

4986
03:16:17,040 --> 03:16:19,880
like you know we can all try and

4987
03:16:18,398 --> 03:16:21,840
appreciate the different things because

4988
03:16:19,879 --> 03:16:23,759
it's all from the same thing it's just

4989
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:26,238
you know like I like blue shirts and you

4990
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:30,040
like red shirts like yeah doesn't mean

4991
03:16:26,238 --> 03:16:31,879
our shirts are wrong yep yeah I I my

4992
03:16:30,040 --> 03:16:34,279
analogies are from music because that's

4993
03:16:31,879 --> 03:16:37,159
my background but it's um no I thought

4994
03:16:34,279 --> 03:16:39,720
that was you know it's very much you

4995
03:16:37,159 --> 03:16:41,879
know like music to me like all the

4996
03:16:39,719 --> 03:16:44,159
things come together like harmonics and

4997
03:16:41,879 --> 03:16:45,799
then the instrumentation behind it and

4998
03:16:44,159 --> 03:16:47,719
the type of strings you use on the

4999
03:16:45,799 --> 03:16:50,000
guitar is just like you know it's just

5000
03:16:47,719 --> 03:16:52,398
it goes and goes and goes for me so I

5001
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:54,398
think um you know hearing everyone's

5002
03:16:52,398 --> 03:16:56,639
technique like Brian watching Brian up

5003
03:16:54,398 --> 03:16:58,358
in Maine do doing his thing it's it's

5004
03:16:56,639 --> 03:17:00,358
really inspiring because he's taking

5005
03:16:58,359 --> 03:17:02,040
these these methods that I've known for

5006
03:17:00,359 --> 03:17:04,439
for years and really modernizing them in

5007
03:17:02,040 --> 03:17:06,800
a way that's inspiring you know it's

5008
03:17:04,439 --> 03:17:09,318
it's so major hats off to you up there

5009
03:17:06,799 --> 03:17:11,000
best friend Farms it's it's awesome you

5010
03:17:09,318 --> 03:17:13,398
know I'm particularly using freeze

5011
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:17,000
dryers these days but you

5012
03:17:13,398 --> 03:17:18,959
know I I still air dry at home you know

5013
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:21,318
Still Still

5014
03:17:18,959 --> 03:17:24,079
Mak I think it's cool to go back to the

5015
03:17:21,318 --> 03:17:26,278
conversation with that too where it is

5016
03:17:24,079 --> 03:17:29,719
actually Market dependent where we're

5017
03:17:26,279 --> 03:17:31,880
talking about the final form or the

5018
03:17:29,719 --> 03:17:34,039
cured form of the resin where everyone's

5019
03:17:31,879 --> 03:17:36,318
really we're trying to isolate that

5020
03:17:34,040 --> 03:17:38,120
beautiful form and keep it as pristine

5021
03:17:36,318 --> 03:17:39,959
as we can there's also the idea that

5022
03:17:38,120 --> 03:17:41,600
it's going to hit different

5023
03:17:39,959 --> 03:17:43,919
dispensaries um it's going to hit

5024
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:46,159
middlemen in between Brokers it's going

5025
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:47,439
to sit on the shelf or go quick it will

5026
03:17:46,159 --> 03:17:50,559
sit on people

5027
03:17:47,439 --> 03:17:52,600
table that don't smoke as quick as we do

5028
03:17:50,559 --> 03:17:55,879
um so with that being in mind I think

5029
03:17:52,600 --> 03:17:57,520
reducing the final form of of a resin

5030
03:17:55,879 --> 03:17:59,438
where it's where I actually will do the

5031
03:17:57,520 --> 03:18:02,000
long two we air drrive but then also

5032
03:17:59,439 --> 03:18:04,639
room temp I really go like room temp up

5033
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:06,559
to a couple weeks even after to see the

5034
03:18:04,639 --> 03:18:09,039
stable form and I I call it whipping but

5035
03:18:06,559 --> 03:18:10,879
it's really just homogenizing so I'll do

5036
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:13,040
a cool whip on my bubble cream for

5037
03:18:10,879 --> 03:18:14,438
instance I'll do the Cool Whip I call it

5038
03:18:13,040 --> 03:18:16,239
and then I'll have it be grainy and

5039
03:18:14,439 --> 03:18:18,680
harder then but it's really strain

5040
03:18:16,238 --> 03:18:20,398
dependent for real first off and then it

5041
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:22,079
goes to a room temp where I'll whip it

5042
03:18:20,398 --> 03:18:24,119
again and let it settle after that to

5043
03:18:22,079 --> 03:18:25,680
homogenize and let it reach its final

5044
03:18:24,120 --> 03:18:27,760
State before it's going to change too

5045
03:18:25,680 --> 03:18:31,840
much when it reaches the consumer the

5046
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:33,800
patient yeah so that's great that's

5047
03:18:31,840 --> 03:18:36,159
that's you know not many people are

5048
03:18:33,799 --> 03:18:37,879
doing that you know Brian that's that's

5049
03:18:36,159 --> 03:18:39,398
it's that's important though because

5050
03:18:37,879 --> 03:18:42,759
you're you're you're getting inside the

5051
03:18:39,398 --> 03:18:45,439
head of of the of the end user which is

5052
03:18:42,760 --> 03:18:47,398
always the goal you know Easier by small

5053
03:18:45,439 --> 03:18:50,279
batch and we're definitely I'm paying a

5054
03:18:47,398 --> 03:18:52,920
lot of attention too to the um sterile

5055
03:18:50,279 --> 03:18:54,120
environment and how to produce that and

5056
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:56,799
I picked some of that up from the

5057
03:18:54,120 --> 03:18:58,800
emerald cup back in California honestly

5058
03:18:56,799 --> 03:19:00,879
from like a fail out for

5059
03:18:58,799 --> 03:19:02,920
microbacterial you know which I had no

5060
03:19:00,879 --> 03:19:04,879
clue of back then and it's turned up my

5061
03:19:02,920 --> 03:19:06,799
game where I just asked around on

5062
03:19:04,879 --> 03:19:09,159
Grassroots level and came up with

5063
03:19:06,799 --> 03:19:11,959
answers such as poly sealed hermetic you

5064
03:19:09,159 --> 03:19:14,478
know ask drying environment to start

5065
03:19:11,959 --> 03:19:17,238
with you know yeah but clean cultivar

5066
03:19:14,478 --> 03:19:19,519
organic practices clean cultivar um

5067
03:19:17,238 --> 03:19:22,000
organic practices as we're all seeking

5068
03:19:19,520 --> 03:19:24,760
resins we're also SE seeking the turpine

5069
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:27,120
profile almost more so so these loud

5070
03:19:24,760 --> 03:19:28,760
strains excuse me that everyone's after

5071
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:31,040
you know when we're organically farming

5072
03:19:28,760 --> 03:19:33,880
the resins they're speaking that real

5073
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:36,000
true nature also strain dependent very

5074
03:19:33,879 --> 03:19:38,119
much but then the cultivation technique

5075
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:40,799
after produces the fireus bubble or

5076
03:19:38,120 --> 03:19:41,840
rosin obviously back to regenerative

5077
03:19:40,799 --> 03:19:44,159
where you're going to actually be

5078
03:19:41,840 --> 03:19:47,040
firming like farming for turps not just

5079
03:19:44,159 --> 03:19:49,920
specific turp profile but how to produce

5080
03:19:47,040 --> 03:19:51,560
those turps under that profile Al to let

5081
03:19:49,920 --> 03:19:54,159
them speak the

5082
03:19:51,559 --> 03:19:57,799
loudest yeah man that's that's well said

5083
03:19:54,159 --> 03:20:00,840
it's awesome that's that's so

5084
03:19:57,799 --> 03:20:02,799
true so with that said what's uh what

5085
03:20:00,840 --> 03:20:04,639
are you guys getting ready to plant for

5086
03:20:02,799 --> 03:20:06,079
uh for hashm this season is there

5087
03:20:04,639 --> 03:20:08,760
anything going into the ground that you

5088
03:20:06,079 --> 03:20:11,680
guys are really excited about on uh on

5089
03:20:08,760 --> 03:20:17,079
you know on the red Coast strawberry

5090
03:20:11,680 --> 03:20:17,079
Angela oh strawberry Angela over here

5091
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:24,000
probably gonna runaya this year nice I

5092
03:20:21,478 --> 03:20:25,278
honestly think I'm people think I'm nuts

5093
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,760
but I think I'm just going to stick with

5094
03:20:25,279 --> 03:20:28,640
what I know and what I've grown outdoors

5095
03:20:26,760 --> 03:20:31,439
and what produces very well for me here

5096
03:20:28,639 --> 03:20:33,639
and what I enjoy extremely well and

5097
03:20:31,439 --> 03:20:35,398
that's my critical cush so I'll probably

5098
03:20:33,639 --> 03:20:36,760
just throw that in the ground throw five

5099
03:20:35,398 --> 03:20:40,478
or six of them outside so we stay

5100
03:20:36,760 --> 03:20:42,639
underneath the numbers and uh yeah it

5101
03:20:40,478 --> 03:20:44,119
produces very well and I I've just

5102
03:20:42,639 --> 03:20:46,959
thrown I went through throwing different

5103
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:49,399
stuff outside before and when I do now

5104
03:20:46,959 --> 03:20:51,000
it'll be the one plant or something uh

5105
03:20:49,398 --> 03:20:53,238
because I've just had plants that do

5106
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:56,680
extremely well indoors and then outside

5107
03:20:53,238 --> 03:20:58,920
it's horrible fails falls on its face so

5108
03:20:56,680 --> 03:21:01,359
I I unfortunately sometimes I don't like

5109
03:20:58,920 --> 03:21:02,960
to fail in those instances when it comes

5110
03:21:01,359 --> 03:21:04,040
to having my medicine so sometimes I

5111
03:21:02,959 --> 03:21:06,238
stick with what I

5112
03:21:04,040 --> 03:21:08,319
know maybe that's when you can learn

5113
03:21:06,238 --> 03:21:10,959
from another person's erors someone in

5114
03:21:08,318 --> 03:21:14,198
the same terar someone

5115
03:21:10,959 --> 03:21:16,318
nearby the lato S1 and forbidden

5116
03:21:14,199 --> 03:21:18,479
Skittles did very well for us last year

5117
03:21:16,318 --> 03:21:20,719
and doing them again this year they're

5118
03:21:18,478 --> 03:21:20,719
very

5119
03:21:21,079 --> 03:21:26,478
resinous

5120
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:28,520
nice I'm I'm gonna grow some OG outside

5121
03:21:26,478 --> 03:21:32,318
for hash making that's not a a common

5122
03:21:28,520 --> 03:21:34,720
thing either we did Iranian OG last year

5123
03:21:32,318 --> 03:21:36,680
that was nice not good for us year it

5124
03:21:34,719 --> 03:21:39,198
flipped way too early and got really

5125
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:41,520
really big really fast and then it was

5126
03:21:39,199 --> 03:21:44,960
like really hot

5127
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:47,840
and not again it's so rare to find a

5128
03:21:44,959 --> 03:21:51,919
good uh OG that does well for like Sol

5129
03:21:47,840 --> 03:21:53,478
this oh yeah it's insane it's hard this

5130
03:21:51,920 --> 03:21:56,040
I got some Dying Breed here I'm gon to

5131
03:21:53,478 --> 03:21:59,159
give a give a go some diesel dog here

5132
03:21:56,040 --> 03:22:03,040
shout out massive sh massive that's some

5133
03:21:59,159 --> 03:22:07,959
OG right there some triple XX OG triple

5134
03:22:03,040 --> 03:22:10,279
xog that looks it show did yeah this is

5135
03:22:07,959 --> 03:22:13,278
some flower rosin actually yeah this was

5136
03:22:10,279 --> 03:22:16,680
separated this is uh the same press time

5137
03:22:13,279 --> 03:22:19,279
again we separated it uh time this I was

5138
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:21,318
going to ask about your press there what

5139
03:22:19,279 --> 03:22:23,840
uh is that is that thing on the market

5140
03:22:21,318 --> 03:22:27,439
now it is it is we released it at MJ

5141
03:22:23,840 --> 03:22:29,719
biscon uh this last year this was the

5142
03:22:27,439 --> 03:22:31,840
second portion so because the oil

5143
03:22:29,719 --> 03:22:34,159
collects to the center we're able to

5144
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:36,079
move the parchment paper as the oil

5145
03:22:34,159 --> 03:22:38,279
separates so I hear everybody talking

5146
03:22:36,079 --> 03:22:41,120
really about washing Steve and washing

5147
03:22:38,279 --> 03:22:43,680
hash uh to clean it to separate the

5148
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:45,920
microns um a late Discovery after

5149
03:22:43,680 --> 03:22:48,199
inventing this for scalability we had

5150
03:22:45,920 --> 03:22:51,040
oil control and because we had oil

5151
03:22:48,199 --> 03:22:54,319
control I noticed the different melting

5152
03:22:51,040 --> 03:22:56,680
phases of oil because I was able to move

5153
03:22:54,318 --> 03:22:59,760
the catching area and separate the kind

5154
03:22:56,680 --> 03:23:02,318
of qualities kind of in my eyes pressing

5155
03:22:59,760 --> 03:23:05,880
with flower rosin separates it or cleans

5156
03:23:02,318 --> 03:23:08,879
it in a in a different form um so it's

5157
03:23:05,879 --> 03:23:11,039
it's it's pretty interesting how uh when

5158
03:23:08,879 --> 03:23:13,318
all the all the rosin flows off of the

5159
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:14,920
parchment paper how it kind of trails

5160
03:23:13,318 --> 03:23:17,318
behind each other as far as melting

5161
03:23:14,920 --> 03:23:20,120
points but with think coming straight

5162
03:23:17,318 --> 03:23:23,079
off of the bag off of the the partum

5163
03:23:20,120 --> 03:23:25,880
paper complete we're able to separate

5164
03:23:23,079 --> 03:23:28,439
the different quality and phases and

5165
03:23:25,879 --> 03:23:29,920
it's it's something new I don't know um

5166
03:23:28,439 --> 03:23:31,920
yeah so you can watch The Head and the

5167
03:23:29,920 --> 03:23:33,719
tail as it as it starts to come out

5168
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:36,159
exactly you could actually just that's

5169
03:23:33,719 --> 03:23:38,920
why I'm seeing like 28% Returns on some

5170
03:23:36,159 --> 03:23:41,959
flour on this triple xog one the last

5171
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:43,639
Harvest not this Harvest was 20 4% but

5172
03:23:41,959 --> 03:23:45,839
because it all the grow always matters

5173
03:23:43,639 --> 03:23:47,039
right but we're able to essentially

5174
03:23:45,840 --> 03:23:49,920
press it all

5175
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:52,680
and separate the good quality yellow

5176
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:54,600
stuff from the darker stuff all in one

5177
03:23:52,680 --> 03:23:56,920
one press extracting everything but

5178
03:23:54,600 --> 03:24:00,079
still uh separating the two for

5179
03:23:56,920 --> 03:24:02,799
production purposes you know that's nice

5180
03:24:00,079 --> 03:24:05,279
as a facility as a corporation you know

5181
03:24:02,799 --> 03:24:08,000
you want to be able to get everything

5182
03:24:05,279 --> 03:24:09,920
every penny matters so leaving any oil

5183
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:12,840
in there especially for another process

5184
03:24:09,920 --> 03:24:15,159
is time for the processor to put it back

5185
03:24:12,840 --> 03:24:17,960
under the plates and press it again so I

5186
03:24:15,159 --> 03:24:19,600
wanted to you know def itely have a

5187
03:24:17,959 --> 03:24:21,398
process that had adequate pounds per

5188
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:23,559
square inch that could extract

5189
03:24:21,398 --> 03:24:25,840
everything and then again a late

5190
03:24:23,559 --> 03:24:29,278
Discovery after the invention was oh

5191
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:31,040
[ __ ] this is yellow light yellow oh now

5192
03:24:29,279 --> 03:24:34,079
there's a drop of dark like it always

5193
03:24:31,040 --> 03:24:36,720
Trails on on two flat plates that I

5194
03:24:34,079 --> 03:24:38,478
pulled it and I saw the dark separate

5195
03:24:36,719 --> 03:24:40,438
from the light and there's a video on

5196
03:24:38,478 --> 03:24:42,920
YouTube under access rosin that shows

5197
03:24:40,439 --> 03:24:46,559
the first time I used the Prototype of

5198
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:49,359
this one that um that did that and it

5199
03:24:46,559 --> 03:24:52,398
the SE junkies Cushman that we pressed

5200
03:24:49,359 --> 03:24:55,439
indoor and the guy it was trim he stored

5201
03:24:52,398 --> 03:24:57,840
it cold and so I was really curious

5202
03:24:55,439 --> 03:25:01,398
about what crumble came out first versus

5203
03:24:57,840 --> 03:25:03,040
the dark Saucy tpping stuff in the back

5204
03:25:01,398 --> 03:25:05,920
I didn't I didn't know the terminology

5205
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:09,120
between the two in the beginning so I

5206
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:10,920
was like I know you know the BHO process

5207
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:13,040
as far as understanding that you have to

5208
03:25:10,920 --> 03:25:15,159
winterize the lipids and fats to extract

5209
03:25:13,040 --> 03:25:18,279
it and and RZ and we're kind of doing

5210
03:25:15,159 --> 03:25:20,600
like a reverse engineering of that by

5211
03:25:18,279 --> 03:25:24,479
liquefying the tpin and oozing them off

5212
03:25:20,600 --> 03:25:26,040
holding back uh the lipin fats and thcas

5213
03:25:24,478 --> 03:25:28,679
that I'm just I'm just kind of playing

5214
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:30,640
with the melting points uh as far as

5215
03:25:28,680 --> 03:25:34,960
production wise looking at it in a

5216
03:25:30,639 --> 03:25:37,079
scalable form for for facilities to to

5217
03:25:34,959 --> 03:25:39,198
again extract everything in a shorter

5218
03:25:37,079 --> 03:25:42,279
process and if I could dial that down

5219
03:25:39,199 --> 03:25:44,920
from pressing flower rosin straight or

5220
03:25:42,279 --> 03:25:47,079
flow straight to rosin without any

5221
03:25:44,920 --> 03:25:50,600
cleaning process and do the cleaning

5222
03:25:47,079 --> 03:25:52,600
process during the Press is is something

5223
03:25:50,600 --> 03:25:55,439
I've just recently been able to

5224
03:25:52,600 --> 03:25:57,800
replicate consistent with two Harvest at

5225
03:25:55,439 --> 03:26:00,639
two different time frames and get the

5226
03:25:57,799 --> 03:26:03,959
same exact results um what's what's the

5227
03:26:00,639 --> 03:26:06,079
cultivar behind you just like dumping I

5228
03:26:03,959 --> 03:26:08,159
mean it's not a squish it's a dump it's

5229
03:26:06,079 --> 03:26:09,799
like that shit's falling behind you well

5230
03:26:08,159 --> 03:26:12,199
that's just because the capacity so I

5231
03:26:09,799 --> 03:26:14,799
was all about scalability and so I try

5232
03:26:12,199 --> 03:26:17,720
to create what is the most comfortable

5233
03:26:14,799 --> 03:26:19,920
throughput capacity per press that a

5234
03:26:17,719 --> 03:26:23,278
press could withhold and so I kind of

5235
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:26,559
sat at a quarter pound four bags at 28

5236
03:26:23,279 --> 03:26:28,479
grams per bag and so that the video on

5237
03:26:26,559 --> 03:26:30,079
the green screen back there is a video

5238
03:26:28,478 --> 03:26:32,959
I'm working on on production and

5239
03:26:30,079 --> 03:26:34,600
Premiere right now to to show case this

5240
03:26:32,959 --> 03:26:37,559
entire process I'm talking about it's

5241
03:26:34,600 --> 03:26:39,000
it's just that of what 28 grams of what

5242
03:26:37,559 --> 03:26:42,719
that was the triple

5243
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:45,318
xog I grew are you doing with with hash

5244
03:26:42,719 --> 03:26:47,639
at all have you tested any yeah yeah

5245
03:26:45,318 --> 03:26:51,000
there's some videos on my YouTube shout

5246
03:26:47,639 --> 03:26:53,959
out C kosher up NorCal I'm in SoCal I

5247
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:56,959
drove up there they they committed again

5248
03:26:53,959 --> 03:26:58,519
it's hard to commit 200 grams of of hash

5249
03:26:56,959 --> 03:27:00,719
right into a brand new press but

5250
03:26:58,520 --> 03:27:03,399
essentially uh I had to show them that

5251
03:27:00,719 --> 03:27:04,959
it works the same it's two heated plates

5252
03:27:03,398 --> 03:27:06,559
in a controlled manner with the bag at

5253
03:27:04,959 --> 03:27:08,159
the edge of the inside of the plate

5254
03:27:06,559 --> 03:27:09,959
where they all collaborate and collect

5255
03:27:08,159 --> 03:27:12,520
together so it just multiplies how much

5256
03:27:09,959 --> 03:27:15,398
you could do and control the oil into a

5257
03:27:12,520 --> 03:27:18,520
collection form and so it it hash or

5258
03:27:15,398 --> 03:27:20,478
flour it really uh it's all op press

5259
03:27:18,520 --> 03:27:21,800
turning it in it's really genetic and

5260
03:27:20,478 --> 03:27:25,000
all the variables you guys have been

5261
03:27:21,799 --> 03:27:26,599
speaking about with uh with put what you

5262
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:29,478
put in is what you get out is the

5263
03:27:26,600 --> 03:27:31,199
ultimate rule of thumb for rosin and uh

5264
03:27:29,478 --> 03:27:33,358
you know again the Press is just the

5265
03:27:31,199 --> 03:27:35,840
equipment that just is trying to make it

5266
03:27:33,359 --> 03:27:38,920
easier for the throughput capacity of

5267
03:27:35,840 --> 03:27:44,120
large scale production both flower and

5268
03:27:38,920 --> 03:27:46,879
hash um again at 200 grams per press uh

5269
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:49,439
the problem I'm running into is is the

5270
03:27:46,879 --> 03:27:50,920
the scalability of ice water but now

5271
03:27:49,439 --> 03:27:53,000
with wizard Tech and everybody coming

5272
03:27:50,920 --> 03:27:56,000
out with huge production ice waterer

5273
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:57,520
machine Goldilocks being the producer of

5274
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:59,439
one of those machines I mean we're

5275
03:27:57,520 --> 03:28:00,800
seeing some Mass amounts of hash that

5276
03:27:59,439 --> 03:28:04,520
could probably keep up with the

5277
03:28:00,799 --> 03:28:07,278
throughput capacity of pressing it

5278
03:28:04,520 --> 03:28:10,399
collecting it and actually SE separating

5279
03:28:07,279 --> 03:28:11,760
the melting points of the rosin and

5280
03:28:10,398 --> 03:28:15,478
creating different

5281
03:28:11,760 --> 03:28:17,359
products cool how what were your size uh

5282
03:28:15,478 --> 03:28:21,639
presses that's really cool

5283
03:28:17,359 --> 03:28:23,199
BR uh right now we use uh two uh we have

5284
03:28:21,639 --> 03:28:26,318
a couple different SAS squashes that I

5285
03:28:23,199 --> 03:28:29,800
use right now it's uh we got a couple M1

5286
03:28:26,318 --> 03:28:31,318
the new M1 uh presses that they have out

5287
03:28:29,799 --> 03:28:33,519
so what's the what's the amount of hash

5288
03:28:31,318 --> 03:28:35,079
you'd put in there too we do we we do

5289
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:36,720
smaller presses to be honest we do

5290
03:28:35,079 --> 03:28:38,039
smaller presses at a little bit higher

5291
03:28:36,719 --> 03:28:40,799
temps quick

5292
03:28:38,040 --> 03:28:45,160
presses um and that's what I to find to

5293
03:28:40,799 --> 03:28:47,358
be the best uh overall thing um it gets

5294
03:28:45,159 --> 03:28:49,279
off of the plates it's good high higher

5295
03:28:47,359 --> 03:28:51,800
attempts is not a bad thing as long as

5296
03:28:49,279 --> 03:28:53,120
it gets off of those plates and uh yeah

5297
03:28:51,799 --> 03:28:56,039
I mean we've done everything over the

5298
03:28:53,120 --> 03:28:58,520
day over the years um I would say I just

5299
03:28:56,040 --> 03:29:01,160
I like these we kind of just have a

5300
03:28:58,520 --> 03:29:04,359
process of I have noticed a difference

5301
03:29:01,159 --> 03:29:06,238
in yield over time is like going up in

5302
03:29:04,359 --> 03:29:07,720
in bag size and like that's what I was

5303
03:29:06,238 --> 03:29:10,238
going to ask everybody is like what what

5304
03:29:07,719 --> 03:29:12,599
weight is everybody putting in in their

5305
03:29:10,238 --> 03:29:15,719
bags and pressing per

5306
03:29:12,600 --> 03:29:17,840
press 14 14 in a bag and I'll do two

5307
03:29:15,719 --> 03:29:20,478
bags what size

5308
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:23,840
bag okay what size

5309
03:29:20,478 --> 03:29:26,000
bag uh it's like a two by I mean the

5310
03:29:23,840 --> 03:29:29,920
amount of bag that I use it's probably

5311
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:34,318
after I fold it probably like two

5312
03:29:29,920 --> 03:29:37,520
by four maybe Micon size I'll either do

5313
03:29:34,318 --> 03:29:39,238
10 grams in a 2 by3 and my by the time I

5314
03:29:37,520 --> 03:29:44,520
fold it over it's usually about a 2 by

5315
03:29:39,238 --> 03:29:46,799
two I'll do 25 micron or or I'll do 20

5316
03:29:44,520 --> 03:29:50,960
grams in a 2x4 and a half which ends up

5317
03:29:46,799 --> 03:29:54,759
being about a 2 by4 I like using 25 3

5318
03:29:50,959 --> 03:29:58,000
by8 and putting like 14 to 20 grams in

5319
03:29:54,760 --> 03:30:01,040
it see that we go by square in this is a

5320
03:29:58,000 --> 03:30:02,879
20 20 inches Square even though it's a

5321
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:05,880
trapezoid shape we we measure it by

5322
03:30:02,879 --> 03:30:07,839
square inch and then uh we just we just

5323
03:30:05,879 --> 03:30:10,719
calculate how much volume like for a

5324
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:13,799
flower uh you know we get a little over

5325
03:30:10,719 --> 03:30:16,398
like 130% per

5326
03:30:13,799 --> 03:30:19,278
bag we do so what's your what's your

5327
03:30:16,398 --> 03:30:21,439
yield back on uh on that solr I'm I'm

5328
03:30:19,279 --> 03:30:24,120
doing 30 gr presses right now and I've

5329
03:30:21,439 --> 03:30:27,159
I've the last in this past last year

5330
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:28,960
I've just been all over the place but um

5331
03:30:27,159 --> 03:30:32,159
I'm seeing a lot of good success at at

5332
03:30:28,959 --> 03:30:34,959
30 grams at seven you know above 70%

5333
03:30:32,159 --> 03:30:38,920
return yeah I'll get so so what I look

5334
03:30:34,959 --> 03:30:40,879
at is okay so I I I have a basically

5335
03:30:38,920 --> 03:30:44,559
with like the six-star I need to get at

5336
03:30:40,879 --> 03:30:48,759
least 90 to like 92% back so with 28

5337
03:30:44,559 --> 03:30:50,238
Grams and two 14 pouches I can get 90 to

5338
03:30:48,760 --> 03:30:54,238
whatever whatever I need to I hit that

5339
03:30:50,238 --> 03:30:56,000
I'll hit at least 90 90% back um and and

5340
03:30:54,238 --> 03:30:57,559
you know like when it comes to full spec

5341
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:59,520
things like that like the full spec

5342
03:30:57,559 --> 03:31:01,119
first like you know not necessarily full

5343
03:30:59,520 --> 03:31:05,040
spec what I call full spec you know is

5344
03:31:01,120 --> 03:31:08,760
it would be like the 70 90 120 uh

5345
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:10,720
sometimes the 150 um but usually on that

5346
03:31:08,760 --> 03:31:15,520
you know I look to get back anywhere

5347
03:31:10,719 --> 03:31:19,639
from uh 84 to like 87% back you know you

5348
03:31:15,520 --> 03:31:21,238
say 214 bags do you do the 214 in one

5349
03:31:19,639 --> 03:31:23,599
bag after you bag them or are you

5350
03:31:21,238 --> 03:31:25,318
putting them side by side on your press

5351
03:31:23,600 --> 03:31:26,960
yeah side by side on the Press because

5352
03:31:25,318 --> 03:31:29,439
and and it's got a little Gap in between

5353
03:31:26,959 --> 03:31:30,599
it so I feel like um you know if I'm

5354
03:31:29,439 --> 03:31:33,120
gonna

5355
03:31:30,600 --> 03:31:35,359
put okay so I feel like with this what

5356
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:38,520
it does is it it reduces the amount of

5357
03:31:35,359 --> 03:31:41,720
mass and like how far the center Mass is

5358
03:31:38,520 --> 03:31:44,600
from from the exit pressure yeah so now

5359
03:31:41,719 --> 03:31:46,318
I have two bags which you know they can

5360
03:31:44,600 --> 03:31:48,640
get out from the center quick it doesn't

5361
03:31:46,318 --> 03:31:50,639
have to travel through so much mass and

5362
03:31:48,639 --> 03:31:52,559
just kind of like it's all it's all

5363
03:31:50,639 --> 03:31:54,719
theory in the head but are you still

5364
03:31:52,559 --> 03:31:57,559
using the Longs Peak yeah I use the

5365
03:31:54,719 --> 03:31:59,000
Longs Peak and you guys are hitting you

5366
03:31:57,559 --> 03:32:00,719
what temperatures are you guys are at

5367
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:03,719
you guys are at 180 or you guys are at

5368
03:32:00,719 --> 03:32:05,278
190 like what's with that type of return

5369
03:32:03,719 --> 03:32:08,879
that seems like a higher temperature

5370
03:32:05,279 --> 03:32:13,120
right yeah I press hot dude I press like

5371
03:32:08,879 --> 03:32:16,438
anywhere from 210 to oh wow like what

5372
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:18,680
what people call real fast yeah I press

5373
03:32:16,439 --> 03:32:18,680
hot

5374
03:32:22,959 --> 03:32:28,519
too 210 like on the low end I'd say 210

5375
03:32:26,920 --> 03:32:31,439
215

5376
03:32:28,520 --> 03:32:33,238
225 yeah oh yeah dude I'll hit I'll max

5377
03:32:31,439 --> 03:32:35,040
out at like 230 but it depends on the

5378
03:32:33,238 --> 03:32:37,119
strain you know what I mean we got

5379
03:32:35,040 --> 03:32:39,720
there's there's super stable strains

5380
03:32:37,120 --> 03:32:42,920
they they they react differently um I

5381
03:32:39,719 --> 03:32:45,478
like to get it off the Block in about 45

5382
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:46,680
to 60 seconds I don't like to go over 60

5383
03:32:45,478 --> 03:32:48,519
Seconds

5384
03:32:46,680 --> 03:32:51,600
um and I really don't like to really go

5385
03:32:48,520 --> 03:32:54,159
much over about 1500 pounds of

5386
03:32:51,600 --> 03:32:56,720
forest or however you want

5387
03:32:54,159 --> 03:33:01,559
to pressure I'm able to like monitor all

5388
03:32:56,719 --> 03:33:04,478
that [ __ ] y keep it low

5389
03:33:01,559 --> 03:33:06,879
too I mean I got strands that we we we

5390
03:33:04,478 --> 03:33:09,559
won't have to goove 500 on you know like

5391
03:33:06,879 --> 03:33:11,599
they'll just be dumping the any of that

5392
03:33:09,559 --> 03:33:15,198
six star I mean it just Dums yeah and as

5393
03:33:11,600 --> 03:33:16,800
you know the six star for sure just when

5394
03:33:15,199 --> 03:33:19,000
you're getting into like the the [ __ ]

5395
03:33:16,799 --> 03:33:21,238
second third wash you know like the the

5396
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:23,639
the mix Micron [ __ ] you have to apply

5397
03:33:21,238 --> 03:33:26,840
more pressure because now you have more

5398
03:33:23,639 --> 03:33:28,318
mass the no mouths yeah that's why I

5399
03:33:26,840 --> 03:33:30,680
think it's cool that's why I think the

5400
03:33:28,318 --> 03:33:32,639
Press like uh that pure pressure the

5401
03:33:30,680 --> 03:33:36,398
m1's from sasquash it's cool because you

5402
03:33:32,639 --> 03:33:39,358
can just dial it all in um we press all

5403
03:33:36,398 --> 03:33:42,358
of our microns everything separately we

5404
03:33:39,359 --> 03:33:46,040
don't mix anything in the Press

5405
03:33:42,359 --> 03:33:48,800
pressed yeah I don't we judge everything

5406
03:33:46,040 --> 03:33:51,880
press and then because we we just have a

5407
03:33:48,799 --> 03:33:56,079
lot of a lot of every Micron so

5408
03:33:51,879 --> 03:33:56,079
it's SE separate all the

5409
03:33:56,959 --> 03:34:02,519
microns so you're

5410
03:33:59,398 --> 03:34:04,559
always I love to mix uh I love to mix

5411
03:34:02,520 --> 03:34:07,159
strains too like when it comes to rosin

5412
03:34:04,559 --> 03:34:09,398
and stuff but I know one thing I'm like

5413
03:34:07,159 --> 03:34:12,159
really big about not doing is when it

5414
03:34:09,398 --> 03:34:14,599
comes to washing them I won't wash like

5415
03:34:12,159 --> 03:34:16,799
let's say I want to do like [ __ ] a

5416
03:34:14,600 --> 03:34:18,840
three [ __ ]

5417
03:34:16,799 --> 03:34:21,519
three blend like this strain that strain

5418
03:34:18,840 --> 03:34:24,520
that strain I don't want to wash them

5419
03:34:21,520 --> 03:34:27,040
together until I know what each isolated

5420
03:34:24,520 --> 03:34:29,159
Micron does you know what I mean so like

5421
03:34:27,040 --> 03:34:31,920
if I know like okay this strain dumps in

5422
03:34:29,159 --> 03:34:34,318
the 90 this strain doesn't dump in the

5423
03:34:31,920 --> 03:34:35,760
90 and it puts a lot in the 70 or it's

5424
03:34:34,318 --> 03:34:37,519
put more in here which is telling you

5425
03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:39,680
where the quality on that strain is

5426
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:42,279
lying you know then you start to mix

5427
03:34:39,680 --> 03:34:44,199
like the degraded parts of other strains

5428
03:34:42,279 --> 03:34:47,000
with Quality Parts of other strains so I

5429
03:34:44,199 --> 03:34:49,319
feel like wash everything separated

5430
03:34:47,000 --> 03:34:51,120
until you know what its isolated Micron

5431
03:34:49,318 --> 03:34:52,680
is and as far as how you grade that

5432
03:34:51,120 --> 03:34:55,079
quality of those

5433
03:34:52,680 --> 03:34:57,359
microns that's when you can wash them

5434
03:34:55,079 --> 03:34:59,279
together but other than that just wash

5435
03:34:57,359 --> 03:35:01,279
everything separate and when it comes to

5436
03:34:59,279 --> 03:35:03,840
the Blends dude like oh man I'll sit

5437
03:35:01,279 --> 03:35:05,560
here and have my [ __ ] I'm I feel like

5438
03:35:03,840 --> 03:35:09,279
I'm a chef when it comes to it dude I'll

5439
03:35:05,559 --> 03:35:11,039
[ __ ] come up with con and it's like

5440
03:35:09,279 --> 03:35:13,520
go ahead and try to figure out what it

5441
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:14,720
is you know you think about like little

5442
03:35:13,520 --> 03:35:16,000
bit of this a little bit of that a

5443
03:35:14,719 --> 03:35:18,639
little bit of this a little bit of that

5444
03:35:16,000 --> 03:35:21,920
mix it all up press it

5445
03:35:18,639 --> 03:35:24,000
like exactly yeah we just did some fun

5446
03:35:21,920 --> 03:35:26,238
mixtures at work

5447
03:35:24,000 --> 03:35:28,719
too back to the times and temperatures

5448
03:35:26,238 --> 03:35:30,520
I'll do 160 degrees I'll always do a

5449
03:35:28,719 --> 03:35:33,000
directional flow so that I get my rosin

5450
03:35:30,520 --> 03:35:36,399
off the plates as quick as possible I do

5451
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:39,279
do with a 30 second preheat I'll do up

5452
03:35:36,398 --> 03:35:40,719
to up to two and a half minute press uh

5453
03:35:39,279 --> 03:35:42,600
that like I said making sure that I get

5454
03:35:40,719 --> 03:35:46,639
the rosin out the plates as soon as

5455
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:49,199
possible um yeah but I never press over

5456
03:35:46,639 --> 03:35:50,639
maybe 170 when we're talking hash I'll

5457
03:35:49,199 --> 03:35:54,720
never press over

5458
03:35:50,639 --> 03:35:57,119
170 yeah I'm I'm a 180 maximum but uh I

5459
03:35:54,719 --> 03:35:59,000
I've been playing over the last year

5460
03:35:57,120 --> 03:36:01,520
with anywhere from between 220 all the

5461
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:02,799
way down to to 90 degrees to be honest

5462
03:36:01,520 --> 03:36:05,680
and it's

5463
03:36:02,799 --> 03:36:07,000
um you know each variety as we've been

5464
03:36:05,680 --> 03:36:09,238
talking is going to give you something

5465
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:12,000
different but uh I found a nice range

5466
03:36:09,238 --> 03:36:14,760
between the the 170 and 190 to be kind

5467
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:16,959
of a sweet spot pring should really be

5468
03:36:14,760 --> 03:36:20,120
specific when you're yeah sorry that's

5469
03:36:16,959 --> 03:36:22,198
for hash only with flow we're talking

5470
03:36:20,120 --> 03:36:23,439
about hash right now yeah I just want to

5471
03:36:22,199 --> 03:36:25,720
make that clear everyone we're talking

5472
03:36:23,439 --> 03:36:29,238
about hash right now only flow I would

5473
03:36:25,719 --> 03:36:30,559
start I would press flow at like 210 200

5474
03:36:29,238 --> 03:36:33,279
press at

5475
03:36:30,559 --> 03:36:38,639
210 I'll simplify the [ __ ] out of it I I

5476
03:36:33,279 --> 03:36:40,319
would press flow at in 190 200 but I've

5477
03:36:38,639 --> 03:36:44,000
completely given that up I will not

5478
03:36:40,318 --> 03:36:48,000
press flower anymore yeah me neither

5479
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:50,199
dude no exception I like double refined

5480
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:52,199
concentrate you know what you know what

5481
03:36:50,199 --> 03:36:54,600
there are some strains that make really

5482
03:36:52,199 --> 03:36:57,479
good flower rosin but for the most part

5483
03:36:54,600 --> 03:37:00,079
you know I feel like it's be it my

5484
03:36:57,478 --> 03:37:02,238
theory on it is that it's probably less

5485
03:37:00,079 --> 03:37:03,959
fats and lipids present in that strain

5486
03:37:02,238 --> 03:37:05,799
so when you press it the clarity the

5487
03:37:03,959 --> 03:37:07,959
stability probably has a lot to do with

5488
03:37:05,799 --> 03:37:10,438
the tpin present and [ __ ] but it's just

5489
03:37:07,959 --> 03:37:12,000
like my observation I like a couple of

5490
03:37:10,439 --> 03:37:13,840
things I like a couple of things about

5491
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:15,959
flower rosin what I like about flower

5492
03:37:13,840 --> 03:37:18,079
rosin is it gives me the ability because

5493
03:37:15,959 --> 03:37:20,519
I don't smoke flour when someone gives

5494
03:37:18,079 --> 03:37:23,318
me flour and lots of people give me

5495
03:37:20,520 --> 03:37:26,199
flour to be able to take that nug home

5496
03:37:23,318 --> 03:37:28,000
run it through the helix or the M1 or

5497
03:37:26,199 --> 03:37:30,840
whatever and get that little bit of

5498
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:32,478
rosin and not only does it give you a

5499
03:37:30,840 --> 03:37:34,920
nice experience like that where the

5500
03:37:32,478 --> 03:37:39,159
person who sh me I can actually take it

5501
03:37:34,920 --> 03:37:42,478
and appreciate it but it's also um that

5502
03:37:39,159 --> 03:37:44,279
I'm I'm now learning as well I'm seeing

5503
03:37:42,478 --> 03:37:45,879
more different types of flowers

5504
03:37:44,279 --> 03:37:48,439
different moisture content different

5505
03:37:45,879 --> 03:37:51,119
rosin it's not like I'm dedicating a lot

5506
03:37:48,439 --> 03:37:55,040
of time to it but I still find it to be

5507
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:56,880
a very nice learning experience uh and I

5508
03:37:55,040 --> 03:37:59,160
that's that's basically what I love

5509
03:37:56,879 --> 03:38:01,318
about good point no no super good point

5510
03:37:59,159 --> 03:38:05,079
dude like that that to me I think that

5511
03:38:01,318 --> 03:38:07,600
is a very important test to have in the

5512
03:38:05,079 --> 03:38:09,120
lab like when it comes to processing new

5513
03:38:07,600 --> 03:38:11,559
material or something you know that's

5514
03:38:09,120 --> 03:38:13,359
not consistent or your grower saying hey

5515
03:38:11,559 --> 03:38:15,719
this run was a little off I don't know

5516
03:38:13,359 --> 03:38:17,159
what's up you know it's always best to

5517
03:38:15,719 --> 03:38:19,079
have you know like when when we're going

5518
03:38:17,159 --> 03:38:21,159
to wash has you know we'll throw some

5519
03:38:19,079 --> 03:38:22,840
buds in a jar with some ice shake it up

5520
03:38:21,159 --> 03:38:24,840
see what falls off is it even worth

5521
03:38:22,840 --> 03:38:26,040
washing yes or no you know and that's

5522
03:38:24,840 --> 03:38:27,359
still not going to tell you if it's

5523
03:38:26,040 --> 03:38:29,520
going to do good it just tells you

5524
03:38:27,359 --> 03:38:31,640
should I give it a shot you know so when

5525
03:38:29,520 --> 03:38:33,680
it comes to any kind of like new flower

5526
03:38:31,639 --> 03:38:36,079
coming in if you have an opportunity to

5527
03:38:33,680 --> 03:38:39,359
press a nug and say hey this nug pressed

5528
03:38:36,079 --> 03:38:41,760
out 30% return on it dude it's got an

5529
03:38:39,359 --> 03:38:44,238
opportunity to do a killer job in the

5530
03:38:41,760 --> 03:38:46,600
wash so now you present it to the wash

5531
03:38:44,238 --> 03:38:50,359
it might not do well so it might only be

5532
03:38:46,600 --> 03:38:53,720
a hydrocarbon slfl rosin extract so you

5533
03:38:50,359 --> 03:38:55,880
have to either you know learn to to to

5534
03:38:53,719 --> 03:38:59,278
refine that to the best of what it can

5535
03:38:55,879 --> 03:39:00,799
be as a flower rosin or choose that it

5536
03:38:59,279 --> 03:39:02,600
can e and you know it could probably

5537
03:39:00,799 --> 03:39:04,599
make great sift and you can refine it

5538
03:39:02,600 --> 03:39:06,159
that way press that into rosin but if

5539
03:39:04,600 --> 03:39:08,040
you're looking for a hash rosin some

5540
03:39:06,159 --> 03:39:12,199
strains just don't cut

5541
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:14,080
it totally great test I like I like just

5542
03:39:12,199 --> 03:39:16,040
the fresh press like when I'm curing my

5543
03:39:14,079 --> 03:39:17,639
weed and I just got to cut down because

5544
03:39:16,040 --> 03:39:19,359
of course I grow my own I like going in

5545
03:39:17,639 --> 03:39:21,398
there start pressing day four grab a

5546
03:39:19,359 --> 03:39:22,920
couple lugs and then I'll take some put

5547
03:39:21,398 --> 03:39:24,920
it in the freezer then I'll do my wash

5548
03:39:22,920 --> 03:39:26,680
and stuff but I I don't like pressing

5549
03:39:24,920 --> 03:39:28,478
flour that's anything over a couple

5550
03:39:26,680 --> 03:39:29,960
weeks old there's I will never but I

5551
03:39:28,478 --> 03:39:31,799
like that fresh press those first couple

5552
03:39:29,959 --> 03:39:33,879
weeks you get that fire you get those

5553
03:39:31,799 --> 03:39:35,278
chps you get that you get something that

5554
03:39:33,879 --> 03:39:37,719
you only if you're growing it you get

5555
03:39:35,279 --> 03:39:40,479
that experience but if you're oid

5556
03:39:37,719 --> 03:39:41,840
oxidizes really fast yeah yeah if you

5557
03:39:40,478 --> 03:39:43,719
can like you're saying John if you can

5558
03:39:41,840 --> 03:39:47,318

03:39:53,398 --> 03:40:00,639
was in my freezer from two what when was

5563
03:39:55,719 --> 03:40:00,639
my last crop John like 2014 or

5564
03:40:04,159 --> 03:40:08,680
something oh you keep muting yourself

5565
03:40:06,600 --> 03:40:12,279
like literally like muting

5566
03:40:08,680 --> 03:40:13,880
yourself um unmute myself sorry about

5567
03:40:12,279 --> 03:40:16,640
that all good I was trying to hit the

5568
03:40:13,879 --> 03:40:20,198
double button and double button was I

5569
03:40:16,639 --> 03:40:22,920
had Harmony in my freezer for years like

5570
03:40:20,199 --> 03:40:26,040
seven or eight years and then I took it

5571
03:40:22,920 --> 03:40:28,398
out and it it was in a Ziploc bag and it

5572
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:30,120
was just sitting on my my de my desk

5573
03:40:28,398 --> 03:40:32,559
here and after like a couple of days I

5574
03:40:30,120 --> 03:40:34,800
opened it and I I kind of was like oh

5575
03:40:32,559 --> 03:40:36,719
this is like nice and like spongy and it

5576
03:40:34,799 --> 03:40:38,398
was all I knew I grew it it was like

5577
03:40:36,719 --> 03:40:40,438
it's going to be good it was Harmony it

5578
03:40:38,398 --> 03:40:42,079
was from reefer man and it was his own

5579
03:40:40,439 --> 03:40:44,398
at first when it when I got it he was

5580
03:40:42,079 --> 03:40:46,559
kind of like oh [ __ ] like kind of a

5581
03:40:44,398 --> 03:40:47,879
little upset and then was I I was like

5582
03:40:46,559 --> 03:40:49,478
well what you want a back or what not

5583
03:40:47,879 --> 03:40:50,959
he's like no no no no it's it's okay I

5584
03:40:49,478 --> 03:40:54,478
didn't realize I gave you like he gave

5585
03:40:50,959 --> 03:40:57,358
me like his cut of of his Harmony it was

5586
03:40:54,478 --> 03:40:59,719
really special but that that rosin was

5587
03:40:57,359 --> 03:41:01,840
some of the loudest rosin I ever made

5588
03:40:59,719 --> 03:41:03,719
and I went to a couple events like lift

5589
03:41:01,840 --> 03:41:05,840
conferences where I was like quite far

5590
03:41:03,719 --> 03:41:07,559
away from people and I would open it up

5591
03:41:05,840 --> 03:41:09,478
and on the parchment it looked like a

5592
03:41:07,559 --> 03:41:12,278
like a baby's diaper it was just this

5593
03:41:09,478 --> 03:41:14,799
yellow snot on the inside it was

5594
03:41:12,279 --> 03:41:17,640
unbelievably like really quite

5595
03:41:14,799 --> 03:41:20,719
incredible Rosen and uh people would be

5596
03:41:17,639 --> 03:41:23,760
like way far away going do you smell

5597
03:41:20,719 --> 03:41:26,000
that like it was incredible and it broke

5598
03:41:23,760 --> 03:41:27,800
all the rules that heat is gonna you

5599
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:29,840
know oh heat that ruins all the tur

5600
03:41:27,799 --> 03:41:31,639
beines and oh it's aged it's how old it

5601
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:34,279
was like in the freezer for how many

5602
03:41:31,639 --> 03:41:35,840
years and then sat on your desk all I

5603
03:41:34,279 --> 03:41:38,359
know is it was some of the loudest I

5604
03:41:35,840 --> 03:41:39,760
ever made so don't get caught up in what

5605
03:41:38,359 --> 03:41:42,359
you

5606
03:41:39,760 --> 03:41:45,800
assume uh that sometimes will keep you

5607
03:41:42,359 --> 03:41:47,880
from making a really nice uh revelation

5608
03:41:45,799 --> 03:41:49,799
it's true and you that hash that when I

5609
03:41:47,879 --> 03:41:51,358
came and visited you in BC man that was

5610
03:41:49,799 --> 03:41:54,519
like I don't even know how old that was

5611
03:41:51,359 --> 03:41:56,318
more than a decade I was guys that was

5612
03:41:54,520 --> 03:41:59,158
more lit than I've been lit in a long

5613
03:41:56,318 --> 03:42:01,079
time that was that was special hey that

5614
03:41:59,158 --> 03:42:04,279
was really special it was delicious too

5615
03:42:01,079 --> 03:42:07,279
it was unbelievable so don't let it fake

5616
03:42:04,279 --> 03:42:07,279
you

5617
03:42:07,639 --> 03:42:13,439
I I've got to get gone guys we've almost

5618
03:42:10,520 --> 03:42:16,079
crushed four hours we got about 20 less

5619
03:42:13,439 --> 03:42:18,760
than 20 minutes 17 minutes we got to

5620
03:42:16,079 --> 03:42:22,158
come up with the last most valuable tips

5621
03:42:18,760 --> 03:42:25,120
and tricks we can offer uh no particular

5622
03:42:22,158 --> 03:42:27,279
order but whether it's from for for

5623
03:42:25,120 --> 03:42:30,239
collecting parchment whether it's for

5624
03:42:27,279 --> 03:42:33,120
how you're bagging your hash or moisture

5625
03:42:30,238 --> 03:42:34,879
content in your flow or temperatures or

5626
03:42:33,120 --> 03:42:36,840
all of the things we've spoken about if

5627
03:42:34,879 --> 03:42:38,000
you feel like you've missed on any of

5628
03:42:36,840 --> 03:42:39,840
those things some of the people that

5629
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:42,520
aren't talking as much I'd love to hear

5630
03:42:39,840 --> 03:42:45,799
from you guys I know some of us are a

5631
03:42:42,520 --> 03:42:47,680
little more aggressive voices but people

5632
03:42:45,799 --> 03:42:49,158
that have not been talking much want to

5633
03:42:47,680 --> 03:42:52,199
want to chime in a little bit more I'd

5634
03:42:49,158 --> 03:42:55,760
like to hammer out 17 more minutes and

5635
03:42:52,199 --> 03:42:58,840
call it a press we'll call it a

5636
03:42:55,760 --> 03:43:01,079
press so how soon does everyone collect

5637
03:42:58,840 --> 03:43:03,359
off their parchment from the Press how

5638
03:43:01,079 --> 03:43:04,959
long do you let it set or settle before

5639
03:43:03,359 --> 03:43:06,960
you actually pull

5640
03:43:04,959 --> 03:43:09,519
it guess it depends on how much you're

5641
03:43:06,959 --> 03:43:11,119
pressing it right away yeah depend yeah

5642
03:43:09,520 --> 03:43:14,158
if it's a grip it'll sit there until I'm

5643
03:43:11,120 --> 03:43:17,040
done pressing all of it so sometimes a

5644
03:43:14,158 --> 03:43:19,520
couple hours or or whatever but usually

5645
03:43:17,040 --> 03:43:21,439
a couple hours you got to watch the

5646
03:43:19,520 --> 03:43:22,800
strains too because some strains want to

5647
03:43:21,439 --> 03:43:24,960
sit there and nucleate while you're

5648
03:43:22,799 --> 03:43:27,119
sitting turn to

5649
03:43:24,959 --> 03:43:29,559
shatter right I usually press in a cold

5650
03:43:27,120 --> 03:43:31,560
room too so it's stuff stays pretty

5651
03:43:29,559 --> 03:43:33,799
stable so when I do leave it on part

5652
03:43:31,559 --> 03:43:36,079
press 40 Dee room too but I'm just

5653
03:43:33,799 --> 03:43:37,559
saying some strains it depends on how I

5654
03:43:36,079 --> 03:43:40,158
mean it depends on some are just gonna

5655
03:43:37,559 --> 03:43:43,920
do it regardless I think you

5656
03:43:40,158 --> 03:43:45,600
know each has their own mind don't I

5657
03:43:43,920 --> 03:43:48,879
hate when you go to collect and it's

5658
03:43:45,600 --> 03:43:50,840
already like like almost converted over

5659
03:43:48,879 --> 03:43:52,398
you got like half crumble and half

5660
03:43:50,840 --> 03:43:54,000
stable and now you're collecting that

5661
03:43:52,398 --> 03:43:55,680
it's crumbling up and yeah it takes

5662
03:43:54,000 --> 03:43:57,559
forever to

5663
03:43:55,680 --> 03:43:59,720
collect

5664
03:43:57,559 --> 03:44:01,519
yeah you just got to work it a little

5665
03:43:59,719 --> 03:44:03,559
more but you know depend on what you're

5666
03:44:01,520 --> 03:44:05,319
trying to do with it I'll generally

5667
03:44:03,559 --> 03:44:07,879
collect as soon as possible but like

5668
03:44:05,318 --> 03:44:09,879
everybody says I'm I'm I'm pressing

5669
03:44:07,879 --> 03:44:11,358
washing everything in a cold room and

5670
03:44:09,879 --> 03:44:12,719
from doing the classes and talking to

5671
03:44:11,359 --> 03:44:15,158
the majority of the people that I've

5672
03:44:12,719 --> 03:44:16,318
talked to um that I think is one of the

5673
03:44:15,158 --> 03:44:17,920
biggest mistakes that people make

5674
03:44:16,318 --> 03:44:20,398
especially when it comes down to washing

5675
03:44:17,920 --> 03:44:22,120
live resin and that's a whole another

5676
03:44:20,398 --> 03:44:24,559
topic of conversation but when we're

5677
03:44:22,120 --> 03:44:26,960
talking about washing like fresh like

5678
03:44:24,559 --> 03:44:28,959
off the plant cut off the plant into the

5679
03:44:26,959 --> 03:44:31,000
freezer when we talk about washing stuff

5680
03:44:28,959 --> 03:44:33,119
like that which is what I consider fresh

5681
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:34,398
live um if you don't do it in a cold

5682
03:44:33,120 --> 03:44:35,600
room you're asking for a nightmare

5683
03:44:34,398 --> 03:44:38,439
you're basically gonna be scoping

5684
03:44:35,600 --> 03:44:40,520
Elmer's glue off of your your

5685
03:44:38,439 --> 03:44:42,880
screens yeah you need a cold room you

5686
03:44:40,520 --> 03:44:44,238
need very cold water the environment

5687
03:44:42,879 --> 03:44:46,278
needs to be extremely cold if you're

5688
03:44:44,238 --> 03:44:48,279
going to process R Frozen from start to

5689
03:44:46,279 --> 03:44:50,560
finish and you want to do it

5690
03:44:48,279 --> 03:44:52,120
efficiently yeah true I've mentioned it

5691
03:44:50,559 --> 03:44:54,079
before but there's these tables and

5692
03:44:52,120 --> 03:44:56,479
there's these stones that you can get

5693
03:44:54,079 --> 03:44:58,000
that are like chocolate teer stones that

5694
03:44:56,478 --> 03:45:00,198
that you can keep them at a certain

5695
03:44:58,000 --> 03:45:01,760
temperature those those those are pretty

5696
03:45:00,199 --> 03:45:03,239
good I mean especially for getting into

5697
03:45:01,760 --> 03:45:05,920
the business aspect if you don't want to

5698
03:45:03,238 --> 03:45:07,959
be in a cold room necessarily the entire

5699
03:45:05,920 --> 03:45:09,439
room doesn't necessarily have to be that

5700
03:45:07,959 --> 03:45:12,158
temperature you might end up giving

5701
03:45:09,439 --> 03:45:13,840
yourself colds and and whatnot over time

5702
03:45:12,158 --> 03:45:16,119
but that's actually pretty good idea

5703
03:45:13,840 --> 03:45:18,279
that's a having a collection plate

5704
03:45:16,120 --> 03:45:19,840
itself and they have like I say the

5705
03:45:18,279 --> 03:45:22,079
really nice chocolate here tables that

5706
03:45:19,840 --> 03:45:23,760
you can set to the temperature it does

5707
03:45:22,079 --> 03:45:25,879
not change that temperature it creates a

5708
03:45:23,760 --> 03:45:28,120
thermal Cline where that temperature is

5709
03:45:25,879 --> 03:45:30,278
like at least an inch or two inches off

5710
03:45:28,120 --> 03:45:33,279
that off that table and it's pretty cool

5711
03:45:30,279 --> 03:45:35,040
man you see them take warm chocolate and

5712
03:45:33,279 --> 03:45:36,880
pour it on liquid and all of a sudden

5713
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:39,399
depending on the temperature and the

5714
03:45:36,879 --> 03:45:40,959
concentration of the chocolate I think

5715
03:45:39,398 --> 03:45:42,959
there's a lot to learn from the

5716
03:45:40,959 --> 03:45:45,799
collection of rosin and the manipulation

5717
03:45:42,959 --> 03:45:48,559
of rosin from the chocolate te here and

5718
03:45:45,799 --> 03:45:49,879
from the uh the Taffy pullers you know

5719
03:45:48,559 --> 03:45:51,959
guys that have been doing that for a

5720
03:45:49,879 --> 03:45:53,879
long time if I was a rosin company I

5721
03:45:51,959 --> 03:45:56,639
would definitely like I see that on a

5722
03:45:53,879 --> 03:45:57,959
resume I'm like yeah I would like to

5723
03:45:56,639 --> 03:46:00,559
pick your

5724
03:45:57,959 --> 03:46:02,278
brain because I mean you you got to be

5725
03:46:00,559 --> 03:46:04,398
careful with condensation though when it

5726
03:46:02,279 --> 03:46:06,040
comes to tools like cooling units like

5727
03:46:04,398 --> 03:46:07,959
if you're working in a cool ass room

5728
03:46:06,040 --> 03:46:10,239
already essentially your tables are

5729
03:46:07,959 --> 03:46:12,238
going to be really cold and sometimes

5730
03:46:10,238 --> 03:46:13,680
you don't want really cold rooms because

5731
03:46:12,238 --> 03:46:15,639
now you got to work a little slower

5732
03:46:13,680 --> 03:46:16,840
because stuff wants to shatter you know

5733
03:46:15,639 --> 03:46:18,519
when you have like that right

5734
03:46:16,840 --> 03:46:20,809
temperature where the oil just wants to

5735
03:46:18,520 --> 03:46:23,279
pick up right

5736
03:46:20,809 --> 03:46:27,680
[Music]

5737
03:46:23,279 --> 03:46:29,960
temperature right right temperature well

5738
03:46:27,680 --> 03:46:31,120
right amount too you know it's like it's

5739
03:46:29,959 --> 03:46:33,519
easy to collect because you're pulling

5740
03:46:31,120 --> 03:46:35,640
up sheets of rosin rather than like if

5741
03:46:33,520 --> 03:46:37,840
you're pressing out like five grams at a

5742
03:46:35,639 --> 03:46:40,198
time you're gonna have a thin layer of

5743
03:46:37,840 --> 03:46:41,639
of rosin with the with the little drips

5744
03:46:40,199 --> 03:46:43,040
which the drips are super easy to

5745
03:46:41,639 --> 03:46:45,318
collect but now you get to that thin

5746
03:46:43,040 --> 03:46:46,800
layer and you got to kind of like wipe

5747
03:46:45,318 --> 03:46:49,559
everything so I'll fold up a sheet of

5748
03:46:46,799 --> 03:46:51,559
parchment and I'll just actually like

5749
03:46:49,559 --> 03:46:53,559
nowadays I just use my glove so I'll

5750
03:46:51,559 --> 03:46:55,238
have my nital glove and I'll just

5751
03:46:53,559 --> 03:46:56,680
collect with the Nitro glove and I'm

5752
03:46:55,238 --> 03:46:58,158
real good at just making sure I get

5753
03:46:56,680 --> 03:46:59,600
every drop off if you're quick with the

5754
03:46:58,158 --> 03:47:02,559
glove you're in a cold room you know

5755
03:46:59,600 --> 03:47:05,318
it's it's pretty simple silicone

5756
03:47:02,559 --> 03:47:07,359
fingertips like literal they the little

5757
03:47:05,318 --> 03:47:09,238
blue guys and they got little Nubs on

5758
03:47:07,359 --> 03:47:13,399
them and they go over your gloves and

5759
03:47:09,238 --> 03:47:15,760
then it I roll it like I'm kind of crazy

5760
03:47:13,398 --> 03:47:18,000
I literally roll all the

5761
03:47:15,760 --> 03:47:20,318
kind of flow and then I end up mushing

5762
03:47:18,000 --> 03:47:21,959
it together and putting it in I kind of

5763
03:47:20,318 --> 03:47:24,680
play with it

5764
03:47:21,959 --> 03:47:26,879
first yeah I will always agitate my R

5765
03:47:24,680 --> 03:47:30,000
Rous and mix pull whatever the heck you

5766
03:47:26,879 --> 03:47:33,799
want to call it I don't Taff it

5767
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:36,279
but together yeah and put it in a jar

5768
03:47:33,799 --> 03:47:39,158
Taffy we Taff when we mix different

5769
03:47:36,279 --> 03:47:41,840
microns together and are we are we Taff

5770
03:47:39,158 --> 03:47:44,439
for homogenization are we Taffy for

5771
03:47:41,840 --> 03:47:46,760
lighter color to come out are we taing

5772
03:47:44,439 --> 03:47:49,158
for all I'll

5773
03:47:46,760 --> 03:47:53,920
Taff for yeah homogenizing when I'm

5774
03:47:49,158 --> 03:47:56,760
doing flavor blending um Micron blending

5775
03:47:53,920 --> 03:47:58,680
um uh for the most part like that if I

5776
03:47:56,760 --> 03:48:00,398
if I don't if I'm gonna make jams and

5777
03:47:58,680 --> 03:48:02,439
stuff I don't like if you don't need to

5778
03:48:00,398 --> 03:48:04,119
there's no reason to yeah and to me it

5779
03:48:02,439 --> 03:48:05,760
goes to me it goes back to the very

5780
03:48:04,120 --> 03:48:09,120
first conversation we had is curing the

5781
03:48:05,760 --> 03:48:11,439
rosin it introduces air into the into

5782
03:48:09,120 --> 03:48:13,920
the rosin which is an oxidation which

5783
03:48:11,439 --> 03:48:15,880
induces curing yeah you're also

5784
03:48:13,920 --> 03:48:19,520
stretching it

5785
03:48:15,879 --> 03:48:20,959
are coming out yeah yeah Will that's why

5786
03:48:19,520 --> 03:48:22,238
I don't like to stretch it out when I'm

5787
03:48:20,959 --> 03:48:24,000
going to make jams because you think

5788
03:48:22,238 --> 03:48:25,879
about it if you're gonna make jams if

5789
03:48:24,000 --> 03:48:27,639
you're gonna stretch it up that was a

5790
03:48:25,879 --> 03:48:29,599
really good point you're gonna start uh

5791
03:48:27,639 --> 03:48:33,639
introducing a lot of little bubbles full

5792
03:48:29,600 --> 03:48:36,120
of oxygen which is gonna uh speed up

5793
03:48:33,639 --> 03:48:38,799
oxidation so when you apply heat to it

5794
03:48:36,120 --> 03:48:40,880
that's GNA rapidly speed up oxidation so

5795
03:48:38,799 --> 03:48:42,840
I feel like when you have a nice fresh

5796
03:48:40,879 --> 03:48:44,799
press straight to a jar and then you're

5797
03:48:42,840 --> 03:48:46,199
trying to do the jam Tech with that

5798
03:48:44,799 --> 03:48:47,959
you're going to get uh you're going to

5799
03:48:46,199 --> 03:48:49,199
achieve like a slightly lighter color

5800
03:48:47,959 --> 03:48:51,358
compared to something that was

5801
03:48:49,199 --> 03:48:54,359
introduced and locked in a little more

5802
03:48:51,359 --> 03:48:57,238
oxygen Point yeah absolutely true that's

5803
03:48:54,359 --> 03:48:59,680
a cool point I I generally don't go any

5804
03:48:57,238 --> 03:49:01,520
further than rosin I don't make the thca

5805
03:48:59,680 --> 03:49:02,920
I don't make diamonds I don't I don't do

5806
03:49:01,520 --> 03:49:05,040
any of that I don't I don't do sauce I

5807
03:49:02,920 --> 03:49:07,478
don't introduce it to heat I'm cold cure

5808
03:49:05,040 --> 03:49:09,640
only just yeah we just cure our rosin

5809
03:49:07,478 --> 03:49:13,119
over seven to 10 days in a in a cold

5810
03:49:09,639 --> 03:49:15,318
room in a dark box so I usually like to

5811
03:49:13,120 --> 03:49:18,199
shoot for 30 days before I

5812
03:49:15,318 --> 03:49:20,680
[ __ ] can you guys aren't climbing up

5813
03:49:18,199 --> 03:49:22,290
the mountain in Himel prash and buing it

5814
03:49:20,680 --> 03:49:24,520
at 3000

5815
03:49:22,290 --> 03:49:27,720
[Laughter]

5816
03:49:24,520 --> 03:49:29,520
me have it bur a little I just can't

5817
03:49:27,719 --> 03:49:32,198
wait until we start really really

5818
03:49:29,520 --> 03:49:34,479
finding out if we are curing let's walk

5819
03:49:32,199 --> 03:49:36,158
down the road if if if we are curing you

5820
03:49:34,478 --> 03:49:38,318
know we can we can start talking about

5821
03:49:36,158 --> 03:49:40,559
like like aged cheddar for Christ sakes

5822
03:49:38,318 --> 03:49:43,959
we can start talking about six year or

5823
03:49:40,559 --> 03:49:47,359
six month 12 months two year five year

5824
03:49:43,959 --> 03:49:49,919
10 year aged hash or

5825
03:49:47,359 --> 03:49:52,318
rosin man it could be a whole new ball

5826
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:54,478
of ball of worms in a couple years I

5827
03:49:52,318 --> 03:49:55,920
really do like rosin once it's cured and

5828
03:49:54,478 --> 03:49:57,599
developed more you know like kind of

5829
03:49:55,920 --> 03:50:00,439
like wi when you let it sit and age more

5830
03:49:57,600 --> 03:50:01,800
it it does develop more flavors um and

5831
03:50:00,439 --> 03:50:03,439
that definitely happens with rosin

5832
03:50:01,799 --> 03:50:04,959
there's been times that I've had rosin

5833
03:50:03,439 --> 03:50:06,920
develop over the month or two and it

5834
03:50:04,959 --> 03:50:09,238
just changes completely from when it

5835
03:50:06,920 --> 03:50:12,279
started out you know it might be

5836
03:50:09,238 --> 03:50:16,039
expressing years Holy balls look at that

5837
03:50:12,279 --> 03:50:17,439
and it's glass and don't I like to grabb

5838
03:50:16,040 --> 03:50:19,439
you know a lot of times when I'm in the

5839
03:50:17,439 --> 03:50:20,720
hash room and I'll have my dab Brak

5840
03:50:19,439 --> 03:50:21,920
sitting right there I have my tool my

5841
03:50:20,719 --> 03:50:23,519
torch and everything I'll heat the son

5842
03:50:21,920 --> 03:50:25,799
of a [ __ ] up and I'll take a fresh dab

5843
03:50:23,520 --> 03:50:28,079
I don't I'm not knocking it you know um

5844
03:50:25,799 --> 03:50:30,398
but I prefer the the the one month cold

5845
03:50:28,079 --> 03:50:32,879
cure or longer if I can yeah I like to

5846
03:50:30,398 --> 03:50:34,879
do like you know seven to two weeks

5847
03:50:32,879 --> 03:50:37,119
seven days to two weeks I

5848
03:50:34,879 --> 03:50:38,559
mean yeah if I'm doing a cold cure

5849
03:50:37,120 --> 03:50:40,120
that's when I really like to do the

5850
03:50:38,559 --> 03:50:43,079
Taffy pool I like to get everything

5851
03:50:40,120 --> 03:50:44,720
completely homogenized same color uh I

5852
03:50:43,079 --> 03:50:45,840
feel like it kind of speeds up like you

5853
03:50:44,719 --> 03:50:47,760
know if you're going to do that throw it

5854
03:50:45,840 --> 03:50:50,398
in a jar and into like you know let's

5855
03:50:47,760 --> 03:50:52,040
just say 40° and let it sit there for a

5856
03:50:50,398 --> 03:50:55,039
couple weeks you know it's going to

5857
03:50:52,040 --> 03:50:57,359
completely uh you know uh go through the

5858
03:50:55,040 --> 03:50:59,479
whole nucleation process and become like

5859
03:50:57,359 --> 03:51:01,359
a nice crumble inside so when you start

5860
03:50:59,478 --> 03:51:03,438
going to your whip you know you start

5861
03:51:01,359 --> 03:51:06,040
giving it like a heavy whip then you

5862
03:51:03,439 --> 03:51:08,279
start to get like um you know a nice wet

5863
03:51:06,040 --> 03:51:09,840
batter you know absolutely and I don't

5864
03:51:08,279 --> 03:51:12,199
like to leave a lot of room in the jar

5865
03:51:09,840 --> 03:51:14,238
between the rosin and the lid um I like

5866
03:51:12,199 --> 03:51:15,520
to get it as full as possible um but you

5867
03:51:14,238 --> 03:51:16,920
got to keep in mind though it certain

5868
03:51:15,520 --> 03:51:20,359
strains will separate real hard and

5869
03:51:16,920 --> 03:51:21,799
you'll have a a tury layer so it it is

5870
03:51:20,359 --> 03:51:23,318
best to um you know to put some

5871
03:51:21,799 --> 03:51:24,519
parchment under the lid if you really

5872
03:51:23,318 --> 03:51:27,600
need to if you're gon to fill it that

5873
03:51:24,520 --> 03:51:29,158
full but you know I like as full as

5874
03:51:27,600 --> 03:51:30,960
possible you're giving it very little

5875
03:51:29,158 --> 03:51:32,318
head of oxygen you know and just like

5876
03:51:30,959 --> 03:51:34,358
anything like when you're trying to

5877
03:51:32,318 --> 03:51:36,559
preserve something you know you can't do

5878
03:51:34,359 --> 03:51:39,359
all this work to preserve it and then at

5879
03:51:36,559 --> 03:51:41,039
the end you know you're skipping ruin it

5880
03:51:39,359 --> 03:51:42,720
the bad part is I think I think I must

5881
03:51:41,040 --> 03:51:44,279
need like a telescoping like a little

5882
03:51:42,719 --> 03:51:45,799
jar that smooshes because every time I

5883
03:51:44,279 --> 03:51:48,720
take [ __ ] hit it gets more head of

5884
03:51:45,799 --> 03:51:50,679
air in it so I I must be hey if you

5885
03:51:48,719 --> 03:51:52,358
think about it these baller jars that

5886
03:51:50,680 --> 03:51:54,559
that you see everywhere and like you

5887
03:51:52,359 --> 03:51:57,040
know I'm guilty of it too dud but these

5888
03:51:54,559 --> 03:51:59,198
baller jars it's like it's like uh

5889
03:51:57,040 --> 03:52:01,960
putting out a two liter of Coke that's

5890
03:51:59,199 --> 03:52:04,600
like a quarter of the way full yeah

5891
03:52:01,959 --> 03:52:08,438
makes this this will literally be gone

5892
03:52:04,600 --> 03:52:10,960
in in three

5893
03:52:08,439 --> 03:52:12,800
weeks of what we want so that way we're

5894
03:52:10,959 --> 03:52:14,519
not going in and out of the fridge all

5895
03:52:12,799 --> 03:52:16,679
the time you have one that you're con

5896
03:52:14,520 --> 03:52:18,640
stantly dabbing out of that you have

5897
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:20,079
your one well one to four grams

5898
03:52:18,639 --> 03:52:22,039
depending on what you want or your

5899
03:52:20,079 --> 03:52:23,559
different flavors so you have them all

5900
03:52:22,040 --> 03:52:25,319
sitting around but that way you're not

5901
03:52:23,559 --> 03:52:27,079
actually touching your stuff that's

5902
03:52:25,318 --> 03:52:29,158
sitting yeah that's what I like to do

5903
03:52:27,079 --> 03:52:31,439
too I use little seven or nine

5904
03:52:29,158 --> 03:52:35,478
millimeter jars and fill them up as much

5905
03:52:31,439 --> 03:52:37,398
as I can exactly just to smoke on yeah I

5906
03:52:35,478 --> 03:52:38,799
do too usually but these quarantine days

5907
03:52:37,398 --> 03:52:40,760
I brought out a

5908
03:52:38,799 --> 03:52:45,679
different yeah

5909
03:52:40,760 --> 03:52:47,960
yeah different size dryer yeah

5910
03:52:45,680 --> 03:52:47,960
there

5911
03:52:50,040 --> 03:52:54,399
you is anyone going directly to jar I

5912
03:52:53,158 --> 03:52:56,959
was doing that for a little while and

5913
03:52:54,398 --> 03:53:00,039
then it became a pain in

5914
03:52:56,959 --> 03:53:04,119
butt it doing it

5915
03:53:00,040 --> 03:53:06,600
all I used to I was like H can't get

5916
03:53:04,120 --> 03:53:08,800
most of this out of here I like I like

5917
03:53:06,600 --> 03:53:10,279
to really decide what I'm gonna do with

5918
03:53:08,799 --> 03:53:11,840
it like I'll just work everything I'll

5919
03:53:10,279 --> 03:53:14,079
get everything pressed out and then I

5920
03:53:11,840 --> 03:53:15,559
like to have like my formulation session

5921
03:53:14,079 --> 03:53:17,520
where it's like everything's kind of

5922
03:53:15,559 --> 03:53:19,600
like an assembly line you know I'll go

5923
03:53:17,520 --> 03:53:21,359
through this process that process I want

5924
03:53:19,600 --> 03:53:22,840
to get it all done pressed out knock

5925
03:53:21,359 --> 03:53:24,760
that work out and then figure out what

5926
03:53:22,840 --> 03:53:26,439
I'm GNA do with it like do I want to jar

5927
03:53:24,760 --> 03:53:27,880
it up fresh press do I want to do this

5928
03:53:26,439 --> 03:53:30,199
to it like what do I want to do do I

5929
03:53:27,879 --> 03:53:31,639
want to manipulate this [ __ ] and like

5930
03:53:30,199 --> 03:53:33,800
yeah how far do I want to take the

5931
03:53:31,639 --> 03:53:38,039
process I know how far you want to take

5932
03:53:33,799 --> 03:53:40,039
the process right into your dab rig and

5933
03:53:38,040 --> 03:53:41,800
that's what I want to I want everyone to

5934
03:53:40,040 --> 03:53:44,199
answer with the last questions because I

5935
03:53:41,799 --> 03:53:47,879
suspect 90 plus perc of us are dabbing

5936
03:53:44,199 --> 03:53:51,079
this [ __ ] um what's uh what's your temp

5937
03:53:47,879 --> 03:53:54,000
you dabing off of and what's your

5938
03:53:51,079 --> 03:53:56,920
temperature great go um

5939
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:59,279
560 when I'm using rosin and you know

5940
03:53:56,920 --> 03:54:01,520
around 500 for my full melt and this is

5941
03:53:59,279 --> 03:54:05,158
the device I used I got the same Temp

5942
03:54:01,520 --> 03:54:09,319
Tech to meter everything Temp Tech I

5943
03:54:05,158 --> 03:54:10,920
like 630 temp

5944
03:54:09,318 --> 03:54:15,799
630

5945
03:54:10,920 --> 03:54:17,639
out it depends if it's melt if it's

5946
03:54:15,799 --> 03:54:21,198
I'm in the

5947
03:54:17,639 --> 03:54:24,959
four I just got this freaking uh the the

5948
03:54:21,199 --> 03:54:28,158
turp slurp from Toro holy [ __ ] dude the

5949
03:54:24,959 --> 03:54:30,438
way that thing hit yeah dude we use the

5950
03:54:28,158 --> 03:54:32,318
mini nail like there's no other way to

5951
03:54:30,439 --> 03:54:34,318
smoke for me like I don't even want to

5952
03:54:32,318 --> 03:54:36,519
[ __ ] hit anything else same my guy

5953
03:54:34,318 --> 03:54:37,478
once I got one of these it changed

5954
03:54:36,520 --> 03:54:39,760
changed

5955
03:54:37,478 --> 03:54:42,079
everything dude if you guys don't have

5956
03:54:39,760 --> 03:54:44,040
one I suggest getting in line to get one

5957
03:54:42,079 --> 03:54:45,039
or whatever get the little pear for

5958
03:54:44,040 --> 03:54:47,279
inside

5959
03:54:45,040 --> 03:54:49,199
and the way it just [ __ ] winds it it

5960
03:54:47,279 --> 03:54:52,040
throws the dab into your [ __ ] lungs

5961
03:54:49,199 --> 03:54:54,199
like a hard ball dude like in one rib

5962
03:54:52,040 --> 03:54:58,760
too yeah it's like one and done even at

5963
03:54:54,199 --> 03:55:02,560
low temps inspirational if you really

5964
03:54:58,760 --> 03:55:05,238
think most [ __ ] even like evened out

5965
03:55:02,559 --> 03:55:07,119
hit like it spreads the oil perfectly

5966
03:55:05,238 --> 03:55:08,959
evenly across the glass and the way it

5967
03:55:07,120 --> 03:55:11,319
falls across it and just right into the

5968
03:55:08,959 --> 03:55:13,358
lungs un it's my favorite nail too for

5969
03:55:11,318 --> 03:55:15,920
sure bro it gets the job done better

5970
03:55:13,359 --> 03:55:18,359
than any other nail I've ever used nice

5971
03:55:15,920 --> 03:55:20,000
by far I usually dab about the email

5972
03:55:18,359 --> 03:55:21,720
over here said at five and a quarter but

5973
03:55:20,000 --> 03:55:23,559
for some reason I've turned the torch so

5974
03:55:21,719 --> 03:55:25,039
much more I really want one of those

5975
03:55:23,559 --> 03:55:27,478
Temp Tech things and I'm actually online

5976
03:55:25,040 --> 03:55:30,760
to get one but uh but I'm usually in the

5977
03:55:27,478 --> 03:55:32,599
low real low uh

5978
03:55:30,760 --> 03:55:35,960
500s or

5979
03:55:32,600 --> 03:55:38,359
44 that's what I'm about I'm about

5980
03:55:35,959 --> 03:55:42,158
fours 480 to

5981
03:55:38,359 --> 03:55:45,520
530 I'm dabbing off of uh the P nail

5982
03:55:42,158 --> 03:55:48,079
lately and uh he sent me the great

5983
03:55:45,520 --> 03:55:52,800
quartz I can't remember the name of it

5984
03:55:48,079 --> 03:55:55,840
Osos 4.0 4.0 yeah and it's at 450 I'm

5985
03:55:52,799 --> 03:55:58,238
dabbing at 450 bubblehash or rosin has

5986
03:55:55,840 --> 03:56:00,439
given me great rips it's surprising

5987
03:55:58,238 --> 03:56:02,600
because all the other Nails I have the

5988
03:56:00,439 --> 03:56:05,559
mini nail and the dabinator

5989
03:56:02,600 --> 03:56:07,359
and they're they're not they're they're

5990
03:56:05,559 --> 03:56:09,840
not the same temperature like Yeah The

5991
03:56:07,359 --> 03:56:13,120
Nail versus your eail temp can be

5992
03:56:09,840 --> 03:56:15,719
completely different I mean oh did you

5993
03:56:13,120 --> 03:56:17,840
oh yeah dude for sure

5994
03:56:15,719 --> 03:56:20,198
yep well think about when you go in and

5995
03:56:17,840 --> 03:56:23,000
hit that nail too like I I dive in at

5996
03:56:20,199 --> 03:56:25,720
6:30 that's when I go to dip the nail in

5997
03:56:23,000 --> 03:56:28,000
so and that T's dropping so fast dude by

5998
03:56:25,719 --> 03:56:29,920
the time I hit it it's probably like 580

5999
03:56:28,000 --> 03:56:32,359
some [ __ ] like that so that's why the en

6000
03:56:29,920 --> 03:56:34,760
know we like that the doesn't drop the

6001
03:56:32,359 --> 03:56:36,920
same way but the torch definitely drops

6002
03:56:34,760 --> 03:56:39,158
that way and the Temp Tech teaches you

6003
03:56:36,920 --> 03:56:40,840
that in the first hour that you own it

6004
03:56:39,158 --> 03:56:42,920
in a way that you can't even believe

6005
03:56:40,840 --> 03:56:44,318
it's it changes the way yeah absolutely

6006
03:56:42,920 --> 03:56:47,079
I'll tell you what though I'll be theil

6007
03:56:44,318 --> 03:56:49,039
Bri the one Brian used to be red hot

6008
03:56:47,079 --> 03:56:51,120
dabs all day y I'll be the Devil's

6009
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:53,080
Advocate I I like my big Globs and

6010
03:56:51,120 --> 03:56:54,800
there's once in a while when I want that

6011
03:56:53,079 --> 03:56:57,559
son of a [ __ ] to punch me and I'll go

6012
03:56:54,799 --> 03:57:00,079
in hot not necessar

6013
03:56:57,559 --> 03:57:01,840
like but I'll go in hot because it just

6014
03:57:00,079 --> 03:57:03,959
it hits you just a little

6015
03:57:01,840 --> 03:57:06,639
different I agree I like going hot every

6016
03:57:03,959 --> 03:57:09,238
now and then too we all need some of

6017
03:57:06,639 --> 03:57:11,559
that Johnny being Pedro are right next

6018
03:57:09,238 --> 03:57:13,478
to each other if you guys if John if you

6019
03:57:11,559 --> 03:57:15,198
go to your left and Pedro goes to his

6020
03:57:13,478 --> 03:57:17,920
right you guys legitimately give each

6021
03:57:15,199 --> 03:57:19,560

03:58:29,559 --> 03:58:33,840
wall thickness of

6051
03:58:31,199 --> 03:58:35,279
that jez I'm not sure looks like it

6052

looks like a it looks like a three or a

6053
03:58:35,279 --> 03:58:40,079
four probably a four it looks fatty yeah

6054
03:58:38,279 --> 03:58:42,479
really ni that's that's what I used to

6055
03:58:40,079 --> 03:58:45,520
this I got just got this eternal quartz

6056
03:58:42,478 --> 03:58:47,158
real deep bucket I mean man you talk

6057
03:58:45,520 --> 03:58:50,000
when you want to talk about taking a big

6058
03:58:47,158 --> 03:58:52,559
is that a 10 Milli or a 14 it's a 10 mil

6059
03:58:50,000 --> 03:58:54,840
down here I wasna say but it's a 30 m up

6060
03:58:52,559 --> 03:58:55,959
here and it's really deep I mean yeah

6061
03:58:54,840 --> 03:58:57,960
you want to talk about dropping a

6062
03:58:55,959 --> 03:59:01,158
freaking half gram you get a lot of uh

6063
03:58:57,959 --> 03:59:03,519
resin like con condensating in the uh

6064
03:59:01,158 --> 03:59:05,520
like coming back into oil yeah but what

6065
03:59:03,520 --> 03:59:06,800
I usually do with my this is another

6066
03:59:05,520 --> 03:59:09,680
trick that I do when we're talk we want

6067
03:59:06,799 --> 03:59:11,438
to talk about dabbing I usually use drop

6068
03:59:09,680 --> 03:59:13,639
I usually use drop downs like they're

6069
03:59:11,439 --> 03:59:15,439
actually on the rig generally but if I

6070
03:59:13,639 --> 03:59:18,039
don't have you use a drop down it's

6071
03:59:15,439 --> 03:59:21,318
plugged [ __ ]

6072
03:59:18,040 --> 03:59:25,120
solid extra filter right there no no no

6073
03:59:21,318 --> 03:59:28,039
no no I'm not smoking everybody the Chaz

6074
03:59:25,120 --> 03:59:29,840
the Chaz I'm not smoking through this

6075
03:59:28,040 --> 03:59:31,239
what I'm doing now is when I hit my hes

6076
03:59:29,840 --> 03:59:32,478
I'll hit them without the drop downs

6077
03:59:31,238 --> 03:59:34,639
because I actually don't have a 10 m

6078
03:59:32,478 --> 03:59:36,358
drop down and I I usually do the Globs

6079
03:59:34,639 --> 03:59:38,119
and I'm I don't I don't smoke it till

6080
03:59:36,359 --> 03:59:39,760
it's freaking gone I always have a big

6081
03:59:38,120 --> 03:59:41,479
puddle in my Banger so if you guys

6082
03:59:39,760 --> 03:59:44,040
probably see me do it the whole show

6083
03:59:41,478 --> 03:59:46,079
I'll bust this out I'll pour my dab the

6084
03:59:44,040 --> 03:59:48,520
left over into this and then I will I

6085
03:59:46,079 --> 03:59:49,879
will warm this up pour it into capsules

6086
03:59:48,520 --> 03:59:52,399
sometimes I'll mix it with the coconut

6087
03:59:49,879 --> 03:59:53,879
oil as well um and then I and I eat that

6088
03:59:52,398 --> 03:59:56,079
as well so man you want to talk about

6089
