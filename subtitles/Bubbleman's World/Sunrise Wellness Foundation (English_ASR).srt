19
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:42,968
I saw this as we came in and this is an

20
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:45,789
absolutely crucial piece in any cannabis

21
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:48,158
enthusiast or cannabis activists or

22
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:51,129
cannabis aficionado if you're in any of

23
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,500
those categories jackers you know number

24
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:55,810
one best-selling book of all time the

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,489
authoritarian historical record of

26
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,409
cannabis and the conspiracy against

27
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:01,780
marijuana and how hemp can save the

28
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,329
world the Emperor wears no clothes this

29
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,000
was a huge inspiration to me as a young

30
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:09,489
activist in Manitoba and it was really

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,590
the book that we got hemp growing

32
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:14,289
legally for the first time in over

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,609
seventy three years in our province so I

34
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:17,608
gotta go show those to that book

35
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:24,638
yeah that's amazing this is a great book

36
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:26,848
this is nice to see so why don't we head

37
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,849
in

38
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,530
you see we're in the clubs of course

39
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,229
this is Dawne you guys we met him just

40
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,579
the other day and

41
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,530
obviously the flavors he shared with us

42
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:43,810
were good enough that here we are a

43
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,269
couple of days later sharing any of that

44
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,560
so tell us a little bit about your spot

45
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,389
here how long have you guys been here

46
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,250
well welcome back to sunrise we're

47
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,659
almost about a year and a half a little

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,840
bit more

49
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:58,829
we opened up just to think July first

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,829
rate around cannabis day

51
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:03,019
it's be fun moving around since there

52
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,170
was about 40 dispensaries and other

53
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,280
tools 200

54
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:09,169
thank you trying to regulate it and

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,739
bring it back down so they get numbers

56
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:14,348
closer to what it used to be

57
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:17,959
going on there

58
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:20,209
yeah they certainly are so it seems like

59
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,920
you guys kind of have a special niche

60
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,900
just from walking in right away it seems

61
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,208
like you're kind of going for a quality

62
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,060
perspective absolutely you're not gonna

63
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,300
find 80 different strains here we try

64
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,269
and carry a smaller menu that ranges

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,189
from 20 to 40 different strains we try

66
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,140
and work with the same group of vendors

67
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:41,689
like very small group of vendors so we

68
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,699
have a good good idea of how they grow

69
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,919
things their standards their their

70
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,509
practices kind of ensure that they're

71
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,359
not using you know plant growth

72
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,409
regulators and other crazy different

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,950
things you definitely don't want any

74
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:57,818
medicine sure so we end up with a menu

75
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:00,259
that has more quality over quantity

76
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:01,729
we've got some stuff in the temple of K

77
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:04,939
Lakes we've got some stuff from humble

78

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,470
when I so callously grab the container

94
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,779
we've also got some Golden Bear extracts

95
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,100
they are from up in Whistler they do

96
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,168
some really nice stuff they got some

97
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:46,390
true pink which I'll show you here

98
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:46,389
that's the true pink 90

99
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,009
that person I think we do

100
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,600
very cool you've done a video with them

101
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,390
actually okay yeah yeah yeah that's what

102
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,360
I thought

103
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,529
pretty close there

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,560
and then sometimes we can give it a

105
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,559
little

106
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:13,889
counter he looks like one this local yes

107
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,490
very nice well I definitely was the

108
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,740
solvent list that got me that put you on

109
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,569
my radar

110
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,069
it's so easy to speak so that's usually

111
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,949
what we reach for when we're reaching

112
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,779
into our Twitter honestly we do smoke

113
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,779
pho we do you smoke all that kind of

114
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:33,569
stuff but I find that the solvent list

115
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:36,539
whether it be public how much dry sift

116
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:39,149
or rosin it just works better for me it

117
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,330
gives me where I need to be with less

118
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:44,969
and with the added to side effects you

119
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:46,979
get from solvent extractions beautiful

120
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,530
did you want to walk us through a couple

121
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,360
of these beautiful graphics so I just

122
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,329
pulled out the borrower different ones

123
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,949
that we haven't seen before

124
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:57,889
Romulan Mikado by the temple of calyx

125
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,430
this is actually a biodynamic

126
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:03,990
example so they do total living soil

127
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,629
it's really cool too Romulan cross

128
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,970
Mikado which are two

129
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:11,159
Federation seeds crossed together mm-hmm

130
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,470
very nice kind of grapefruit nose to a

131
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,090
real head ringer of a sativa effects

132
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,090
real upfront the forehead

133
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:34,160
The Mikado always reminded me of breeder

134
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:38,550
Steve's grapefruit mm-hmm

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,370

moon cup with their lemon lime this is a

140
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,590
new breeding project that they've been

141
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,709
working on and it's kind of similar to

142
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:57,649
many of the Tanja's you see down in the

143
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:01,439
states it's got this really awesome

144
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:03,799
tangerine orange flavor it's very Cali

145
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,319
oh it took to me

146
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,199

149
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,139
know some reason I'm pretty sure he's

150
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,030
good men Sam said on how she acts the

151

153
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,210
nice you know that very when you rose

154
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,079

161
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,800

I've seen this a lot NBC growing up it's

169
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,829
kinda reminds me of when I was a

170
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,310
teenager and it's just got that really

171
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,300
homey kind of smell to it kind of it's

172
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,310
hard to describe it so it's like

173
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,129
Christmas I'll tell you the color of the

174
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,139
pistol it the stigma hairs to me are

175
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:32,519
very reminiscent of a string that we

176
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:35,219
used to have called the poo pee oo h and

177
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,218
it was like like this is going back to

178
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,190
the 90s now but

179
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:43,789
it looked a lot like that

180
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,789
there's sweet smell

181
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:49,278
yeah that's a nice smell to it for sure

182
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:49,278
nice candy cane yeah

183
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,629

here as well yeah we've got a really

213
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:09,809
great range of medical products as well

214
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,279
whether it be teachers capsules no

215
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,199
edibles unfortunately because the City

216
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,750
of Vancouver won't allow it hopefully

217
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,490
they change that right but you can

218
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,559
usually get it done with textures and

219
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,539
capsules

220
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,789
Phoenix tears appointments with no way

221
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,409
to get around the edibles safe for you

222
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,449
to be just the same way your sonís would

223
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:29,669
be for you to sell tubs of coconut oil

224
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,740
extract yep absolutely could either cook

225
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:34,349
with or just eat and consume this long

226
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,120
as it's a prepackaged cooking oil we can

227
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,769
sell so next thing we've got something

228
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,629
so honey's here yeah those are kind of

229
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,600
classified as like honey changers okay

230
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,679
so they are you know there is a little

231
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,210
bit of sway with what they define

232
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,549
they just don't want confectionery and

233
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,259
baked goods yeah anything that looks

234
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:55,289
