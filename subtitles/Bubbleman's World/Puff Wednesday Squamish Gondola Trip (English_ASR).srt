54
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,318
show you something we've never seen

55
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,359

428
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,119
deck what do you say John I think uh we

429
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:26,400
got some picnic tables right there

430
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,798
beautiful we can sit down and uh dabic

431
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,280
tables look at and they say Cy sure I

432
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,839
don't know this is a pretty good zone

433
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:36,519
right here yeah but you do have all of

434
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,519
the the beautiful

435
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:44,240
view oh yeah Johnny

436
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:48,200

437
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,640
Johnny you got the tripod no well we

438
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,519
forgot this

439
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,240
guy we forget this if we went like

440
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,279
probably like no let's go have a 420 out

441
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,120
on this bridge on the bridge on the

442
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,119
bridge on the bridge

443
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,880
all right this is potentially the

444
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,839
uh Johnny B hey dude what do you think

445
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,839
of this place this is amazing look at

446
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:32,399
that beautiful view huh oh it's

447
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:34,439
beautiful and now we have the uh empty

448
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,840
Bridge did you want to have a dab on the

449
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,840
bridge or did you want to dab over at

450
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,399
the end of the

451
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:43,199
bridge well it's

452
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,240
uh I think we'll dab I think trying to

453
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,519
film dabing on the bridge might risk us

454
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,079
drop through the camera it's possible

455
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,558
which would probably be pretty epic once

456
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,119
we discovered the camera and got the

457
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,278
card out he would be like that was wild

458
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,798
I'm still pretty dabbed up from the uh

459
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:01,480
Gondola there you go and the car car

460
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:05,519
dab yeah the car dab I'll let you know

461
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:08,679
when uh the Bones start hurting here

462
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,918
definitely so I guess they have a little

463
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:16,440
Trail up here that apparently goes about

464
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:19,600
400 m just in a small circle so we'll

465
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,038
check it out see if we can't find the

466
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,038
ultimate dab

467
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,960
spot John's a little

468
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:46,000
that looks like a path someone's already

469
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
created it's neat to know this is a new

470
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,839
Zone and we haven't even figured out our

471
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,600
secret spots yet oh we got to find them

472
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,839
of course we are I'm looking up theree

473
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,639
me

474
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,759
too

475
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,679
here there

476
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,679
yeah that looks like a good

477
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,558
spot

478
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:14,558
Johnny Johnny B says that's where we're

479
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,599
setting up and that's where we're

480
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:20,918
setting up there's another bench right

481
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:24,079
there view yeah that view will be the

482
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,080
back end of the mountains

483
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
pilot

484
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,038

486
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:44,519

487
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,519
time to start pulling out I got the 420

488

00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,879
nail and the Hitman nice that's pretty

491
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,360
much all we need there and then

492
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,919
depending on which way the wind's going

493
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:07,719
which probably if you do the lighting of

494
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,919

bit of a bit of a smoky Rip but not

558
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:13,720
getting the nail heated up I think that

559
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:16,319
a for the next rip that we do um will

560

561
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,158
seems like it's a little bit low oh okay

562
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,640
well here we go let's see what Johnny B

563
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,640
says about

564
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,519
that

565
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,558
that was well

566
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,319
needed

567
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:39,319
beautiful

568
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,839
excellent well I'm really digging the

569
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:44,119
Squamish Gondola so far the view is

570
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,439
spectacular it's unrecognizable by me I

571
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:51,199
don't I've never really been in this

572
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,200
zone so I appreciate these uh accesses

573
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,159
you know I mean most of the accesses for

574
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,558
snowmobiling and dirt biking and such

575
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,720
are given by logging roads and M

576
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,079
this is nice to see tourism producing

577
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,038
access by you know putting up a

578
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:08,240
gondola yeah they got a few warning

579
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:10,319
signs around here see down yeah danger

580
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,278
Cliff area so they want people to be

581
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,158
very careful but I mean at the same time

582
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,839
they're not chaining it up here and

583
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,799
trying to keep you out from kind of

584
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,720
really exploring but remember always be

585
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:24,759
safe in areas like this because and

586
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,200
remember always bring hash a beine bong

587
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,440
and a dab

588
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,919
rig don't don't forget the hash don't

589
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,159

626
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,880

00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,720
their Jenny back so I think we're coming

628
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,440
right back around to the sort of

629
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,798
entrance to the trails that he was

630
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,200
telling us about this is that short

631
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:23,839
little 400 m Trail right at the base of

00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,439
that and I don't know what do you think

634
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,519
Johnny would we tell the audience that

635
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,679
this is something that they should check

636
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,120
out if they're on their way up to

637
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,720
Whistler or they're kind of heading back

638
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,398
through Whistler or ripping through

639
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,639

00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,119
get away it's it's cheap and it's epic

660
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:18,479
yeah it is I think we should walk in

661
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,839
those other little short ones over there

662
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,519
and see that other side of that mountain

663
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,240

664
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,759

show you bag rips I don't know where it

696
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,639
came from I just thought about it I used

697
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,200
to do bag rips all the time with my rure

698
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:45,959
bag I'm just wondering if maybe we did

699
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,558
it in Amsterdam one day I it's great for

700
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,440
wind no idea but I was just here and I

701
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,558
thought of it and maybe it is maybe it

702
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,399
wasn't but bag I'm looking around well

703
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,079
the rure is perfect cuz it's so straight

704
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:59,678
and tall and the bowl sticks out in an

705
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,918
angle oh see see that you can so this

706
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,798
was just a this is a red beard bag right

707
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,679
that still worked great it worked pretty

708
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:08,358
good dude I thought it was Goods so uh

709
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,280
where do you want to go see next Johnny

710
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:13,159
B we got about a half an hour to

711
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,800
burn well I think we should go take a

712
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,159
look at the front and look now all right

713
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,639
we'll do that all right well that was uh

714
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,240
you know pretty heavy duty Trail track

715
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,280
in there for Johnny and I so we figured

716
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:26,239
we might just stop and get another dab

717
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,839
quick dabs right yeah quick dabs I think

718
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,279
there still a piece

719
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,838
that yeah I'll just just leave it if you

720
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,320
just leave it it's my dab yeah perfect

721
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:39,320
is perfect oh so perfect so yeah the did

722
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,838
the the the bag rip and that was just uh

723
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,079
something uh inspired to videos of the

724
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,398
past yeah I can't remember if we've ever

725
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,119
done that in a video or not but uh I

726
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,719
remember it's an old Amsterdam special

727
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,919
I'll tell you doing it on the tram with

728
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,199
hash

729
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:58,878
Bean that would be fun yeah definitely

730
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,878
oh look at these people

731
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,280
they wouldn't even know what you're were

732
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:05,639
doing so of course uh you know

733
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,200
what you got to get that end and you got

734
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,199
to hit that bubble when it needs to be

735
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,719
bubbling

736
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,920
nice so of course uh you know

737
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,400
what you got to get that in and then you

738
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,519
got to hit that bubble when it needs to

739
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,639
be bubbling PR

740
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:26,639

table I did get a a nice little bit of a

743
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,079
rip but we are fighting wind I can do

744
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,559
better yeah I think if I position myself

745
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,760
a little bit better here I might be able

746
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,078
to I'm voting people so you know as

747
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,000
always um we're not being blatant about

748
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,839
it we're we're trying to be discreet

749
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,039
about it and it really comes down to um

750
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,159
prob that just be that's nice isn't it

751

754
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,760
better even temperature oh getting that

755
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,760
little color to it especially in the

756
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,920
cold require a pretty hot nail to get

757
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,119
the right

758
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,559

759
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,160
this tra coming up to the very top of

760

the mountain up here it's the view and

761
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:15,679
and just sitting here on the back and

762
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,480
then watching people come in and and

763
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,440
really the the the amount of people

764

coming up here and it's really cool to

765
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,358
see actually it's uh it's nice that you

766

767
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,440
worlding us to come and take a look at

yeah it's not too shabby nice nice to

769
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,559
see at the beginning stages you know see

770
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,079
what it's going to look like in a few

771
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,559
more years and stuff like that but uh

772
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,880

773
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,279
up there on the camera there you know

774
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,680
looking around cool very nice well I

775
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,359
guess uh it's Johnny be's turn to have a

776

on there so I got my camera out I might

780
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,639
grab a few Snappy sneeze

781
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,400
just such a nice little little Zone here

782
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,000
it's a beautiful Zone

783
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,480
here this is pretty much my backyard

784
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,119
pretty much where I live just a half an

785
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,199
hour down the road and it's I really

786
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,000
can't express how strange it is to be in

787
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:17,598
a place that's so close to where you

788
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,760
live that you've never actually been

789
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,440
to well you know what like you said you

790
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,240
watch the construction on it yes they

791
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,679
did a time lapse of thing yeah they said

792
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:26,159
they had a lot of good photos so I'd be

793
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,000
looking forward be interesting to see

794
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,838
how that all B sure we got going on it's

795
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,480
kind of

796
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,480
cool Bing Bang

797
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,640
Boom what are we puffing on anyway um

798
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:42,279
right now that would be the watermelon

799
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:46,199
okay the AST as can't go run with the

800
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,200
Astro Boy WR with the a

801
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,760
boy all right good

802
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,159
one Johnny B with the backlash of

803
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,960
rippers going going to have to hold that

804
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,519
one in for a bit Johnny B let's see how

805
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,480
long Johnny B can hold it in for and

806
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,480
pretend he didn't take a

807
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,920
rip it's a good size rip it was a nice

808
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,199
rip he did the nail up perfectly this is

809
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,318
a real nice little zone for just coming

810
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,239
and chilling it seems real loose no

811
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:21,800
one's bothering us we've puffed in what

812
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:26,039
three or four zones so far five no one

813
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,599
two three four going for five all right

814
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,440
well

815
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,838
well if we counted actually in the

816
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,318
parking lot right getting on the Gondola

817
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:37,318
so that's two and we've

818
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:39,480
done three on the mountain

819
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:42,559
now see this is the great thing about

820
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,199
being nice and uh medicated you don't

821
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,000
have to remember so much yeah we don't

822
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,199
have to remember not that particular I

823
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,480
don't I know that uh pain has subsided

824
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,759
in my

825
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,519
body may maybe a lot of you don't know

826
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,760
this but I myself have also broken many

827
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,759
of Bones from uh my early days of being

828
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,920
a skateboard uh Maniac as well as uh

829

831
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,400
nice yeah not too bad well you know not

832
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:14,159
nice but we talked about it and this is

833
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,800
the reason why uh Mark is actually able

834
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,879
to use cannabis legally and we're able

835
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,640
to do what we do here every day mhm

836
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,720
that's the best part about it yeah who

837
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,000
have thought it was such an incredible

838
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:26,799
um pain reliever or pain I wouldn't call

839
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,318
it a pain masker it really does seem to

840
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,839
just desensitize pain it's

841
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:34,960
uh it's great takes my thought off of it

842
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,559
that's why the best was trying to

843
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,079
remember things was like

844
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,838
why you know what Pain's like I forgot

845
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,440
what I was

846
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,279
