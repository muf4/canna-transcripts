13
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,679
Spain with a beine rep cuz you know that

14
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,558
D nail is packed oh maybe you should put

15
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,320
some hash in the bowl there bubble man

16
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,518

which does happen

23
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:35,759

24
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,840
hitting the denail cuz you don't really

25

need to pull the bowl out but

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,399

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,680

28

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,240
Jew gold right originally so then that's

333
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,600
why we call kosher gold kosher is Du

334
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,120
gold okay that's all it is it's is that

335
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,000
so so that's the crew the crew that grew

336
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,918
it that we got it from called it gold

337
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,359
that was what they called it see a

338
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,720
little it looks great we didn't want to

339
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,678
call it gold because it's not really a

340
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,160
can market

341
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,360
so but all we did wasend so it is J gold

342
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,759
it's the same strain you see what I'm

343
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,359
saying so when we made a j gold the pink

344
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,599
cush is all that and I got all different

345
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,759
beans for all this kind of crap so the

346
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,639
the kosher times the Tangi since kosher

347
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,879
is really duw gold we call it 24 karat

348
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,559
gold

349
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,159
cuz there go you heard it

350
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:01,879
here right you heard it we spend it so

351
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,840
