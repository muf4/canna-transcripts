our newest panelists who was uh studying

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,359

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:35,920
wouldn't it be cool to do a music and

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:38,280

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,920
episode uh Caleb's invited a bunch of

15
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,878
different people from the water boys to

cool folks I invited only a few myself

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,280
but um for this particular conversation

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,679
I really wanted to invite some of my

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Jamaican Breen and so uh Kazam Davis

21
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,558
who's in the room right now reached out

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,960
to me now Kazam hasn't really been

23
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,560
playing music a lot for the last few

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
years but he was deeply involved for a

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,799
very long time at a time when I was

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,118
spending a lot of time in Jamaica I feel

27
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,600
like I met Kazam through the LI Joe crew

28
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,959
which uh there was this guy Joe and he

29
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,679
was just amazing he was kind of taken

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,239
off his music was blowing up it's really

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,400
powerful music uh you know hair on the

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,679
back of the neck standing up and Joe

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,280
unfortunately had uh brain aneurysm and

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,920
he passed away I believe he was 26 or 27

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,560
years old um and there was this whole

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,159

deep Dives on cannabis we were talking

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,560
last week about uh C weed and how he

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,279
started looking for this you know term C

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,959
weed in music and how he found so many

95
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,079
different people using it in songs and

96
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,959
titles and he ended up saying that it

97
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,959
was um it was a lot had come from

98
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,478
Germany if I'm not mistaken Caleb that

99
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,159
you found the most songs were coming out

100
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,959

guys are from the Czech Republic they

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,680
wrote all the code and this was about

115
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,839
helping musicians monetize their music

116
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,199
on YouTube you can obviously do it

117
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,799
yourself which I monetize my YouTube and

118
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,919
it's done by myself but there's

119
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,840
companies that can do it and they can

120
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,839

224
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,838
studio in Kingston you know one of

225
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,079
10,000 studios in Kingston Jamaica and

226
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,800

227
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,599

230
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,399
amazing and then there's another guy

231
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,000
sitting in the shadows in the corner of

232
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,240
this you know kind of Outside Inside

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000

it was like more Talent more Talent more

237
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,600
Talent the level of talent that you guys

238
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,799
have in Jamaica and I'm certain it's

239
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,959
connected to the suffering and it's

240
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:49,519
connected to the perspective of love and

241
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,759
abundance instead of fear and scarcity

242
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,959
it's dude I can't say enough about it

243
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,679
man I I I love you guys circumstances

244
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,479
make us who we are you know and and the

245
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,439
reality and the reality is that you know

246
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,959
Jamaica is like a open portal for for

247
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,000
creativity for it's like everybody in

248
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,599
Jamaica is a is a artist it's

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,360
so look at it that way you know it's so

250
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,000
true it's the first country I ever went

251
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,360
to when I was standing at the bus stop I

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
went in 1995 and I was standing on the

253
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,200
bus stop waiting to get on the bus which

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,720
was an amazing experience in its own I

255
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,920
remember the guy next to me had a little

256
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,320
piece of wood in his hand and I was like

257
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,759
I was like I wonder what he's going to

258
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,680
do with that like why is he just

259
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,679
carrying a little piece of wood uh

260
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,559
around with him but it he was put he put

261
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,239
it between two seats and made himself a

262
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,958
seat on this bus that we you know we put

263
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,039
like 30 people on this little bus that

264
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,479
fits like

265
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:47,278
11 but before we got on the bus you

266
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,440
would think that we were at a Sizzla

267
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:53,480
concert this guy had his his boom box

268
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,600
going and Sizzla was pounding and he's

269
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,240
singing every lyric and he's dancing

270
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,399
almost violently like and my wife was

271
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,039
like what is going on and I I was like I

272
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,799
think we're in Jamaica I think we're in

273
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,199
Jamaica sweetie this what's up like I

274
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,879
just love the energy and the you know in

275
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,600
North America sometimes we don't even

276
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,399
want to look at each other in the eye

277
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,720
when we walk by each other we don't want

278
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,240
to like we don't want to express our

279
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,879
love and our joy and you know we're

280
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,120
we're sometimes easier to express uh you

281
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,679
know dismay and and pain and anguish but

282
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,120
in Jamaica once again this place where

283
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:34,599
clearly you know people have less more

284
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,600
than more like Peter said some live in

285
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,240

00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,319
learning about this right now cushion he

329
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
was ahead of the game way ahead of the

330
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,720
game listen he was the first person I

331
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,159
ever went into a grow in Jamaica inside

332
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,360
the house where he was just growing weed

333
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,198
inside his house and it was like

334
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,000
beautiful like OG Kush like he had

335
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,879
beautiful plants growing inside and it

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,480
was it might have been the weirdest

337
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,320
thing I've ever seen in Jamaica to be

338
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,920
honest it just seemed seemed so like

339
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,278
strange and off the the the charts and I

340
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:06,319
just remember his little daughter

341
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,559
walking around and this you know these

342
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,120

379
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,399
in America that's still under the

380
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,479
prohibition you know yeah well listen to

381
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,639
this I'll tell you something about Texas

382
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,440
for years people would hit me up and

383
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,600
they'd be like oh man like there's no

384
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
good hash like I'm in Texas and I'd be

385
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,278
like listen there is so much good hash

386
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,039
in Texas the problem is these

387
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,400
[ __ ] protect that [ __ ] they're

388
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,519
not exposing themselves like maniacs

389
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,038
from California they're still living

390
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:10,199
under the they're still living under the

391
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,199
thumb of the man so you can't be like

392
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,279
bragging and showing pounds of hash and

393
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,720
big you got you got to be lowkey you

394
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:21,558
know even though lowkey you got to be a

395
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,160
little lowkey so I will say this about

396
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:27,959
Texas they are probably tied with New

397
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,038
York State for the state that I sent the

398
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,600
most bubble bag too so obviously

399
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,640
California's number one for hash bags

400
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,558
but the the second most bags that I ever

401
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,280
sent anywhere is like a tie between

402
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:46,918
Texas and New York and so Texas is is

403
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,160
certainly representing it's just uh yeah

404
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,038
they don't they don't [ __ ] around in

405
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,720
Texas I remember when it was really bad

406
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,839
years ago it was like 10 it was like

407
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,640
Alabama it was like 10e mandatory

408
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,519
minimums if you got caught with anything

409
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,400
in Texas it just like w bam 10 years

410
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:05,200
inis prison holy [ __ ] 10 years like what

411
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:08,240
a [ __ ] crime to put habitual florist

412
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,640
go ahead DJ check it out well this is

413
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,440
what you got to understand in the state

414
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,360
of Texas any it's been like this for

415
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,720
years because I got caught with some

416
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:23,158
weed before so anything under 50 pounds

417
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,319
can be reduced to a simple possession or

418
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,799
claimed as personal use so they might

419
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,720
they might initially charge you with

420
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,038
possession of marijuana with the intent

421
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,200
to distribute which is a felony but they

422
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:39,919
but if it's under 50 pounds they'll take

423
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,120
the with intent off and it's just simple

424
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,759
position which is a mystery damn that's

425
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,678
amazing that's like the best news I've

426
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,919
heard in a long time no doubt listen in

427
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:52,480
Canada when I got arrested with 16

428
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,320
pounds this was in

429
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,519
1998 my maximum

430
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:02,000
sentence was 25 years in prison

431
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,359
that's that's what I was facing now no

432
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,038
one had ever gotten that in Canada it

433
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,000
wasn't something that was like we were

434
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:12,480
handing out like free candy on Halloween

435
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,759
like they do in some states but it still

436
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,240
was on the book so when I got arrested

437
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,519
and charged and this that and the other

438
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,759
thing and then I asked my lawyer hey

439
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,158
like what's the worst that can happen

440
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,519
and he's like well don't freak out but

441
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,520
the worst that can happen is is 25 years

442
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,759
in prison I was just like don't freak

443
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,639
out listen if you think I'm white now

444
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,640
you should have seen how [ __ ] white I

445
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,320
was when he told me that I am talking

446
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,960
every drop of color fell from I was just

447
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:42,639
like 25 years but I thought we were in

448
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,679
Canada so it took him about a a week to

449
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,320
talk me off the ledge he was like listen

450
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,038
in the meantime Mark emer's facing the

451
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,319

452
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,158

468
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,960
50 I wish I wish but like like like like

469
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,798
what I have not I have a sacramental

470
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,919
license right that allows me to grow

471
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:52,720
ganja for 5 years distribute it whatever

472
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:55,360
I want to do mm yeah but I'm affiliated

473
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,600
with a briging called

474
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:03,319
rager um and you know so whatever I do I

475
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:06,319
you know we communicate in a in a sense

476
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:08,359
okay okay that's good and so when you

477
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,119
talk about the sacramental use of

478
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,439
cannabis like uh maybe we'll get into

479
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,558
this conversation a little bit here you

480
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,360
know how important and I I mean I know

481
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,960
the answer but I kind of like to have

482
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:22,678
your words how important is the musical

483
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,679
component of the

484
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:29,159
sacramental use of cannabis because it

485
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,240
seems like no group of people

486
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,159
has

487
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:38,519
more you know music than Jamaica to sort

488
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,840
of represent and sing about the absolute

489

love of cannabis it seems like it goes

490
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:47,199
even deeper than a love of cannabis it's

491
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:49,919

Christopher yeah yeah give thanks um I

574
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,000
was just thinking to what Kazam was

575
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,080
saying about like Urban Music is like

576
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,599
mother's milk for the soul and and and

577
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:40,599
feeding their soul good nutrients you

578
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,359
know good herb good music um and being

579
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,678
Muse worthy I think that's something

580
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,759
that's been connected throughout here in

581
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,360
Santa Cruz I play with a Roots group

582
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:52,000
called ancest tree tree tree tree

583
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,278
growing Roots here in rosta Cruz and

584
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,079
yeah I play bass and so getting in the

585
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:57,720
pocket and playing with the Rhythm

586
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,119
Section and getting into the drums in

587
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,399
the bass something that's really

588
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,639
important to me and and locking in

589
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:05,519
drummer than the heartbeat I think ganja

590
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,360
is one of the ways I can build that

591
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,679
connection even if it's jamming with

592
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:14,119
just new players new rhythms um it's

593
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,600
like a place you can go with herb and

594
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,398
and you know you could truly transport

595
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,359
your your Consciousness and that's

596
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:22,678
something I feel like we need to not

597
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:25,158
only feed our bodies like I loved what

598
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,038
you said food urb and music that for me

599
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,600
is like Mind Body

600
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,038
Spirit and yeah music and Herb that's

601
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,599
kind of that Spirit piece uh but herb is

602
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:37,119
also body and mind and and to continue

603
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:40,000
to create and be an instrument of

604
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,639
creation I think it takes really good

605
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,319
herb and music um and so we definitely

606
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,360
feel that connection here in Santa Cruz

607
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,759
we've been performing on the west coast

608
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:53,359

635
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,440
different realm my song selection just

636
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:09,640
becomes so much greater it's like it's

637
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,360
like it enhances the moood for me and

697
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,200
uh China weed because it was sort of

698

and as kman is saying now really and

709
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
truly what I see people asking for now

710
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,360
is

711
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:53,319
runs runs yeah runs has a quite a quite

712
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:56,759
a strong uh flavor profile everybody's

713
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,960
asking for runs it it it is a hash

714
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:00,278
producer when you when I made the last

715
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,639
runs I

716
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:08,319
ran I got a 30% return dry you hear that

717
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:11,119
Dr Mark 30% without the use of solvents

718
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:15,158
from like that even when I get that

719
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:19,000
yield I feel like I'm lying to myself is

720
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:21,159
is that dry siip it no this was water

721
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,398
hash Kevin from Royal Harvest came over

722
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,799
to my house he brought this red velvet

723
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,319
runs was the cultivar and he brought a

724
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:30,558
bunch of ones and I would have never

725
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:35,759
picked this one to be the one that G I

726
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:38,960
ran 100 gram of his flour and in fact I

727
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,960
actually got a little over 30% but when

728
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,319
we weighed and it all was said there was

729
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,120
a little bit that we smoked that we

730
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:48,038
didn't weigh but we weighed and had 30

731
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:51,158
full grams and that was after it was

732
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:52,839
dried after the hash was dried exactly

733
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,080
yeah yeah I always like to make sure

734
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:59,519
that my U that is truly amazing whereas

735
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:04,839
with dry sift with skunk number one I

736
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,839
got 2% if I want to clean it up to

737
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:14,398
99.9 that's really

738
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:16,879
low it's really low but it's uh it's

739
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:20,038
worth it especially if you've got you

740
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,799
know Unlimited Supply of herb and you

741
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:25,720
want hash yeah exactly Caleb I want to

742
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:28,038
put sort of get bring it over to you I

743
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,960
know that we just sort of kind of uh got

744
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:31,919
into a long conversation I hadn't seen

745
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,759
Kazam in a while but we caught up a

746
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,880
little bit and if there's any sort of

747
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,919
Direction you had or some questions you

748
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,880
had maybe for some of the panelists or

749
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,399
maybe we want to do more introductions

750
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,559
whatever you guys want I'm super chill

751
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,119
I'm loving the Vibes yeah I think

752
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:47,319
introductions would be good we haven't

753
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,918
heard from Dan from Rebel grown yet I

754
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:52,558
saw people shouting out the uh double OG

755
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,159
pem in the chat and also haven't heard

756
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,879
from uh Dr Mark yet I think uh be cool

757
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,600
if everyone kind of introduced like when

758
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,960
they came to form a relationship with

759
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,278
the plant and you know maybe what music

760
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,440
they may have been listening to what

761
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:09,199
genre of music at that time I think we

762
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,398
have a pretty wide variety here of

763
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,158
people really dedicated to different uh

764
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:17,838
genres and we can find some commonality

765
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,919
with the weed here um so yeah Dan could

766
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,639
you give a little

767
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,638
intro yeah um just wanted to say I

768
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,200
appreciate the invite so my first time

769
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,399
getting to participate on uh hash church

770
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,638
and uh

771
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,440
yeah I mean I've been very passionate

772
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,480
about music since I was really

773
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,838
young I started getting into music when

774
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,000
I was probably five or six years old uh

775
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,878
Michael Jackson uh was the first big

776
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,440
influence in my life so when I was a kid

777
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:45,918
I used to dress up as Michael Jackson

778
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,000
and dance around and [ __ ] but what I

779
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,000
think about uh the connection between

780
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,480
cannabis and music is that I really look

781
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,199
at cannabis as an amplifier it amplifies

782
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,920
everything that's happening internally

783
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,799
emotionally spiritually um and so with

784
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,960
music which is already so important to

785
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,560
us you know when you're using good

786
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,838
cannabis it just amplifies that

787
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,838
experience it makes it such a a profound

788
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,279
connection and so when I was a kid I

789
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,838
wanted to be like a rock star and then

790
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,760
when I was eight years old I I heard

791
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,799
Easy E um and so like my big musical

792
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,480
influences when I was a kid was Michael

793
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,400
Jackson Axel Rose and e e and then I

794
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,480
discovered regate music and and Bob

795
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,680
Marley and um especially you know my

796
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,679
early you know before I was a teenager

797
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:33,000
teen AG you know mid 20s um you know

798
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,719
Jamaican culture was really inspiring to

799
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,079
me um so yeah I've had a long history of

800
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,879
Music in cannabis since I was like 12 13

801
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,480
years old and that's really what I've

802
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,240
committed a lot of my life to I don't

803
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,240
have a lot of other things in my life um

804
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,879
normal things like you know Vacations or

805
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,358
other things but uh you know I don't go

806
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,680
around saying that I'm good at a lot of

807
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,318
things but the two things that I think

808
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:00,279
that I can contribute is cannabis and

809
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:02,358
and music music um I I do hip-hop I

810
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,400
write and I rap um I've been doing that

811
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:09,440
29 years um just put out some new music

812
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,280
so first debut was put out in August um

813
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,159
it's on band camp if anybody wants to

814
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,920
check out my music uh there's like a

815
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:18,318
five song EP uh but I've got over 25

816
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,079
years worth of of recordings and so I'm

817
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:23,519
actually in my studio right here this

818
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,800
studio in 2015 uh 2014 when I was in

819
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,400
Humble still um and this was rented out

820
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,400
the space here was rented out to record

821
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,920
labels different like independent labels

822
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,639
this is on a a 200 acre off-grid

823
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,800
property in the Northeast Kingdom of

824
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,078
Vermont um and so it was meant to be an

825
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,720
artist Retreat uh where people from

826
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,560
Brooklyn and and the city could you know

827
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:45,598
these labels could book the space for a

828
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,960
month and send their artists and bands

829
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,680
here to you know decompress and get away

830
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,920
from cell service and so the studios had

831
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,960
a couple floods you know some issues but

832
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,838
everything here is still functional I've

833
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,440
actually got this really cool uh eight

834
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:04,159
track uh channel from a SSL that

835
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,800
apparently Legend man that part of the

836
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,318
SSL apparently came from a Prince's

837
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,280
studio um when he died and his Studio

838
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:13,239
was broken down so apparently that's

839
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,440
what I heard but anyway yeah so I I

840
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:17,159

the best herb I can find my whole life

844
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,280

smoke good strong herb um my brand used

848
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,760
to be called ganja Rebel U because ganja

849
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,800
to me was such a powerful word I just

850
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,359
felt like the attachment and connection

851
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,640
between everything that that ganja and

852
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,279
the herb represented was really

853
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,400
important I took the the ganja out you

854
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,480

think you know music is my religion and

875
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:41,559
you know I was a kid who grew up uh

876
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:45,400
following the Grateful Dead around and

877
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:48,679
you know I when when I first started

878
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,400
smoking weed yeah it was you know I I

879
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:53,480
knew

880
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,838
some uh some of my friends who had older

881
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,599
siblings and they knew you know the

882
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:02,199
so-called weed dealers and it was was

883
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:05,079
mostly like yeah Brown Mexican weed or

884
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:08,519
we rarely had really you know s rarely

885
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,760
we had sensia but you know at the dead

886
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,719
show uh I would smell a different kind

887
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,240
of weed being smoked and it was all that

888
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:18,838
dank Bud from Northern California that

889
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:23,159
came out on Grateful Dead tour that I

890
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:24,880
think spread kind bud across the country

891
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:28,118
you know I really do think that the

892
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,559
Grateful Dead um would just this

893
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,079
traveling circus that we went to in the

894
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:36,159
late 70s and 80s it was so [ __ ] cool

895
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,000
man I was like I graduated high school

896
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,078
in

897
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,559
1981 and I lived in Suburban New York

898
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,480
City in northern New Jersey and it was

899
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:48,440
just so easy to go and see the Grateful

900
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,719
Dead um they would play in in New York

901
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,519
City they'd play in like Syracuse and

902
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:58,519
New Haven Connecticut and Binghamton New

903
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,800
York and down in Phil at the Spectrum so

904
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:04,559
it was just so easy to you know take a

905
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,400
two-hour ride and this was before cell

906
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,279
phones and before you know so many

907
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,200
things that you know we take for granted

908
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,000
now but yeah we would really just not

909
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:15,679
even have tickets and just show up at

910
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,400
the shows and somehow scramble get

911
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,519
tickets at the last minute and go see

912
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,280
the shows and you know for those of us

913
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:28,519
who were alive to see Jerry Garcia

914
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:31,519
perform it was just a real amazing

915
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:33,960
um almost religious experience

916
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,880
because every because because you were

917
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,480
on

918
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,960
acid no I I don't think so a lot of

919
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,920
people who were there who were straight

920
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,639
and there were a lot of people there who

921
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,920
were just smoking weed and not doing

922
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,400
psychedelics but there's just yeah an

923
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,760
incredible the Psychedelic aspect of it

924
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,920
was unbelievable would you not say that

925
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,040
that was like yeah but like I don't

926
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,880
think I've seen it since I mean the way

927
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,440
try describes it is like he remembers

928
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:04,119
when he first saw Bruce Springstein

929
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,920
right in 1978 at the Spectrum in Philly

930
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:10,200
and every person in that concert was

931
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,599
locked on to that one guy on stage and

932
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,118
that's the same way it was with with the

933
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,200
grateful Dad and Jerry Garcia he had

934
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,280
everyone's attention in that room and I

935
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:24,719
think the Grateful dad changed the way

936
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,519
live music is played and yeah I think

937
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,000
cannabis and psychedelics had a big

938
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,480
thing to do with it because they were

939
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,480
the you know the Pioneers from the San

940
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,880
Francisco sound that got involved with

941
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,838
key and the pranksters during the early

942
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,480
days of the acid tests and their

943
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,679
soundman you know bear the guy that they

944
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,679
named you know the dancing bear or the

945
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:50,399
marching Bears or you know Bears Choice

946
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,118
uh he was the you know Dropout chemist

947
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,800
who basically turned on a whole

948
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:58,039
generation on LSD by Purity LSD I think

949
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,480
they're still doing some of this Stash

950
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:03,318
from ousley's uh lab but you know I mean

951
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,280
make a long story short Marcus I don't

952
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:08,719
think weed I mean like like when I think

953
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:12,000
about it like even like hash even like

954
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:14,598
good high quality nugget I mean when you

955
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,719
were living in suburan New York uh you

956
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:20,960
can go more easily buy an eight Bott of

957
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:23,039
coke by some dealer just on the street

958
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,039
you know in Manhattan and come back to

959
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,759
your party in Suburban New Jersey and

960
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,358
completely uh

961
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,160
own the party but it was just difficult

962
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:36,199
to get good weed and you'd be able to

963
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:39,199
get these little $10 and $15 manila

964
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:41,279
envelopes of of mostly seeds and stems

965
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,919
and a little bit of brown weed you're

966
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,240
lucky if you could get a joint out of

967
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,318
like this little $10 dime bag so you

968
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:52,399
know the the Dead really were the ones

969
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:53,880
that brought good weed to the east coast

970
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,838
I don't think there's any question about

971
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,640
it there would not be the appetite for

972
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:01,558
deep

973
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:05,358
I mean uh chem dog has a Grateful Dead

974
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:08,559
um uh Genesis right so PUD and G first

975
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,920
met at a Grateful Dead show in 1991 in

976
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,319
Deer Creek they exchanged numbers they

977
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,358
exchanged weed next thing you know you

978
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:18,119
know Greg out in Massachusetts pops

979
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,838
these beans that end up becoming Cham

980
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,760
dog so I mean that's that's a Grateful

981
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:27,719
Dead uh connection I mean they connected

982
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,920
at a Grateful Dead show so yeah I mean I

983
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,519
so so that's my story I mean I think

984
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,559
that yeah there's probably a lot of

985
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,838
people with the same story but you'd be

986
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:38,519
able to go to a dead show Marcus and

987
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,920
hook up with acid and hook up with good

988
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,358
weed and then bring that back to your

989
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,318
town and they'll be like holy [ __ ] where

990
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,440
did you get all these good drugs and

991
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:50,119
it's like oh at the parking lot at the

992
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,318
Grateful Dead show you can get anything

993
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:55,160
right Shakedown Street right so down

994
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:57,318
street was responsible for some of the

995
00:43:55,159 --> 00:44:00,239
best uh cannabis connections you know

996
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:01,880
some of the best genetic lines were as a

997
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,879
result of people having good times at

998
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,920
Shakedown Street for the whole country

999
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,599
it's is that's a really positive

1000
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,159
connection with weed and music is how

1001
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,160
music brings people together and same

1002
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,519
with ganja right like you always have

1003
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,519
that Circle the international

1004
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,679
herb yeah for me it was just like I I

1005
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,480
couldn't believe first of all that this

1006
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,399
incredible weed existed and it seemed as

1007
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,318
though again there was like this

1008
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,720
cultural aspect tied to well it's

1009
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:35,279
cultivated in Humble or in mesino you

1010
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,919
got to be out there and so I had a lot

1011
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,319
of friends who grew up in the east coast

1012
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,599
in the midwest who migrated to Oregon

1013
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:46,558
and Northern California because they

1014
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,680
wanted to grow the weed that they smoked

1015
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,119
on Grace dead tour and I I have a back

1016
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,639
Seed story from summer tour in 1991 I

1017
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,559
hooked up with my friend Ron the pizza

1018
00:44:54,639 --> 00:45:00,879
man from Shasta and he hooked me up with

1019
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:03,559
a bag of Big Sir holy nug and it was

1020
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,480
just these incredible buds man they were

1021
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:09,079
so so dense and out of that came two

1022
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,960
seeds which we popped like two years

1023
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:15,000
later at a grow that I I first started

1024
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,280
growing weed in the summer of 1992

1025
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Marcus right after fish tour um we were

1026
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,200
growing some some weed in Fort Collins

1027
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,559
and uh yeah we popped those seeds and

1028
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:29,279
and yeah it was you know Grateful Dead

1029
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,720
tour just a cultural phenomena we we

1030
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,359
knew each other it was through the music

1031
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:36,239
but it was through our appreciation of

1032
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,920
psychedelic experiences and good weed

1033
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,558
and good food so all those elements that

1034
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,039
you guys were just talking about you

1035
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:47,720
know the food the music the weed it was

1036
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:49,679
just intersected in this lifestyle that

1037
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,838
you know basically lived to the

1038
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,159
soundtrack of the Grateful Dead I don't

1039
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,119
know how else to describe

1040
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:59,118
it hey what's up Dr Mark by the way you

my herb and the character of my my

1060

definitely definitely definitely I want

1067
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,639
to uh dive in there on like so Dr Mark

1068
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,279
you were talking about how the Grateful

1069
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:13,358
Dead Shakedown Street kind of spread the

1070
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,440
knowledge of kind bud around the country

1071
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:16,838
and like fast forward to like my first

1072
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,358
time smoking in

1073
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:23,078
2010 and um you know in Virginia kind

1074
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:25,960
bud was like the top tier bud so what

1075
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:27,440
was very common was we'd be receiving

1076
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,960
the BC bud

1077
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,838
you know the kind that was already

1078
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,440
sifted had no trikes on it and then

1079
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:37,719
people would sell it as kind bud the

1080
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,559
Beast kind bud the beers exactly beers

1081
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,838
were being sold as kind bud even though

1082
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,160
they clearly weren't but no one really

1083
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,719
knew the difference and there's been a

1084
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:49,799
lot of I guess um you know name switches

1085
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:54,480
that that could happen um and I guess

1086
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,599
different tiers of weed that kind of uh

1087
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,760
the information about the different

1088
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,559
tiers of weed gets out through music so

1089
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,520
kind bud is a great example um perhaps

1090
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,880
some of the more uh perhaps people would

1091
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,159
like to talk about like how did the

1092
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,480
reputation of

1093
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:12,558
Indo become like as a higher tier item

1094
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,079
because over time right there was a

1095
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,920
point in time when everyone was smoking

1096
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,800
outdoor and then there becomes a point

1097
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,599
in time when now I guess depending on

1098
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,280
which Camp you're in indoor might be

1099
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,240
considered the higher tier versus

1100
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,040
outdoor love to get people's thoughts on

1101
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,959
that and how music may or may not have

1102
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,960
influenced that

1103
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:35,559
okay I'll start you know my first time

1104
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,559
smoking weed was like in

1105
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:43,000
1994 I think I was about 15 years old

1106
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:45,960
and we and Snoop Doggy Dog and Dr Dre

1107
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:51,358
came out with the chronic Nothing But a

1108
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:54,960
G thing and I'm telling you everybody

1109
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:57,480
wanted to sip Jin Jin and juice and

1110
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,358
smoke a blunt and then when they and

1111
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,400
then they came out with with a song

1112
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:05,558
called rolling down the street smoking

1113
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,039
in

1114
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:11,798
sing I listened to it

1115
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:15,599
yesterday hey I'm telling you music

1116
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:18,318
influences culture and that and that

1117
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,119
definitely influenced our culture down

1118
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,679
here in Houston because you know like it

1119
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,400
seemed like everybody wanted to know

1120
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,159
somebody from Texas so they could get

1121
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,480
cheap weed or something like that or

1122
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:36,719
other drugs you know but for us you know

1123
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:40,000
I I think like uh the the the actual drw

1124
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:44,159
the actual Kelly Kush I think it hit

1125
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,039
Houston last I think it hit us about

1126
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:49,598
2004

1127
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:51,039
2005 however we had this stuff called

1128
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:56,240
red hair

1129
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:58,199
SES and aapco gold and to get that down

1130
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,879
here Houston was

1131
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,919
like like something like like it was a

1132
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,960
very

1133
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,760
rare a very rare set of buds that you

1134
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,079
could get and we would get and if you

1135
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:17,240
were able to get a hold of that and jam

10-year-old son yesterday to that very

1147
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,039
song in fact uh because he had never

1148
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,280
heard it before but I did want to

1149
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:55,639
mention to Caleb before he went into his

1150

1152
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,720
getting from BC and that he actually

1153
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,639
mentioned a part of the history that a

1154
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:07,199
lot of people uh Miss they just blame

1155

the shoddy BC Growers the low Integrity

1156
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:13,118
BC Growers uh but he did mention that uh

1157
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:16,358
it sifted that that flower was sifted

1158
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,119
those buyers who were buying it who were

1159
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:22,400
the the American folks were bouncing the

1160
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,880
the flower like hundreds of pounds of it

1161
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,039
and just collecting the sift and then

1162
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,280
selling the

1163
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:31,279
weed into like prohib prohibition Rich

1164
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,680
States you know like V Virginia and

1165
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,720
North Carolina and all Florida and

1166
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:39,719
Alabama different places yeah so I I

1167
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:41,279
came up on Canadian herb you know I'm

1168
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:44,959
about 30 miles from the border right

1169
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:47,119
here where I sit and um you know we used

1170
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,480
to get small bats stuff I grew up in the

1171
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,280
Boston area we got imported brick weed

1172
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,358
you know and until we started getting

1173
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,040
small batch kind bud but when Canadian

1174
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:58,960
herbs started coming in um yeah I mean

1175
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,519
those were that all organized crime

1176
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,838
running that [ __ ] and I think I think we

1177
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:04,358
can talk about it now it's it's it's

1178
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,279
been a long time but uh when it first

1179
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:08,159
started come because it was so dense and

1180
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,640
compact we thought it was the kind bud

1181
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,480
you know and in the beginning the

1182
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:13,639
quality I think was okay but over time

1183
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,358
as it was more and more mass produced it

1184
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:17,639
was obvious that it was you know

1185
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:20,239
harvested earlier you know not dried

1186
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:23,679
right probably you know had been tossed

1187
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,399
or keed or something all of the above

1188
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,078
all all of the above I don't think I've

1189
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,680
ever honestly experienced

1190
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:30,760
the quality stuff that you guys have up

1191
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:33,480
there I uh I I write for some weed

1192
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,520
magazines and I um I write a column

1193
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,838
called the breeder diaries for skunk and

1194
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,280
I did this uh interview with breeder

1195
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,318
Steve a couple years ago incredible

1196
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,640
story uh that he told but you know he

1197
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,480
gave me a lot of the background and

1198
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:47,519
history of the evolution all the

1199
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,440
Canadian genetics so I don't think us

1200
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:50,719
Americans have had a fair share of your

1201
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,119
stuff unless you're buying seeds in the

1202
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:55,199
mid to late

1203
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:58,440
90s yeah for sure well I met Steve right

1204
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:01,679
when I moved here from Manitoba in like

1205
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,960
96 I would have met Steve and let me

1206
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:07,159
tell you in

1207
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,880
96 Steve was all in like both feed in

1208
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:12,239
just like going a 100 miles an hour it

1209
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,358
was wild to be around actually I can

1210
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,598
imagine I told his I did his whole life

1211
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:18,239
story in the article I I spent like a

1212
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,318
hundred hours on that article from like

1213
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,719
a three four hour interview with him so

1214
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,519
I I was blown away by how cool his story

1215
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,679
was there's a lot more cool stuff in

1216
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:29,358
there than did he talk about sending

1217
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:32,639
like three or four doctors to the ER

1218
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:35,639

1219
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,798
brownies he did not talk about that but

1220
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:40,279
um I got the whole background story from

1221
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:42,039
the very beginning of his first plants

1222
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,599
and you know his experience with

1223
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:46,199
Northern Lights to how he ended up in BC

1224
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:49,280
and Vancouver to how the sweet pink

1225
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:51,199
grapefruit was named to how he got

1226
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,319
connected with Mark Emory and how all

1227
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:57,679
that went down to um you know everything

1228
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:59,279
in Switzerland so I I went pretty deep

1229
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,558

1230
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,880
Switzerland with him as well in

1231
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:07,200

I yeah you were definitely around there

1233
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,519
I went and spent like a month with him

1234
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,279
just uh when he first moved

1235
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:18,039
there did you stay at the tennis Resort

1236
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:21,760
Sam at the cadro panoramica no I stayed

1237
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:26,679
at the uh I think it was Hotel Splendid

1238
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:30,040
on on Lake lagano oo fany yeah no it was

1239
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:33,838
the best hotel around and uh I was with

1240
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,519
my wife so I splurged I bet you she

1241
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,119
would have liked the hotel cadro

1242
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,679
panoramica

1243
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:42,838
more he told me the whole story how he

1244
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:44,798
had originally had this other farm and

1245
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:48,719
had made the arrangements to move there

1246
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:50,079
sold his vehicle his Hydro shop and

1247
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,838
right before he headed out to the

1248
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,039
airport was told the the place fell

1249
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,798
apart and then at the last minute they

1250
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:57,440
ended up finding a much better place

1251
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:59,679
with a more Mediterranean climate

1252
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,200
towards Italy and it ended up being a

1253
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:04,639
way better grow climate um so it's it

1254
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:10,239
was a cool story to to hear about very

1255
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,239
cool very cool lake lagano has excellent

1256
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,599
weather

1257
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,520
yeah another uh thing that Dr Mark

1258
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:24,159
mentioned was I guess the people

1259
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,599
listening to the music that weren't

1260
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:30,399
living in California Oregon time um you

1261
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:33,079
know might be inspired to then move out

1262
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,920
and you know I personally I guess feel

1263
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:38,240
like around 2013 when I moved to

1264
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,240
California um you know I was following a

1265
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,598
similar Exodus but you know not because

1266
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:45,118
of Grateful Dead music but because of

1267
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,318
Hip Hop and um you know it came up a

1268
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,358
little bit earlier when hardit and Kazam

1269
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:52,759
were talking but you know I think in

1270
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:54,960
certain parts of the country right like

1271
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,680
they said it there Wu Tang's influence

1272
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,159
wasn't as hard as for instance uh Snoop

1273
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,679
Dog or Dr Dre or Cypress Hill and really

1274
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:04,798
depending on where you are in the

1275
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:08,159
country you know for whatever reasons

1276
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:10,400
there's going to be different uh music

1277
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:13,159
artists that are more popular and you

1278
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,079
know that could have an influence on

1279
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:16,960
what particular artist is smoking what

1280
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:18,880
particular cultivar and what are they

1281
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,838
bringing into town what is their crew

1282
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,838
bringing into town come concert time or

1283
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,358
come something else and I guess does

1284
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,920
anyone have any stories about specific

1285
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:29,358
Cult of ours associated with specific

1286
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,920
artists in that

1287
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:34,159
way yeah I mean in New York you mean

1288
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,838
you're talking about wuang I mean

1289
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:40,159

1290
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:43,639
from tribe really spawn the bedroom

1291
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:45,679
producer and being in New York for me

00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:47,519
artists like Travis Stewart machine drum

1293
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:49,919
and flying Lotus and all these people

1294

1295
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,280
making beats trying to figure out you

1296
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:58,199
know how to blend our ourselves back

1297
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,798
into this culture we were so inspired by

1298
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:04,199
and I think through that strains like

1299
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:06,719
sour diesel came up a lot um especially

1300
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:09,439
in New York um there's definitely a lot

1301
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:13,919
of chams a lot of super skunks at the

1302
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:16,880
time um a lot of um just really gassy

1303
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,079
fenos c99 was really around a lot in the

1304
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,119
early early days um because a lot of

1305
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,440
influence from Boston um there's a lot

1306
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:25,960
of great Growers that were circling that

1307
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,599
whole New England area than they you

1308
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:31,720
know New York was the spot to drop it

1309
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:33,359
you know Dan knows that well and I think

1310
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:35,000
that what's up brother good to see you

1311
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,920
man good to see everyone by the way I've

1312
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,079
been absent um we'll get into that later

1313
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,760
but I think the music scene for me it

1314
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,640
even spawned into the Jazz downtown

1315
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,520
jazine in New York for me because I was

1316
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,558
around people like messie Martin wood

1317
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:51,838
and JN zor and I was always selling

1318
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:55,720
these people herb to be honest with

1319
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:57,639
everyone and I I you know it was it was

1320
00:57:55,719 --> 00:58:00,879
very much

1321
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:03,199
um a collective of individuals that were

1322
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,119
all um looking for something for an

1323
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:08,480
inspiring session that they were they

1324
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:11,280
were trying to go into it wasn't um most

1325
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:14,039
of these people I knew weren't daily or

1326
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,440
even hourly users they were they were

1327
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,440
looking for something that would Inspire

1328
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,440
them to to further their creative

1329
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,960
outlets and it wasn't the main event it

1330
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,159
was a part of the room um much like a

1331
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,679
new guitar or a new synthesizer rolls in

1332
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:28,038
and it's like got this expression and

1333
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:31,159
you're you're now writing a new song as

1334
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:33,680
a result um and I think that's what I

1335
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:36,598
saw from a young age and being around

1336
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:42,118
these sessions and Studios of other

1337
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:43,960
artists and I you know I think if if Jay

1338
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,640
from Happy monkey was here he could tell

1339
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,199
a great story too

1340
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:50,519
about his studio and how that became a

1341
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:51,759
Speak Easy and through that the wuang

1342
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:54,559
and all these people were coming through

1343
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,680
his Studio spawned a birth of of a new

1344
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,480
revelation in in New York and I think

1345
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:01,838
that's for me those are the varietals

1346
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,719
that spoke the loudest and was on the

1347
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,960
tip of everyone's tongue it was always a

1348
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:08,759
gas and then you either had a Jack or

1349
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,519
you had you had that and there was

1350
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,119
really no sure you had your piff which I

1351
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,960
believe is was more of a mango

1352
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:19,160
influenced Haze um just my nose and my

1353
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,318
my palette is really makes me believe

1354
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:25,798
that um and then these muted tones were

1355
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:27,519
really street corners that you know

1356
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,679
didn't have the greatest herbs so they

1357
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,000
sold what they had right and I think

1358
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,719
those that's the the blend that I was

1359
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,559
associated with as as a young kid

1360
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:39,159
growing up around it um in my cousins in

1361
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,720
Staten Island and my f extended family

1362
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:43,558
in Staten Island that was what they

1363
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:47,000
always had around um from from New York

1364
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:50,079
so that that's that's my piece on on

1365
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,400
association with with that that realm in

1366
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:55,280
Brooklyn and uh in the

1367
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,559
fibros well yo can I tell a cool Blu

1368
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,519
Tang story

1369
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,240
do yeah dude of course first first I'll

1370
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,920
say the the two most influential songs

1371
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,479
in terms of the herb that you smoke for

1372
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,480
me when I was a kid was Cypress Hill

1373
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,039
because hits from the bong just like

1374
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,798
everyone that I knew we were obsessed

1375
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:14,319
with bongs we're building bongs out of

1376
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:17,318
everything we were trying to get bongs

1377
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:19,558
um so big UPS to Bong Hits and then you

1378
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:22,400
know the whole album of Ka and Bob

1379
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:24,160
Marley was also the biggest to this

1380
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,240
that's the most influential weed smoking

1381
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:29,679
music of my life is the whole album Kaa

1382
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:32,159
um I've smoked so much weed to that you

1383
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:34,199
know album but anyway cool wuang story

1384
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,199
um in Vermont we got to throw a New

1385
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,159
Year's party with one of the

1386
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:40,879
dispensaries that we work with that has

1387
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:43,798
a um a music venue and so we did a show

1388
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,200
with kaidon and inspected deck who are

1389
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:48,038

1390
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:50,598

1391
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:54,400

1394
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:00,318
was a little cheesy but it was cool we

1395
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,358
did a pre-roll with my double OG Cam and

1396
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:03,798
put the flyer for the show on the thing

1397
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:05,159
and they came ins sign autograph I

1398
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:07,119
didn't bother them with autographs but

1399
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:09,399
when I got to meet them you know the

1400
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:12,358
first time I ever wrapped in my life was

1401
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,000
listening to 36 Chambers and people in a

1402
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:15,199
room were freestyling so that's the very

1403
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,519
first thing that really got me into

1404
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:19,639
rapping and so I meet inspected deck and

1405
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,519
kaidon and I give them my herb and I

1406
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:23,838
show them this weed with the leaf on it

1407
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:25,719
and I go to inspect the deck and I go

1408
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:27,358

meet them but I was in Amsterdam one

1447

year at my hotel and it took me years to

1448

find this hotel it was the cow rulsky it

1449

was this big fancy Russian hotel in Dam

1450
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,559
Square in the city center of Amsterdam

1451
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:07,318
and um what I had learned and I can't

1452
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:10,278
even remember who told me but it was

1453
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:11,920
like a long time ago 25 years ago now

1454
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:14,960
was that they had another building

1455
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,039
attached to their hotel that was like

1456
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,798
Apartments so they weren't rooms cu the

1457
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,400
first time I went to this hotel it was

1458
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,960
just like this two fancy red velvet

1459
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,960
carpets and stuff and like you're in

1460
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,720
this tiny little room that just has a

1461
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,480
little bed and it's like 500 gilders

1462
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:32,000
this was before the Euros but uh I found

1463
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,318
these apartments eventually and it was

1464
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,199
like the sickest deal they were like 250

1465
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:38,239
bucks a night and it had a kitchen and

1466
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:41,118
an upstairs with a bed and it was just

1467
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,278
on the back end of the of the kapulsky

1468
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:46,519
but it was their Apartments but they

1469
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:48,960
would never tell you if you that they

1470
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:50,639
had Apartments so I'm standing there

1471
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,440
I've been going there for probably three

1472
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:55,920
or four years at this point and I'm at

1473
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,679
the desk and this dude is like kind of

1474
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,920
flipping out he's like look I got all

1475
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:02,399
these rooms they're way too small my

1476
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,400
guys can't fit in these rooms like what

1477
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,880
you do you have anything bigger and of

1478
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,000
course she couldn't just say oh actually

1479
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,920
sir yes we have these apartments right

1480
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,559
they just don't do that in Holland for

1481
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,200
whatever reason and so this guy's losing

1482
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:15,119
his mind and I'm like this listen dude

1483
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:17,719
like let me give you a tip you just need

1484
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:20,240
to ask for the apartments and if you say

1485
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:21,959
that she'll say Yes and she'll probably

1486
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:25,159
rent you like four or five Apartments

1487
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:28,679
anyway it ended up being the wuang cluh

1488
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:30,598
this dude was their manager and uh yeah

1489
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,239
they were stay it was a small apartment

1490
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:34,440
where it was just like each floor had

1491
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:37,479
like two of these apartments so it was

1492
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:40,159
basically me staying in one of them with

1493
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,920
like you know eight or nine uh of the

1494
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:46,199
wuang uh members staying in the other

1495
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:51,318
ones it was pretty cool pretty cool

1496
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:53,439
experience shouts to the woo I got story

1497
01:04:51,318 --> 01:04:56,599
I got a quick yeah just one cvar that

1498
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,200
comes to mind with music is purple

1499
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:00,720
like I remember the first time I heard

1500
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:03,159
Jimmy Hendrick on vinyl sitting down

1501
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:04,639
like a toddler my Dad pulled out a vinyl

1502
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:07,598
record and he said son I want you to

1503
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:07,598
hear something and put

1504
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,278
on it's the first time I heard that riff

1505
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:14,639
it kind of changed something in my head

1506
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:17,358
and it kind of reminds me the first time

1507
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:19,038
I tried herb um they called me smiley

1508
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,199
from Santa Cruz and when first time I

1509
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,920
tried my first puff was actually purple

1510
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:26,598
hayze so it was prophetic what happened

1511
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,440
um and you know something changed in my

1512
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:31,359
brain when I took a puff of Purple Haze

1513
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,159
and we listened to that song it was in

1514
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,960
an orchard in El Dorado County during a

1515
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:37,598
snowstorm I I skipped fourth period when

1516
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,639
I was 14 but that's actually pretty

1517
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:42,519
profound because like these are key

1518
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:44,920
moments in my life you know over over

1519
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:47,798
your decades as you grow you remember

1520
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:51,079
key Great Moments uh Great Moments in

1521
01:05:47,798 --> 01:05:53,159
your history and so that one cult ofar

1522
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:55,119
that one song and that that that

1523
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:57,239
beginning riff by Jimmy Hendrick is

1524
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,160
something that I'll never forget and it

1525
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:00,959
is amazing that cannabis connection to

1526
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:03,679
music specifically and it kind of set me

1527
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,880
on that path of like I want to you know

1528
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:09,278
I want a jam um and that that specific

1529
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,559
cultivar and living in Santa Cruz full

1530
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:14,559
circle is kind of cool home of the haze

1531
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:17,200
um you know since I was like a toddler

1532
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,039
to high school to now being you know I

1533
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,519
got my own toddlers I'll turn them on to

1534
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,400
some purple hayze jimmi Hendricks after

1535
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:26,318
the show what what year did you smoke

1536
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:31,318
purple a

1537
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:34,759
uh 2001 2000 it was it was early like

1538
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:37,038
maybe 25 years ago okay because it was

1539
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,400
not the haze Brothers growing that

1540
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:42,720
purple haze because no it wasn't that

1541
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:45,798
long ago I wish I really wish it was

1542
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,000
they stopped growing the the the two

1543
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:50,559
different Haze brothers were my

1544
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,159
neighbors and one of them lived on one

1545
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:56,960
side of me the other one lived on the

1546
01:06:52,159 --> 01:07:00,318
other side of me and they quit they both

1547
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,039
quit growing the original Haze which I

1548
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:08,880
thought was the finest weed in the world

1549
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:12,319
uh including purple ha uh by I don't

1550
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:16,680
know maybe

1551
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:22,199
1980 or the mid 80s that they had quit

1552
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:25,719
growing Haze and uh they both grew skunk

1553
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:29,318
because it was so much faster and easier

1554
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:31,399
D how crazy is it that hay skunk hay

1555
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:33,639
like you had two Hayes Brothers living

1556
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,440
next door to you on either side of your

1557
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:38,318
house and your skunkman Sam now that in

1558
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:41,159
Santa Cruz it was South County Santa

1559
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:43,719

1583
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:58,278
of w Music City used to be before Tower

1584
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:03,919
records the coolest place to buy music

1585
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:07,159
uh at least in California and uh yeah I

1586
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,640
I I just grew Mexican seeds I mean they

1587
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:13,198
weren't nothing super special but uh

1588
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:16,880
they got a put her Too Tall before

1589
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:19,719
either the gardener cut him down or one

1590
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:22,759
of the people that were hanging out on S

1591
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:26,600
Boulevard spotted them and and harvested

1592
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:30,798
them for the Revolution and uh

1593
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:34,440
yeah and then after that the music I was

1594
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:36,439
actually listening to at that time was

1595
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:39,119
people like

1596
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:43,119
uh Buffalo

1597
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:46,278
Springfield uh Jefferson Airplane that

1598
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:53,719
that's the music that I lik back then

1599
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:57,960
but uh when I moved to Santa Cruz in uh

1600
01:09:53,719 --> 01:10:00,800
1972 uh a few years later we were able

1601
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:04,279
to see

1602
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:08,079
uh uh Bob Marley played at the Santa

1603
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:11,359
Cruz Civic twice and we went and saw him

1604
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:15,000
both times the second time we had our

1605
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:18,839
daughter with us she was only uh uh two

1606
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,479
or three years old I mean she was but

1607
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:25,440
uh it was fantastic and the Santa Cruz

1608
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:29,359
Civic used to be my favorite place to go

1609
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:33,719
see music because it was small maybe at

1610
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:38,359
the most 1 or 2,000 people fit in it and

1611
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:44,439
uh man it it I saw so much good music

1612
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:47,880

1615
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:57,239

1616

show in the Santa Cruz Civic uh uh

1617
01:10:57,238 --> 01:11:04,439

1618
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:05,559
wasn't 72 I think it was 78 in July okay

1619
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:10,079
in

1620
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:12,920
79 in uh towards the end of the year and

1621
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:16,119
by the when I saw him the second time he

1622
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:20,440
was uh he did not have the energy left

1623
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:20,439
and you could tell something was

1624
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:27,198
wrong it's Legend a place a legend yeah

1625

01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:31,639
it's still going but I I don't know if

1627
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:34,198
it was it's not quite where it used to

1628
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,679
be in the late 70s that said though

1629

1630
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:39,639
in that space for

1631
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:49,920
sure I I love Santa Cruz it was the only

1632
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:52,159
reason I left was because uh the state

1633
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,880
and federal government were flying

1634
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:57,439

like oh these are the little bags that

1672

that

1688
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:47,079
stuff yeah except for I I really

1689
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:49,519
collected it for myself it it would be

1690
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:52,679
nice to share them and I've considered

1691
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:56,280
putting them online on the website but

1692
01:14:52,679 --> 01:15:00,520
uh yeah it's a lot of work and uh i'

1693
01:14:56,279 --> 01:15:02,840
I've got hundreds of them yeah you do

1694
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:05,440
there's a Grateful Dead archive at the

1695
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:08,360
Henry Miller or the the the library at

1696
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:12,839
UCSC and I could see like a skunk man

1697
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:14,679
Sam archive uh little mum thing um you

1698
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,600
know giving some homage to the young

1699
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:20,239
slugs going to school I think important

1700
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:22,440
to document and have a little exhibit I

1701
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:27,079
don't know if you know this but the

1702
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:30,960
hatch Museum in amster D was actually

1703
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:35,000
started by me and Bob Warren and cool

1704
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:38,279
Ben drunkers bought the building and

1705
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,238
took over the museum and actually he

1706
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:43,039
ended up putting a lot more money in it

1707
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:47,718
than I had and then he built that one in

1708
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:50,359
Barcelona which is amazing it's insane

1709
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:53,198
it's Bonkers actually that one in

1710
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:53,198
Barcelona is

1711
01:15:53,238 --> 01:15:57,879
Bonkers so beautiful

1712
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,600
I think I think we broadcast something

1713
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,960
from there together I foret we did we

1714
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,000
did for sure I think it might have been

1715
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:07,399
a hash Church actually but yeah it's a

1716
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,719
16th century building and instead of

1717
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:10,319
restoring

1718
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,960
it

1719
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:15,639
he I don't know what the hell the well

1720
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:19,158
he spent a few million dollars in in

1721
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:21,400
four years restoring it first of all

1722
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:24,079
yeah no exactly but it was like the way

1723
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:26,559
he explained it it was like he dug he he

1724
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:28,559
lifted all the dirt off and like exposed

1725
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,880
what was there and just yeah it was just

1726
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,760
incredible incredible building if you're

1727
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:37,119
in Barcelona it's definitely worth

1728
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:40,400
whatever even if it's 20 or30 EUR it's

1729
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:43,479
well worth uh walking through it the

1730
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:46,238
collection is ridiculous I mean what

1731
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:49,559
yeah it's ridiculous it's worth seeing

1732
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:49,559
anyway in

1733
01:16:51,198 --> 01:17:00,198
person yep that and Bugatti building and

1734
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:01,600
Barcelona both of those I I I I really

1735
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,719
like

1736
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,840
Barcelona that's a pretty cool City I

1737
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,880
like to rent a motorcycle when I'm in

1738
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,039
Barcelona and boot around on a

1739
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:13,319
motorcycle it's like the quickest way to

1740
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:16,439
get around and it seems like they have

1741
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:18,479
more of a motorcycle culture where the

1742
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:21,279
cars aren't running them

1743
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:24,519
over there's a lot of a lot of people in

1744
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,479
Barcelona use metros too underground for

1745
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,080
sure

1746
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:32,839
y perfect do it

1747
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:32,840
up uh I had some

1748
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,760
other questions that I had created

1749
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:43,840

1757
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:09,359
my father passed away uh December 17th

1758
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:10,079

1759
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:13,880

1760
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:18,000

bet that's uh I think

1765
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:30,759
back back that might have been the

1766
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:33,000
hardest time of my life when my father

1767

1772
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,320
that we that you've been going through

1773
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:49,359
all this stuff and haven't been here and

1774
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:52,599
we're glad to have you back

1775
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:55,238
dude thanks man yeah it's good to be

1776
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,719
here good to be with y'all I fig

1777
01:18:55,238 --> 01:19:00,359
I was actually thinking yeah I was

1778
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:03,639
thinking about you know

1779
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:07,119
um as you were saying like what artists

1780
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:09,880
like what varietals and I I've as the

1781
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:11,800
older self coming up through all that I

1782
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:14,079
don't think anyone could really call it

1783
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:15,920
out because it took individuals like us

1784
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:19,800
to come in the room to be like yo this

1785
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:23,239
is this this is that try this try that

1786
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:25,320
um because I musicians are largely their

1787
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:28,879
heads space are occupying

1788
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:32,238
Sonic territories and they're thinking

1789
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:34,920
about other things than what herb is

1790
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:37,158
right for them and I think it takes

1791
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,158
experience through trying things for

1792
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:41,759
them to find what works but it largely

1793
01:19:39,158 --> 01:19:44,000
takes a conduit and someone who is

1794
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,119
obsessive with that that medium or art

1795
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,238
form if you will and I think when you

1796
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:50,519
bring that into the room it it lifts up

1797
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:52,678
the room and then and only then can they

1798
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,719
call those things out like Dan gave them

1799
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:57,520
the jar right and then they were in the

1800
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:02,119
studio and he cracks it open and that's

1801
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:04,600
a to me that's an artist discovering

1802
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:06,800
something something the Magic in the

1803
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,360
mundane in a in a in a in a sense like

1804
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,159
they're just like it's in a jar and I

1805
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:13,399
open it and then there's the magic right

1806
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:17,079
um yeah there's a name but I always find

1807
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:18,519
that that comes after and I think from

1808
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:20,559
an artist point of view I don't think

1809
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:22,280
they're searching as much at least back

1810
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,360
then maybe today it's more because

1811
01:20:22,279 --> 01:20:25,679
there's more information and we all know

1812
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:27,880
more

1813
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,319
um but I don't remember someone being

1814
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,520
like can you give me this it was

1815
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:36,599
never I don't remember going in as a

1816
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:38,760
delivery being like only after time was

1817
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,719
that that that relationship developed

1818
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,840
and then can I see what else you have um

1819
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:46,880
but largely it was what do you think I

1820
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:49,079
should have um very very similar to

1821
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:52,719
today in a lot of respect but um with a

1822
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:55,158
Different Twist to it you know um

1823
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:57,760
so would you characterize that kind of

1824
01:20:55,158 --> 01:21:00,759
like a relationship between the artist

1825
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,480
and a specific grower or or you know

1826
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,719
breeder and then like there's a trust

1827
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:07,319
there and then really whatever yeah

1828
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:09,439
varietal well we yeah well we had this

1829
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:11,439
kid that was in with all the hip-hop

1830
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:13,439
guys and he would take our work and

1831
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:17,399
bring it in with them and he'd be like

1832
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:19,519
yo Ro likes this this guy likes that

1833
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:21,960
this guy like you know and and we would

1834
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,159
then arm him with other stuff like that

1835
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:26,760
um and he was a part of a management

1836
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:28,279
team and and you know there was it was

1837
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,639
you know he had the authority and

1838
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:32,359
there's always someone with an authority

1839
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:35,679
within the circle and I found that

1840
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:38,279
largely how I got through to people was

1841
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,719
utilizing the not only the assistants

1842
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:41,158
but the managers and then the assistant

1843
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:43,079
managers and all these people that got

1844
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:45,519
us into the circles and then and then

1845
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:48,760
you at least back this is talking like

1846
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:51,280
early 2000s or way back in the early

1847
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,880
days of this for me and that's how our

1848
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:54,840
you know it kind of moved you know you

1849
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,960
weren't just like invited into a room

1850
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,480
with all these guys right it took time

1851
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,880
to develop that relationship you know

1852
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:03,559
and then the trust was born from that

1853
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:07,039
and then it was just like creature haboc

1854
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:09,280
like call the call the guy um so I think

1855
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,800
that's a lot largely a lot of my

1856
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:13,198
experience at least personal experience

1857
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:17,039
with it um I don't know what anyone

1858
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,479
else's had but you know I I said sour

1859
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,198
and then I was like that was only after

1860
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:22,519
I was like guys you should try this and

1861
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:25,158
try that and try this you know and it

1862
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:28,280
was more um

1863
01:22:25,158 --> 01:22:30,359
influencing them to to try stuff and

1864
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:31,679
they then you know it's like music you

1865
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:34,238
listen to it you're like I want more of

1866
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:37,679
that can I listen to more of that um so

1867
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:40,000
I think that was um if I'm very honest

1868
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:42,079
about it I think that's really how A lot

1869
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,679
of this was was done I don't know if

1870
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,600
anyone could really call Things by name

1871
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:48,480
because we didn't really we had like

1872
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,960
four-way and like you know skunk and

1873
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:53,799
Hydra you know it wasn't like it is now

1874
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:57,480
like these names came in in really the

1875
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,119
2000 for us as as you know Brokers and

1876
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:01,079
stuff you know it was just we didn't

1877
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:04,079
really have this vernacular like we have

1878
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:07,039
today if I'm really really honest I mean

1879
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:09,679
I don't know Mark you know SC scouton

1880
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:11,359
like you even growing up in the 80s like

1881
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,119
what what what were the terms like were

1882
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:15,079
people really calling things by varietal

1883
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:18,158
names like I don't I don't really

1884
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:20,279
remember that

1885
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:23,158
no

1886
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:26,719
yeah I I I remember certain varieties

1887
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:31,079
like I remember things like uh Matt nusa

1888
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:33,800
[ __ ] and Y monkey paw and peab

1889
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:37,519
Bud and yeah things just sort of had

1890
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:40,239
like a slang in the vernacular right I

1891
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:44,360
mean kind bud was sort of recognized as

1892
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:47,519
being just dense

1893
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:51,719
sensia could be fruity could be gassy I

1894
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:55,760
don't think it was um it was strange

1895
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:58,399
specific until like the 90s on fish tour

1896
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,719
the first time I heard the word

1897
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:04,279
bubblehash was right around the time

1898
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:06,639
Marcus you started going to shows so I I

1899
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:09,880
think bubble has entered the vernacular

1900
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:12,400
during the fish at least during my you

1901
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,679
you know what funny enough all of my

1902
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:16,399
fish

1903
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,760
activity like almost all of it was

1904
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:20,359
pre-bubble

1905
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,360
bubble would have hit like I started

1906
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:26,039
going to seea fish in

1907
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:27,920
93 well 99 was when I coined the term

1908
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:29,000
bubble hash but that's an interesting

1909
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,520
thing because you were talking about the

1910
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,880
Grateful Dead earlier and we've been

1911
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,360
talking about you know colins's talking

1912
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:35,880
about like how you can influence

1913
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:38,479
musicians with your herb and then if you

1914
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,560
can get those cultivars liked by those M

1915
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:42,439
musicians and then they sing it I mean

1916
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,039
listen I wasn't a huge ludicrous fan but

1917
01:24:42,439 --> 01:24:45,799
when I heard that blueberry yum Y young

1918
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:47,840
song when it first came out I was just

1919
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,159
like cranking that thing I was like dude

1920
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,119
I wanted blueberry I was like trying to

1921
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:53,638
reach out to DJ Short and be like well I

1922
01:24:52,118 --> 01:24:56,639
got to get the blueberry again like this

1923
01:24:53,639 --> 01:24:59,520
blueberry then then my friend Kayla

1924
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:02,520
started a company here in Canada and has

1925
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,080
a cultivar called blueberry yum yum and

1926
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:06,719
I don't know if she's growing it like

1927
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:08,719
aquaponically or what it is but it it

1928
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:12,359
literally looks like the weed from the

1929
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:14,560
video like it's just fluffy big round

1930
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:17,359
coated crystally lovely Buds and here's

1931
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:19,119
the thing I don't even smoke flower like

1932
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,039
flower is next to useless for me unless

1933
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:23,639
I can somehow bounce the resin off of it

1934
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:25,960
or if I can you know I can vaporize it

1935
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:28,159
and get the get that flavor profile that

1936
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,679
way but I kind of went about things a

1937
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:33,238
little differently because you know I of

1938
01:25:30,679 --> 01:25:36,199
course I hooked up a gazillion musicians

1939
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:39,039
over the years that had inspired me that

1940
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:39,039
I was going to then

1941
01:25:52,039 --> 01:25:57,519
reinpuck herbs but um yeah starting

1942
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,119
Bubble Bags was a little different

1943
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:02,639
because you know the way Colin was like

1944
01:25:59,118 --> 01:26:05,238
you had to earn that trust for me I sold

1945
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:07,079
bags I was transparent I taught people

1946
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:09,198
how to do the process and then that was

1947
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:11,198
it I had earned their trust like in a

1948
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:14,439
very short period of time at a time

1949
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:16,559
where it was very very illegal many many

1950
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:19,319
many people would invite me right into

1951
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:22,440
their home where they were making hash

1952
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:25,319
like like completely exposed themselves

1953
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:27,479
in a way that like I had earned a very

1954
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:30,639
deep trust and everywhere I went like

1955
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:32,279
every country every city wherever I went

1956
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:34,760
I'd always meet someone that was like

1957
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:36,679
wanted to just show me all their [ __ ]

1958
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:39,400
and it was really like wrap your head

1959
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:42,118
around it during a time where you could

1960
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:45,399
get in a lot of trouble so I

1961
01:26:42,118 --> 01:26:47,639
somehow leapfrogged the trust earning

1962
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:50,158
Thing by by releasing the bags being

1963
01:26:47,639 --> 01:26:52,840
transparent and just teaching people

1964
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:56,238
something that they didn't know before

1965
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:58,880
that was so sort of mind altering and

1966
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:01,118
life altering like not only are you now

1967
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,880
no longer throwing your trim away you

1968
01:27:01,118 --> 01:27:04,839
know of course years would go by and

1969
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,319
we'd get to crops being grown

1970
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:10,760
specifically just for hash making and it

1971
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:12,759
created this incredible Community where

1972
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:16,440
I just suddenly knew everywhere in the

1973
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:19,960
world where the best hash was like I was

1974
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:22,118
the conduit for that I knew I know where

1975
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:24,480
all the best hash in the world is from

1976
01:27:22,118 --> 01:27:26,759
all of these incredible people people

1977
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:29,279
ordering uh Bubble Bags over the years

1978
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:31,520
and just uh and just making hash so it's

1979
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:34,158
uh that's been my journey and it's been

1980
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,360
an honor to walk these steps and just

1981
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:38,799
travel around the world Johnny apple

1982
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:41,399
seed style but Johnny uh Johnny Hash

1983
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,679
Pipe Style just making hash and showing

1984
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:45,879
people how to do it when reg to come

1985
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:49,760
into

1986
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:52,400
Amsterdam they would uh people like yoy

1987
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,840
and aan the first thing they would do

1988
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:57,799
when they landed would give me a call

1989
01:27:54,840 --> 01:28:01,159
and i' whip over and give giant handfuls

1990
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:05,119
of skunk number one to everyone of the

1991
01:28:01,158 --> 01:28:08,519
band members and seeds to them and uh I

1992
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:12,319
I I I had really a lot of herb at that

1993
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:15,199
time and did not to am am I incorrect to

1994
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:17,039
say that Joseph culture Hill was like in

1995
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:18,919
Amsterdam maybe you guys were hanging

1996
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:22,679

2031
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:14,400
these [ __ ] up wet balls of hash

2032
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:15,960
basically like wrong like just wrong you

2033
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:17,439
know what I mean and I was like bubble

2034
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,679
hash you know trying to move you know

2035
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:22,799

all the trics are gonna get stuck in it

2047
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,719
you know what I mean because I was like

2048
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:53,520
just trying you know was cold out after

2049
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:57,480
I gone through the the first few months

2050
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:59,360
of having it and uh it took a while man

2051
01:30:57,479 --> 01:31:02,158
to really get it you know again no one

2052
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:03,799
to talk to except you know a message

2053
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:06,039
that you would send and hopefully you'd

2054
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:09,960
be on overgrow and answer it through PM

2055
01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:12,439
you know um free DM which is funny to

2056
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,920
say I when the word DM came out I was

2057
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:17,039
like what is DM what happened to PM

2058
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:19,639
private message you know what I

2059
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:22,359
mean um but that's you know the Journey

2060
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:25,719
of that I think I remember utilizing

2061
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:29,118
that that and going to on tour with it

2062
01:31:25,719 --> 01:31:31,560
with my girlfriend at the time um and

2063
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:34,238
you know it was it was a interesting

2064
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:36,000
time in in I think everyone's lives at

2065
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:40,198
that point in that band's career and our

2066
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,279
our own lives um because it was mainly

2067
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:44,479
um you know there was some hash but it

2068
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:47,319
was it was very few and far between and

2069
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:52,399
it wasn't very good when you found it um

2070
01:31:47,319 --> 01:31:54,279
it was usually imported um but it's um

2071
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:57,399
yeah I think Mark you know the the

2072
01:31:54,279 --> 01:31:59,920
timeline is maybe a little bit into the

2073
01:31:57,399 --> 01:32:02,599
2000s when the bubble hat really truly

2074
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:05,079
hit because I don't I think maybe 200000

2075
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:08,480
2001 2003 it's really when it started to

2076
01:32:05,079 --> 01:32:11,238
really blow through the lot um down

2077
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:12,519
Shakedown and stuff and then um from

2078
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:17,839
there it just

2079
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:21,760
grew first water hatch that I made was

2080
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:23,480
1988 wow so Sam with that said like were

2081
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:25,480
you pulling were you how which screens

2082
01:32:23,479 --> 01:32:29,118
were you using like I'm always curious

2083
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:32,359
using screens we would use we would get

2084
01:32:29,118 --> 01:32:36,839
dry buds grinded up with like a coffee

2085
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:42,759
bean grinder and dump it in big

2086
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:46,199
tall uh like several liter glass

2087
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:49,520
jars and the resin would sink down to

2088
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:53,079
the bottom and you'd wash it once or

2089
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:56,880
twice to get rid of the the the floating

2090
01:32:53,079 --> 01:33:00,639
crap and to make the water cleaner and

2091
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:05,159
then you uh treated it like water has

2092
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:08,600
but the yield wasn't quite as good as uh

2093
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:13,719
uh with multiple bag system like Marcus

2094
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:18,000
came up with a decade later but uh it it

2095
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:21,239
absolutely did work but to be honest I

2096
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,000
didn't make a whole lot of it because uh

2097
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:27,959
even though the yield of dry sift was

2098
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:31,238
much lower uh I preferred dry to me it

2099
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,239
was the gold standard and uh so that's

2100
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:35,000
what I

2101
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:36,678
made yeah it makes sense because the the

2102
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,800
one thing I was hanging out with Mojave

2103
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:42,359
and Rob Clark and and one thing he said

2104
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:44,520
that you would always say is that gold

2105
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:45,920
sinks and [ __ ] floats and I just thought

2106
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,080
it was the funniest thing that we were

2107
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,199
just like sitting there and he just says

2108
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:50,960
that all of a sudden I'm like that's

2109
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:53,399
really funny you say that but how would

2110
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:55,079
you get to that and then you just you

2111
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:56,599
just saying what you just said made it

2112
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:59,158
all make sense to me because you're

2113
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:02,400
using jars and it the gold would sink

2114
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:05,679
and the [ __ ] would float

2115
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:08,679
yeah Rob took a lot of pictures of the

2116
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:11,319
processing and uh yeah it was actually

2117
01:34:08,679 --> 01:34:16,719
showed to me in

2118
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:19,719
1988 by Neville at cannabis castle and

2119
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:22,760
uh some American guy I think his name

2120
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:26,198
was Mike I I don't actually remember at

2121
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:28,280
the moment he had showed him and a week

2122
01:34:26,198 --> 01:34:32,079
later me and Rob went over and visited

2123
01:34:28,279 --> 01:34:34,840
Neville and he showed us and uh I

2124
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:38,399
thought it was really interesting but I

2125
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:41,159
didn't do it a whole super lot because I

2126
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:43,719
like dry

2127
01:34:41,158 --> 01:34:46,198
better was that because of the the the

2128
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:49,880
chir preservation you know because when

2129
01:34:46,198 --> 01:34:56,158
it get I invented static neck and I

2130
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:59,880
could clean up dryft to 99 9 now the Y

2131
01:34:56,158 --> 01:35:03,799
incredbly the yield was incredibly low

2132
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:07,880
but uh got it when you make water hash

2133
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:10,800
depending on the variety you're using uh

2134
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:13,600
you will lose some of the turps ETC I

2135
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,159
mean that's why the water you know

2136
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:18,239
smells so

2137
01:35:15,158 --> 01:35:21,279
turpy right and did it matter that the

2138
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:26,638
yield was so low when you had access to

2139
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:30,039
a fair bid yeah I mean I I never never

2140
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:33,600
never never ran out of herbal cannabis I

2141
01:35:30,039 --> 01:35:36,519
mean I had you know trust me dude I saw

2142
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:39,159
it I saw the wall of 55 gallon barrel

2143
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:42,800
drums blue ones

2144
01:35:39,158 --> 01:35:44,960
filled as far as uh the Bubble Bags go I

2145
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,239
was thinking about you know re jogging

2146
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:50,158
my memory these were the first bags that

2147
01:35:47,238 --> 01:35:52,359
I got I dug up a old picture for you but

2148
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:55,279
I got my local hydro stores in Vermont

2149
01:35:52,359 --> 01:35:56,479
to order these from you probably in 2005

2150
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:59,639
or

2151
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:02,279
2006 and uh so that was my early hash

2152
01:35:59,639 --> 01:36:04,960
making Journey with your bubble bags

2153
01:36:02,279 --> 01:36:06,960
right here back in the day and then my

2154
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,679
buddy and I who were my other buddy was

2155
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,840
really more passionate about hash than I

2156
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:13,039
was and he made us a custom press and

2157
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,639
brought some gold leaf and so we just

2158
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:17,118
you know would would take some nice

2159
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,760
stuff and uh I also messed up drying it

2160
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:21,519
the first couple times but we were smart

2161
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:23,920
enough to put it in the freezer um but

2162
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,440
so that's that's how long I've been back

2163
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,840
with those bags would be probably

2164
01:36:26,439 --> 01:36:30,678
2006 that's awesome man that's early

2165
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:32,800
days dude that's very early days that's

2166
01:36:30,679 --> 01:36:35,960
only you know six or seven years in and

2167
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,679
it it did take really realistically like

2168
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:41,239
around three three in a bit to pop and

2169
01:36:38,679 --> 01:36:45,279
take off right when did the eight bag

2170
01:36:41,238 --> 01:36:47,399
kit come in like round 2005 right I'm

2171
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:49,639
remember no I think he had a six or a

2172
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:52,638
seven there he just said seven I thought

2173
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:55,000
seven it said it said made in Nepal and

2174
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,199
it took over to convince my local hydro

2175
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,279
store owner to get it because they were

2176
01:36:56,198 --> 01:37:01,000
so bugged out to even order Bubble Bags

2177
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:05,399
you know like that was it was different

2178
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:08,198
times I know it really was greting B

2179
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:10,839
everyone yes yes it changed it's changed

2180
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:14,279
the world Marcus because most people

2181
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:16,440
weren't using my dry method even though

2182
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:18,920
I publicized

2183
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:20,439
it got to go to work Sam just give me

2184
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:23,079
one second because I'm just going to say

2185
01:37:20,439 --> 01:37:25,359
goodbye and then you can finish yes Z

2186
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:27,800
rude to just cut out like that you know

2187
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:29,519
so it's nice meeting everyone I'm sorry

2188
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,880
that I have to leave this important

2189
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:35,480
conversation right now this is so

2190
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:37,039
interesting like I can't I can't process

2191
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:40,158
all that I'm

2192
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:42,079
hearing right now so I'm talking to some

2193
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:44,879
Legends right now you know so it's

2194
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:47,760
really it's really great to invite me um

2195
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:49,719
bbba man I'm really looking forward to

2196
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:54,119
linking with each and every one of you

2197
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:56,920
and see how best I can learn and

2198
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:59,639
grow grow the best thing in Jamaica here

2199
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:02,118
or you know what I

2200
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:04,440
mean yeah it's really great you know

2201
01:38:02,118 --> 01:38:07,198
trust me and I mean for me I started

2202
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:09,799
music by climbing trees and smoking

2203
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:15,039
ganja that's my inspiration when I

2204
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:17,800
started um smoking herbs and through um

2205
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:20,279
a group called orthodox music there were

2206
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:23,079
a group in a organization in 12 tribes

2207
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:24,118
of Israel in Jamaica here so growing up

2208
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:27,519
in a

2209
01:38:24,118 --> 01:38:30,799
family growing up with herbs every day

2210
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,960
24/7 yard in your space it was only

2211
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,000
evident that you know I ended up started

2212
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:38,719
smoking weed um I started smoking herb

2213
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,359
as I said climbing the AI trees and

2214
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:44,399
finding inspiration and eventually I

2215
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:44,399
started to write

2216
01:38:45,158 --> 01:38:51,879
notes which turned out to be music so

2217
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:56,118
that is how my journey started 21 years

2218
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:59,480
ago 22 years ago musically nice and

2219
01:38:56,118 --> 01:39:02,439

2262
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:12,679
you could think of um and yeah we just

2263
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:15,920
uh as a community Matti Community Center

2264
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:19,639
has kind of been like the the beacon of

2265
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:21,319
both music and cannabis culture honestly

2266
01:41:19,639 --> 01:41:25,000
and reg on the river was always that

2267
01:41:21,319 --> 01:41:26,719
Pinnacle and so for me it was you know

2268
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,399
kind of coming in I'm from Cleveland

2269
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:33,079
Ohio originally moved out to Humble like

2270
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:35,799
13 years ago now and uh it just I didn't

2271
01:41:33,079 --> 01:41:37,880
plan on staying and it sucked me in you

2272
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:40,560
know the Cannabis was great but really

2273
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,920
what sucked me in was the culture um you

2274
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:45,080
know I come from kind of like an

2275
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:46,639
underground punk rock Anarchist world

2276
01:41:45,079 --> 01:41:48,960
and you know the hippies that I knew in

2277
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:51,279
the city were totally different and so I

2278
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,719
came out here and it was like oh wow

2279
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:56,118
this is this is a world I can get you

2280
01:41:53,719 --> 01:41:59,079
know into and and really kind of live in

2281
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:02,519
and after a couple years just realized

2282
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:04,039
like you know the mat is kind of

2283
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:06,880
everything I've ever been looking for

2284
01:42:04,039 --> 01:42:08,639
and so my wife and I just dived head in

2285
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:10,800
uh we've been trying to help keep it

2286
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,639
alive you know I hate that kind of story

2287
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,840
of like ah this thing's dying got to

2288
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:17,279
keep it alive but that really is what

2289
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:18,960
we're dealing with here um and then

2290
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:20,439
through that you know spent a couple

2291
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,679
years trying to bring back reg on the

2292
01:42:20,439 --> 01:42:25,319
river uh with some of the key people

2293
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:28,239
that originally did it some new blood a

2294
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:31,399
little bit of everything and last year

2295
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:34,000
by the skin of our teeth we did it so um

2296
01:42:31,399 --> 01:42:36,399
yeah it's uh all about how to keep that

2297
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,679
tradition going I guess so I'm more here

2300
01:42:40,039 --> 01:42:45,519

2301
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:47,480

chronics and the kakas and I've just uh

2393
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:31,000
had a huge passion for reggae music a

2394
01:46:29,319 --> 01:46:32,639
big part of my life although funny

2395
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,920
enough you know for me it started with

2396
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:38,000
rock and roll my dad gave me the old

2397
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:40,279
Beatles and Stones albums and CCR and I

2398
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,198
was just like this is [ __ ] awesome

2399
01:46:40,279 --> 01:46:44,439
and then it kind of went into punk rock

2400
01:46:42,198 --> 01:46:46,238
for me because I was a skateboarder and

2401
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:49,118
I was living in Winnipeg this kind of

2402
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:50,839
pretty pretty awesome [ __ ] hole that uh

2403
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:52,479
you know a [ __ ] hole sucks if you don't

2404
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:55,079
make best of it but if you're living in

2405
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:57,319
a [ __ ] whole like I guess kind of out of

2406
01:46:55,079 --> 01:47:00,479
rock before Cleveland's kind of a [ __ ]

2407
01:46:57,319 --> 01:47:02,079
old too so Winnipeg sounds very familiar

2408
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:04,198
very similar we just had all the great

2409
01:47:02,079 --> 01:47:06,359
bands and so just like Cleveland prior

2410
01:47:04,198 --> 01:47:09,399
to the punk rock bands we had all the

2411
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:11,960
metal bands so first I saw all the metal

2412
01:47:09,399 --> 01:47:14,399
bands you know from glamrock kisses to

2413
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:17,158
like hardcore Sabbath and just the the

2414
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:19,598
real the real rootsy metal [ __ ] even

2415
01:47:17,158 --> 01:47:22,519
like Venom and like you know some some

2416
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:24,400
some obviously Slayer that kind of

2417
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:26,920
turned into punk rock we had this dive

2418
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:29,839
bar bar called the Albert that just had

2419
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:31,319
like every punk rock band every punk

2420
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,279
rock band like they were all just there

2421
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:35,319
and I was buying vinyl at the time so I

2422
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:38,639
still have all these punk rock records

2423
01:47:35,319 --> 01:47:40,000
on vinyl oh and that kind of grew for me

2424
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:42,480
I don't know how it happened it must

2425
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,520
have been psychedelics it must have been

2426
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,598
psychedelics because somehow for me and

2427
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:51,080
I don't think I'm missing anything I

2428
01:47:46,599 --> 01:47:55,480
went from punk rock back into that sort

2429
01:47:51,079 --> 01:47:58,238
of old school 60 psychedelic Rock and

2430
01:47:55,479 --> 01:48:00,000
then the Grateful Dead and fish and once

2431
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:01,839
the Grateful Dead and fish although I

2432
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,599
will say in that time that I was getting

2433
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,360
into the Grateful Dead and fish reggae

2434
01:48:03,599 --> 01:48:08,520
was like at that like I was listening to

2435
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:10,719
Peter Tosh like a crackhead like I would

2436
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:13,719
just listen to Peter Tosh all and he had

2437
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:17,920
so many albums it was just like pounding

2438
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:21,239
Peter Tosh religiously into my head um

2439
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:23,840
and then uh and then really jam bands

2440
01:48:21,238 --> 01:48:25,919
jam bands reggae and now more eclectic

2441
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:28,960
from Hip Hop obviously there was hip-hop

2442
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,880
in there a bit too in '95 uh when Biggie

2443
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,760
and Tupac were kind of taken off and the

2444
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:36,920
woo and you know obviously krs1 and some

2445
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:39,079
of the classics that I like so I I feel

2446
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:40,920
like I'm pretty eclectic in my music I

2447
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:42,960
guess if there's any genre I've

2448
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:46,520
certainly paid attention to World music

2449
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:49,000
I was a huge faila ANUK kapo couti fan

2450
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:52,119
massive fathala fan listen to so much of

2451
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:54,238
that music for so long with Egypt 80 and

2452
01:48:52,118 --> 01:48:57,079
all his other different iterations even

2453
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:59,839
his son FEI couti I got to meet and hang

2454
01:48:57,079 --> 01:49:01,599
out with those guys dude his son is

2455
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:03,840
incredible dude I saw him Fe

2456
01:49:01,599 --> 01:49:06,079
unbelievable in central at the central

2457
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,400
same energy I mean I never got to see

2458
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:11,118
but fi I've seen many times and his

2459
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:13,879
energy was incredible dude and they

2460
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:16,839
speak French so I'm I'm bilingual being

2461
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:18,679
a good old Canadian so I was able to uh

2462
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,199
meet them in Amsterdam there was really

2463
01:49:18,679 --> 01:49:22,319
not a lot of people at the show that

2464
01:49:20,198 --> 01:49:24,359
were speaking French funny enough but uh

2465
01:49:22,319 --> 01:49:26,799
I could so they spent lots of time

2466
01:49:24,359 --> 01:49:29,519
hanging out with me so always happy to

2467
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:32,639
spend time with musicians who are so

2468
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,880
exceptional at the execution of their

2469
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:38,800
Vision or tapping

2470
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:41,000
into this just incredible I guess as Dan

2471
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:43,480
would say amplifier well he was calling

2472
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,920
cannabis an amplifier but music too can

2473
01:49:43,479 --> 01:49:50,359
be Amplified as we know from Bob Dylan

2474
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:52,880
uh I guess it was what 1965 or 67 what

2475
01:49:50,359 --> 01:49:54,559
year did Bob Dylan do his Newport or

2476
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:57,639
even yeah Newport was it earlier yeah I

2477
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:59,639
think it was 65 65 yeah so that was a

2478
01:49:57,639 --> 01:50:01,199
big thing when he just like I think he

2479
01:49:59,639 --> 01:50:03,599
was getting booed there wasn't he when

2480
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:05,759
he came out with the electric

2481
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:10,480
guitar it goes to show you how much

2482
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:12,280
humans fear change because I bet you 99%

2483
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:14,198
of the people that booed at Dylan when

2484
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:17,639
he came out with the electric guitar at

2485
01:50:14,198 --> 01:50:19,919
Newport are huge electric guitar fans

2486
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:24,079
today if they're still

2487
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:25,800
alive yeah yeah new is scary yeah same

2488
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:27,279
thing happened to Miles man when you

2489
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:30,800
made [ __ ] Brew they were like what

2490
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:32,359
are you doing bro and he changed the

2491
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,920
world I mean I had a conversation last

2492
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:35,799
night where they're like miles is

2493
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,239
underrated I was like actually he

2494
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,840
created drum Loops so I'm not quite sure

2495
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:44,519
I'm on board with that actually he just

2496
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:47,800
doesn't give a [ __ ] about that yeah yeah

2497
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:50,440
on the west coast it was a Monteray Pop

2498
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:53,400
Festival right that was was that the

2499
01:50:50,439 --> 01:50:56,839
most important um like out Open Air

2500
01:50:53,399 --> 01:50:59,638
Festival in California Sam is that like

2501
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:01,599
the bigest time yes

2502
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:04,400
yeah yeah because I remember listening

2503
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:07,800
to hris as or studying Hendrick as a

2504
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:09,638
Young musician and that performance

2505
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:12,039
always came up because of him lighting

2506
01:51:09,639 --> 01:51:13,840
his guitar on you know all the stuff all

2507
01:51:12,039 --> 01:51:17,238
the all the sensationalism that happened

2508
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:20,880
during that and no one had ever seen

2509
01:51:17,238 --> 01:51:22,359
that it's incredible it's well I don't

2510
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,000
know he was definitely influen I was

2511
01:51:22,359 --> 01:51:26,399
thinking about that where he was

2512
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,078
definitely influenced by like The Who

2513
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:31,238
and others like that because they were

2514
01:51:28,078 --> 01:51:32,599
already doing crazy stuff like that and

2515
01:51:31,238 --> 01:51:34,039
then he was like what am I gonna do to

2516
01:51:32,599 --> 01:51:35,520
up this and he's like I'm gonna L my

2517
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:37,359
[ __ ] on

2518
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:40,679
fire

2519
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:42,679
well Guitar kind of good yeah he was

2520
01:51:40,679 --> 01:51:44,520
decent yeah just just kind of good he

2521
01:51:42,679 --> 01:51:46,880
inspired some people I remember seeing

2522
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:48,760
dzel Zappa and him telling the story of

2523
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,000
like finding like bits and pieces of a

2524
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:53,039
guitar under his dad's stairs and his

2525
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,039
dad being like Oh that was uh Jim that's

2526
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:58,000
the one he burnt at the Monterey Pop

2527
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:59,840
Festival and then I think he restored it

2528
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,639
I he might have even been playing it the

2529
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:03,078
night that he told the story I can't

2530
01:52:01,639 --> 01:52:05,440
imagine why he would tell the story if

2531
01:52:03,078 --> 01:52:08,238
he wasn't but I don't remember exactly

2532
01:52:05,439 --> 01:52:11,598
dzel Zappa definitely has that guitar

2533
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:15,839
though the one that Jimmy uh set on fire

2534
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:20,520
Frank was a a one block away neighbor of

2535
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:23,599
mine in L Canyon course was his

2536
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:26,400
babysitter was Miss

2537
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:28,360
who was uh kind of a girlfriend of mine

2538
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:31,799
at the

2539
01:52:28,359 --> 01:52:33,880
time ah the skunkman Sam history Frank's

2540
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:36,360
a block away the Hayes brothers are even

2541
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:37,800
closer Frank's probably telling his band

2542
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:40,198
stay the [ __ ] away from those Hayes

2543
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:43,880
Brothers in that skunk

2544
01:52:40,198 --> 01:52:47,799
guy well is it true I I hadn't run into

2545
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:49,400
the haze when I was living in L Canyon

2546
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:53,560
that was in the late

2547
01:52:49,399 --> 01:52:57,198
60s so it was a different time

2548
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:59,599
La not Santa Cruz well hold on there's

2549
01:52:57,198 --> 01:53:01,399
like Sam just let me can I ask you a

2550
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:03,360
really important question because that

2551
01:53:01,399 --> 01:53:05,279
scene that music scene Laurel Ken scene

2552
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:07,519
at the time you were there was the most

2553
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:11,479
important music scene in the world like

2554
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:13,360
it was the center of I mean all I you

2555
01:53:11,479 --> 01:53:18,039
know pretty much most of the greatest

2556
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:20,519
songs center of the uh Jefferson

2557
01:53:18,039 --> 01:53:24,760
Airplane and

2558
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:27,320
uh Big Brother you know so I mean there

2559
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:30,079
there was other important areas

2560
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:33,639
too true but it felt at least it felt

2561
01:53:30,078 --> 01:53:36,118
like Fleetwood Mac and I you the beach I

2562
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:38,118
mean so much American history has been

2563
01:53:36,118 --> 01:53:41,238
written in that Canyon it's kind of for

2564
01:53:38,118 --> 01:53:45,078
me at least as a nerd about music histo

2565
01:53:41,238 --> 01:53:47,839
historical moments I I look at that as a

2566
01:53:45,078 --> 01:53:50,519
very unique time almost like the Lowry

2567
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:53,319
side in the mid to late 60s kind of had

2568
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:56,040
its own Vision too there within five

2569
01:53:53,319 --> 01:53:59,279
miles of the current fire line of the

2570
01:53:56,039 --> 01:54:02,198
Palisades fire Palisades fire is right

2571
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:05,078
on mandville Canyon which is just above

2572
01:54:02,198 --> 01:54:07,960
Brentwood which is just above mahalan

2573
01:54:05,078 --> 01:54:10,559
mahalan actually the old mahalan road is

2574
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:13,039
the current current boundary of the

2575
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:17,000
upper level of that fire so that fire is

2576
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:18,078

2615
01:56:04,118 --> 01:56:09,399
a pretty sensitive time talking about

2616
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:12,159
the fires because uh actually in 2020 I

2617
01:56:09,399 --> 01:56:14,719
myself became victim to the Oak fire and

2618
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:17,118
I actually lost

2619
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:18,078
everything so sorry man sorry to hear

2620
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:21,639

2621
01:56:18,078 --> 01:56:22,920
that you know firsthand um yeah what it

2622
01:56:21,639 --> 01:56:28,039
what it means

2623
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:31,440
um but yeah you know it really is so um

2624
01:56:28,039 --> 01:56:33,760
I'm hoping and I'm hoping they can

2625
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:35,519
contain the fire it's at 11 or I think

2626
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:37,159
11% and you know maybe someone can

2627
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:42,719
correct me if I'm wrong here

2628
01:56:37,158 --> 01:56:44,319
but um it's not looking great so yeah

2629
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:49,599
it's not for

2630
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:53,479
sure can I River Story please do all

2631
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:56,639
right so um in 2008 I moved to Santa

2632
01:56:53,479 --> 01:56:59,238
Cruz next to a green room on Beach Hill

2633
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:01,319
and uh my roommates at the time were the

2634
01:56:59,238 --> 01:57:02,919
moon germs so kind of punk rock surf

2635
01:57:01,319 --> 01:57:05,880
rock it kind of ties in all this Bubble

2636
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:08,480
Bags everything and they were like I was

2637
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:10,880
18 didn't know anyone I actually took a

2638
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:12,198
musician's room because he went on tour

2639
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,279
and move I'm like now I'm living in

2640
01:57:12,198 --> 01:57:16,198
Santa Cruz and they take me to this band

2641
01:57:14,279 --> 01:57:19,719
practice in montere so there's a montere

2642
01:57:16,198 --> 01:57:21,919
pops there and uh they Jam hard and I'm

2643
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:24,118
trying to keep up with all these college

2644
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:26,800
kids and I'm 18 so I'm I'm puff and

2645
01:57:24,118 --> 01:57:28,598
tough and and I fall asleep on the couch

2646
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:30,039
and I wake up and they're dumping black

2647
01:57:28,599 --> 01:57:32,760
and yellow bins and they said it's time

2648
01:57:30,039 --> 01:57:35,679
to chop your way to the top and so the

2649
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:38,320
whole the whole house was triming weed

2650
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:40,480
and Monterey um and we would get some of

2651
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:43,599
the trim and make hash out of it and

2652
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:46,319
that's how we like built our our studio

2653
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:48,440
our little Jam Shack our first records

2654
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:50,759
were paid for from crops later on I

2655
01:57:48,439 --> 01:57:52,479
started ancest tree which is a Santa

2656
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:54,880
Cruz Roots ban so Nick it's a pleasure

2657
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:57,759
to to meet you and our goal was to tour

2658
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:59,359
a a circuit from Seattle to San Diego

2659
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:02,199
and that's what we did we would chop our

2660
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:04,000
way to the top it was all funded from

2661
01:58:02,198 --> 01:58:06,439
Cannabis and we would make the hash and

2662
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,639
sell that at shows and one cool thing

2663
01:58:06,439 --> 01:58:12,118
about Weeden music is it was The Growers

2664
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:14,319
in Oregon and NorCal that would take us

2665
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:17,319
in we would play a show like the Jolly

2666
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:20,118
Roger or something some you know dive

2667
01:58:17,319 --> 01:58:22,599
and we had nowhere to stay uh we were

2668
01:58:20,118 --> 01:58:25,039
sleeping in a little LAX short bus and

2669
01:58:22,599 --> 01:58:27,039
there's 11 of us and it was always like

2670
01:58:25,039 --> 01:58:28,880
a grower some iy head would be like yo

2671
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:31,719
where you guys staying like we had no

2672
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:33,400
idea like in our car you know in the bus

2673
01:58:31,719 --> 01:58:35,198
and so that's another cool thing is not

2674
01:58:33,399 --> 01:58:37,519
Not only was it the amplifier cannabis

2675
01:58:35,198 --> 01:58:40,198
was like the The Muse but it was the

2676
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:43,320
Cannabis community that always took in

2677
01:58:40,198 --> 01:58:45,198
players and bands and acts in my

2678
01:58:43,319 --> 01:58:47,719
experience as a performing touring

2679
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:50,439
musician from Seattle to San Diego we

2680
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:52,719
always got love um so it's something

2681
01:58:50,439 --> 01:58:55,000
that I think you know

2682
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:57,639
times have changed uh when it comes to

2683
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:01,679
like you know depending on a crop to pay

2684
01:58:57,639 --> 01:59:04,520
for an album or a tour uh but hey it

2685
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:06,960
really was the foundation that that that

2686
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:08,880
built our group ancestry and one of our

2687
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:11,960
ways one of the stops on the way was reg

2688
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:15,960
on the river circuit like 2010 2012 it

2689
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:18,118
was 20 2010 to 2014 that was our circuit

2690
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:20,599
yeah you you nailed something though

2691
01:59:18,118 --> 01:59:22,279
like just being a musician and stuff

2692
01:59:20,599 --> 01:59:25,520
myself I mean whatever just the

2693
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:27,960
traveling around in a van with like some

2694
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:29,679
level of like weed or I used to ship

2695
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:31,480
finger hash back to myself and hide it

2696
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:33,279
in the you know guitar pedals and that

2697
01:59:31,479 --> 01:59:35,399
would be like smoking out of an apple on

2698
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:37,599
the back of the van but you nailed it

2699
01:59:35,399 --> 01:59:39,920
every single time no matter where you

2700
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:42,760
were if it was like a shitty ass sports

2701
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:45,719
bar we ended up at if it was like the

2702
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:48,079
randomst hardcore crusty house whoever

2703
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:50,599
was smoking weed they were always it was

2704
01:59:48,078 --> 01:59:53,078
like oh let's huddle

2705
01:59:50,599 --> 01:59:54,719
up like what do you need like you guys

2706
01:59:53,078 --> 01:59:56,599
hungry like you guys want to go get some

2707
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:59,239
food you need a place to crack every

2708
01:59:56,599 --> 02:00:02,199
single time it was always the stoner and

2709
01:59:59,238 --> 02:00:04,118
that just crossed every single boundary

2710
02:00:02,198 --> 02:00:05,839
uh which actually kind of like what you

2711
02:00:04,118 --> 02:00:08,238
were saying Mark it's like

2712
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:09,560
every type of music you just described

2713
02:00:08,238 --> 02:00:12,359
you're like oh it's all over it's

2714
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:15,560
eclectic it's all weed like that's the

2715
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:17,598
one kind like you know it it really is

2716
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:19,440
like and out here in Humble first thing

2717
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,679
I realized when I moved that was all the

2718
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:23,598
hills too it was like if you can imagine

2719
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:25,679
a type of person into a type of music

2720
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:27,679
smoking a kind of weed they had their

2721
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:29,199
own little Hill or like part of a hill

underrated those calans up there those

2885
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:32,520
those are like uh Arab Christians so you

2886
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:34,159
know how you have Arab Muslims so you

2887
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:37,320
got Arab Christians so they call

2888
02:07:34,158 --> 02:07:41,598
themselves calans and those calan people

2889

2893
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:54,559
sometimes if you're just looking for the

2894
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:57,118
weed itself it's hard to find but if you

2895
02:07:54,559 --> 02:07:59,920
if you hunt the hash and you find the

2896

six-star full melt like you just found

2897

02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:28,559
brother I want to try some Vermont weed

2908
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:30,920
what's up with that Vermont weed you

2909
02:08:28,559 --> 02:08:30,920
talking

2910
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:36,599
about Dan knows D here in front of me

2911
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:38,639
you know I've got this is the California

2912
02:08:36,599 --> 02:08:40,559
version and then I've got the Vermont

2913
02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:42,800
version here and I got them both rolled

2914
02:08:40,559 --> 02:08:44,559
up so I've been smoking back and forth

2915
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:46,840
this is the California this is the

2916
02:08:44,559 --> 02:08:49,840
Vermont and then I've got some indoor

2917
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:52,920
too but uh yeah you know it really

2918
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:55,639
depends in my opinion on how it's stored

2919
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:57,158
um there's things about my California

2920
02:08:55,639 --> 02:08:59,800
weed that I like better that I think it

2921
02:08:57,158 --> 02:09:01,879
has a deeper flavor and it's it's

2922
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:03,639
probably a bit stronger in certain ways

2923
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:06,199
the Vermont weed is easier to preserve

2924
02:09:03,639 --> 02:09:09,440
the turpins so it's really turpy and

2925
02:09:06,198 --> 02:09:12,638
it's easier to keep it uh fresh I think

2926
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:15,158
um I'm I'm high so I like

2927
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,719
both so what what what would you

2928
02:09:15,158 --> 02:09:18,598
preferred up like if you had a

2929
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:20,319
preference would it be the California or

2930
02:09:18,599 --> 02:09:21,639
would it be the Vermont I'm I'm in love

2931
02:09:20,319 --> 02:09:24,840
with growing weed in both of these

2932
02:09:21,639 --> 02:09:25,719
places so I would never do that okay

2933
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:28,630
okay

2934
02:09:25,719 --> 02:09:31,319
okay don't make them shoes

2935
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:33,279
[Laughter]

2936
02:09:31,319 --> 02:09:36,479
call that's

2937
02:09:33,279 --> 02:09:38,399
awesome what I will say that Humble

2938
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:42,759
County in theal triangle is probably the

2939
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:45,719
ultimate in terms of potential climate

2940
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:48,360
history culture

2941
02:09:45,719 --> 02:09:49,719
uh if I if someone put a gun to my head

2942
02:09:48,359 --> 02:09:52,198
and said you could only grow weed in

2943
02:09:49,719 --> 02:09:56,279
Humble or Vermont probably go back to

2944
02:09:52,198 --> 02:09:59,799
Humbolt but very tough call have you

2945
02:09:56,279 --> 02:10:02,519
been up to the cies in

2946
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:05,800
Canada I haven't you should come check

2947
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:07,920
out the cies I'm like 99% sure it was

2948
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:09,840
like draft Dodgers from humbold who

2949
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:12,639
bounced to the cies and started the

2950
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:14,000
culture there so it's very much like our

2951
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:17,319
version

2952
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:21,399
of of Humbolt it's it's big it's

2953
02:10:17,319 --> 02:10:24,118
forested and it's just like uh maniac

2954
02:10:21,399 --> 02:10:26,759
[ __ ] characters living on acreages

2955
02:10:24,118 --> 02:10:28,639
just everywhere growing

2956
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:31,719
weed when I

2957
02:10:28,639 --> 02:10:34,559
first is that where black bear was

2958
02:10:31,719 --> 02:10:36,840
living uh black bear was actually in the

2959
02:10:34,559 --> 02:10:38,880
Okanagan he wasn't quite but he would

2960
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:42,039
have like he would have been the king of

2961
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:44,199
the Cy faky would have been the king of

2962
02:10:42,039 --> 02:10:45,519
of humble for that matter that guy was

2963
02:10:44,198 --> 02:10:48,078
uh quite a

2964
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:49,840
character so my first year in Humble the

2965
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:52,799
farm that I was at had a bunch of

2966
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:54,599
Vancouver Island purple crosses um and a

2967
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:58,400
bunch of crosses so we actually had a

2968
02:10:54,599 --> 02:11:00,440
bunch of um you know Vancouver Island um

2969
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:03,039
early finishing pures crossed into some

2970
02:11:00,439 --> 02:11:04,799
like old school neighborhood Northern

2971
02:11:03,039 --> 02:11:06,719
Lights crosses so that was actually the

2972
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:09,360
first stuff I grew in California was you

2973
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:11,480
know Canadian you know stuff and did

2974
02:11:09,359 --> 02:11:13,000
great it's beautiful herb that wasn't

2975
02:11:11,479 --> 02:11:15,678
from Legends was

2976
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:18,198
it it was some people who had come and

2977
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:19,639
worked on farms and they brought

2978
02:11:18,198 --> 02:11:23,039
genetics with them that they had been

2979
02:11:19,639 --> 02:11:25,279
working on um in the in Vancouver Island

2980
02:11:23,039 --> 02:11:26,479
and then those just made a impact you

2981
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:27,960
know it's like they were living in the

2982
02:11:26,479 --> 02:11:29,598
neighborhood and brought genetics and

2983
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:31,639
combined them with the old school

2984
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:35,159
neighborhood stuff and some people still

2985
02:11:31,639 --> 02:11:38,800
had it yeah that's awesome go ahead

I'm here in mesino County uh wow where

2997
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:17,400
to begin I have a passion for the hashen

2998
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:19,119
I also love to DJ on the side and lately

2999
02:12:17,399 --> 02:12:20,759
starting last year I decided what

3000
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:25,000
happens if I wanted to combine both

3001
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:28,400
passion both DJing and hash making by

3002
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,078
which honestly I put it um me and a good

3003
02:12:28,399 --> 02:12:32,198
homie of mine who's been kind of doing

3004
02:12:30,078 --> 02:12:34,880
this thing for a while now put our

3005
02:12:32,198 --> 02:12:37,000
talents together and we've been on this

3006
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:40,039
this little bit of a quest this last few

3007
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:42,158
year uh myself I should say along with

3008
02:12:40,039 --> 02:12:45,439
him within this last year of finding the

3009
02:12:42,158 --> 02:12:48,479
right frequencies vibrations HTS and

3010
02:12:45,439 --> 02:12:51,238
honestly D dejing and using bass as the

3011
02:12:48,479 --> 02:12:52,598
agitation process

3012
02:12:51,238 --> 02:12:55,279
I was just going to say are you doing

3013
02:12:52,599 --> 02:12:56,599
that already right now yes we've been

3014
02:12:55,279 --> 02:12:58,840
talking about that for a while too it's

3015
02:12:56,599 --> 02:13:02,078
the coolest thing ever to make some Keef

3016
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:04,639
with some Bas y yep actually I remember

3017
02:13:02,078 --> 02:13:08,078
sub subcool rest in peace was was using

3018
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:09,960
a Bas key agitated Keef and then I

3019
02:13:08,078 --> 02:13:12,558
remember seeing that and honestly before

3020
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:14,599
I started doing hash making back in the

3021
02:13:12,559 --> 02:13:17,119
day I was I remember watching

3022
02:13:14,599 --> 02:13:19,840
documentaries about Mor hash making in

3023
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:22,238
Morocco in which you would see the uh

3024
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:23,440
sticks and beat SI process happening so

3025
02:13:22,238 --> 02:13:25,919
I'm like all right if they're beating

3026
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:28,319
the plant material they're using a

3027
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:30,078
vibration so what happens if I as a

3028
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:32,920
little R&amp;D what happens if I took a

3029
02:13:30,078 --> 02:13:36,479
bunch of my Grinders put them on my subs

3030
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:38,760
and DJ to see what would happen and

3031
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:40,598
little suc had great success and then

3032
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:43,320
all right not just dry sifting but what

3033
02:13:40,599 --> 02:13:45,239
about ice waterer

3034
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:48,039
sifting

3035
02:13:45,238 --> 02:13:50,479
Savage and yep it's been real positive

3036
02:13:48,039 --> 02:13:52,599
results you know what else works really

3037
02:13:50,479 --> 02:13:56,839
good is

3038
02:13:52,599 --> 02:14:00,400
Ultrasonics yes when you use Ultrasonics

3039
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:04,480
either with alcohol uh for example you

3040
02:14:00,399 --> 02:14:11,319
can put ground up Buds and uh just do it

3041
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:14,558
for like 30 45 seconds and the uh what

3042
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:18,639
you get is gold the green doesn't come

3043
02:14:14,559 --> 02:14:21,159
out fast enough and beautiful it's it's

3044
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:23,840
incredible

3045
02:14:21,158 --> 02:14:26,078
awesome actually um in terms of

3046
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:28,599
Ultrasonics um I've been using

3047
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:31,519
ultrasonic as a way of cleaning the

3048
02:14:28,599 --> 02:14:34,880
resin once it's sifted through the

3049
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:36,480
microns and so I'll be honest like in

3050
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:39,279
terms of cleaning that

3051
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:41,279
resin um I'll I'll be real in this in

3052
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:43,800
this little R&amp;D process I have not used

3053
02:14:41,279 --> 02:14:45,238
a hose or a or a sand a fan setting on

3054
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:47,440
the hose to clean the resin at all it's

3055
02:14:45,238 --> 02:14:51,399
only been Ultrasonics and it's been

3056
02:14:47,439 --> 02:14:54,000
working and how clean does it get uh um

3057
02:14:51,399 --> 02:14:56,158
pretty uh honestly uh the market I have

3058
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,520
with people interested it's that old

3059
02:14:56,158 --> 02:15:01,078
school hashes quality and it's a good

3060
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:02,559
melt full melt bubble style if it don't

3061
02:15:01,078 --> 02:15:05,599
bubble it ain't worth the trouble and

3062
02:15:02,559 --> 02:15:06,719
it's been never trouble so far I I made

3063
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:11,639
that

3064
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:11,639
up yes sir hon to be in your

3065
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,760
presence Savage that's a cool thing I

3066
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:19,519
just wanted to jump in I actually just

3067
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:21,679
got back from Morocco not that long ago

3068
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:24,159
and what you mentioned Morning Glory

3069
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:25,639
like I took note right away where

3070
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:28,000
everyone was talking about like who was

3071
02:15:25,639 --> 02:15:31,118
beating the best hash and it was all

3072
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,118
about what Rhythm they had and so like

3073
02:15:31,118 --> 02:15:34,799
in the family that I was like hanging

3074
02:15:33,118 --> 02:15:36,479
out with it was like the different sons

3075
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:38,239
all had different rhythms and they'd all

3076
02:15:36,479 --> 02:15:39,919
argue no mine's the best mine's the best

3077
02:15:38,238 --> 02:15:42,399
and it'd be like oh listen to the

3078
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:44,078
pattern and then smoke the hash and it

3079
02:15:42,399 --> 02:15:45,558
was like you could tell the difference

3080
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:47,558
because it was how long they did it you

3081
02:15:45,559 --> 02:15:49,239
know what kind of thing I never thought

3082
02:15:47,559 --> 02:15:51,320
about the science behind it as much as

3083
02:15:49,238 --> 02:15:53,439
you but uh immediately that clicked to

3084
02:15:51,319 --> 02:15:55,719
my head is like Ah that's that's where

3085
02:15:53,439 --> 02:15:58,759
it's at being a drummer myself so the

3086
02:15:55,719 --> 02:16:02,359
only trouble with Moroccan hatch is it's

3087
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:05,239
all made with seeded marijuana it's not

3088
02:16:02,359 --> 02:16:06,558
CIA so it's hard to be the best of the

3089
02:16:05,238 --> 02:16:10,078
best of the

3090
02:16:06,559 --> 02:16:12,159
best yeah that we could talk about yeah

3091
02:16:10,078 --> 02:16:14,479
quality issues there all day I think but

3092
02:16:12,158 --> 02:16:17,399
the the science behind like kind of the

3093
02:16:14,479 --> 02:16:21,718
culture of them beating was great

3094
02:16:17,399 --> 02:16:24,198
yeah oh yeah but I tell you what though

3095
02:16:21,719 --> 02:16:29,118
I was out there in Casablanca for three

3096
02:16:24,198 --> 02:16:29,118
days and I was hot as

3097
02:16:30,319 --> 02:16:35,318
[ __ ] that's what's up well you know what

3098
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:38,358
you do you listen I've had to smoke

3099
02:16:35,318 --> 02:16:40,558
things of a much lower caliber in my

3100
02:16:38,359 --> 02:16:42,519
days depending on to me it's always what

3101
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:44,518
you have whenever someone says what's

3102
02:16:42,519 --> 02:16:46,200
what's your favorite hash I'm like wow

3103
02:16:44,519 --> 02:16:50,478
the one that was

3104
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:53,800
grown like perfectly I I I less I care

3105
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:57,398
less about the aromatic profile then I

3106
02:16:53,799 --> 02:16:59,478
do care about how well has it expressed

3107
02:16:57,398 --> 02:17:02,959
itself because at that point in time I

3108
02:16:59,478 --> 02:17:04,519
can lean towards any flavor profile sure

3109
02:17:02,959 --> 02:17:05,959
I love the haze that's kind of my

3110
02:17:04,519 --> 02:17:08,200
all-time favorites and I have an

3111
02:17:05,959 --> 02:17:10,518
appreciation for Fruity and the gassy

3112
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:14,519
and all these different varieties garlic

3113
02:17:10,519 --> 02:17:16,960
and Funk and but I really would choose

3114
02:17:14,519 --> 02:17:19,519
the one that was grown the best every

3115
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:21,358
time there's no flavor profile that

3116
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:23,719
would have me choose something that was

3117
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:26,519
a little bit below something else just

3118
02:17:23,718 --> 02:17:31,558
because I preferred that flavor profile

3119
02:17:26,519 --> 02:17:33,960
that's how much my um focus is on the

3120
02:17:31,558 --> 02:17:37,000
caliber the Purity and the quality

3121
02:17:33,959 --> 02:17:43,518
that's my focus has always been on

3122
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:45,519
effects so to be up clear High Speedy I

3123
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:48,920
don't really like couch lock weed

3124
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:51,719
although I understand how medical users

3125
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:54,439
do like couch lock because they they're

3126
02:17:51,718 --> 02:17:54,438
in physical

3127
02:17:58,280 --> 02:18:03,000
pain I like I like cash back and it

3128
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:05,678
ain't because of physical pain I like

3129
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,679
the full

3130
02:18:06,359 --> 02:18:16,479
effect got it full effect so

3131
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:19,599
uh speaking of very efficacious cultiv

3132
02:18:16,478 --> 02:18:25,000
ours um congrats to Mendo Dope on the

3133
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:27,478
recent Emerald cup win yes thank you my

3134
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,599
brother yeah that Hees is a it's very

3135
02:18:27,478 --> 02:18:31,199
special strain we've been liking for

3136
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:32,558
quite a few years now we've been growing

3137
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:33,960
more and more of it throughout the last

3138
02:18:32,558 --> 02:18:36,239
couple years that's since we found it

3139
02:18:33,959 --> 02:18:37,518
from the from the re Edge you know I

3140
02:18:36,239 --> 02:18:38,840
don't if did you see the story from the

3141
02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:40,760
Emerald Triangle thing they did a little

3142
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:43,920
cartoon even about the little story was

3143
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:45,719
pretty funny um but yeah it was found at

3144
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,799
our homies garden and that was already

3145
02:18:45,718 --> 02:18:50,079
in full flower um a homie passed away

3146
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:52,478
that year so we were going to his garden

3147
02:18:50,079 --> 02:18:54,920
to go check out what his plants look

3148
02:18:52,478 --> 02:18:56,119
like to help his dad kind of put strains

3149
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:58,079
together because he had a lot of seed

3150
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,920
start stuff so he's trying to pack

3151
02:18:58,079 --> 02:19:01,959
things to sell and what can mix together

3152
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:04,359
and we found that one right there and

3153
02:19:01,959 --> 02:19:07,438
cut the Clone that's already you know

3154
02:19:04,359 --> 02:19:09,079
deep October so full eight nine weeks on

3155
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:10,679
the flower of it and then slowly brought

3156
02:19:09,079 --> 02:19:13,359
it back the next year had a couple

3157
02:19:10,679 --> 02:19:15,239
clones tested it indoors next year was

3158
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:16,479
perfect to do an outside test it did

3159
02:19:15,239 --> 02:19:19,558
pretty good and then we did a big

3160
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:21,840
outside garden of it at the at the farm

3161
02:19:19,558 --> 02:19:24,358
we had with Cody and

3162
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:26,239
um so yeah that one is it's just like a

3163
02:19:24,359 --> 02:19:27,679
straight old school gas but there's a

3164
02:19:26,239 --> 02:19:30,879
little something hiding in there too

3165
02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:33,478
it's like a 90 I'd say like

3166
02:19:30,879 --> 02:19:35,398
95% old school gas and it's a little bit

3167
02:19:33,478 --> 02:19:38,119
of every gas it's hard to even say which

3168
02:19:35,398 --> 02:19:41,358
OG it is it's like a it's just like a

3169
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:43,599
really good OG of a little combo from

3170
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:45,679
like the best ogs that we used to have

3171
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:47,398
like not even ones that we ever grew cuz

3172
02:19:45,679 --> 02:19:49,159
we never really got a really good OG to

3173
02:19:47,398 --> 02:19:51,000
grow before we always would get cuts

3174
02:19:49,159 --> 02:19:52,318
from clubs and get us something that not

3175
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:54,920
what we wanted we're always trying to

3176
02:19:52,318 --> 02:19:56,279
find these couple different ogs that we

3177
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:57,920
would get eights of you know and be like

3178
02:19:56,280 --> 02:20:00,120
man if we could get this cut but we

3179
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:01,719
never could find it so then after

3180
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:03,680
finding this one it's like the gassiest

3181
02:20:01,719 --> 02:20:05,799
one we've ever had our favorite like

3182
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:10,398
just Kush strain in our mother room and

3183
02:20:05,799 --> 02:20:12,719
our like selection and um it's uh super

3184
02:20:10,398 --> 02:20:15,639
super nice strain just super cool and uh

3185
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:17,119
grows really badass and it's really cool

3186
02:20:15,639 --> 02:20:19,159
that the judges all liked it it was

3187
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:22,200
funny too because like you know gas has

3188
02:20:19,159 --> 02:20:24,079
been uh a little bit on the back burner

3189
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:25,720
now after all the Exotic candy gas

3190
02:20:24,079 --> 02:20:28,000
things that people are on and all of the

3191
02:20:25,719 --> 02:20:30,358
new hype stuff so for it to be like

3192
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,478
catch the judges for like a just nice

3193
02:20:30,359 --> 02:20:36,000
pretty close to all traditional OG kind

3194
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:38,559
of profile was really cool to see

3195
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,840
how people like uh Emeral cut people are

3196
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:41,039
a little different too than other people

3197
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,799
too they're more old school and they're

3198
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:44,280
very smart and they're not like a normal

3199
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:47,438
other cups you know that they could be

3200
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:49,159
tricked by the hype stuff so it's cool

3201
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:50,920
to see like people that really took the

3202
02:20:49,159 --> 02:20:54,200
time to like it liked it like as much as

3203
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:54,200
we like it so it's really cool to

3204
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,760
see cool story

3205
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:05,959
too Strain To Us yeah [ __ ] came together

3206
02:21:04,478 --> 02:21:07,199
yeah it's like well we're gonna have to

3207
02:21:05,959 --> 02:21:10,279
keep this forever you know like this

3208
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:12,399
isn't we we we keep strains probably for

3209
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:13,920
like we've had our we had a vanilla cush

3210
02:21:12,398 --> 02:21:16,519
strain we had for like 11 years as

3211
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:18,840
longest we ever had one strain for and

3212
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:20,840
then that strain kind of got maybe sick

3213
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:22,680
or sad or H Latin virus or something it

3214
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:25,239
stopped gr on to grow really vigorously

3215
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:27,000
and we just got rid of it but besides

3216
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:28,959
that one strain we kind of keep strains

3217
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,120
for a few years maybe three four years

3218
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:32,478
and then we'll we'll move on again and

3219
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:34,560
kind of switch things the mother room

3220
02:21:32,478 --> 02:21:36,760
around and but that he strain in general

3221
02:21:34,559 --> 02:21:38,840
will be like a forever strain for us and

3222
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:40,559
we've been Crossing strains to that now

3223
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:43,239
for a little bit so we have all kinds of

3224
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:46,079
strains with that lineage from it so

3225
02:21:43,239 --> 02:21:47,639
it's really cool to see new stuff that's

3226
02:21:46,079 --> 02:21:51,359
back dates to that

3227
02:21:47,639 --> 02:21:53,639
also you keep your clones clean

3228
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:56,520
you can keep I've had them for more than

3229
02:21:53,639 --> 02:22:00,318
30 years and they were just as good as

3230
02:21:56,520 --> 02:22:02,800
they were 30 years ago but I used

3231
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:06,279
Extreme Measures to keep them clean

3232
02:22:02,799 --> 02:22:11,239
including not taking any new plant into

3233
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:15,000
my facilities until I had uh field Tri

3234
02:22:11,239 --> 02:22:16,359
trialed it for uh 6 months or so yeah I

3235
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,920
bet that's probably how you have to be

3236
02:22:16,359 --> 02:22:20,120
real serious these days with everything

3237
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:21,359
going on and all the strains that have

3238
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,439
you know all the strains you can get

3239
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:25,040
that are disease ridden and whatever and

3240
02:22:23,439 --> 02:22:26,600
really for our mother room our whole

3241
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:28,600
life since we we started keeping that

3242
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:32,600
vanilla strain we kept in like

3243
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:34,079
200 in in 12 or 2011 when we first kept

3244
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:37,200
like mothers and that was the first

3245
02:22:34,079 --> 02:22:38,959
clone we kept as like a forever like all

3246
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:41,200
year long we keep it and all the next

3247
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:42,959
year we have it and we have it and and

3248
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:44,800
our mother sex like a lot of our mother

3249
02:22:42,959 --> 02:22:46,318
rooms we would just let them barely live

3250
02:22:44,799 --> 02:22:50,279
like sometimes during the winter they're

3251
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:51,799
just like very dormant like in uh um

3252
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:52,760
like I forget what the word would be

3253
02:22:51,799 --> 02:22:54,438
right now but it's like they're like in

3254
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:56,000
limbo they're not really happy they're

3255
02:22:54,439 --> 02:22:58,398
not vigorous because we don't have a lot

3256
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:00,639
of space to have like vigorous plants

3257
02:22:58,398 --> 02:23:02,840
the whole all winter and all year and

3258
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:04,519
the amount of moms that we do have so we

3259
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:06,880
for a long time we keep our moms in the

3260
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:08,479
winter time really slow growing kind of

3261
02:23:06,879 --> 02:23:15,159
sad and then we'll boost them back up in

3262
02:23:08,478 --> 02:23:17,679
the in the season I had a a cold grow

3263
02:23:15,159 --> 02:23:19,000
refrigerator so I kept the temperature

3264
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:20,960
at 4 or

3265
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,680
5° and uh

3266
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:27,599
you hardly had to water it at all and it

3267
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:29,720
had grow lights fluoresence inside the

3268
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:31,600
refrigerator that's just super smart

3269
02:23:29,719 --> 02:23:34,000
yeah that's it seems like keeping them

3270
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:37,200
in that dormant slow motion grow is not

3271
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,040
a problem to slow down things and be

3272
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:40,560
able to

3273
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:42,520
maintain U but with us like we that

3274
02:23:40,559 --> 02:23:44,039
vanilla mon we almost lost it like 10

3275
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:45,680
different times throughout the 11 years

3276
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:47,560
we had it like it just it got it would

3277
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:49,559
get sick and then when russets hit that

3278
02:23:47,559 --> 02:23:51,239
year russets hit hard out here it got

3279
02:23:49,559 --> 02:23:53,478
russets bad and we we barely kept it

3280
02:23:51,239 --> 02:23:55,719
alive that year and then it's like that

3281
02:23:53,478 --> 02:23:57,199
thing went through hell and so it's like

3282
02:23:55,719 --> 02:23:59,000
not far-fetched that it would catch

3283
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:01,240
something and it probably maybe someone

3284
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:03,239
could have cleaned it we liked it a lot

3285
02:24:01,239 --> 02:24:04,439
but we also you know it was cool to have

3286
02:24:03,239 --> 02:24:09,600
it for as long as we had it we didn't

3287
02:24:04,439 --> 02:24:14,279
need to to force force at one time I had

3288
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:17,439
360 mothers and a few fathers damn and

3289
02:24:14,279 --> 02:24:21,040
uh yeah my employees sort of rebelled

3290
02:24:17,439 --> 02:24:23,639
against me so I knocked it down to 120

3291
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:25,840
so I've had happen a lot I've had people

3292
02:24:23,639 --> 02:24:28,599
rebel against my collections you know

3293
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:31,639
like I've had I've had whole years where

3294
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:33,840
we've you know cloned you know 750

3295
02:24:31,639 --> 02:24:35,519
plants and went through multiple rounds

3296
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:37,120
of testing only for someone in the

3297
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:40,079
winter to let stuff go without

3298
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:42,040
permission because it's challenging to

3299
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:43,680
manage with a you know when you're

3300
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:45,319
limited with space or electricity

3301
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:48,600
especially growing off great a lot in

3302
02:24:45,318 --> 02:24:49,959
Northern California um so I feel that I

3303
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:51,760
for what's funny is as long as I've been

3304
02:24:49,959 --> 02:24:53,839
growing weed there's such a small

3305
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:56,318
percentage of time that I had actual

3306
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:58,799
control of a year round mom room where

3307
02:24:56,318 --> 02:25:00,840
someone wouldn't make mistakes you know

3308
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:02,278
and now I you know even in in Humble you

3309
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:04,600
know we play musical Grow rooms in the

3310
02:25:02,279 --> 02:25:07,000
winter we use our cloning room which is

3311
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:08,800
you know small we have to you know you

3312
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,398
know burn fuel which is very wasteful to

3313
02:25:08,799 --> 02:25:12,079
do that then we fire up the greenhouse

3314
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:14,959
and put a bunch of propane in at a

3315
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:16,840
certain point but it's it's a year round

3316
02:25:14,959 --> 02:25:19,278
evolving thing that's a challenge and

3317
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:21,799
and not efficient with with cost or

3318
02:25:19,279 --> 02:25:23,640
anything uh when you're off- grid and

3319
02:25:21,799 --> 02:25:25,679
super Rural and then here on the East

3320
02:25:23,639 --> 02:25:27,039
Coast we Bank all my stuff so I have my

3321
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:28,960
stuff banked here and have a pretty

3322
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:30,800
decent collection and some of the the

3323
02:25:28,959 --> 02:25:33,358
males that we use so we can recreate not

3324
02:25:30,799 --> 02:25:35,920
have to re reselect and then the goal

3325
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:38,439
for years is I've been trying to get my

3326
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:39,879
you know my more special stuff banked

3327
02:25:38,439 --> 02:25:42,239
with tissue culture but I haven't

3328
02:25:39,879 --> 02:25:45,039
trusted any of the tissue culture people

3329
02:25:42,239 --> 02:25:47,000
that exist that are offering Services um

3330
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:49,040
and I'm about to do some initiations and

3331
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:51,559
then you know keeping them clean and

3332
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:53,520
making sure that you have you know lab

3333
02:25:51,559 --> 02:25:55,959
testing that they pathogen and and vroid

3334
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:58,120
free it's it's a big Challenge and a a

3335
02:25:55,959 --> 02:25:59,879
big challenge in in cultivating that

3336
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:04,439
didn't you know exist when you go back

3337
02:25:59,879 --> 02:26:10,599
15 years ago um that's absolutely true

3338
02:26:04,439 --> 02:26:14,920
I've I've found 29 different viruses in

3339
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:17,439
cannabis damn

3340
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:19,760
D yeah whatever that Vanilla Kush had it

3341
02:26:17,439 --> 02:26:22,479
would like the Vanilla Kush was always a

3342
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:23,840
[ __ ] to root too it was so hard to root

3343
02:26:22,478 --> 02:26:25,879
it take longer than any strain we've

3344
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:27,760
ever had our whole life they'll always

3345
02:26:25,879 --> 02:26:30,719
be sad by the time they rooted so that

3346
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:32,398
was a problem but that that was like we

3347
02:26:30,719 --> 02:26:34,199
would get them to root though and then

3348
02:26:32,398 --> 02:26:35,680
they would grow kind of good and veg and

3349
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:37,200
we put them outside they look happy but

3350
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:39,520
as soon as they start to get a little

3351
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:40,960
bit of a teen mode and a little bit

3352
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:42,920
where everything's starting to rip that

3353
02:26:40,959 --> 02:26:45,000
would just be dormant and slow down and

3354
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:46,840
then as it went to flower it started

3355
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,840
just dying like yellowing out and not

3356
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:51,559
putting out the smallest buds ever it

3357
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:53,239
was like a tricks for like two or three

3358
02:26:51,559 --> 02:26:54,879
years we thought we could like save it

3359
02:26:53,239 --> 02:26:56,520
and the mom would be good and we'd get

3360
02:26:54,879 --> 02:26:58,438
clones and they'd start to look good and

3361
02:26:56,520 --> 02:27:00,760
we' be like nice it's maybe it's back

3362
02:26:58,439 --> 02:27:02,760
but then no it just go to [ __ ] right by

3363
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:05,439
the time it really need to start doing

3364
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:07,279
something that's why I always try to

3365
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:09,398
give stuff to other people I trust you

3366
02:27:07,279 --> 02:27:10,920
know it's hard to trust people but every

3367
02:27:09,398 --> 02:27:12,239
year before the winter I'd always try to

3368
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:14,279
get the most important things to at

3369
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:16,239
least a few people so hopefully if you

3370
02:27:14,279 --> 02:27:18,040
know if everybody made a mistake one

3371
02:27:16,239 --> 02:27:21,039
person would still have it you know very

3372
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:22,439
smart yeah very very have our our heades

3373
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:24,399
now we have a couple people with the

3374
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:27,079
heades cuz we cannot lose that [ __ ]

3375
02:27:24,398 --> 02:27:29,478
strain so we had to make sure yeah it's

3376
02:27:27,079 --> 02:27:31,159
not on just one person I mean even when

3377
02:27:29,478 --> 02:27:33,159
the fires came through you know a couple

3378
02:27:31,159 --> 02:27:36,079
years ago those three years of fires

3379
02:27:33,159 --> 02:27:37,359
straight that was also a crazy hurdle

3380
02:27:36,079 --> 02:27:40,200
and pain in the ass to keep mothers

3381
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:42,159
going it was like uh very dangerous you

3382
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:44,760
know just having one of a kind plant one

3383
02:27:42,159 --> 02:27:46,239
unicorn in the world we could have it

3384
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:48,239
somewhere like like sometimes we have

3385
02:27:46,239 --> 02:27:49,760
our homie now in Minnesota have some

3386
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:50,920
cuts for like Minnesota nice hold some

3387
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:53,559
things for us we're going to start

3388
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:54,719
having him have like couple various rins

3389
02:27:53,559 --> 02:27:58,000
just like we the [ __ ] away from

3390
02:27:54,719 --> 02:28:01,398
California's fires first off fires would

3391
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:03,600
be probably the one of the top 10 ways

3392
02:28:01,398 --> 02:28:09,000
you could lose your [ __ ] [ __ ]

3393
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:13,920
nowadays I I would grow a one or two big

3394
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:18,239
plants in the ground that would be 15 ft

3395
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:22,960
tall and I would grow uh maybe five of

3396
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:25,840
them in uh like a 5 10 L Pot and then I

3397
02:28:22,959 --> 02:28:30,159
would grow a couple of them in a

3398
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:34,439
refrigerated uh uh cold refrigerator

3399
02:28:30,159 --> 02:28:37,200
with grow lights and uh I I never lost

3400
02:28:34,439 --> 02:28:40,720
one that's that's

3401
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:43,479
badass the cold that was over a 30y year

3402
02:28:40,719 --> 02:28:46,478
period that's like with our mothers we

3403
02:28:43,478 --> 02:28:48,840
have we have a big like a 60x 4 like

3404
02:28:46,478 --> 02:28:50,398
metal shop for the last like quite a few

3405
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:52,079
years now where our Grandpa's house was

3406
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:54,318
that we took over and that's like where

3407
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:56,120
our moms are and our studio is and we

3408
02:28:54,318 --> 02:28:57,559
have our little Hut for like our our

3409
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:59,319
moms we don't have we only have we keep

3410
02:28:57,559 --> 02:29:00,799
we keep we've always we never gone hard

3411
02:28:59,318 --> 02:29:02,079
like you guys we keep like 31 like

3412
02:29:00,799 --> 02:29:03,840
masking Robins has always been like

3413
02:29:02,079 --> 02:29:06,318
something we like 31 Flavors like if we

3414
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:08,318
have 31's I don't know how why we would

3415
02:29:06,318 --> 02:29:10,639
need more I know it's so [ __ ] easy to

3416
02:29:08,318 --> 02:29:12,879
hoard and keep everything but we would

3417
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:15,000
try to once we get past that we try to

3418
02:29:12,879 --> 02:29:17,039
weed it back down so we can fit like our

3419
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:20,200
moms in the dormant state in our little

3420
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:22,279
Hut upstairs in the in the Machine Shop

3421
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:24,640
so it's [ __ ] freezing in there too

3422
02:29:22,279 --> 02:29:26,760
like like your fridge technique and that

3423
02:29:24,639 --> 02:29:29,840
is how like it's been helpful for us to

3424
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:31,680
not have just full-time vigorous plants

3425
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:33,760
all year round constantly transplanting

3426
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:35,639
and keeping them fed and happy and

3427
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:38,120
cutting them cutting them cutting

3428
02:29:35,639 --> 02:29:39,439
them and we've always done lot smaller

3429
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:40,920
Gardens Too than a lot of people

3430
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:41,639
throughout the years once we got raided

3431
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:45,000
in

3432
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:46,719
2013 or whatever we uh we just started

3433
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,359
filming our personal Gardens you know

3434
02:29:46,719 --> 02:29:51,278
like everyone's known like our our

3435
02:29:48,359 --> 02:29:53,600
YouTube stuff is like it's all like six

3436
02:29:51,279 --> 02:29:55,319
plants and 12 plants like we got rated

3437
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,880
with the 25 because they were too big

3438
02:29:55,318 --> 02:29:58,920
and then instead of just going in the

3439
02:29:56,879 --> 02:30:00,119
hills and teaming up with people are

3440
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:01,680
going and getting a property where we

3441
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:03,960
were just going to blow it up we were so

3442
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:07,120
focused in music we wanted to do music

3443
02:30:03,959 --> 02:30:08,519
so much not disappear and then then that

3444
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:10,079
kind of made us like get into the and

3445
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:12,000
subcool made us get into filming the

3446
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:13,639
garden at the same time so we're filming

3447
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,760
music stuff filming the garden stuff at

3448
02:30:13,639 --> 02:30:17,239
the same time but growing so much

3449
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:18,520
smaller Gardens than so many people are

3450
02:30:17,239 --> 02:30:20,799
doing it's only the last couple years

3451
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:24,200
we've been doing these bigger Gardens

3452
02:30:20,799 --> 02:30:27,199
where thousands of plants shout out to

3453
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:29,760

weed oh yeah for sure he game he laced

3465
02:31:00,760 --> 02:31:04,159
our game up for sure a lot with the

3466
02:31:02,439 --> 02:31:07,760
indoor stuff and with hash and

3467
02:31:04,159 --> 02:31:09,439
solventless and clean clean weed in

3468
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,200
general just like watering with just

3469
02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:14,279
water and super soil and not liquid

3470
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:15,880
feeding every single watering and all

3471
02:31:14,279 --> 02:31:17,359
the stuff we were told like tricked by

3472
02:31:15,879 --> 02:31:20,199
in the beginning of the

3473
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:22,720
times yeah and he lost his place in a

3474
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:25,520
fire wasn't that right remember yeah

3475
02:31:22,719 --> 02:31:27,039
yeah that fire was like the 2017 fire I

3476
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:29,439
think or something that's right he was

3477
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:32,560
on hash church I think the following

3478
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:35,000
week yeah tell that he got out with

3479
02:31:32,559 --> 02:31:37,079
nothing more than his backpack a

3480
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:40,000
baseball hat and like a small little

3481
02:31:37,079 --> 02:31:42,200
bong and a small statue weed well I was

3482
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:43,959
talking to him while it was happening

3483
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:46,560
and he was trying to get back in his

3484
02:31:43,959 --> 02:31:48,679
truck to like this to to get back to his

3485
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:51,039
property uh and that's why I invited him

3486
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:54,318
on to Hash Church the next week that was

3487
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:57,279
uh yeah that was shocking man fire that

3488
02:31:54,318 --> 02:31:59,278
just wiped out Santa Rosa right it wiped

3489
02:31:57,279 --> 02:32:01,079
out like a lion through Santa Rosa like

3490
02:31:59,279 --> 02:32:02,960
it came over the mountain right where

3491
02:32:01,079 --> 02:32:05,039
sub's house was kind of in towards the

3492
02:32:02,959 --> 02:32:06,398
start of that fire and it he was way up

3493
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:08,800
in the mountains compared to the down

3494
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:11,000
low Santa Rosa area it turned over the

3495
02:32:08,799 --> 02:32:14,278
hill wiped his house down almost like a

3496
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:16,439
[ __ ] fire waterfall or a river or

3497
02:32:14,279 --> 02:32:18,079
some [ __ ] straight line through his

3498
02:32:16,439 --> 02:32:19,639
property through the people down him

3499
02:32:18,079 --> 02:32:22,719
straight to the bottom of where Santa

3500
02:32:19,639 --> 02:32:25,000
Rose the town is took out like a a big

3501
02:32:22,719 --> 02:32:27,879
hotel and a couple other trailer parks

3502
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:30,120
crossed the [ __ ] freeway went through

3503
02:32:27,879 --> 02:32:32,119
skinny neighborhood down to this block

3504
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:35,000
at the end that took out the entire

3505
02:32:32,120 --> 02:32:39,120
[ __ ] residential block that was

3506
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:40,439
like it was a crazy crazy fire for sure

3507
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:42,079
it was one of the biggest ones that's

3508
02:32:40,439 --> 02:32:45,398
ever been out here that burnt sub's

3509
02:32:42,079 --> 02:32:46,639
house down that [ __ ] was was like uh

3510
02:32:45,398 --> 02:32:49,278
probably like very similar to what's

3511
02:32:46,639 --> 02:32:50,840
going on in La like full tornadoes of

3512
02:32:49,279 --> 02:32:52,960
Fire full

3513
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:54,680
like when sub would just explained it he

3514
02:32:52,959 --> 02:32:56,599
said it came over the hill and exploded

3515
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:58,159
trees on the way down like when it hit

3516
02:32:56,600 --> 02:33:00,399
the fire would come like a waterfall he

3517
02:32:58,159 --> 02:33:02,760
said and then as it hit the next tree

3518
02:33:00,398 --> 02:33:05,039
the tree would explode and go down to

3519
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:06,800
the next one it wasn't like the fire was

3520
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:09,000
a normal fire you know it's it's just

3521
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:11,719
exploding through the forest just

3522
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:12,879
ripping down the hill like downhill too

3523
02:33:11,719 --> 02:33:14,760
you know it's not wasn't even going

3524
02:33:12,879 --> 02:33:17,119
uphill it's just going

3525
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:19,040
downhill that's [ __ ] I was in Santa

3526
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:22,439
Rosa when that one went down and that

3527
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:24,600
was a crazy experience you know because

3528
02:33:22,439 --> 02:33:25,920
I I used to stay at those hotels on the

3529
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:28,439
The Fountain Grove when I used to come

3530
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:30,960
into town business those were like my

3531
02:33:28,439 --> 02:33:33,000
spots and I had actually just moved to

3532
02:33:30,959 --> 02:33:35,639
Santa Rosa and rented a house and it was

3533
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:37,879
my first night in the rental house and

3534
02:33:35,639 --> 02:33:40,159
no nobody knew that I was there and I'd

3535
02:33:37,879 --> 02:33:42,358
moved for a business deal or whatever

3536
02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:43,920
and um I was about to move my my my

3537
02:33:42,359 --> 02:33:45,680
family out they were going to be there

3538
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:47,639
like you know whatever but I woke up at

3539
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:49,439
6:00 in the morning I went to bed and I

3540
02:33:47,639 --> 02:33:51,840
could smell smoke and I could hear what

3541
02:33:49,439 --> 02:33:53,520
I thought was gunshots and I was like

3542
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:55,760
who'd be stupid enough to burn a wood

3543
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:57,960
stove right now you know with the with

3544
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:59,439
the wind and and how dry it was when I

3545
02:33:57,959 --> 02:34:00,879
woke up in the morning I found out that

3546
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:02,680
what I thought was gunshots was the

3547
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:04,679
propane tanks exploding in people's

3548
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:07,880
homes like a mile and a half down the

3549
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:09,279
road from where I was so I I went to go

3550
02:34:07,879 --> 02:34:11,039
check on my other friend's house and set

3551
02:34:09,279 --> 02:34:13,840
up sprinklers on people's houses in

3552
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:15,720
downtown Santa Rosa and yeah I that I

3553
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:18,719
mean the ones in La I think are a lot

3554
02:34:15,719 --> 02:34:20,398
even crazier and worse but yeah yeah

3555
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:22,760
honestly that's that's of the reasons I

3556
02:34:20,398 --> 02:34:24,879
chose to leave California part-time was

3557
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:26,680
like you know full-time was because my

3558
02:34:24,879 --> 02:34:28,438
kids kept being exposed to so much smoke

3559
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:30,800
from so many fires so many weeks out of

3560
02:34:28,439 --> 02:34:34,000
the year and it was so intense you know

3561
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:36,039
what I'm saying and um it's it's really

3562
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,079
unfortunate difficult situation for

3563
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:40,560
people out there yeah it's really bad it

3564
02:34:38,079 --> 02:34:43,079
sucks so bad because sub cool like we we

3565
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:45,278
met sub through the Cannabis cups like

3566
02:34:43,079 --> 02:34:47,840
early on and right when he was moving

3567
02:34:45,279 --> 02:34:50,319
out of Oregon and he was finding a place

3568
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:52,200
in California then he found the Santa

3569
02:34:50,318 --> 02:34:54,199
Rosa house and he was so close to us it

3570
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:56,560
was it was right as we were starting to

3571
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:58,439
become like super fans of his when we

3572
02:34:56,559 --> 02:35:00,559
met him and he moved closer to us then

3573
02:34:58,439 --> 02:35:02,079
we just clicked and he was able to drive

3574
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:04,600
to our house and we could drive to his

3575
02:35:02,079 --> 02:35:06,920
house anytime and his house was super

3576
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:08,399
sick and he was just starting to grow

3577
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:10,200
outdoor like it was like his second or

3578
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:12,278
third year doing like the man dope style

3579
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:13,439
outdoor at his house and it was so

3580
02:35:12,279 --> 02:35:15,159
[ __ ] cool and as soon as that

3581
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:17,520
happened it all went to [ __ ] like he was

3582
02:35:15,159 --> 02:35:19,039
already going through so much [ __ ] with

3583
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:21,800
his health and with Jill and stuff and

3584
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:24,359
then that just [ __ ] his rest of his

3585
02:35:21,799 --> 02:35:27,438
life up that fire [ __ ] it up so bad

3586
02:35:24,359 --> 02:35:29,359
it's so sad how many people have to go

3587
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:31,079
through same some things similar to like

3588
02:35:29,359 --> 02:35:33,520
how sub did but sub had so much on top

3589
02:35:31,079 --> 02:35:36,359
of his plate already at the fire just

3590
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:38,800
[ __ ] changed his life for the like

3591
02:35:36,359 --> 02:35:39,960
fully he was just it was so sad because

3592
02:35:38,799 --> 02:35:41,239
we just didn't get see him no more it

3593
02:35:39,959 --> 02:35:42,438
was only a couple weeks he was in Cali

3594
02:35:41,239 --> 02:35:46,239
after that and then it was gone and we

3595
02:35:42,439 --> 02:35:48,079
saw him in in Arizona once but it was uh

3596
02:35:46,239 --> 02:35:51,279
super shitty his house was really cool

3597
02:35:48,079 --> 02:35:52,920
and I mean just the seats he had his his

3598
02:35:51,279 --> 02:35:54,680
where the seed Vault was like on his

3599
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:57,398
bottom uh downstairs of his house or

3600
02:35:54,680 --> 02:35:59,040
whatever like all that [ __ ] [ __ ] gone

3601
02:35:57,398 --> 02:36:01,760
we went up there to his house like a

3602
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:03,880
month or so after the fires and walked

3603
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:05,800
around and looked at it and we grabbed

3604
02:36:03,879 --> 02:36:07,759
one of the stocks that was left like it

3605
02:36:05,799 --> 02:36:09,639
all burnt one of his trees that he had

3606
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:11,800
there was a nice stock we kept and we

3607
02:36:09,639 --> 02:36:15,239
have it in our in like our house and

3608
02:36:11,799 --> 02:36:19,000
stuff just like for a memory but it's

3609
02:36:15,239 --> 02:36:22,039
[ __ ] so sad dude so sad but sub was

3610
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:25,120
he was yeah he had fire so long ago so

3611
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:26,359
many fenos could have been kept as one

3612
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:27,800
name it whatever the [ __ ] you want to

3613
02:36:26,359 --> 02:36:31,040
name he probably had a Lemon Cherry

3614
02:36:27,799 --> 02:36:33,039
gelato similar variety and his [ __ ]

3615
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:34,760
pheno mixes and [ __ ] he made you know

3616
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:36,840
what I mean he had so many cool strains

3617
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:38,600
so with the people he was working with

3618
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:41,279
too like in his circle of who was making

3619
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:44,159
stuff with him and and I'll say this

3620
02:36:41,279 --> 02:36:47,439
about sub like his Cult of

3621
02:36:44,159 --> 02:36:49,639
ours obviously who grew it was fairly

3622
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:52,479
important but it seemed like it was they

3623
02:36:49,639 --> 02:36:54,478
were somewhat more generous for some

3624
02:36:52,478 --> 02:36:57,398
people that maybe if you were had never

3625
02:36:54,478 --> 02:36:59,239
grown full melt resin before you might

3626
02:36:57,398 --> 02:37:02,039
have the best chance doing it with some

3627
02:36:59,239 --> 02:37:05,559
of his cultivars they were just like

3628
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:08,720
everyone I ever tried was just slamming

3629
02:37:05,559 --> 02:37:11,039
like so good so tasty so strong he

3630
02:37:08,719 --> 02:37:13,079
always just had great hash and I listen

3631
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:14,880
I go back with I don't even know what

3632
02:37:13,079 --> 02:37:18,318
year it would have been whatever year he

3633
02:37:14,879 --> 02:37:20,559
met Jill cuz I was on like like chat

3634
02:37:18,318 --> 02:37:24,478
rooms in the

3635
02:37:20,559 --> 02:37:26,439
90s with her Jill and this guy Jack they

3636
02:37:24,478 --> 02:37:28,318

3637
02:37:26,439 --> 02:37:30,079

02:37:30,079 --> 02:37:35,239
to her soon after Jack disappeared and

3640
02:37:33,398 --> 02:37:38,199
then sub popped in and that's how I met

3641
02:37:35,239 --> 02:37:41,279
sub was through Jill so really I I feel

3642
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:43,479
like I met him before he made any I feel

3643

3644
02:37:43,478 --> 02:37:48,398

Amplified farms and um we've gone to

3719
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:56,920
some shows uh together and I know one of

3720
02:40:54,639 --> 02:41:00,318
my favorite Cult of ours from Amplified

3721
02:40:56,920 --> 02:41:02,960
is called Cypress OG and I was wondering

3722
02:41:00,318 --> 02:41:07,039
perhaps you could share the the story of

3723
02:41:02,959 --> 02:41:09,519
how yall got that um we that was just

3724
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:11,800
basically gifted around our circle of

3725
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:14,479
friends that were grew and it went by a

3726
02:41:11,799 --> 02:41:16,599
few different names over the years and

3727
02:41:14,478 --> 02:41:19,039
supposedly uh our one buddy that got it

3728
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:22,040
first got it from I think DJ mugs or

3729
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:24,080
something so when we wanted to like name

3730
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:26,000
it for the brand we just kind of called

3731
02:41:24,079 --> 02:41:28,359
it Cypress OG just to give a nod to

3732
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:30,639
those guys but uh it's one of my

3733
02:41:28,359 --> 02:41:33,680
favorite Cuts still to this day um just

3734
02:41:30,639 --> 02:41:35,680
hits every time and um it's kind of like

3735
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:37,639
listening to you guys earlier about like

3736
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:39,398
keeping moms alive for a long time and

3737
02:41:37,639 --> 02:41:41,039
that was the one that the group of

3738
02:41:39,398 --> 02:41:44,318
friends was always making sure somebody

3739
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:46,640
had alive so um yeah I was uh people

3740
02:41:44,318 --> 02:41:48,559
called it the Tahoe G for a while and I

3741
02:41:46,639 --> 02:41:51,199
think it went under a few different

3742
02:41:48,559 --> 02:41:53,760
names over the years but um yeah great

3743
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:55,760
great strain just great effect probably

3744
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:58,559
still my favorite thing we

3745
02:41:55,760 --> 02:42:02,040
grow is that also known as that Ricky's

3746
02:41:58,559 --> 02:42:03,519
Brothers cush or whatever I'm not sure I

3747
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:05,640
I mean I'm sure it's known as a few

3748
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:09,000
things but I I I can't speak to that I

3749
02:42:05,639 --> 02:42:09,840
don't know uh know about that but um you

3750
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:12,159

3751
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:14,880
grows it gets big you know when it's

3752
02:42:12,159 --> 02:42:17,279
healthy it does really well but um yeah

3753
02:42:14,879 --> 02:42:20,398

3754
02:42:17,279 --> 02:42:23,880

3803
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:15,600
day it was just one of those holy [ __ ]

3804
02:44:12,799 --> 02:44:18,000
that's not really that's weed can't

3805
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:20,439

cuts and they went it was creepy man

3829
02:45:17,079 --> 02:45:22,439
they went and broke all the moms they

3830
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:24,239
just snapped all their backs and left

3831
02:45:22,439 --> 02:45:25,920
them there like in the apartment like

3832
02:45:24,239 --> 02:45:29,239
walking in a crime scene just like a

3833
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:31,239
bunch of dead plants and only one of all

3834
02:45:29,239 --> 02:45:35,279
the moms was able to

3835
02:45:31,239 --> 02:45:37,359
get reved out of all those dead plants

3836
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:39,439
or dying plants a clone sorry a clone

3837
02:45:37,359 --> 02:45:42,439
that got off of those dying plants and

3838
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:45,318
it wasn't Cypress Hill cut though it was

3839
02:45:42,439 --> 02:45:48,279
not and that bubble gum became the

3840
02:45:45,318 --> 02:45:49,439
parent to all the bubble gum of today

3841
02:45:48,279 --> 02:45:51,040
was what

3842
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:52,639
from that that's what went to Serious

3843
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:55,439
seeds and that's what went to you know

3844
02:45:52,639 --> 02:46:00,278
Saga mother and all that so the real

3845
02:45:55,439 --> 02:46:03,880
Bubblegum the Cypress Hill cut which was

3846
02:46:00,279 --> 02:46:05,560
just [ __ ] insane just insane so and

3847
02:46:03,879 --> 02:46:07,199
it was the only one that was and the one

3848
02:46:05,559 --> 02:46:08,600
that survived was yeah it was bubble gum

3849
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:10,000
and it tastes like bubble gum it was a

3850
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:13,600
good cut it was actually a good like

3851
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:15,079
medium version to get a lot but the real

3852
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:17,279
the Cypress Hill

3853
02:46:15,079 --> 02:46:20,559
cut

3854
02:46:17,279 --> 02:46:22,479
[ __ ] and that's few times I've ever seen

3855
02:46:20,559 --> 02:46:24,959
like uh you know that kind of weird

3856
02:46:22,478 --> 02:46:29,079
jealousy kind of thing where someone was

3857
02:46:24,959 --> 02:46:30,478
like your genetics need to die like and

3858
02:46:29,079 --> 02:46:31,879
then the weird part is like they took

3859
02:46:30,478 --> 02:46:33,599
them and we knew right away it's like

3860
02:46:31,879 --> 02:46:36,000
well you can never use it you can only

3861
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:37,600
breed with it because can't grow it

3862
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:40,920
amram's a small town you can't like

3863
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:43,239
start pulling out bubble gum just like

3864
02:46:40,920 --> 02:46:45,359
where did you get it so such a weird

3865
02:46:43,239 --> 02:46:48,559
like history in the cannabis genetics of

3866
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:51,559
how intense it can be when something new

3867
02:46:48,559 --> 02:46:54,959
pops up and who has it and who can have

3868
02:46:51,559 --> 02:46:59,039
it and who's jealous and who you know

3869
02:46:54,959 --> 02:47:01,839
weird is real ain't it the hate is real

3870
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:03,760
oh yeah it's fear and scarcity man

3871
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:07,120
people start getting insecure with fear

3872
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:12,359
and scarcity they can do some silly

3873
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:12,359
things I uh I prefer love and

3874
02:47:13,719 --> 02:47:20,318
abundance makes me a happier person yeah

3875
02:47:17,279 --> 02:47:22,040
I have a interesting I keep seeing uh DJ

3876
02:47:20,318 --> 02:47:25,680
Morning Glory there hitting his three-

3877
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:27,720
hole Hash Pipe and um I'm reminded of

3878
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:29,720
the time that I met him at Black Oak

3879
02:47:27,719 --> 02:47:32,358
Ranch at an event called the kind bud

3880
02:47:29,719 --> 02:47:34,559
camp out and you know he taught me how

3881
02:47:32,359 --> 02:47:37,279
to use that three hole um does anyone

3882
02:47:34,559 --> 02:47:40,799
have any stories about kind of that

3883
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:44,000
correlation between glass and cannabis

3884
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:46,358
and music and all these events that uh

3885
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:49,239
may have seen each other at I well I I

3886
02:47:46,359 --> 02:47:52,318
got a good story my buddy uh Jamie from

3887
02:47:49,239 --> 02:47:55,439
uh heavy glass bong he's up in in uh

3888
02:47:52,318 --> 02:47:57,760
Oregon now but um a band I was playing

3889
02:47:55,439 --> 02:47:59,840
in in the early 2000s we used to

3890
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:02,200
practice in his uh he had a couple

3891
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:03,559
warehouses in I think Gardina or

3892
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:04,960
something we used to rehearse there

3893
02:48:03,559 --> 02:48:07,959
while there was like a whole crew of

3894
02:48:04,959 --> 02:48:10,278
people uh blowing uh tubes and he had an

3895
02:48:07,959 --> 02:48:12,000
assembly line going and that was right

3896
02:48:10,279 --> 02:48:14,680
when like uh Jerome

3897
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:17,200
Baker um got popped and then all of a

3898
02:48:14,680 --> 02:48:19,720
sudden he was like the biggest biggest

3899
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:22,000
fish in the pond so then I think he he

3900
02:48:19,719 --> 02:48:24,799
got rid of his company but he used to go

3901
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:26,760
on tour with our band and and we never

3902
02:48:24,799 --> 02:48:28,599
had any money but he he would always

3903
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:31,800
just make sure we had a killer time and

3904
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:34,479
was just just an awesome awesome like

3905
02:48:31,799 --> 02:48:38,679
inspirational dude that just lived life

3906
02:48:34,478 --> 02:48:39,799
his own way just uh total Savage and um

3907
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:41,880
yeah it was it was really good I

3908
02:48:39,799 --> 02:48:44,559
remember taking a guitar and burning

3909
02:48:41,879 --> 02:48:46,799
part of it with the uh with the torch

3910
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:49,079
from the uh from the glass making the

3911
02:48:46,799 --> 02:48:52,079
making the tubes and still got a burn

3912
02:48:49,079 --> 02:48:55,000
mark on it but yeah just those times

3913
02:48:52,079 --> 02:48:56,000
were pretty uh pretty awesome just like

3914
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,959
when things were a little more

3915
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:01,279
underground and a little more closeted

3916
02:48:57,959 --> 02:49:03,039
and uh and and just like uh just the way

3917
02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:05,720
he ran his whole operation you'd have a

3918
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:08,640
couple non-descript Vans where he'd do

3919
02:49:05,719 --> 02:49:10,840
his runs to supply his uh you know head

3920
02:49:08,639 --> 02:49:12,398
shops and he'd book some of it around

3921
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:14,318
some of our tours so we'd always have

3922
02:49:12,398 --> 02:49:16,799
someone fun to hang out with at the end

3923
02:49:14,318 --> 02:49:20,719
of the night but yeah that was a that

3924
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:20,719
was pretty pretty cool scene back then

3925
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:24,559
I don't know if anybody knows

3926
02:49:24,639 --> 02:49:29,559
Jamie yeah I'm trying to think if I do

3927
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:31,640
i' I for whatever reason always had a

3928
02:49:29,559 --> 02:49:34,199
very strong connection to the glass

3929
02:49:31,639 --> 02:49:36,199
blowing World from pretty early on I

3930
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:41,319
would say my

3931
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:43,960
first pipe was I I want to say

3932
02:49:41,318 --> 02:49:47,799
94 I think I

3933
02:49:43,959 --> 02:49:50,879
bought a hug grass it was one of snod

3934
02:49:47,799 --> 02:49:53,199
grass's like students I got a little Hue

3935
02:49:50,879 --> 02:49:56,398
grass pipe and I went to Amsterdam that

3936
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:58,600
year or no the next year and I ended up

3937
02:49:56,398 --> 02:50:00,519
selling it because someone apparently

3938
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:04,840
needed it more than I needed it but I

3939
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:07,479
ended up meeting marble Slinger before

3940
02:50:04,840 --> 02:50:09,639
he was marble Slinger uh at that

3941
02:50:07,478 --> 02:50:11,318
Cannabis Cup I it was super weird

3942
02:50:09,639 --> 02:50:12,959
because years later I actually met him

3943
02:50:11,318 --> 02:50:16,079
by picking him up hitchhiking on the way

3944
02:50:12,959 --> 02:50:18,478
to a fish show uh at the Gorge but he

3945
02:50:16,079 --> 02:50:20,639
was living in I'm I'm guessing close to

3946
02:50:18,478 --> 02:50:21,959
where Dan is right now he said he was 30

3947
02:50:20,639 --> 02:50:25,159
minutes from the border if he's on the

3948
02:50:21,959 --> 02:50:26,679
west coast anyway because he was in uh

3949
02:50:25,159 --> 02:50:29,840
uh

3950
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:32,680
Bellingham I'm close to Quebec oh Quebec

3951
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:36,000
okay on the East Coast right awesome um

3952
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:37,800
Vermont right um yeah so these guys all

3953
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:40,120
lived in Bellingham and there was a lot

3954
02:50:37,799 --> 02:50:43,318
of them there was Marcel braa who's this

3955
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:45,880
just incredible glass blower like top of

3956
02:50:43,318 --> 02:50:49,039
his game he was he was like creating and

3957
02:50:45,879 --> 02:50:51,438
building tools to do things things that

3958
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:53,760
no one had done with glass yet so he was

3959
02:50:51,439 --> 02:50:56,920
really going down the R&amp;D hole plus he

3960
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:59,639
was just beyond talented Savant style

3961
02:50:56,920 --> 02:51:02,879
but then there was also you know Slinger

3962
02:50:59,639 --> 02:51:06,398
and and Zach and Pedro Smiley and d and

3963
02:51:02,879 --> 02:51:10,079
Max Poland got a little Max Poland piece

3964
02:51:06,398 --> 02:51:12,119
right here that uh sits on my side here

3965
02:51:10,079 --> 02:51:14,359
Jason Lee was a part of that group so

3966
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:16,600
they had this huge contingency of these

3967
02:51:14,359 --> 02:51:21,000
glass blowers I'll be honest this was

3968
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:23,559
really pre Bubble Man pre-bubble hash so

3969
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:26,079
for me I was just chain smoking joints

3970
02:51:23,559 --> 02:51:28,478
like huge giant joints smoking insane

3971
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:31,760
amounts of them I didn't really smoke

3972
02:51:28,478 --> 02:51:34,679
with pipes these guys [ __ ] put like

3973
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:36,398
took Buds and like smashed them into

3974
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:39,880
their bowl of their pipe and then just

3975
02:51:36,398 --> 02:51:42,639
hit it and I was like I was intrigued so

3976
02:51:39,879 --> 02:51:45,358
as I met them really because I met them

3977
02:51:42,639 --> 02:51:47,199
at 98 at the Gorge and you know within a

3978
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:49,000
year later I was basically going to have

3979
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:51,319
access to Bubble has so by the time I

3980
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:53,159
really befriended them through email and

3981
02:51:51,318 --> 02:51:55,359
whatnot and invited them to come up it

3982
02:51:53,159 --> 02:51:58,639
was 45 minutes for them to come from

3983
02:51:55,359 --> 02:52:00,520
Bellingham right to my deck in Canada

3984
02:51:58,639 --> 02:52:02,159
here and literally that house is two

3985
02:52:00,520 --> 02:52:04,560
doors down for me that we used to have

3986
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:08,879
all those meetings but uh they really

3987
02:52:04,559 --> 02:52:11,478
helped turn me on to the glass world uh

3988
02:52:08,879 --> 02:52:14,000
the the art form of it the the

3989
02:52:11,478 --> 02:52:17,799
awesomeness for flower I missed the boat

3990
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:20,398
but for smoking hash purely like having

3991
02:52:17,799 --> 02:52:22,759
like the stain steel screen with the the

3992
02:52:20,398 --> 02:52:26,199
match or even better like the beline

3993
02:52:22,760 --> 02:52:28,760
wick and just like fading the flame over

3994
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:30,200
the hash and boiling it and even though

3995
02:52:28,760 --> 02:52:31,639
there was no carb cap and it was

3996
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:34,760
probably not the most efficient way to

3997
02:52:31,639 --> 02:52:38,639
do things it was still an

3998
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:40,680
incredible time to be alive and be

3999
02:52:38,639 --> 02:52:43,599
exposed uh to these different things it

4000
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:45,720
was part of my journey surely and so

4001
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:48,840
yeah old full melt

4002
02:52:45,719 --> 02:52:52,840
Bubbles and Jason had a um before Jerome

4003
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:55,238
Baker was Jerome Baker um he had a

4004
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:57,520
little spot right next to Adam's CIA

4005
02:52:55,238 --> 02:53:00,079
spot in Amsterdam where he would blow

4006
02:52:57,520 --> 02:53:01,720
and it was a trip because I'd never seen

4007
02:53:00,079 --> 02:53:03,279
anyone you know i' never seen anyone

4008
02:53:01,719 --> 02:53:04,599
blowing glass before you know other than

4009
02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:06,920
that like a fair making a little

4010
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:08,559
Trinkets and stuff and here's this kid

4011
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:10,719
you know his long-hair young kid and

4012
02:53:08,559 --> 02:53:12,879
he's over there and he's just in this

4013
02:53:10,719 --> 02:53:14,478
old building like in the middle of this

4014
02:53:12,879 --> 02:53:16,959
kind of old Warehouse that looks like

4015
02:53:14,478 --> 02:53:20,238
it's an old like just Old Ship or

4016
02:53:16,959 --> 02:53:21,839
something and me and Rober buffing and

4017
02:53:20,238 --> 02:53:23,238
you know most of the bowls that you'd

4018
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:25,120
get pull bowls you'd get were like

4019
02:53:23,238 --> 02:53:28,760
Graphics pull bowls that were like a

4020
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:31,239
serious deep angle and we're puffing

4021
02:53:28,760 --> 02:53:33,478
bubbling hash you know and we're like

4022
02:53:31,238 --> 02:53:35,000
dude this this just clogs the bowl every

4023
02:53:33,478 --> 02:53:37,519
time and even to put a screen in there

4024
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:40,318
you have to [ __ ] push it in so Jason

4025
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:41,720
was like yeah he's like oh how would you

4026
02:53:40,318 --> 02:53:44,559
what what do you I'm like can you make

4027
02:53:41,719 --> 02:53:46,318
it a little more u-shaped and a little

4028
02:53:44,559 --> 02:53:48,639
flatter and he's like yeah I'll be right

4029
02:53:46,318 --> 02:53:50,680
back and he runs over and he's like

4030
02:53:48,639 --> 02:53:53,278
literally like 20 minutes later he comes

4031
02:53:50,680 --> 02:53:55,880
back and gives us the bowl and we start

4032
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:58,840
puffing it's just like what just

4033
02:53:55,879 --> 02:54:00,920
happened did that just happen right now

4034
02:53:58,840 --> 02:54:04,040
and it's a trip because you know Jason

4035
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:06,879
Harris everyone calls him Jerome Baker

4036
02:54:04,040 --> 02:54:09,000
because jome B his company and for I

4037
02:54:06,879 --> 02:54:11,599
didn't even know for like a couple years

4038
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:13,920
and I used to sell their stuff at a shop

4039
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:16,640
I used to run and I asked him one time I

4040
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:19,000
was like dude why is it Jerome Baker

4041
02:54:16,639 --> 02:54:21,599
he's like dud Garcia

4042
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:24,079
man he's like getting B because it's

4043
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:28,399
like you know so glass and glass and and

4044
02:54:24,079 --> 02:54:30,478
the dead and music are just like like it

4045
02:54:28,398 --> 02:54:33,039
wouldn't have happened it's just that

4046
02:54:30,478 --> 02:54:38,358
was the first glass blowing I also saw

4047
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:40,600
and I I met uh Jay in 95 when that I I

4048
02:54:38,359 --> 02:54:43,600
believe it was 95 that they that he had

4049
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:45,318
that studio and Adam still had the CIA

4050
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:49,120
because I think he closed it soon after

4051
02:54:45,318 --> 02:54:52,079
and then opened the KGB 94 it would have

4052
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:55,000
by 95 I think was open yeah so by I

4053
02:54:52,079 --> 02:54:57,680
think it was just from like mid mid late

4054
02:54:55,000 --> 02:55:00,200
93 all the way through 94 and that would

4055
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:02,000
have been it awesome yeah it was cool

4056
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:03,560
yeah good times can I actually I gotta

4057
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:05,238
roll man but I just because it's the

4058
02:55:03,559 --> 02:55:08,159
music thing I'll give you can I give you

4059
02:55:05,238 --> 02:55:11,039
a quick story on my cannabis music

4060
02:55:08,159 --> 02:55:13,799
relationship please that's what we want

4061
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:15,600
right on um so I grew up you know with a

4062
02:55:13,799 --> 02:55:17,478
lot of musicians around and stuff and

4063
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:19,520
music was always a part of it and

4064
02:55:17,478 --> 02:55:23,000
obviously cannabis is in music so I

4065
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:26,079
actually moved to Amsterdam to do music

4066
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:28,279
um one of my family friends was a guitar

4067
02:55:26,079 --> 02:55:30,600
player for Nina Simone and he lived in

4068
02:55:28,279 --> 02:55:33,200
France and he said like come on out and

4069
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:35,600
I'll Mentor you and you do music you

4070
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:36,800
know learn jazz guitar and I wanted to

4071
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:39,559
take it to the next level I was like

4072
02:55:36,799 --> 02:55:41,639
yeah cool man I I basically came out

4073
02:55:39,559 --> 02:55:42,920
there got a one-way ticket and partied

4074
02:55:41,639 --> 02:55:45,278
in Amsterdam for a few months and

4075
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:47,920
hitchhiked to France and like some dumb

4076
02:55:45,279 --> 02:55:50,640
kid with like a big bag of hash and a

4077
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:53,238
guitar in a backpack I realized that my

4078
02:55:50,639 --> 02:55:55,398
mentor had moved back to the US like

4079
02:55:53,238 --> 02:55:57,159
four weeks earlier because we were

4080
02:55:55,398 --> 02:56:00,920
communicating on like postcards and

4081
02:55:57,159 --> 02:56:03,439
[ __ ] payones and [ __ ] right and I

4082
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:07,000
literally stranded in Paris with no

4083
02:56:03,439 --> 02:56:08,479
money and nothing but hash um which was

4084
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:10,359
better than money because whenever you

4085
02:56:08,478 --> 02:56:12,079
found people who needed hash right got

4086
02:56:10,359 --> 02:56:15,520
you that's how I survive got like a

4087
02:56:12,079 --> 02:56:17,760
place to stay and food anyway and I

4088
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:18,760
called up Amsterdam and called up and

4089
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:21,398
got Monica

4090
02:56:18,760 --> 02:56:23,079
at ciny seeds on the phone and Monica's

4091
02:56:21,398 --> 02:56:26,079
like why don't you you know come back up

4092
02:56:23,079 --> 02:56:28,639
here and we became a couple and I we end

4093
02:56:26,079 --> 02:56:31,478
up living with Monica and I started

4094
02:56:28,639 --> 02:56:33,000
growing and breeding and while I was in

4095
02:56:31,478 --> 02:56:35,639
Amsterdam this

4096
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:37,120
band um and I fell in love with with

4097
02:56:35,639 --> 02:56:39,599
cannabis you know with with the whole

4098
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:41,680
culture in Amsterdam and there was this

4099
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:43,920
band that was an LA band that was local

4100
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:46,318
band you know playing around and they

4101
02:56:43,920 --> 02:56:48,879
got signed and they were doing they

4102
02:56:46,318 --> 02:56:51,119
needed their guitar player quit and they

4103
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:52,959
needed another guitar player and I was

4104
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:54,279
like well I play guitar because I I

4105
02:56:52,959 --> 02:56:56,119
can't remember how I knew these guys and

4106
02:56:54,279 --> 02:56:59,399
they're like and and I'm from La they

4107
02:56:56,120 --> 02:57:01,040
like perfect it's like oh yeah dude and

4108
02:56:59,398 --> 02:57:02,840
so we're rehearsing and starting to do

4109
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:04,359
some recording and then actually yeah

4110
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:06,079
that's they got signed afterwards and

4111
02:57:04,359 --> 02:57:09,040
they had like this five record deal and

4112
02:57:06,079 --> 02:57:10,000
a tour and all this [ __ ] and they're

4113
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:11,359
like all right we're goingon to go we're

4114
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,840
going to start touring in Germany we're

4115
02:57:11,359 --> 02:57:16,399
going to go around the world blah blah

4116
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:17,600
blah and I said you know what I I think

4117
02:57:16,398 --> 02:57:19,159
I'm just gonna stay in Amsterdam and

4118
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:21,079
grow weed

4119
02:57:19,159 --> 02:57:23,279
like it's just I I couldn't feel it it

4120
02:57:21,079 --> 02:57:26,559
was just weird I was like the plant was

4121
02:57:23,279 --> 02:57:28,800
so like dude I'm here it's like right

4122
02:57:26,559 --> 02:57:31,000
here it's like if you can play music and

4123
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:33,358
be with me then that'll work but if

4124
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:35,520
you're going to go off in the world then

4125
02:57:33,359 --> 02:57:37,559
we're definitely going to part ways you

4126
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:39,920
know what I mean because traveling in

4127
02:57:37,559 --> 02:57:42,079
the early 90s and cannabis was always

4128
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:44,000
such a challenge so I decided just to

4129
02:57:42,079 --> 02:57:47,600
stay with the

4130
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:49,559
plan and you know and that band went off

4131
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:51,920
and they're like went crazy and they all

4132
02:57:49,559 --> 02:57:54,600
had all this crazy drama on their world

4133
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:58,318
tour and you know following your passion

4134
02:57:54,600 --> 02:58:00,920
is like definitely important but for me

4135
02:57:58,318 --> 02:58:03,719
it was definitely sticking with weed it

4136
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:05,799
was The Sage it was The Sage dude I

4137
02:58:03,719 --> 02:58:08,840
couldn't couldn't was it's like part of

4138
02:58:05,799 --> 02:58:10,959
my uh part of my DNA you know Sage

4139
02:58:08,840 --> 02:58:14,799

02:58:59,439 --> 02:59:03,000
of

4156
02:59:00,318 --> 02:59:06,920

and his best buddy had all kinds of

4160
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:18,840
strange uh relationships with the dead

4161
02:59:16,719 --> 02:59:24,119
around you know

4162
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:27,359

4163
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:28,399
way back and his family his his kids are

4164
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:32,040
still good

4165
02:59:28,398 --> 02:59:33,719
friends and I I never really appreciated

4166
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:35,960
growing up like what that meant like

4167
02:59:33,719 --> 02:59:37,599
being like you know it's like just the

4168
02:59:35,959 --> 02:59:40,759
Grateful Dead was just a kind of a

4169
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:42,840
fixture you know of our family you know

4170
02:59:40,760 --> 02:59:45,159
Hell's Angels like my mom tells stories

4171
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:47,279
about like you know hell Hell's Angels

4172
02:59:45,159 --> 02:59:50,799
showing up on a dirt road in Big Sir on

4173
02:59:47,279 --> 02:59:52,600
like Harley's like 30 bringing food for

4174
02:59:50,799 --> 02:59:54,799
us because you know they found out that

4175
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:57,600
a bunch of hippies living on this out in

4176
02:59:54,799 --> 03:00:01,119
the woods didn't have food and so we had

4177
02:59:57,600 --> 03:00:03,238
this weird Bay Area um connection we

4178
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:06,079
live my family lived in Moran too before

4179
03:00:03,238 --> 03:00:08,238
we moved to Big Sir um so yeah it goes

4180
03:00:06,079 --> 03:00:11,318
way back with the dead but then later in

4181
03:00:08,238 --> 03:00:13,398
life as a teenager when they reemerged

4182
03:00:11,318 --> 03:00:15,879
in you know I guess you know in the 80s

4183
03:00:13,398 --> 03:00:18,519
when it became a big thing then I you

4184
03:00:15,879 --> 03:00:20,639
know started going to shows again

4185
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:22,079
and you know by then my uncle was no

4186
03:00:20,639 --> 03:00:25,639
longer involved because he got way

4187
03:00:22,079 --> 03:00:28,000
whacked out and drugs and all that stuff

4188
03:00:25,639 --> 03:00:30,238
but um he kind of reintroduced me to

4189
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:32,478
that scene and he his kids as well got

4190
03:00:30,238 --> 03:00:35,119
reintroduced to the scene and started

4191
03:00:32,478 --> 03:00:36,438
going to shows backstage passes going

4192
03:00:35,120 --> 03:00:38,560
there and hanging out with the dead in

4193
03:00:36,439 --> 03:00:40,600
the back there you know just like a trip

4194
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:42,119
just like a little kid on acid there

4195
03:00:40,600 --> 03:00:43,800
while the wives are making them

4196
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:45,200
sandwiches and I'm just like wow

4197
03:00:43,799 --> 03:00:47,639
sandwiches look really good could I have

4198
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:49,200
a sandwich like the [ __ ] are you like

4199
03:00:47,639 --> 03:00:51,959
I'm just I'm just here I've got this

4200
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:54,840
pass and people say I can go places you

4201
03:00:51,959 --> 03:00:57,199
know are you amazed are are you amazed

4202
03:00:54,840 --> 03:01:01,040
like me like when you look back now like

4203
03:00:57,200 --> 03:01:03,600
here we are in 2025 and it was just kind

4204
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:06,720
of like a flash in the pan that they

4205
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:10,079
existed for the 30 years that they did

4206
03:01:06,719 --> 03:01:14,000
here we are and going to be the 60th

4207
03:01:10,079 --> 03:01:17,398
year of Grateful Dead music and man it

4208
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:19,680
seems like their music is bigger today

4209
03:01:17,398 --> 03:01:22,680
than it was was when when Jerry checked

4210
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:26,479
out right like there's Grateful Dead

4211
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:29,000
cover bands in every you know part of

4212
03:01:26,478 --> 03:01:31,000
the country performing that music and

4213
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:33,879
there's really famous musicians who

4214
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:35,120
perform the music of Grateful Dead so I

4215
03:01:33,879 --> 03:01:37,519
think it has something to do with the

4216
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:40,359
staying power of the music but does it

4217
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:42,560
Amaze you Mojave like when you look back

4218
03:01:40,359 --> 03:01:45,000
like to think that oh my God here it is

4219
03:01:42,559 --> 03:01:47,519
like so many years after Jerry's gone

4220
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:50,120
and the actual configuration that we

4221
03:01:47,520 --> 03:01:52,640
knew The Grateful Dead has been ceased

4222
03:01:50,120 --> 03:01:55,560
to exist for a while but that body of

4223
03:01:52,639 --> 03:01:57,199
Music exists and you know I think it has

4224
03:01:55,559 --> 03:02:00,119
to do with the taping you know they

4225
03:01:57,200 --> 03:02:02,079
allowed taping at their show and that

4226
03:02:00,120 --> 03:02:04,520
was a really smart move it didn't seem

4227
03:02:02,079 --> 03:02:07,840
like a smart move at the time but if you

4228
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:10,560
think about it there's more recordings

4229
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:13,040
of the Grateful Dead than any other band

4230
03:02:10,559 --> 03:02:16,039
on the planet if you think about like

4231
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:18,000
all the tapes in everyone's Collections

4232
03:02:16,040 --> 03:02:19,960
and and the way it's the way it was

4233
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:23,359
traded to me it's just it's it's

4234
03:02:19,959 --> 03:02:25,159
phenomenal just to think about I think

4235
03:02:23,359 --> 03:02:27,200
the music well the I think the music is

4236
03:02:25,159 --> 03:02:29,680
important and the music is beautiful and

4237
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:31,720
that is definitely 100% true Mark but I

4238
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:34,079
think more than the the to me the real

4239
03:02:31,719 --> 03:02:36,318
reason the dead is still relevant and

4240
03:02:34,079 --> 03:02:38,600
people listen to the music and the cover

4241
03:02:36,318 --> 03:02:40,959
bands and all the similar bands and jam

4242
03:02:38,600 --> 03:02:43,000
bands is because the spirit of what the

4243
03:02:40,959 --> 03:02:44,719
dead was and that connective tissue that

4244
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:49,079
they were for

4245
03:02:44,719 --> 03:02:50,478
Humanity in as a community was so needed

4246
03:02:49,079 --> 03:02:52,920
right like what if the what would the

4247
03:02:50,478 --> 03:02:55,639
world be like like you can't take you

4248
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:57,359
can like I love Jimmy Hendricks I love

4249
03:02:55,639 --> 03:02:59,358
Le Zeppelin I love the Beatles I love a

4250
03:02:57,359 --> 03:03:02,238
lot of classic rock but you could remove

4251
03:02:59,359 --> 03:03:03,640
all those people from those bands from

4252
03:03:02,238 --> 03:03:05,920
the world and the world would be

4253
03:03:03,639 --> 03:03:09,879
different but if you took the dead out

4254
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:12,600
of the human history of the world man we

4255
03:03:09,879 --> 03:03:15,879
it'd be very different right they they

4256
03:03:12,600 --> 03:03:18,159
created this cultural movement that

4257
03:03:15,879 --> 03:03:21,079
branched off into all these different

4258
03:03:18,159 --> 03:03:24,959
facets into cannabis into glass into

4259
03:03:21,079 --> 03:03:27,398
culture into Tech into art into you know

4260
03:03:24,959 --> 03:03:31,278
whatever they're like a they're like a

4261
03:03:27,398 --> 03:03:33,840
anthropological phenomenon so it's

4262
03:03:31,279 --> 03:03:35,640
like what happened in and around that

4263
03:03:33,840 --> 03:03:38,040
scene especially as it relates to

4264
03:03:35,639 --> 03:03:41,199
cannabis and psychedelics and you I

4265
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:42,880
guess having a good time in general is

4266
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:45,920
you know like if you go to a billy

4267
03:03:42,879 --> 03:03:49,398
string so Billy strings again just like

4268
03:03:45,920 --> 03:03:52,200
incredible musician and he's got a scene

4269
03:03:49,398 --> 03:03:54,398
outside of his shows the proverbial

4270
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:57,479
Shakedown Street right where there's

4271
03:03:54,398 --> 03:04:00,519
people who are vending all kinds of you

4272
03:03:57,478 --> 03:04:03,318
know wees and you could get good glass

4273
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:05,920
pipes you could probably get good weed I

4274
03:04:03,318 --> 03:04:10,079
mean the thing is is that that that

4275
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:13,478
business model of having a culture kind

4276
03:04:10,079 --> 03:04:15,719
of develop around your music I think the

4277
03:04:13,478 --> 03:04:17,318
dead were the first to do that right cuz

4278
03:04:15,719 --> 03:04:19,879
like you the great bands that you

4279
03:04:17,318 --> 03:04:24,519
mentioned and I I grew up listening to

4280
03:04:19,879 --> 03:04:27,559
Prague Rock ELP yes you know Genesis

4281
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:30,640
great music and such a you know period

4282
03:04:27,559 --> 03:04:33,000
of time when you know when you got

4283
03:04:30,639 --> 03:04:36,439
records you had to go to the record

4284
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:38,159
store The Day the album was released and

4285
03:04:36,439 --> 03:04:40,318
then you brought that album home and you

4286
03:04:38,159 --> 03:04:43,039
clean your weed on it and you put the

4287
03:04:40,318 --> 03:04:45,760
headphones on and you got lost in Pink

4288
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:49,080
Floyd Animals or you know remember all

4289
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:51,398
that great music that went kind like it

4290
03:04:49,079 --> 03:04:55,279
created and this goes back to this

4291
03:04:51,398 --> 03:04:59,478
episode right Caleb a connection between

4292
03:04:55,279 --> 03:05:01,880
The Human Experience of music and like

4293
03:04:59,478 --> 03:05:03,879
getting high like when you got home with

4294
03:05:01,879 --> 03:05:06,039
that Talking Heads album that was just

4295
03:05:03,879 --> 03:05:08,278
released and you're getting high and

4296
03:05:06,040 --> 03:05:10,200
you're listening to that album for the

4297
03:05:08,279 --> 03:05:12,720
first time like maybe you've heard a

4298
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:14,960
couple of the songs on the radio but

4299
03:05:12,719 --> 03:05:16,679
like it's not like it is today I mean

4300
03:05:14,959 --> 03:05:19,238
you heard that song on the radio you had

4301
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:21,960
to wait till the radio station plays it

4302
03:05:19,238 --> 03:05:25,318
again to hear it again I remember

4303
03:05:21,959 --> 03:05:27,519
listening to uh to uh wrapped up like a

4304
03:05:25,318 --> 03:05:29,719

4307
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:36,119

Springsteen song right and we were

4309

4311
03:05:42,559 --> 03:05:48,238
the joint that we started smoking but I

4312
03:05:45,279 --> 03:05:52,520
mean the connection that we had back in

4313
03:05:48,238 --> 03:05:54,359
the FM music days between you know

4314
03:05:52,520 --> 03:05:56,200
getting a record for the first time at

4315
03:05:54,359 --> 03:05:58,960
the record store and then going home and

4316
03:05:56,200 --> 03:06:01,239
smoking some weed and putting it on I

4317
03:05:58,959 --> 03:06:03,000
remember you know brothers and sisters

4318
03:06:01,238 --> 03:06:05,079
the Almond Brothers I remember the day

4319
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:07,840
that terpin station came out the day

4320
03:06:05,079 --> 03:06:10,398
that Shakedown Street came out yeah you

4321
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:12,799
went to the record store got the record

4322
03:06:10,398 --> 03:06:15,238
went home rolled a joint got high put

4323
03:06:12,799 --> 03:06:18,159
the headphones on and listened to that

4324
03:06:15,238 --> 03:06:20,600
music for the first time it was magical

4325
03:06:18,159 --> 03:06:21,920
experience such as trans roll the joint

4326
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:25,040
on the

4327
03:06:21,920 --> 03:06:27,238
record on the record it was the same way

4328
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:31,200
but I I had some different artists I was

4329
03:06:27,238 --> 03:06:35,478
like red man me man you know what I'm

4330
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:36,960
saying some Snoop doll some Dr Dre

4331
03:06:35,478 --> 03:06:40,679
clonic

4332
03:06:36,959 --> 03:06:42,519
2001 explosives baby you know I was a

4333
03:06:40,680 --> 03:06:44,600
white kid living in the suburbs growing

4334
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:47,200
up in the 70s so I was just I was

4335
03:06:44,600 --> 03:06:49,600
listening to wnw in New York and

4336
03:06:47,200 --> 03:06:52,479
whatever they played when I first heard

4337
03:06:49,600 --> 03:06:55,318
Elvis Costello first heard the Talking

4338
03:06:52,478 --> 03:06:57,438
Heads first heard squeeze all those

4339
03:06:55,318 --> 03:07:02,238
great bands and it doesn't seem like

4340
03:06:57,439 --> 03:07:04,479
music is that way anymore right like the

4341
03:07:02,238 --> 03:07:07,520
music that's today is just doesn't have

4342
03:07:04,478 --> 03:07:09,719
the substance that you know that music

4343
03:07:07,520 --> 03:07:12,120
of the 60s and the

4344
03:07:09,719 --> 03:07:14,799
70s I don't know Mark I think I think

4345
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:16,479
the music is great even better in some

4346
03:07:14,799 --> 03:07:18,039
respects because it's everywhere in

4347
03:07:16,478 --> 03:07:21,039
performance it's just

4348
03:07:18,040 --> 03:07:23,279
the ability the record companies can't

4349
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:25,760
present the art the way they used to and

4350
03:07:23,279 --> 03:07:28,359
so now record companies can only present

4351
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:30,960
the most commercial fast food version of

4352
03:07:28,359 --> 03:07:32,960
it because it's been taken away from

4353
03:07:30,959 --> 03:07:35,719
them right music is now in the hands of

4354
03:07:32,959 --> 03:07:37,919
the internet so it's like there is no

4355
03:07:35,719 --> 03:07:41,238
like it's sad for kids not to have that

4356
03:07:37,920 --> 03:07:43,719
collective experience of of the way we

4357
03:07:41,238 --> 03:07:46,600
did but I think the music part's alive

4358
03:07:43,719 --> 03:07:49,278
it's just not the product the way it the

4359
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:51,000
music is the weed right there's too many

4360
03:07:49,279 --> 03:07:53,479
people trying to go grow weed they're

4361
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:55,079
not all deserving to be growing weed and

4362
03:07:53,478 --> 03:07:56,920
there's too many people trying to be

4363
03:07:55,079 --> 03:07:59,120
artists and maybe they're not all

4364
03:07:56,920 --> 03:08:01,120
talented and because the record labels

4365
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:03,840
no longer invest heavily in artist

4366
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:05,160
development and creative the same way

4367
03:08:03,840 --> 03:08:07,120
the stories aren't being told and

4368
03:08:05,159 --> 03:08:08,478
there's just a lot of there's just a lot

4369
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:10,319
but of course I'm sure there's the same

4370
03:08:08,478 --> 03:08:11,959
amount of talent percentage wise in the

4371
03:08:10,318 --> 03:08:13,920
world it's just harder to dig through it

4372
03:08:11,959 --> 03:08:15,559
and find it you know I just think about

4373
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:17,719
me searching on the internet from

4374
03:08:15,559 --> 03:08:19,799
something now compared to 10 15 can't

4375
03:08:17,719 --> 03:08:21,079
find anything I don't know where [ __ ] is

4376
03:08:19,799 --> 03:08:24,000
I don't know how you find out about

4377
03:08:21,079 --> 03:08:25,520
stuff but um I think that's that's what

4378
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:27,159
it is is like it is all about the

4379
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:29,720
internet and so many people trying to do

4380
03:08:27,159 --> 03:08:31,398
it similar to weed there's just so many

4381
03:08:29,719 --> 03:08:34,719
people who go oh weed's cool and I want

4382
03:08:31,398 --> 03:08:37,358
to be down with weed and um that's what

4383
03:08:34,719 --> 03:08:38,959
makes it hard you gota consumers have to

4384
03:08:37,359 --> 03:08:41,640
weed through all that themselves to find

4385
03:08:38,959 --> 03:08:44,000
out who the real weed people are yeah

4386
03:08:41,639 --> 03:08:46,840
well back then too it was you know more

4387
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:48,879
like this like main component of where

4388
03:08:46,840 --> 03:08:50,880
the music was coming out from and they

4389
03:08:48,879 --> 03:08:53,398
were all listening to similar records

4390
03:08:50,879 --> 03:08:55,478
they were all inspired by similar bands

4391
03:08:53,398 --> 03:08:57,079
and they were all being inspired in very

4392
03:08:55,478 --> 03:08:59,159
similar they were moving to the same

4393
03:08:57,079 --> 03:09:01,959
places and going to each other's

4394
03:08:59,159 --> 03:09:05,079
concerts and so it was kind of like now

4395
03:09:01,959 --> 03:09:07,759
that's not how music is chosen like now

4396
03:09:05,079 --> 03:09:10,559
music is chosen through the infinite

4397
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:13,880
high of the melum network it can come

4398
03:09:10,559 --> 03:09:15,639
from a billion different ways it does it

4399
03:09:13,879 --> 03:09:17,920
certainly does not need to be limited

4400
03:09:15,639 --> 03:09:19,879
through like the record label

4401
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:21,719
which was pretty much the way music was

4402
03:09:19,879 --> 03:09:24,159
fed to us back in the day if the label

4403
03:09:21,719 --> 03:09:26,119
didn't get behind it it would be it

4404
03:09:24,159 --> 03:09:28,039
would have been very hard for you to

4405
03:09:26,120 --> 03:09:30,239
have been turned on to Leed

4406
03:09:28,040 --> 03:09:32,120
Zeppelin right I saw some artists

4407
03:09:30,238 --> 03:09:34,238
talking about what they would do to fix

4408
03:09:32,120 --> 03:09:35,319
it and they go super simple put CD

4409
03:09:34,238 --> 03:09:38,760
players in

4410
03:09:35,318 --> 03:09:40,760
cars start selling CDs put CD players

4411
03:09:38,760 --> 03:09:42,318
back in cars and get rid of all this

4412
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:43,760
digital stuff I don't even have any

4413
03:09:42,318 --> 03:09:45,639
music on my phone I don't know how to

4414
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:47,520
download anything but my own music so I

4415
03:09:45,639 --> 03:09:49,680
listen to music on YouTube cuz I don't

4416
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:52,439
know how to use Spotify but put CD

4417
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:56,120
players back in cars sell the CDs in

4418
03:09:52,439 --> 03:09:56,120
physical stores and no more

4419
03:09:56,359 --> 03:10:00,238
streaming I think that's again just

4420
03:09:58,398 --> 03:10:03,119
going back to like what the jam band

4421
03:10:00,238 --> 03:10:05,439
scene is now and like nugs.net you know

4422
03:10:03,120 --> 03:10:07,200
all the couch tour stuff and all the

4423
03:10:05,439 --> 03:10:09,680
broadcasts of live

4424
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:13,720
performances I think the Grateful dad

4425
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:16,880
changed the way live music is presented

4426
03:10:13,719 --> 03:10:20,119
and like yeah now anyone with an

4427
03:10:16,879 --> 03:10:23,358
Instagram or a YouTube channel can be an

4428
03:10:20,120 --> 03:10:25,880
artist and back then you needed to be

4429
03:10:23,359 --> 03:10:27,600
picked up by a major record label to be

4430
03:10:25,879 --> 03:10:30,000
distributed or else people wouldn't know

4431
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:33,520
who you were but I think what the dead

4432
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:35,840
did quietly all during the 80s is just

4433
03:10:33,520 --> 03:10:38,159
played night after night they played a

4434
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:41,159
different show every night and they had

4435
03:10:38,159 --> 03:10:43,840
kids like me hooked because you know I

4436
03:10:41,159 --> 03:10:46,359
remember when I had to justify to my dad

4437
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:48,799
who thought I was in college and I was

4438
03:10:46,359 --> 03:10:51,120
coming home for for dinner one Easter

4439
03:10:48,799 --> 03:10:52,358
and we had to change the time of the

4440
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:54,040
dinner so I could make it to the

4441
03:10:52,359 --> 03:10:56,720
Hartford show that

4442
03:10:54,040 --> 03:10:58,960
night it was like an obsession you know

4443
03:10:56,719 --> 03:11:01,039
they thought that we were obsessed and I

4444
03:10:58,959 --> 03:11:02,919
had to kind of like rationalize the

4445
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:05,200
Grateful Dead like baseball I'm like

4446
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:08,279
well yeah it's different every time you

4447
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:10,000
know it's like every night was different

4448
03:11:08,279 --> 03:11:12,800
and I don't think every band was like

4449
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:17,000
that at the time and so now I think

4450
03:11:12,799 --> 03:11:18,000
again there's this whole scene of bands

4451
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:21,120
who

4452
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:23,879
can exist without having Mass popularity

4453
03:11:21,120 --> 03:11:26,200
and not being you know a you know a band

4454
03:11:23,879 --> 03:11:28,679
like Mo for example I think Mo is a

4455
03:11:26,200 --> 03:11:31,760
great example they have achieved a

4456
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:34,439
certain level of success their you know

4457
03:11:31,760 --> 03:11:36,800
ban admin office is all family members

4458
03:11:34,439 --> 03:11:39,800
so they kind of keep it in the family

4459
03:11:36,799 --> 03:11:41,840
and they play small little venues uh

4460
03:11:39,799 --> 03:11:44,679
Daniel like this they just played stos

4461
03:11:41,840 --> 03:11:46,840
cider the other night and uh you know

4462
03:11:44,680 --> 03:11:49,279
like small venues kind of like Zen bar

4463
03:11:46,840 --> 03:11:52,040
like things that are nice in Vermont

4464
03:11:49,279 --> 03:11:54,159
that has you know cultural significance

4465
03:11:52,040 --> 03:11:56,880
in that when you go there you're

4466
03:11:54,159 --> 03:11:58,920
supporting a local venue so the money

4467
03:11:56,879 --> 03:12:02,119
you're spending behind the bar isn't

4468
03:11:58,920 --> 03:12:04,719
going to some Live Nation big venue it's

4469
03:12:02,120 --> 03:12:06,960
going to a small venue owner here in the

4470
03:12:04,719 --> 03:12:09,199
state and so things kind of stay

4471
03:12:06,959 --> 03:12:11,919
homegrown and I I think there's certain

4472
03:12:09,200 --> 03:12:15,439
levels of success that you could achieve

4473
03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:18,439
now without being you know Ariana Grande

4474
03:12:15,439 --> 03:12:21,079
or some you know big blown up back these

4475
03:12:18,439 --> 03:12:23,800
days you there's still a lot of great

4476
03:12:21,079 --> 03:12:26,600
music going on today but I don't think

4477
03:12:23,799 --> 03:12:29,759
that it's I I don't think it'll ever be

4478
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:31,600
like it was in the 60s and 70s and well

4479
03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:34,520
they don't sell they don't sell records

4480
03:12:31,600 --> 03:12:37,120
to to dance point because that but they

4481
03:12:34,520 --> 03:12:38,359
they make their money performing so if

4482
03:12:37,120 --> 03:12:40,120
you're a good performer and that's kind

4483
03:12:38,359 --> 03:12:42,079
of what the dead did they also didn't

4484
03:12:40,120 --> 03:12:45,079
sell as nearly as many records as they

4485
03:12:42,079 --> 03:12:46,680
did performance put people in seats so

4486
03:12:45,079 --> 03:12:48,920
if you're a good band and you can

4487
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:51,318
perform you know people do appreciate

4488
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:53,520
live music and there is amazing music I

4489
03:12:51,318 --> 03:12:56,519
just lately like a like a couple months

4490
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:59,000
ago Spotify took me on a thread that I

4491
03:12:56,520 --> 03:13:00,920
wouldn't have gone down and I've been

4492
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:03,159
like listening to some really cool music

4493
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:05,279
that I never would have selected and I

4494
03:13:03,159 --> 03:13:07,840
got but I got lucky because 90% of the

4495
03:13:05,279 --> 03:13:10,279
time I ever tried that before it took me

4496
03:13:07,840 --> 03:13:12,559
down this Commercial Avenue that I

4497
03:13:10,279 --> 03:13:14,479
didn't like so I'd always just play the

4498
03:13:12,559 --> 03:13:16,600
music that I wanted to listen to and

4499
03:13:14,478 --> 03:13:18,398
then I started letting it go and I was

4500
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:21,120
like wow there wow you guys took me to

4501
03:13:18,398 --> 03:13:23,920
like 70s Ethiopian jazz

4502
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:25,840
funk and I'm like this really [ __ ]

4503
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:28,478
cool and now I'm like obsessed with

4504
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:30,680
Ethiopian Jazz

4505
03:13:28,478 --> 03:13:33,278
fun well as long as there's people

4506
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:34,960
smoking marijuana right I mean as we

4507
03:13:33,279 --> 03:13:36,960
used to say you know you get Five Guys

4508
03:13:34,959 --> 03:13:39,238
together you get them drink alcohol they

4509
03:13:36,959 --> 03:13:41,238
get into fight you get five people you

4510
03:13:39,238 --> 03:13:43,520
get them a joint next thing you know

4511
03:13:41,238 --> 03:13:44,439
they're starting a band so there's still

4512
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:47,760
the

4513
03:13:44,439 --> 03:13:49,800
creativity out there it's just you know

4514
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:52,238
we've seen a demographic I grew up

4515
03:13:49,799 --> 03:13:55,478
playing a traditional instrument right

4516
03:13:52,238 --> 03:13:57,279
about a decade ago I mean Guitar Center

4517
03:13:55,478 --> 03:13:59,639
and others said the number one selling

4518
03:13:57,279 --> 03:14:03,600
things are DJ equipment right it's it's

4519
03:13:59,639 --> 03:14:05,719
it's just changed its creativity and

4520
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:08,040
perception what people were doing on a

4521
03:14:05,719 --> 03:14:11,119
fretboard they started doing with

4522
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:13,520
turntables and sounds and and really

4523
03:14:11,120 --> 03:14:15,680
experimenting and taking things so it's

4524
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:17,319
always going to be an EB and flow you

4525
03:14:15,680 --> 03:14:19,079
remember you know rock and roll was

4526
03:14:17,318 --> 03:14:21,278
going to be the devil's music but Jazz

4527
03:14:19,079 --> 03:14:24,478
was the devil's music then hip-hop was

4528
03:14:21,279 --> 03:14:26,359
the devil's music so just make music

4529
03:14:24,478 --> 03:14:27,719
you're always going to be accused of of

4530
03:14:26,359 --> 03:14:30,640
being on the side of the devil because

4531
03:14:27,719 --> 03:14:33,920
you're being creative so you know just

4532
03:14:30,639 --> 03:14:36,639
do it and whatever happens it's just as

4533
03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:39,799
as everybody's talk how I did it which

4534
03:14:36,639 --> 03:14:43,000
was making a mixtape and you know then

4535
03:14:39,799 --> 03:14:46,199
you know 45 then to you know going to

4536
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:48,120
wax and stuff like that that went away

4537
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:50,000
but now it's back back you know what I'm

4538
03:14:48,120 --> 03:14:52,439
saying so because when I grew up I was

4539
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:56,840
only buying seven Ines right my first

4540
03:14:52,439 --> 03:15:00,398
7even inch was uh L freak uh you know

4541
03:14:56,840 --> 03:15:03,200
freak out you know back in the 70s

4542
03:15:00,398 --> 03:15:06,000
right right but that was again what was

4543
03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:08,159
it was an affordable medium right a 45

4544
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:10,799
was you know less than a buck back then

4545
03:15:08,159 --> 03:15:12,760
right and it was two songs right you got

4546
03:15:10,799 --> 03:15:14,559
one song and then you got one song you

4547
03:15:12,760 --> 03:15:16,760
never heard on the other side right or

4548
03:15:14,559 --> 03:15:19,039
that you occasionally listen to right

4549
03:15:16,760 --> 03:15:21,279
but then that what changed into right

4550
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:24,120
what how many of us belong to a music

4551
03:15:21,279 --> 03:15:26,800
service but like the old school where

4552
03:15:24,120 --> 03:15:29,120
you get 10 tapes and you know then you

4553
03:15:26,799 --> 03:15:32,278
have to buy them over series of time

4554
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:33,880
right then it became CD and then

4555
03:15:32,279 --> 03:15:37,720
it's

4556
03:15:33,879 --> 03:15:39,839
Kel right Kel for sure and then we then

4557
03:15:37,719 --> 03:15:42,719
we all destroyed our computers with lime

4558
03:15:39,840 --> 03:15:45,318
wire right or our friends or our parents

4559
03:15:42,719 --> 03:15:48,679
computers right because I used kazah

4560
03:15:45,318 --> 03:15:51,639
kazah right because then way to burn

4561
03:15:48,680 --> 03:15:54,398
music so just it doesn't matter as long

4562
03:15:51,639 --> 03:15:56,398
as the music's there people will find a

4563
03:15:54,398 --> 03:15:58,278
way to get it out yeah it's different

4564
03:15:56,398 --> 03:16:00,840
the music industry is completely changed

4565
03:15:58,279 --> 03:16:03,439
and I'm glad that it's changed because

4566
03:16:00,840 --> 03:16:06,000
I've been a musician I was an artist I

4567
03:16:03,439 --> 03:16:08,600
was I was a music artist I wasn't a

4568
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:10,719
music player in the sense that you're in

4569
03:16:08,600 --> 03:16:14,120
the music industry right that's a whole

4570
03:16:10,719 --> 03:16:16,679
other realm of reality is that you know

4571
03:16:14,120 --> 03:16:18,800
you have to be really good talented but

4572
03:16:16,680 --> 03:16:21,559
you got to also have some luck and love

4573
03:16:18,799 --> 03:16:24,438
and a way to get that music out so you

4574
03:16:21,559 --> 03:16:26,719
know cannabis spreads still by smoking

4575
03:16:24,439 --> 03:16:29,639
circles and the music will continue to

4576
03:16:26,719 --> 03:16:31,959
spread just in different ways shapes and

4577
03:16:29,639 --> 03:16:33,840
forms and something's going to evolve

4578
03:16:31,959 --> 03:16:35,799
from you know the turntables to

4579
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:37,680
something else eventually that's

4580
03:16:35,799 --> 03:16:39,799
currently being made right now that

4581
03:16:37,680 --> 03:16:42,079
people are scoffing at and laughing at

4582
03:16:39,799 --> 03:16:44,920
will soon eventually become the dominant

4583
03:16:42,079 --> 03:16:46,959
parad in music that's just how it goes

4584
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:48,879
cuz generation Alpha right the new

4585
03:16:46,959 --> 03:16:50,358
generation will reject our conventional

4586
03:16:48,879 --> 03:16:52,198
music and find something and create

4587
03:16:50,359 --> 03:16:55,359
something else and that's the beauty of

4588
03:16:52,199 --> 03:16:59,279
music right whatever they do create I do

4589
03:16:55,359 --> 03:17:03,238
hope to see a world where you can go to

4590
03:16:59,279 --> 03:17:06,120
a musical experience and have cannabis

4591
03:17:03,238 --> 03:17:09,559
be the drug of choice that's set up to

4592
03:17:06,120 --> 03:17:11,800
support your intake of cannabis it's not

4593
03:17:09,559 --> 03:17:14,959

03:18:12,600 --> 03:18:17,000
what's cool is I've got decades worth of

4623
03:18:15,318 --> 03:18:19,359
of songs that I'm going to all start

4624
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:22,398
putting out and so my my plan is to

4625
03:18:19,359 --> 03:18:24,559
start a label and you know have a whole

4626
03:18:22,398 --> 03:18:26,478
strategy of what I want to do with this

4627
03:18:24,559 --> 03:18:28,519
music you know I just want people to

4628
03:18:26,478 --> 03:18:30,760
hear it and you know hope maybe they

4629
03:18:28,520 --> 03:18:33,960
have a similar impact you know or enjoy

4630
03:18:30,760 --> 03:18:36,279
it the way I do but you know the balance

4631
03:18:33,959 --> 03:18:37,879
is running a a cannabis company and

4632
03:18:36,279 --> 03:18:39,560
having the the time to break away from

4633
03:18:37,879 --> 03:18:42,039
that so that's my hope in balance is to

4634
03:18:39,559 --> 03:18:43,719
start consistently releasing music you

4635
03:18:42,040 --> 03:18:45,640
know on a monthly basis so there's more

4636
03:18:43,719 --> 03:18:47,478
and more but you know I need to free up

4637
03:18:45,639 --> 03:18:49,879
the time to shoot theic music videos and

4638
03:18:47,478 --> 03:18:52,159
write the blogs and do the [ __ ] you

4639
03:18:49,879 --> 03:18:54,198
know other things to get it out there um

4640
03:18:52,159 --> 03:18:57,600
but I appreciate an opportunity to come

4641
03:18:54,199 --> 03:19:00,040
on and and and speak about it and uh be

4642
03:18:57,600 --> 03:19:02,479
interesting if people check it

4643
03:19:00,040 --> 03:19:05,520

4644
03:19:02,478 --> 03:19:08,278

4732
03:22:42,840 --> 03:22:46,120
just kind of a heady dude I was kind of

4733
03:22:44,520 --> 03:22:48,520
when Mike first reached out to me I was

4734
03:22:46,120 --> 03:22:50,239
like this is it this is where bubble

4735

4740
03:22:58,959 --> 03:23:03,358

4746
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:21,398
with Madonna Like not too long

4747
03:23:19,520 --> 03:23:23,520
ago

4748
03:23:21,398 --> 03:23:26,119
yeah I was going to say you know it's

4749
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:28,000
not just being in in in musicians to get

4750
03:23:26,120 --> 03:23:29,399
involved in cannabis I was with the

4751
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:34,318
Cannabis Action Network back in the

4752
03:23:29,398 --> 03:23:37,119
early 90s and the uh laoa and The Horde

4753
03:23:34,318 --> 03:23:39,600
tour liked that we were Grassroots

4754
03:23:37,120 --> 03:23:43,079
cannabis people and we went out on tour

4755
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:44,520
and then uh Primus and fishbone and

4756
03:23:43,079 --> 03:23:46,600
various others were like we like what

4757
03:23:44,520 --> 03:23:49,120
y'all are doing come out with us and

4758
03:23:46,600 --> 03:23:51,479
educate people on tours so you know you

4759
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:53,520
can this you don't have to be a musician

4760
03:23:51,478 --> 03:23:55,478
to necessarily plug into the scene

4761
03:23:53,520 --> 03:23:57,840
because what we found is when we were

4762
03:23:55,478 --> 03:24:01,000
doing these tours the musicians were all

4763
03:23:57,840 --> 03:24:04,279
coming to us I met various musicians

4764
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:07,238
scoring you know on the buses from the

4765
03:24:04,279 --> 03:24:09,560
the Bas Tech right is the was the actual

4766
03:24:07,238 --> 03:24:13,238
seller on the tour right so everybody

4767
03:24:09,559 --> 03:24:15,238
went and visited and you know uh you

4768
03:24:13,238 --> 03:24:18,840
know it's just the reality is cannabis

4769
03:24:15,238 --> 03:24:21,279
and music are at the hip they cannabis

4770
03:24:18,840 --> 03:24:23,478
doesn't travel without music and music

4771
03:24:21,279 --> 03:24:26,800
doesn't travel without cannabis that's

4772
03:24:23,478 --> 03:24:28,478
what I learn from the inside scene so

4773
03:24:26,799 --> 03:24:30,759
again you don't have to necessarily be

4774
03:24:28,478 --> 03:24:33,039
musically inclined to tap into the

4775
03:24:30,760 --> 03:24:36,439
culture if you're active and you're

4776
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:39,040
genuinely working towards as we were

4777
03:24:36,439 --> 03:24:40,960
they will respond not only that they'll

4778
03:24:39,040 --> 03:24:43,080
invite you on the tour we weren't paid

4779
03:24:40,959 --> 03:24:45,679

03:27:27,238 --> 03:27:32,039
and and Vivid often dark tales of life

4842
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:36,079
in Houston

4843
03:27:32,040 --> 03:27:37,720
right struggles struggles of the

4844
03:27:36,079 --> 03:27:41,000
streets

4845
03:27:37,719 --> 03:27:42,519
introspection what's unique about scar

4846
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:44,478
yeah go ahead he was probably one of the

4847
03:27:42,520 --> 03:27:47,000
first rappers to talk about struggles

4848
03:27:44,478 --> 03:27:51,198
with mental health you know hip hop is

4849
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:52,760
so masul most hard but his early music

4850
03:27:51,199 --> 03:27:55,040
he would talk about the own battles that

4851
03:27:52,760 --> 03:27:57,639
he was having in his mind and some

4852
03:27:55,040 --> 03:28:00,000
pretty dark stuff for sure but you know

4853
03:27:57,639 --> 03:28:02,159
really really deep he's an interesting

4854
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:05,879
dude just watching interviews of him you

4855
03:28:02,159 --> 03:28:07,398
know it kind of uh plays to today where

4856
03:28:05,879 --> 03:28:09,719
you see I don't know how many of you

4857
03:28:07,398 --> 03:28:13,159
guys have been exposed to

4858
03:28:09,719 --> 03:28:15,039
Ren but Ren was going to be uh Ren was

4859
03:28:13,159 --> 03:28:17,039
kind of going to be like some big big

4860
03:28:15,040 --> 03:28:18,640
thing in the UK I don't know if it was

4861
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:21,479
he was supposed to be a pop star or

4862
03:28:18,639 --> 03:28:22,439
something but he had major major mental

4863
03:28:21,478 --> 03:28:25,840
health

4864
03:28:22,439 --> 03:28:28,318
breakdown and then just inwardly

4865
03:28:25,840 --> 03:28:32,439
converted his mental health breakdown

4866
03:28:28,318 --> 03:28:36,760
into a focus on executing

4867
03:28:32,439 --> 03:28:38,479
authentic music his authentic music and

4868
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:40,318
uh if you don't know who he is I would

4869
03:28:38,478 --> 03:28:42,799
definitely implore you to go check it

4870
03:28:40,318 --> 03:28:44,799
out he's got some cool concepts for a

4871
03:28:42,799 --> 03:28:48,840
longest time all the videos I'd seen of

4872
03:28:44,799 --> 03:28:51,079
Ren were um him busking out uh in the

4873
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:53,359
streets of whatever City I think there's

4874
03:28:51,079 --> 03:28:55,120
some Amsterdam ones and some London ones

4875
03:28:53,359 --> 03:28:58,079
but he'd just be busking and really

4876
03:28:55,120 --> 03:29:02,239
really crushing it and doing a wide

4877
03:28:58,079 --> 03:29:05,719
variety of music but um some of his more

4878
03:29:02,238 --> 03:29:09,000
non covers his own authentic music

4879
03:29:05,719 --> 03:29:12,438
there's uh he's he's he's basically

4880
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:15,000
having a conversation with his his Dark

4881
03:29:12,439 --> 03:29:17,359
Passenger right his mental illness his

4882
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:19,520
like the the voice in head and he's

4883
03:29:17,359 --> 03:29:20,960
wearing just a like hospital gown and

4884
03:29:19,520 --> 03:29:22,960
he's sitting in this sort of dark and

4885
03:29:20,959 --> 03:29:25,318
dingy room on an acoustic guitar and

4886
03:29:22,959 --> 03:29:27,559
it's it's really [ __ ] powerful if you

4887
03:29:25,318 --> 03:29:30,359
haven't seen it I would uh I would check

4888
03:29:27,559 --> 03:29:32,318
it out he's worth uh looking into uh

4889
03:29:30,359 --> 03:29:36,000
just you know from what Dan mentioned

4890
03:29:32,318 --> 03:29:38,159
about uh Scarface speaking about mental

4891
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:41,840
health uh Ren is definitely picking up

4892
03:29:38,159 --> 03:29:46,478
that baton and going deep with

4893
03:29:41,840 --> 03:29:49,120
it really exposing the uh that the

4894
03:29:46,478 --> 03:29:52,278
nitty-gritty Dark Side of of mental

4895
03:29:49,120 --> 03:29:54,560
health that really everyone has suffered

4896
03:29:52,279 --> 03:29:57,238
from at at one point in time some worse

4897
03:29:54,559 --> 03:29:59,719
than others for sure but everyone's

4898
03:29:57,238 --> 03:29:59,719
tasted

4899
03:30:04,398 --> 03:30:09,760
it well we got about a half an hour left

4900
03:30:07,318 --> 03:30:11,920
today on the show if there's anything I

4901
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:14,079
know I was going to end it I had a

4902
03:30:11,920 --> 03:30:16,199
concept that I was going to ask you guys

4903
03:30:14,079 --> 03:30:20,079
about I'll have to remember that I did

4904
03:30:16,199 --> 03:30:22,159
have kind of the last 10 or 15 minutes

4905
03:30:20,079 --> 03:30:23,680
of a of a of a question I was going to

4906
03:30:22,159 --> 03:30:26,680
ask everyone but in the meantime we have

4907
03:30:23,680 --> 03:30:29,120
about a half an hour if anyone wants to

4908
03:30:26,680 --> 03:30:31,600
speak to anything in particular or talk

4909
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:33,840
about projects that they're up to that

4910
03:30:31,600 --> 03:30:35,720
uh maybe the people who are listening

4911
03:30:33,840 --> 03:30:39,639
would like to know about I think we have

4912
03:30:35,719 --> 03:30:44,358
three or 400 people watching live right

4913
03:30:39,639 --> 03:30:47,519
now yeah still 325

4914
03:30:44,359 --> 03:30:49,199
326 well I'm I'm always happy to talk

4915
03:30:47,520 --> 03:30:51,079
about stuff if there's any topic you

4916
03:30:49,199 --> 03:30:55,120
guys would like to discuss you know from

4917
03:30:51,079 --> 03:30:57,559
genetics and ongoing stuff with you know

4918
03:30:55,120 --> 03:31:00,399
breeding

4919
03:30:57,559 --> 03:31:02,478
cultivation

4920
03:31:00,398 --> 03:31:05,079
music one thing that came to mind

4921
03:31:02,478 --> 03:31:08,039
earlier that kind of resonated was like

4922
03:31:05,079 --> 03:31:10,439
cultivating and giving giving space for

4923
03:31:08,040 --> 03:31:13,760
the grow and I feel like in creating

4924
03:31:10,439 --> 03:31:16,479
music or or the creative process it's

4925
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:17,840
good sometimes to be out in nature and

4926
03:31:16,478 --> 03:31:21,358
that disconnect I think that's a

4927
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:23,079
connection with cannabis and music um

4928
03:31:21,359 --> 03:31:25,399
and would love to speak to that maybe a

4929
03:31:23,079 --> 03:31:26,879
little bit because I know in NorCal

4930
03:31:25,398 --> 03:31:30,439
Emerald Triangle in the Santa Cruz

4931
03:31:26,879 --> 03:31:33,358
mountains or where I grew up in uh Gold

4932
03:31:30,439 --> 03:31:37,040
Country um that connection

4933
03:31:33,359 --> 03:31:39,559
to getting to the roots and creation I

4934
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:42,680
think is best paired cannabis and music

4935
03:31:39,559 --> 03:31:45,478
together but also taking that time you

4936
03:31:42,680 --> 03:31:48,359
know on the hill and taking that time in

4937
03:31:45,478 --> 03:31:49,639
the the wild the wild element to

4938
03:31:48,359 --> 03:31:53,040
cannabis and

4939
03:31:49,639 --> 03:31:54,840
music I feel that I um there's no human

4940
03:31:53,040 --> 03:31:58,840
beings within a half a mile of me in any

4941
03:31:54,840 --> 03:32:01,880
direction and um I I like it that way um

4942
03:31:58,840 --> 03:32:04,238
I really like my privacy and I think

4943
03:32:01,879 --> 03:32:06,278
that's because you know I've been trying

4944
03:32:04,238 --> 03:32:10,439
not to get busted for weed a lot of My

4945
03:32:06,279 --> 03:32:12,359
Life um and so you know both here in

4946
03:32:10,439 --> 03:32:15,120
Vermont and in California both both

4947
03:32:12,359 --> 03:32:16,359
properties are off grid solar and and

4948
03:32:15,120 --> 03:32:19,840
battery and so

4949
03:32:16,359 --> 03:32:22,120
so uh you know I I like to visit cities

4950
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:24,359
and more populated areas to kick it and

4951
03:32:22,120 --> 03:32:26,199
do cool stuff and experience culture and

4952
03:32:24,359 --> 03:32:30,199
visit people but I I definitely prefer

4953
03:32:26,199 --> 03:32:32,439
to be um you know more you know in

4954
03:32:30,199 --> 03:32:34,640
natural surroundings and try to preserve

4955
03:32:32,439 --> 03:32:35,920
them as much as possible and that's

4956
03:32:34,639 --> 03:32:39,799
where I like to grow weed and that's

4957
03:32:35,920 --> 03:32:39,799
where I like to write and do

4958
03:32:40,199 --> 03:32:47,079
music very cool man I uh definitely have

4959
03:32:43,959 --> 03:32:50,198
a massive affinity for music music not

4960
03:32:47,079 --> 03:32:52,559
much of a creator of it you know played

4961
03:32:50,199 --> 03:32:55,000
drums and always enjoyed drum circles

4962
03:32:52,559 --> 03:32:58,000
and have a lovely collection of drums

4963
03:32:55,000 --> 03:33:00,559
and got an acoustic guitar eventually I

4964
03:32:58,000 --> 03:33:02,359
I play left-handed so there was never it

4965
03:33:00,559 --> 03:33:04,600
just was never convenient for me to

4966
03:33:02,359 --> 03:33:06,840
learn from anyone if someone knew guitar

4967
03:33:04,600 --> 03:33:09,120
and had a guitar it was strapped the

4968
03:33:06,840 --> 03:33:11,359
wrong way for me I was just I didn't I

4969
03:33:09,120 --> 03:33:13,399
didn't fit into that

4970
03:33:11,359 --> 03:33:16,960
unfortunately um but that's okay because

4971
03:33:13,398 --> 03:33:18,760
I was directed into uh nice hash so I

4972
03:33:16,959 --> 03:33:21,398
was happy with my pathway and I can

4973
03:33:18,760 --> 03:33:22,920
always still pick up my guitar today and

4974
03:33:21,398 --> 03:33:25,278
start playing it again which is a

4975
03:33:22,920 --> 03:33:27,318
beautiful thing about music but uh it's

4976
03:33:25,279 --> 03:33:30,399
definitely played an important role in

4977
03:33:27,318 --> 03:33:33,119
just my life uh and I can see it in my

4978
03:33:30,398 --> 03:33:35,599
kids too my daughter and particular how

4979
03:33:33,120 --> 03:33:39,239
important music is to her just that

4980
03:33:35,600 --> 03:33:41,840
connection it's nice to have a a track

4981
03:33:39,238 --> 03:33:44,119
to your to your different experiences of

4982
03:33:41,840 --> 03:33:47,439
your life you know where you hear music

4983
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:51,439
and you can remember specific

4984
03:33:47,439 --> 03:33:53,479
times that's uh that's pretty cool yeah

4985
03:33:51,439 --> 03:33:57,520
music has I think got us all through

4986
03:33:53,478 --> 03:34:01,198
times of no pot right than anything else

4987
03:33:57,520 --> 03:34:03,520
right you know from the you know when I

4988
03:34:01,199 --> 03:34:07,920
went to combat when I was in in the Army

4989
03:34:03,520 --> 03:34:10,920
I made my own mixtapes I brought a uh an

4990
03:34:07,920 --> 03:34:13,000
Outback uh Sony Outback [ __ ] tape

4991
03:34:10,920 --> 03:34:16,159

4992
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:19,439
heavy duty to survive and yeah I mean

4993
03:34:16,159 --> 03:34:21,840
all the toughest most hardest times in

4994
03:34:19,439 --> 03:34:24,398

4995
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:25,920
out is music right that is always been

4996
03:34:24,398 --> 03:34:27,238

4997
03:34:25,920 --> 03:34:31,199

4999
03:34:31,199 --> 03:34:34,520
um as mentioned when I first jumped on

5000
03:34:33,520 --> 03:34:37,560
that

5001
03:34:34,520 --> 03:34:39,199
uh losing everything in the fire U one

5002
03:34:37,559 --> 03:34:41,159
thing I was blessed about in the

5003
03:34:39,199 --> 03:34:44,079
community here in the Emerald

5004
03:34:41,159 --> 03:34:46,398
Triangle uh was that not only did

5005
03:34:44,079 --> 03:34:48,719
farmers see what happened to me bless me

5006
03:34:46,398 --> 03:34:51,920
with trusting getting their trust to

5007
03:34:48,719 --> 03:34:54,719
make hash for them but also I got to DJ

5008
03:34:51,920 --> 03:34:56,920
Harvest parties I djed a lot of parties

5009
03:34:54,719 --> 03:34:59,438
out in the Hills that helped help me

5010
03:34:56,920 --> 03:34:59,439
rebuild

5011
03:35:01,079 --> 03:35:08,719
myself sir

5012
03:35:04,719 --> 03:35:08,719
awesome beauty of community

5013
03:35:08,879 --> 03:35:13,398
here and I just want to learn to grow

5014
03:35:11,199 --> 03:35:15,120
the weed from scratch to everything

5015
03:35:13,398 --> 03:35:17,639
everything that I can learn about

5016
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:17,640
growing

5017
03:35:18,799 --> 03:35:23,840
everything and I'm willing to learn well

5018
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:26,960
there's no shortage man and let me tell

5019
03:35:23,840 --> 03:35:29,398
you there's a lot of good people sharing

5020
03:35:26,959 --> 03:35:32,599
information about such a thing plus you

5021
03:35:29,398 --> 03:35:34,760
live in a place where when you plant

5022
03:35:32,600 --> 03:35:38,079
seeds they

5023
03:35:34,760 --> 03:35:38,079
grow so

5024
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:48,159
beautifully I think if somebody um

5025
03:35:46,079 --> 03:35:51,039
Legends could drop some of the links so

5026
03:35:48,159 --> 03:35:53,318
you know where we can read up or learn

5027
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:56,000
couple things couple videos here some of

5028
03:35:53,318 --> 03:35:58,600
them are talking about some YouTube

5029
03:35:56,000 --> 03:36:01,840
links I can link you up with all sorts

5030
03:35:58,600 --> 03:36:04,439
of information Kazam including people

5031
03:36:01,840 --> 03:36:06,760
and uh even people in Jamaica like I

5032
03:36:04,439 --> 03:36:09,800
said the best way to learn in my opinion

5033
03:36:06,760 --> 03:36:11,680
in Jamaica you could go intern you know

5034
03:36:09,799 --> 03:36:13,879
you have to have time to be able to give

5035
03:36:11,680 --> 03:36:16,800
to it but you could go donate and

5036
03:36:13,879 --> 03:36:20,039
volunteer your time at different Grows

5037
03:36:16,799 --> 03:36:22,478
Where you know someone has a vast array

5038
03:36:20,040 --> 03:36:24,399
of knowledge that's sort of the person

5039
03:36:22,478 --> 03:36:27,079
running it right you want to work with

5040
03:36:24,398 --> 03:36:28,599
someone who's exceptional and who has a

5041
03:36:27,079 --> 03:36:31,159
good understanding there's definitely

5042
03:36:28,600 --> 03:36:34,159
certainly incredible Growers on hash

5043
03:36:31,159 --> 03:36:36,318
church that have been dropping really

5044
03:36:34,159 --> 03:36:39,359
good information for the last like 10

5045
03:36:36,318 --> 03:36:41,198
years on here but uh I don't know where

5049
03:36:47,840 --> 03:36:51,478
where does one find such a thing at this

5050
03:36:50,199 --> 03:36:54,040
point in time I remember there used to

5051
03:36:51,478 --> 03:36:57,318
be key websites but now there just must

5052
03:36:54,040 --> 03:36:58,520
be a billion and one different sources

5053
03:36:57,318 --> 03:37:01,719
for

5054
03:36:58,520 --> 03:37:04,600

people you know who are growing weed and

5060
03:37:14,439 --> 03:37:17,760
try to look over their shoulders

5061
03:37:16,398 --> 03:37:21,159
and ask

5062
03:37:17,760 --> 03:37:21,159

like that's a there's a lot of knowledge

5069
03:37:38,920 --> 03:37:44,639
there and an actual growing is a is a

5070
03:37:42,318 --> 03:37:46,639
right of right a passage you have to be

5071
03:37:44,639 --> 03:37:48,358
humbled sometimes and keep growing and

5072
03:37:46,639 --> 03:37:50,119
learn from your mistakes that's

5073
03:37:48,359 --> 03:37:52,880

03:39:07,439 --> 03:39:12,840
another what you'll you'll compile some

5102
03:39:09,639 --> 03:39:15,238
as well Caleb yep get you that list by

5103
03:39:12,840 --> 03:39:17,199
the end of the showroom oh yeah that's

5104
03:39:15,238 --> 03:39:19,279
great sat we smoke sat here and smoked

5105
03:39:17,199 --> 03:39:22,120
weed for a long time it's

5106
03:39:19,279 --> 03:39:24,840
fun yeah it's you know every Sunday we

5107
03:39:22,120 --> 03:39:26,880
do this for about four hours we go into

5108
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:28,760
different levels of conversation it was

5109
03:39:26,879 --> 03:39:30,920
nice to have a kind of a different panel

5110
03:39:28,760 --> 03:39:33,238
today with some of the regulars as well

5111
03:39:30,920 --> 03:39:35,159
and sort of have this conversation I

5112
03:39:33,238 --> 03:39:37,198
think this conversation definitely has

5113
03:39:35,159 --> 03:39:39,119
the capability of going deeper it's just

5114
03:39:37,199 --> 03:39:42,359
a little bit of a harder one to crack

5115
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:45,040
you know that that cannabis music

5116
03:39:42,359 --> 03:39:47,960
relationship and how absolutely inp like

5117
03:39:45,040 --> 03:39:50,760
how important it was in so many

5118
03:39:47,959 --> 03:39:54,358
different genres of music that came out

5119
03:39:50,760 --> 03:39:57,520
if you follow cannabis use back to

5120
03:39:54,359 --> 03:40:00,238
really like old jazz

5121
03:39:57,520 --> 03:40:02,960
music so

5122
03:40:00,238 --> 03:40:06,279
cool I have a really hard time doing

5123
03:40:02,959 --> 03:40:07,759
music and making music without weed um

5124
03:40:06,279 --> 03:40:09,720
there's one time in my life where I was

5125
03:40:07,760 --> 03:40:12,398
challenged where you know I was in a

5126
03:40:09,719 --> 03:40:14,159
position where I couldn't smoke um and I

5127
03:40:12,398 --> 03:40:15,840
wanted to write and so I had to really

5128
03:40:14,159 --> 03:40:17,600
challenge myself

5129
03:40:15,840 --> 03:40:19,279
as a writer to see what I was made of

5130
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:21,520
and I I was able to write some stuff

5131
03:40:19,279 --> 03:40:23,359
that I thought was really special but

5132
03:40:21,520 --> 03:40:26,040
like I said about the amplifier when I

5133
03:40:23,359 --> 03:40:28,520
write I just I start smoking and uh what

5134
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:32,239
it what it does is it you know I believe

5135
03:40:28,520 --> 03:40:34,199
that it connects you know it's also a a

5136
03:40:32,238 --> 03:40:35,600
a conduit a connector and so you know

5137
03:40:34,199 --> 03:40:37,319
they talk about your Consciousness and

5138
03:40:35,600 --> 03:40:39,120
when you use you know weed it can open

5139
03:40:37,318 --> 03:40:41,119
up a lot of things that otherwise you

5140
03:40:39,120 --> 03:40:42,960
wouldn't have access to and I think

5141
03:40:41,120 --> 03:40:45,600
that's where when I work on music

5142
03:40:42,959 --> 03:40:47,519
whatever is is coming from you know is

5143
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:49,600
largely you know coming from the

5144
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:51,079
influence that the herb has when I smoke

5145
03:40:49,600 --> 03:40:52,760
and then it's kind of like a wave that

5146
03:40:51,079 --> 03:40:55,238
you're trying to ride because like if

5147
03:40:52,760 --> 03:40:57,439
you hit it at the right way all this

5148
03:40:55,238 --> 03:40:59,639
[ __ ] is bursting out all this creative

5149
03:40:57,439 --> 03:41:01,800
stuff and then you'll put things down

5150
03:40:59,639 --> 03:41:03,398
that you you know can't go back later

5151
03:41:01,799 --> 03:41:05,599
and and understand where it came from

5152
03:41:03,398 --> 03:41:07,238
that all kind of connects and clicks and

5153
03:41:05,600 --> 03:41:09,960
then if there's too much or too little

5154
03:41:07,238 --> 03:41:12,398
you know that's that's what it's kind of

5155
03:41:09,959 --> 03:41:14,159
like for me as I as I use you know herb

5156
03:41:12,398 --> 03:41:16,719
when I when I write and stuff from my

5157
03:41:14,159 --> 03:41:19,520
own experience it's it's the key to your

5158
03:41:16,719 --> 03:41:22,198
door of creativity right it it unlocks

5159
03:41:19,520 --> 03:41:24,760
your door right we all have individual

5160
03:41:22,199 --> 03:41:27,079
doors of creativity that we don't know

5161
03:41:24,760 --> 03:41:29,439
how to unlock it just unlocks and when

5162
03:41:27,079 --> 03:41:30,920
it's there you best bathe in that [ __ ]

5163
03:41:29,439 --> 03:41:33,120
you know because if you don't you're

5164
03:41:30,920 --> 03:41:37,040
going to potentially miss lightning if

5165
03:41:33,120 --> 03:41:39,399
it's just a hum a beat a Melody a lyric

5166
03:41:37,040 --> 03:41:41,359
right you got to immediately jot it down

5167
03:41:39,398 --> 03:41:43,398
right and get you know capture that

5168
03:41:41,359 --> 03:41:44,960
otherwise it's gone to the ether if you

5169
03:41:43,398 --> 03:41:46,358
go to sleep and you don't jot it down

5170
03:41:44,959 --> 03:41:48,599
you're we're not waking up the next

5171
03:41:46,359 --> 03:41:51,399
morning and hearing it right so you know

5172
03:41:48,600 --> 03:41:52,880
when you're in that flow and I found

5173
03:41:51,398 --> 03:41:54,920
that's what I find with cannabis

5174
03:41:52,879 --> 03:41:56,959
cannabis is that key that unlocks that

5175
03:41:54,920 --> 03:41:59,000
door that creativity and that flow if

5176
03:41:56,959 --> 03:42:01,238
you're not ready for it you better be

5177
03:41:59,000 --> 03:42:03,920
ready for it because it's coming and

5178
03:42:01,238 --> 03:42:05,959
inside you it's exactly how I feel so a

5179
03:42:03,920 --> 03:42:08,238
lot of times I'll be driving and I'm

5180
03:42:05,959 --> 03:42:10,318
supposed to have phone calls and I'll

5181
03:42:08,238 --> 03:42:12,520
smoke I'll get really high and I'll hear

5182
03:42:10,318 --> 03:42:14,920
a beat and all of a sudden that's what I

5183
03:42:12,520 --> 03:42:16,520
have to do and I and I'll just I'll just

5184
03:42:14,920 --> 03:42:17,879
write while I drive a lot of my songs

5185
03:42:16,520 --> 03:42:20,680
are actually written on notes on my

5186
03:42:17,879 --> 03:42:22,398
phone hitting the the just repeat over

5187
03:42:20,680 --> 03:42:24,439
again on the instrumental on long drives

5188
03:42:22,398 --> 03:42:26,840
and stuff but you can't lose the

5189
03:42:24,439 --> 03:42:29,000
opportunity if you get that intense

5190
03:42:26,840 --> 03:42:31,840
energy of creation

5191
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:33,879
coming especially if you're you know if

5192
03:42:31,840 --> 03:42:36,398
you're in a musical

5193
03:42:33,879 --> 03:42:39,959
collaboration like I've always said that

5194
03:42:36,398 --> 03:42:42,119
you can't you can't make music with

5195
03:42:39,959 --> 03:42:44,438
people that you can't communicate with

5196
03:42:42,120 --> 03:42:46,880
and like like think about just the sort

5197
03:42:44,439 --> 03:42:49,680
of like the situ sitation where like if

5198
03:42:46,879 --> 03:42:52,318
a guy is screwing your woman you can't

5199
03:42:49,680 --> 03:42:56,760
make music with that guy right because

5200
03:42:52,318 --> 03:42:59,478
you have to be in a place where You're

5201
03:42:56,760 --> 03:43:02,398
vulnerable and sometimes I think right

5202
03:42:59,478 --> 03:43:04,039
Dan sometimes cannabis gets you there if

5203
03:43:02,398 --> 03:43:06,238
you're in a group of musicians and

5204
03:43:04,040 --> 03:43:08,720
everyone's getting high and everyone's

5205
03:43:06,238 --> 03:43:13,760
kind of like on the same wavelength when

5206
03:43:08,719 --> 03:43:16,799
you lower those those guards you can

5207
03:43:13,760 --> 03:43:19,079
really start communicating

5208
03:43:16,799 --> 03:43:21,599
musically with other people in a

5209
03:43:19,079 --> 03:43:24,719
collaboration and that's where the the

5210
03:43:21,600 --> 03:43:26,800
gestal thing comes in the play because

5211
03:43:24,719 --> 03:43:29,079
what you're doing now is bigger than

5212
03:43:26,799 --> 03:43:31,920
just the individual players themselves

5213
03:43:29,079 --> 03:43:35,158
right and so there's this

5214
03:43:31,920 --> 03:43:37,840
communication that happens amongst

5215
03:43:35,158 --> 03:43:41,039
musicians when you're playing in a small

5216
03:43:37,840 --> 03:43:43,520
group and everyone's kind of on that

5217
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:45,159
same kind of wavelength it's really

5218
03:43:43,520 --> 03:43:47,079
exciting when that happens and I think

5219
03:43:45,158 --> 03:43:49,478
think everyone in the Ensemble

5220
03:43:47,079 --> 03:43:51,840
recognizes it and it doesn't always

5221
03:43:49,478 --> 03:43:54,799
happen right but I think cannabis can

5222
03:43:51,840 --> 03:43:56,880
help you get there absolutely it can

5223
03:43:54,799 --> 03:43:58,879
also help you recognize it while you're

5224
03:43:56,879 --> 03:44:01,000
watching and it's

5225
03:43:58,879 --> 03:44:03,358
happening well it also can get you

5226
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:04,959
together to synchronize right I've had

5227
03:44:03,359 --> 03:44:06,318
my band used to practice High used have

5228
03:44:04,959 --> 03:44:09,198
band called Norther kns number five so

5229
03:44:06,318 --> 03:44:12,079
that when we played High we were ready

5230
03:44:09,199 --> 03:44:14,239
for it right you can't practice then go

5231
03:44:12,079 --> 03:44:16,478
play high and you know no if you're

5232
03:44:14,238 --> 03:44:18,840
playing and you're doing it right you're

5233
03:44:16,478 --> 03:44:21,959
hitting a level sometimes right correct

5234
03:44:18,840 --> 03:44:23,920
me if I'm wrong musicians who has not

5235
03:44:21,959 --> 03:44:26,278
astral projected while they're playing

5236
03:44:23,920 --> 03:44:29,359
live literally left their body left

5237
03:44:26,279 --> 03:44:31,359
their being and you're just holding some

5238
03:44:29,359 --> 03:44:35,720
spiritual ground to be there but that

5239
03:44:31,359 --> 03:44:38,199
connection so solid anybody else if you

5240
03:44:35,719 --> 03:44:41,238
stud not everyone understands music it's

5241
03:44:38,199 --> 03:44:45,319
a spiritual thing yeah well closing my

5242
03:44:41,238 --> 03:44:47,719
eyes that is powerful that's well said

5243
03:44:45,318 --> 03:44:50,519
if you study for the test stoned you

5244
03:44:47,719 --> 03:44:55,039
better take the test high

5245
03:44:50,520 --> 03:44:57,279
right yes very true this is very

5246
03:44:55,040 --> 03:44:58,920
true I don't know what happened man I

5247
03:44:57,279 --> 03:45:00,560
really blew that taste well did you get

5248
03:44:58,920 --> 03:45:01,439
did you did you get super high before

5249
03:45:00,559 --> 03:45:05,079
you took

5250
03:45:01,439 --> 03:45:07,520
it oh that's what that was the problem I

5251
03:45:05,079 --> 03:45:11,520
have to admit I did take tests very high

5252
03:45:07,520 --> 03:45:11,520
and did fine on them but maybe not for

5253
03:45:12,879 --> 03:45:19,358
everyone me that's important

5254
03:45:16,079 --> 03:45:21,639
that amongst the players they they they

5255
03:45:19,359 --> 03:45:23,680
told us if you exactly what Mark said if

5256
03:45:21,639 --> 03:45:25,840
you study High you better take the test

5257
03:45:23,680 --> 03:45:30,479
high and that was my TA in my English

5258
03:45:25,840 --> 03:45:33,318
101 I was like oh this is a life hack I

5259
03:45:30,478 --> 03:45:35,000
had life hack how much it was a life

5260
03:45:33,318 --> 03:45:38,238
hack I was learning the probably the

5261
03:45:35,000 --> 03:45:40,238
most the best lesson I ever learned in

5262
03:45:38,238 --> 03:45:45,799
college

5263
03:45:40,238 --> 03:45:45,799
sh I like that dude I like that a lot

5264
03:45:47,040 --> 03:45:51,640
well I can't tell you how many times but

5265
03:45:49,439 --> 03:45:54,120
we would be like drummer would be off

5266
03:45:51,639 --> 03:45:56,198
bass player would be off thing let's get

5267
03:45:54,120 --> 03:45:58,359
take a break smoke a joint and next

5268
03:45:56,199 --> 03:45:59,840
thing you know you're back all in sync

5269
03:45:58,359 --> 03:46:01,120
have that happened especally recording

5270
03:45:59,840 --> 03:46:03,279
when you're in the studio trying to

5271
03:46:01,120 --> 03:46:05,880
record your music you guys got to be

5272
03:46:03,279 --> 03:46:09,800
it's like taking a test High you you you

5273
03:46:05,879 --> 03:46:11,318
jam High you create high you find you

5274
03:46:09,799 --> 03:46:13,358
know you find your verses and your

5275
03:46:11,318 --> 03:46:15,920
choruses you're you find the structure

5276
03:46:13,359 --> 03:46:18,000
sometimes High because you're open in

5277
03:46:15,920 --> 03:46:20,960
that in that realm that space that

5278
03:46:18,000 --> 03:46:23,559
cannabis can help take you um and

5279
03:46:20,959 --> 03:46:26,278
playing long enough you eventually can

5280
03:46:23,559 --> 03:46:28,719
communicate you know telepathically I've

5281
03:46:26,279 --> 03:46:30,600
also experienced this with with other

5282
03:46:28,719 --> 03:46:32,198
you know other teachers and that's

5283
03:46:30,600 --> 03:46:34,439
really important that when you build

5284
03:46:32,199 --> 03:46:37,479
that Rapport our our group has been

5285
03:46:34,439 --> 03:46:40,398
playing um every week and in weekends

5286
03:46:37,478 --> 03:46:42,119
since 2010 so going on 15 years and you

5287
03:46:40,398 --> 03:46:44,519
get to a point where there's such a

5288
03:46:42,120 --> 03:46:48,960
relationship you know cannabis kind of

5289
03:46:44,520 --> 03:46:50,800
keeps that um new and and listening to

5290
03:46:48,959 --> 03:46:53,438
music too I was thinking about that too

5291
03:46:50,799 --> 03:46:56,158
the DJs on the on the on the panel you

5292
03:46:53,439 --> 03:46:57,800
know ganjo can get you to to this place

5293
03:46:56,158 --> 03:46:59,559
where you can hear different things

5294
03:46:57,799 --> 03:47:01,799
almost every time you can listen to the

5295
03:46:59,559 --> 03:47:03,519
Same album same record and there's still

5296
03:47:01,799 --> 03:47:05,679
something kind of new there sometimes

5297
03:47:03,520 --> 03:47:09,359
and it's it's like there's that that

5298
03:47:05,680 --> 03:47:12,199
beautiful um you know Infinity of

5299
03:47:09,359 --> 03:47:15,439
possibilities and and Novelty

5300
03:47:12,199 --> 03:47:17,960

03:47:19,920 --> 03:47:23,040
have had the experience where you've

5304
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:25,479
wanted to you've been turning someone

5305
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:27,399
onto a song and you want them to focus

5306
03:47:25,478 --> 03:47:29,799
on it as much as you're focusing on it

5307
03:47:27,398 --> 03:47:31,519
and really hear what that song is so

5308
03:47:29,799 --> 03:47:34,959
what I would ask each and every one of

5309
03:47:31,520 --> 03:47:37,439
you will go through the list is to what

5310
03:47:34,959 --> 03:47:39,759
is that song that you would like to turn

5311
03:47:37,439 --> 03:47:43,279
on the people that are listening to the

5312
03:47:39,760 --> 03:47:46,880
podcast today for you and uh I don't

5313
03:47:43,279 --> 03:47:49,479
mind uh going first uh something that

5314
03:47:46,879 --> 03:47:51,438
you just it it it's it's like an

5315
03:47:49,478 --> 03:47:55,000
exciting Jam or it's an incredible

5316
03:47:51,439 --> 03:47:58,880
guitar riff or it's a an amazing bass or

5317
03:47:55,000 --> 03:48:00,439
drum beat or you know it could be vocals

5318
03:47:58,879 --> 03:48:02,719
it could be whatever it is that you

5319
03:48:00,439 --> 03:48:06,079
would just love for our audience to hear

5320
03:48:02,719 --> 03:48:07,559
if you had your one song I'm going to

5321
03:48:06,079 --> 03:48:10,600
say for

5322
03:48:07,559 --> 03:48:12,318
me um I'm going to go and this is mainly

5323
03:48:10,600 --> 03:48:13,760
because these are the most recent sort

5324
03:48:12,318 --> 03:48:15,719
of musical experiences I've been

5325
03:48:13,760 --> 03:48:18,238
happening I've gone down this Harry Mack

5326
03:48:15,719 --> 03:48:22,238
Rabbit Hole this freestyle rapper guy

5327
03:48:18,238 --> 03:48:25,680
that's just mindbending on every level

5328
03:48:22,238 --> 03:48:29,760
and I think I was going to say Omega 18

5329
03:48:25,680 --> 03:48:32,840
but what I will say is rap col train I

5330
03:48:29,760 --> 03:48:35,158
think it's his uh rap soliloquies it's

5331
03:48:32,840 --> 03:48:37,158
called rap col train and the two songs

5332
03:48:35,158 --> 03:48:39,520
are called well one is rap col train and

5333
03:48:37,158 --> 03:48:41,639
the other is snake eyes and it's just a

5334
03:48:39,520 --> 03:48:44,880
YouTube video go watch that after you

5335
03:48:41,639 --> 03:48:47,000
take a big rip maybe put the uh uh close

5336
03:48:44,879 --> 03:48:48,719
captions on even though he's very clear

5337
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:51,600
you want to read the words while he's

5338
03:48:48,719 --> 03:48:53,478
saying them and uh let me know what you

5339
03:48:51,600 --> 03:48:56,079
think in the comments sections of the

5340
03:48:53,478 --> 03:48:58,238
video I'm going to pass it on to Dan and

5341
03:48:56,079 --> 03:48:59,879
he's going to let you know what song uh

5342
03:48:58,238 --> 03:49:02,398
does it for him and that he'd really

hear something I like I like to listen

5347
03:49:09,840 --> 03:49:14,238
to it on repeat a lot because you do get

5348
03:49:12,158 --> 03:49:15,959
a different expression of it every time

5349
03:49:14,238 --> 03:49:18,879

5461
03:54:11,000 --> 03:54:16,959
about Morning

5462
03:54:13,199 --> 03:54:19,720
Glory oh boy as a DJ with ADHD I have so

5463
03:54:16,959 --> 03:54:22,000
many songs on my mind right

5464
03:54:19,719 --> 03:54:23,799
now well I'm gonna have to I've been

5465
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:25,879
thinking about it as well as been

5466
03:54:23,799 --> 03:54:27,039
hearing everyone's inputs it's I'm not

5467
03:54:25,879 --> 03:54:30,039
gonna have any bars because it's a

5468
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:31,479
little more modern but I'm gonna say a

5469
03:54:30,040 --> 03:54:32,760
song that I've probably choosen because

5470
03:54:31,478 --> 03:54:35,318
I've been playing it every time I've

5471
03:54:32,760 --> 03:54:38,000
been agitating the biomass to make hash

5472
03:54:35,318 --> 03:54:41,439
with this track it's called Uh Love

5473
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:41,439
Rocket by LS

5474
03:54:42,439 --> 03:54:46,760
dream excellent I just wrote that down

5475
03:54:45,359 --> 03:54:50,000
I'm going to check that out for sure

5476
03:54:46,760 --> 03:54:53,238
little hash making music hey

5477
03:54:50,000 --> 03:54:54,398
yes absolutely okay so but as a DJ do

5478
03:54:53,238 --> 03:54:57,760
you

5479
03:54:54,398 --> 03:54:59,799
have are you playing songs as a DJ like

5480
03:54:57,760 --> 03:55:02,398
I guess it's really I I I'm not a

5481
03:54:59,799 --> 03:55:03,840
musician or a DJ but I I imagine there's

5482
03:55:02,398 --> 03:55:05,398
times where you're playing music for

5483
03:55:03,840 --> 03:55:07,398
yourself and that there's times where

5484
03:55:05,398 --> 03:55:11,119
you're playing music for your

5485
03:55:07,398 --> 03:55:13,238
audience exactly um one thing I love

5486
03:55:11,120 --> 03:55:16,000
about where I when I DJ a lot of like

5487
03:55:13,238 --> 03:55:18,039
quote unquote Underground scenes is

5488
03:55:16,000 --> 03:55:22,559
personally one of my favorite genres to

5489
03:55:18,040 --> 03:55:24,479
mix is house music but I Al also realize

5490
03:55:22,559 --> 03:55:27,559
that not everyone loves that type of

5491
03:55:24,478 --> 03:55:30,318
music so uh one thing I've been doing is

5492
03:55:27,559 --> 03:55:33,079
on my quest to find new tracks I love

5493
03:55:30,318 --> 03:55:35,478
finding like these Bay Area deep sty

5494
03:55:33,079 --> 03:55:39,318
deep house style tracks that have like

5495
03:55:35,478 --> 03:55:41,639
covers of 90 lyrics 90s hip-hop lyrics

5496
03:55:39,318 --> 03:55:43,639
or kind of like it's getting the vibe of

5497
03:55:41,639 --> 03:55:45,000
modern but bringing you back when you

5498
03:55:43,639 --> 03:55:48,119
hear these

5499
03:55:45,000 --> 03:55:51,318
voices nostalgic

5500
03:55:48,120 --> 03:55:54,760

version of the track that they just

5585

5597
04:00:04,439 --> 04:00:08,680
group of people with us over 300 people

5598
04:00:07,000 --> 04:00:10,959
that have watched for the last four

5599
04:00:08,680 --> 04:00:12,359
hours as we've been uh hanging out and

5600
04:00:10,959 --> 04:00:14,919
shooting the [ __ ] and talking about

5601
04:00:12,359 --> 04:00:16,840
music and cannabis and the sort of

5602
04:00:14,920 --> 04:00:18,920
connection between those two things

5603
04:00:16,840 --> 04:00:20,359
which uh is the sort of theme for this

5604
04:00:18,920 --> 04:00:23,639
week's show all of us have a deep

5605
04:00:20,359 --> 04:00:25,760
appreciation for both cannabis and music

5606
04:00:23,639 --> 04:00:28,760
and I liked how there was sort of Reggae

5607
04:00:25,760 --> 04:00:31,439

5611
04:00:36,158 --> 04:00:40,279

5612
04:00:38,199 --> 04:00:43,158
