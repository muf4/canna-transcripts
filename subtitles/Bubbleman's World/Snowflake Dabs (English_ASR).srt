00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,239
all

3
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:29,118
right hey welcome to Bubble man's world

4
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:31,159
everybody it is snowing like crazy it's

5
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,759
been 24 hours or less since I did the

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,280
last video of being out on my deck and

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,280
it was beautiful and sunny and I was

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,039
sitting in my

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,320
t-shirt and uh well now it's not now

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,399
it's cold and snowy and I thought what a

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,558
cool little video if we came out and did

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,558
a sort of contrast video one

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,840
second all right sorry about that had my

14
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,280
son in the other room going off so I

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,399
think we're just going to get a dab done

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,439
here try to get a little dab off the

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,439
slab here that's actually a very large

18
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,718
dab but you know what

19
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,280
I say it might be Wow Let's Not Be

20
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,960
exaggerating it's certainly not going to

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
be the last dab of 2016 as we're still

22
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:15,679
quite early on in the day but it could

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
be one of the biggest of this particular

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,759
day I got it I didn't think it was going

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
to work I'm not going to lie I was

26
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,159
getting a little nervous as it is Snowy

27
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,519
out here very very snowy nice big flakes

28
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,759

34
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,759
immediately you know we got to do a TP

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:49,640

36
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:53,079

50
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,439
yes all right

51
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:02,719
W that was

52
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,239
killer only thing left to do is clean

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,239
the

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,599
Dabber not the Dabber sorry the Banger

55
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,079
only thing left to do is clean the

56
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:20,919
Banger and it is outside the

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,920
Banger don't see that too

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,878
often was such a big one it dripped over

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,039
top so we'll make sure we get all that

60
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,000
cleaned

61
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,679
up thank God for the DC glass cleaner

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,639
man I am loving this

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,920
[ __ ] it cleans glass better than

64
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,759
anything I've seen clean glass yet now

65
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,559
only hot hot quartz hot glass cleans it

66
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,280
beautifully sorry not hot glass because

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,640
if you actually put this stuff onto Hot

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,438
Glass I'm sure you'd have a very bad

69
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,279
time but quartz and its ability to

70
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,799
withstand thermal shock is is a safe as

71
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,280
safe can be

72
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,680
so I'm going to call it a day at that

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,158
coughing coughing coughing great little

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,680
TP dip there with you and uh yeah just

75
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,878
thought I'd show you guys the contrast

76
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,000
which can happen on this deck in less

77
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,199
than 24 hours so thanks for watching

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,620
Bubble man's world and we will see you

79
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:32,969
