14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,280
I've had a great relationship with him

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,959
over the years and I I I like to say I

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,480
helped Mentor him in learning how to

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,759
make hash and selling him bags and kind

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,119
of being a good buddy to him uh he sent

19
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,960

20
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,799
refrigerated he sent me another one um

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,480

23
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,518

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,440
refrigerated one this one feels like

25
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,438
it's been more just at like

26
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,079

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,279

30
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,879

32
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,118

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,920
the utter the the highest level and I

37
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,239
thought on my anniversary I should be SM

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,960
smoking something high level so without

39
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,039
further Ado I'm planning on opening

40
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,478

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,320
what is in these I have no idea he sent

42
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,519
me the two boxes uh they are marked one

43
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,559
of 20 both of them so you can see that

44
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,280

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,560

spectacular try not to uh ruin the tape

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,919
too much and see if we can't just slide

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,598
this box out of here nicely without

54
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,000
destroying it I don't think it's going

55
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,679
to happen I think we're going to have to

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,919

57
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,040

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,120
short of Epic the strawberry banana

99
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,959
Ultra premium collection would not exist

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,879

101
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,240

right here uh that are going I love the

178
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,879
the glossy finish on this you can see

179
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,360
whenever I hold it up it actually shows

180
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,720
me reflecting inside from my phone

181
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,080
that's filming me right now well let's

182
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,599

183

live hash Rosen strawberry banana so

187
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,598
I've got two of these here a damn I

188
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,800
guess I better turn on the

189
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,519
denail it'd be weird to do this video

190
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,079
and not have a little dab so we're going

191
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,598
to do that get the dunk tank and the

192
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:30,318
marbles out get the

193
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:32,559
uh get the TP slurper into the pipe

194
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,599
right boom boom boom got a little turb

195
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,319
Slurp in action and then we're going to

196
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,278
drop that right

197
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,479
into the universal heater which is right

198
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:46,679
here so give that a few seconds to heat

199
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,440
up it takes usually no more than a

200
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,519
couple minutes I'll turn on the Temp

201
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,200
Tech and uh just want to shout out

202
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
concentrated X this is a really nice

203
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,480
gift dude and I apologize for holding on

204
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,679
to it for a whole year before I actually

205
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,680
opened it um you you've been nothing but

206
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:06,519
a gentleman and a scholar you've been an

207
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,000
absolute bubble ambassador of the

208
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,919
highest level for a very very long time

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,278

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,360
legal end in the legal world but I'm

216
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,200
guessing uh South Park would probably

217
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,839
sue me if I put things like this on my

218
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,879
package but uh just going to give it the

219
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,480
old thumbnail

220
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,039
twist

221

230
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
getting concentrated X bubble if it's

231
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,360

of this uh you know globbed into one

236
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,519
piece it usually happens within 5

237
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,600
minutes of leaving it at room

238
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,759
temperature which Hopefully this wasn't

239
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,759

247
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,879
of 20 or number 20 out of 20 the fact

248
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,120
that you sent me 1 out of 20 was special

249
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,559
and I'll never forget it I'm going to

250
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000

253
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,439
uh I'm definitely going to be enjoying

254
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,000
uh the flour as well which is not

255
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,920
something you'll hear me say very often

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,200
and I love the little coin I think

257
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:18,759
that's really cool dude and I've just

258
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:23,040
been super stoked to be a part of um of

259
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:25,278
your journey a part of your journey

260
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,078
so I don't know where to start I guess

261
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,399
I'll probably start oh jeez how do you

262
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,799
not start with a full Mount bubble how

263
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,679
do you not start with the full melt

264
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:37,120
bubble it's just uh let's see if I can

265
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,799
get a little bit out without uh ooh my

266
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
God yeah this

267
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,319
is this is

268
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,120
insane this is absolutely

269
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,680
insane so we're going to Chisel some off

270
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,639
going to drop it into my hand a little

271
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,559
bit and then we're going to

272
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,680
make with just with the warmth of our

273
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,239
hand I'm going to take that that little

274
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,078
bit and I'm going to put my thumb on

275
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,720
that give it a little

276
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:09,638
twist and it just disappeared

277
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,519
basically oh

278
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,079
baby we'll get that onto the end of the

279
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,639
Dabber it's not a huge dab but it

280
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:20,039
definitely shows that there is a quality

281
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,799
there that

282
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:25,000
is really second to none so I'm going to

283
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,198
end up smoking this whole jar got a

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,958
little party to go to tonight butth for

285
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:31,559
now we'll start with a little tiny dab

286
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:35,759
Maybe I'll dip that in there and get a

287
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:38,838
little bit more of the fresh headies on

288
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:42,519
there that sounds like a plant isn't

289
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,720
it oh yeah that made it a little bit

290
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,120
little bit nicer I just coated it in

291
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,360
more pure

292
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:54,000
heads more pure heads oh in the

293
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,000
meantime we get this

294
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,838
sitting make sure it's in my

295
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,919
freezer I have a little free are sitting

296
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,920
on the side of my

297
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,919
uh that's not the right

298
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,559
way okay you know how sometimes you go

299
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,198
to put a USB in and it's like no it

300
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:16,278
doesn't oh this USB has been

301
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:18,799
crushed that is probably why that is not

302
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,439
opening

303
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:24,879

perfect so we'll just put those in there

308
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,720
for now that's how you preserve

309
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,639
incredible quality hash uh

321
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,480
this piece of plastic and you can't even

322

if it'll be a type of contest or what

334
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,078
it'll be but I really got to say that

335
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,958
that

336
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:51,919
is a level of class I have not yet seen

337
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,719
in the hash world so once again shout

338

342
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,278
unit that uh I'm guessing I'm probably

343
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,039
in line for a nice little dab here dab

344
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,039
is going to absolutely crush me which I

345
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:17,360
love I'm very happy about

346
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:19,159
that um yeah I turned off the the alarm

347
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,120
on my dab right so you won't hear it go

348
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:24,799
off but it is at 550 now so bubble hash

349
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,120
I'll always hit a little bit warmer than

350
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,120
rosin Bona petite if you're joining me

351
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:46,318
I

352
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,199
mean let me tell you

353
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,639
something that right there is what it

354
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:58,599
was always about for me that

355
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,919
almost what wants to close up your

356
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,278
throat

357
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,559
it wants to make you close your eyes it

358
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:08,120
wants you

359
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,919
to go in in a very very very deep way

360
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,078
just dunk tanking my Banger here give me

361
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,078
a

362
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,399
second I've been in I've fallen in love

363
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,240
with full out bubble from the day I

364
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,519
first tried it and it's not to say that

365
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,720
I don't absolutely love and appreciate

366
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,399
the rosin I think rosin is spectacular

367
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,360
it's a great way for us to take our

368
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,440
bubble that is subpar non full melt

369
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,199
bubble

370
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
and get it into a product that makes it

371
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,120
and elevates it to a point where it's

372
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,360
still very beautiful and I've said this

373
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,799
before rosin really seems like a dessert

374
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,959
to me that seemed like a five course

375
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:47,318
meal the quality of the

376
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:50,919
high and the the insulation of the high

377
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:53,919
and how sort of thick and and deep that

378
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:55,719
it goes it's not a surface High it

379
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,679
really is like a four to five course

380
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,000
meal the

381
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,958
flavor was the most incredible

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,679
strawberry banana if any of you know DNA

383
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,678
genetics and you know the cut strawberry

384
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:09,279
banana you've probably seen a variety of

385
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:13,240
phenos the pheno that concentrated X has

386
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:15,720
picked and found um is spectacular truly

387
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,558
the photo right when you see how bright

388
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,679
the bananas and the strawberries look

389
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:24,119
that is what it tastes like it's very

390
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:27,038
very profound it overtakes your palette

391
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,759
very quickly my favorite part of it is

392
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,839
on the exhale where I can't even

393
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,440
describe what I feel in my throat but it

394
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:37,399
almost feels like the way you feel right

395
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,360
before you pass out unconscious right

396
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,840
before you lose Consciousness that sort

397
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:46,959
of maybe it's a surrender I'm not sure

398
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,519
possibly um as you're exhaling that full

399
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,519
melt bubble it left very little Chaz on

400
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,679
the Banger I mean it cleaned in the dunk

401
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,240
tank very clean I do have a little bit

402
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,000
of cleaning on this Banger to do it's

403
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,279
not quite as clean as you know you've

404
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
got a little bit of build build up of

405
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,038
oil here that doesn't get cleaned in the

406
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Banger um that doesn't get cleaned in

407
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:08,400
the Banger basket sorry got a nice

408
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,079
little high going on yeah that was

409
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,120
wonderful that was exactly everything

410
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,038
