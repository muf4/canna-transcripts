00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:15,620
it's a little sapphire or quartz ball

161
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:18,320
that goes in route correct in the first

162
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,060
gen of the d-mail top I mean the second

163
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,420
generation of D nail tops had that hole

164
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:26,778
in the top and so does this one the new

165
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:29,838
core I guess it's a the Beagle made this

166
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:32,000
one so this actually has a hole in the

167
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
top too so it causes a rotation there

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,490
are this is the alpha or the beta run

169
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,528
actually will have a handle on it so

170
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:43,190
it's pretty awesome just got the other

171
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:44,990
day so trying it out and give it a very

172
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,140
nice ya know I was stoked when I saw

173
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:52,850
those I hit for the first time a say

174
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:54,949
what was it it was it was a red I want

175
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,519
to say Ruby but I don't know if it was

176
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,520
