00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,400
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world I

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,400
am sitting out on my deck today because

4
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,839
For the First Time in about a month it

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,320
is beautiful and I do mean beautiful I'm

6
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,359
not just sitting out in a T-shirt shirt

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
it's actually t-shirt weather it's got

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,600
to be 12 to

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,239
15° Celsius I don't know what that is in

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,399
Fahrenheit but by all means Google it

11
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,238
translate it figure it out it's got to

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,600
be 60° maybe 70 I don't know probably

13
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:48,558
not quite 70 anyway I thought uh I was

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,280
on my way home and I saw some beautiful

15
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,119
waterfalls and some beautiful ocean

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,280
front and I saw a Cypress Mountain and I

17
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,839
thought I need to make a video I'd love

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,679
to be hitting all these spots and of

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,079
course I didn't hit any of those spots

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,558
but here we are beautiful day you can

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,400
hear the melt in the background and you

22
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,719
hear the water running through the E

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,880
system of the house tons of snow down in

24
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:13,039
my front yard still but turning into

25
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,158
liquid quickly so I of course have the

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,479
new Mothership pickup give thanks to

27
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,640
high integrity glass art for the drop as

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,920
always uh for all your Mothership needs

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,359
here in British Columbia beautiful

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,000
little um you know sand blasted frosted

31
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:33,640
if you will mini uh with the new style

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,519
thick big beef cake ofz which fits on

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,239
just

34
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,959
beautifully um smoking a little bit of

35
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,919
MK Ultra bubble hash from the West Coast

36
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,478
concentrate boys and I really like um

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,118
the base of this particular rosin

38
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,438
doesn't have a very like overly strong

39
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,799
flavor to it like sometimes the MK Ultra

40
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,519
can very cushy so it's a good base for

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,039
me to be able to hit all these wonderful

42
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,519
tpin that I have from Blue River so a

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,118
gift from Tony uh the lemon tree not

44
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,920
carrying that one up on my website

45
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,560
unfortunately but all the rest from the

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:13,199
starg to the

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:15,519
Clementine to the Jack Frost to the

48
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,639
Tangi and we're on to the last two

49
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,439
Sunset sherbet and last but certainly

50
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,598
not least the three times crazy which is

51
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,959
I think what we're going to be dipping

52
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:27,679
right now a little bit of the three

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
times crazy clean this Dabber make sure

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,959
it's as clean as clean can be one thing

55
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,598
about the glass Dabber give it a wipe

56
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,560
each time I don't want any little

57
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,079
microscopic hairs or remnants of

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,598
anything that's non- resin non-

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,120
glandular on the end of this thing so

60
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:46,639
got a nice little dab

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,680
here get that it's pretty cold out here

62
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,158
so even bending this dab around the

63
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,239
Dabber and yes I will use my fingers

64
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,399
because it is my dab after all don't

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,878
need to have gloves for my own dab get a

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,400
nice big dip of the three times crazy on

67
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:05,560
there and we're going to go to town get

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,319
this up get that

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,318
opened and get this torch

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,840
going and as always what comes in handy

71
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:18,439
when you're using these quartzes a lot

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,319
of people ask how long do you heat it

73
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,560
for how do you know how long to heat it

74
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,878
for well I just follow the time you know

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,360
I heat it up for a certain amount of

76
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,000
time with the torch and once it gets to

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,799
that time I stop

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,598
I think my torch might even be dying

79
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,438
right

80
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:40,598
now it's hard to tell yeah it's dying

81
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:40,598
all right I'll be right

82
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,000
back all right so we got the torch

83
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,039
stopped and now we're going to take a

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,598
lovely lovely rip through this uh Frost

85
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,120
little mini it's got a real nice hit to

86
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,438
it I've hit it probably about a half a

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,719
dozen times so far shared it even on the

88
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,199
channel I just love the little size you

89
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:16,279
know 5.5 in looks so nice in the Sun and

90
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,560
just feels great you know like even

91
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,159
between the fingers it feels solid it's

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,759
uh we were talking today at the cchq

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,919
when we had it down we were hitting it

94
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,560
without touching it and we realized that

95
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,240
it doesn't even really tip when you put

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,800
your mouth on to it it doesn't have much

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,360
of a tip at all so it's pretty sweet

98
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,560
pretty

99
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,759
sweet all

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,759
right another 5 seconds and we're good

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,759
to go here we go

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,639
nice puddling in effect there got a nice

103
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,199
puddled out

104
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,560
rip and the beauty of that is that it

105
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,759
really cleans nicely with the Q-tips and

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,079
once you

107
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,319
uh yeah once you get in

108
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,879
there you can do a real nice job on

109
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,199
cleaning and that to me the you know

110
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,719
that whole not that I'm religious but

111
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,199
cleanliness is Godliness statement is uh

112
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,479
somewhat true to me keep your stuff

113
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,199
clean much more

114
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,000
enjoyable each rip give it a nice clean

115
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,240
no matter who's hitting it always give a

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,639
nice fresh

117
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,960
clean and uh I guess that's about it I

118
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,918
just really wanted to share a bowl with

119

127
