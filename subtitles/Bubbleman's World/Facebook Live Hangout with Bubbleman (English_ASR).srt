24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,439
talk about today I don't know I just

25
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,039
actually got a

26
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,478
text from Eugene Monroe he's the NFL

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,118
player for the Ravens that donated

28
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,039
$80,000 to promote cannabis as a pain

29
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,280
medication as an alternative to opioids

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,479
uh we've got a good conversation that

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
we're going to be having with him next

32
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,400
week and we're excited you know I was

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,600
unfortunately sad to see that the Ravens

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,040
let him go today really unfortunate they

35
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,559
said something like his his cause isn't

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,600
our cause when uh it really should be

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,240
their cause because the bottom line is

38
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,239
these football players are being drugged

39
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,759
but with opioids they're being sent out

40
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:33,839
onto the field to destroy themselves and

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,719
the bottom line is is that cannabis can

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,640
work wonders for pain management and it

43
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,438
can also be a preventative for them as

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,478
well so yeah he did indeed but watch

45
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,239
more things from from Mr buo bubbly as

46
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,118
Eugene Monroe calls himself that's his

47
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,158
nickname boo bubbly huge uh bubble hash

48
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,239
fan and a fan of uh all the things that

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
Tony and myself have been doing so we

50
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,599
are looking forward to having a good

51
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,759
conversation with Mr Monroe and it's too

52
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,359
bad that uh that his team the Ravens

53
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,478
just didn't stand behind because the

54
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:08,000
guy's doing historical work so that's an

55
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:10,679
NFL players exactly it is all about the

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,479
money yeah exactly Chile you know drug

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,560
them right up it's that's the thing when

58
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,399
they say they're worried about them

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,159
being high on the field they're already

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,879
high on the field high on opioids and uh

61
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,878
that's kind of a bit of a dangerous game

62
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,479
I think it's time to get ready for a dab

Luis Warez he's got this two posts

182
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,120
coming out of the sea with a hammock in

183
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,639
the middle and uh it's got to be one of

184
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,319
the most beautiful uh you know tropical

185
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,319
photos I've seen in a long long

welcome to the poy is it synthetic

188
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,000
Sapphire or how are they sourcing the

189
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,478
material they are growing the sapphire

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,439
they literally grow these

191
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,439
dishes how [ __ ] cool is that

192
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,759
yes I think Blue River

193
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,959
extract.com sells uh he ships to the UK

194
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:43,000
Canada we do not ship to the UK as of

195
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:46,119
yet but soon one day I'm looking forward

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,120
to uh breaking

197
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,600
out happy day Jake lemier I think we

198
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,720
need to have another dab although that

199
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,560
dab really did get my eyes watering that

200
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,639
was a lot of hash and a lot of rosin and

201
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,759
a TP dip it was definitely the way to to

202
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,000
go what else we got over here we got

203
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:08,078
some purple

204
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,320
candy well I like purple candy welcome

205
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:12,159
Ross Kaplan Ross is a friend of mine

206
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,800
from outou East he's going to be making

207
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,759
his way across the country in the near

208
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,919
future and coming for a little visit to

209
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:21,159
BC been looking forward to that always

210
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,399
nice to have friends from out in the

211
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,000
world come

212
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,639
by stuff is a little bit little bit

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,159
buttery so we're going to need to put a

214
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,039
little maybe a this can tonic resin on

215
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,078
there just

216
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:38,039
to secure

217
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:40,278
it there we go I hate when it Butters up

218
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:43,078
and then it just it doesn't want to dab

219
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,480
it just wants to you know look like that

220
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,799
so you got to get a mixture in there

221
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,720
once you dip it into the turps ah one

222
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,519
thing about this is the one nice thing

223
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,639
about the butter is is that when you dip

224
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,720
it into the turps it literally absorbs

225
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:00,919
the turps whereas the shatter it kind of

226
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,519
just gently slides out on the

227
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,278
outside I'm working on that Josh I'm

228
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,120
working on that right now as we speak I

229
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:10,679
actually have to go to the courts either

230
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,759
today or tomorrow to get some documents

231
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,359
and I'm working on it DOC keeps saying I

232
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,958
smoke marijuana and weed I correct him

233
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
refuse to call it cannabis yeah well

234
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,599
docs don't always know what are the best

235
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,320
temperature ranges for concentrated tpin

236
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,959
that's totally personal and it'll change

237
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,399
depending on what surface uh you're

238
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,000
hitting if you're hitting on are you

239
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,440
hitting on titanium are you hitting on

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,958
quartz are you hitting on Sapphire are

241
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,160
you hitting on ceramic or perhaps

242
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,559
silicon carbide all of these different

243
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,799
surface areas will have different

244
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,958
temperature sweet spots for tarpine

245
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,399
concentrates so I think the best way to

246
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,559
do it is you know start around 400 and

247
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,440
move your way up to 600 and find your

248
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,479
sweet spot cuz it's definitely going to

249
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,959
be in between 4 and

250
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,839
600° hey right on Jeremy Smith glad

251
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,838
you're digging them let's do another

252
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,240
rip TP dip oh what did I TP dip I TP dip

253
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:05,359
[Applause]

254
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,159

00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,958
Victor do you use RO water for bubble

258
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,720
has I've used all sorts of water for

259
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,000
bubblehash I love to use RO water I love

260
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,440
to use distilled I love to use Creek

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,759
Water I love to use pure artisian spring

262
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,800
water I have used Lake water I have used

263
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,240
water from waterfalls I have used Waters

264
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:34,078
from Rivers I will use water from a

265
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,039
dirty nasty shitty City if I have to if

266
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,359
I'm forced I'm not going to not make the

267
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,360
hash just because I don't have the best

268
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,159
water but uh using the best water is

269
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
obviously great when you can Creek

270
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,879
water's proper spring water's proper Ro

271
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,000
waterers proper hard to beat Ro but if

272
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,519
you don't have a big Ro machine and you

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,440
just want to make a batch it's not going

274
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,440
to be the end of the world let's hit it

275
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,799
o I can't tell you how good that tasted

276
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,799
that was

277
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,559
unbelievable that's Pure Heaven that is

278
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,479
pure

279
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,319
Pure Heaven I can't even believe how

280
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,560
good that tastes I just want to keep

281
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,560
hitting

282
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,278
it snow water's nice but you got to be

283
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,799
careful with snow water you really want

284
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:50,360
to make sure you're in a really clean

285
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,559
environment because snow when freezing

286
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,440
in the air will pick up contaminant

287
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,799
that's in the air all sorts of nasty

288
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,480
debris and dirt that's above cities we

289
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,359
get the snow from up on wood Whistler

290
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,039
Mountain uh up on the peak as well as um

291
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,199
the Black Tusk which is about another

292
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,919
mountain range south of Whistler

293
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:11,039
Mountain in the Tantalus range and the

294
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,559
Black Tusk has incredible snow when you

295
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,559
melt it it melts into clear water and

296
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,159
that's always a good thing to do with

297
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,759
your snow take it and put it in a clear

298
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,198
glass of water put it on the window sill

299
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,480
let it melt and and look at it

300
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:25,399
afterwards is it clean or is there a

301
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,920
bunch of particulate floating and some

302
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,159
sitting on the bottom of the water cuz

303
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,759
you do not want that particulate that's

304
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,759
sort of product will sink in your bubble

305
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,120
bags and it'll end up contaminating your

306
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,958
final product Shout out to S who just

307
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,360
came into the room brother from another

308

00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,559
think we ever had a

316
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,838
disagreement in all the years we've

317
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,399
known each other I can't picture s

318
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,920
getting mad at

319
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,039
[Laughter]

320
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,198
me always smiling yeah everybody say hi

321
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,198
to

322
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,399
S Tony braa started Blue River are you

323
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,679
kidding me that's his company Tony is

324
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,078
Blue River I can give you a quick

325
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,519
breakdown on how fast it happened he was

326
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,638
playing around and doing little things

327
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,519
but he wasn't quite on the right path K

328
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,600
from triome Technologies called me one

329
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,919
day where are you K where'd you go oh

330
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,600
here we are here's K right here so K

331
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,039
from triome Technologies called me one

332
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,839
day and he said Bubble man you need to

333
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,838
get on the water hash water tpin the

334
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,720
tpin that are escaping into that water

335
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,920
you need to capture those and get it

336
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,120
back into your hash it'll be the future

337
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:58,159
of of of

338
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,120
hash I took that information and I said

339
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,639
to Tony you know what this tpine thing

340
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,480
is the real deal Kay's been working on

341
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,720
it for a while um I think that you you

342
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,759
know if we could figure out how to get

343
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,560
the tping out of the water it might be

344
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,278
something that uh we could you know

345
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,479
really move forward in the industry and

346
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,439
Tony was not really super interested in

347
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,800
that but I did tell him about the tpin

348
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,759
that day and I swear less than a week

349
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,958
later he had tpin like a week later and

350
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,399
that really was the start of him making

351
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,239
tpin and he started you know first he

352
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,679
started with a simple steam distill

353
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,759
which anyone can start with you can make

354
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,679
your own tpin they're just a they're not

355
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,600
really a true molecule they're more what

356
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,078
we would call an artifact not an

357
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,399
accurate representation of the molecule

358
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:44,078
itself but more like a shadow of what it

359
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,519
once was due to the cause of the heat

360
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,958
affecting and and changing uh the

361
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,639
molecules then he learned to get into

362
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,638
some different processes and I'm sure he

363
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,919
must have gone through uh like a hydro

364
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,440
diusion or a vac diffusion there's all

365
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,799
sorts of different things that people do

366
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,759
in the world of chemistry and you can

367
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,159
just Google it up we've posted some of

368
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,639
them in all things tpin uh Hydro

369
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,399
diffusion vac diffusion steam

370
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,959
distillation uh cold trapping uh people

371
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,000
are cold trapping from slabs that are uh

372
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,479
Ved out in ovens or freeze dryers these

373
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
are all different ways that people are

374
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,240
doing it and then of course Tony's

375
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,278
invented his own way to create uh the

376
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,399
brand of Tarin that he has now which is

377
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,240
kind of why Blue River is a a bit a bit

378
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,360
Standalone is right now there's not too

379
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,720
many companies in the same um in the on

380
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,720
the same level level and for me I just

381
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,079
asked him hey you know Canadians need

382
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
this product as well I'd love to

383
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,198
represent Canada I mean I'd love to

384
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,519
represent Europe for that matter I'm I'm

385
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:43,679
a proponent of the Blue River tpen so I

386
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,198
started my company Blue River extracts

387
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,519
Canada just a couple of months ago and

388
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,120
the website's up Blue River extracts. CA

423

hash Church telling their stories and uh

428
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,640
yeah cuz people need to be inspired

00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,439
every day of the week that is for sure

430
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,679

439
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,759
it yeah well Christopher has a crazy

440
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,440
inspirational story so does Alex they

441
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,558
both their stories need to be told I

442
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,519
don't even know their stories like super

443
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,798
intimately but I know the brief cliff

444
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,359
notes of their stories and they're

445
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:55,319
definitely like there'll be stories that

446
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:58,199
you all that you want to hear for

447
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:00,599
sure send me a message man it's I just

448
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,960
forget sometimes and I don't have

449
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,558
relationships with you guys where I'm

450
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,079
talking to you every single day so

451
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,480
Sundays come and go real fast for me so

452
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,720
if you guys can book one it'll just make

453
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,400
it easier for me where even if they're

454
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
different ones just let me know us

455
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,120
Sunday that you can come and you can be

456
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,519
on and then I'll pen you in and it's

457
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,798
it's very important for the audience

458
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,158
that when you say you can you're going

459
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,000
to be there that you make the point on

460
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,679
being there that you make the point on

461
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,079
having a headset that you don't come in

462
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,519
on a phone but you come in on a computer

463
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,798
and even maybe check a day or two before

464
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,798
Sunday we can do a little uh you know

465
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,839
pre-run where I open up a Google Chat

466
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,720
and I send you the link and we make sure

467
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,599
that you can get in without your

468
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,000
microphone ringing and bleeping and all

469
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,359
these different things that sometimes

470
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,240
end up happening on hash church so I'm

471
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,479
trying to end up or making it a little

472
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,679
bit more professional but like I say

473
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,519
this is not my profession I'm a hash

474
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,880
processor that just happens to had to

475
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,798
have learned photography so I could show

476
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,520
you the photo so I could show you what I

477
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:59,079
was dealing with and what I was making

478
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,879
you know the the purity of it and

479
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:04,199
whatnot and now the videographing and

480
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,440
the audio and the directing of like a

481
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,679
live show or producing it just becomes a

482
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,320
lot uh to try and um to to try and deal

483
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,000
with okay that's a great question Chase

484
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,720
will Blue River turps evaporate if the

485
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,079
lid is left off for hours okay I'm not

486
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,279
going to be sarcastic when I ask you

487
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,879
these questions

488
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,119
but Tarin are volatile so they're almost

489
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,799
evaporating at room temperature so yes

490
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,959
is the answer right off the bat of

491
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:31,558
course they will and in fact even being

492
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,519
left at room temperature versus being

493
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,639
left in a fridge or a freezer will

494
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,158
change their

495
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,600
reaction when you leave the lid off and

496
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,520
you can smell the Turpin in the air

497
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,480
that's answering your question for you

498
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,240
the fact that those molecules are

499
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,440
continually continually escaping out

500
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,880
into the air into the atmosphere and

501
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,640
that you can smell them that's the

502
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,240
that's how you know they're evaporating

503
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,960
that they are escaping and if you keep

504
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,679
the lid on and you can't smell them well

505
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,679
then you know they they are where they

506
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,640
belong TP

507
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,320
derp can you vote for a Canadian for US

508
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,919
president I don't think so dude I'm sure

509
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,158
that if they could you know what [ __ ]

510
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
that our prime minister he seems like

511
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,080
he's a good dude but I don't know if

512
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,319
you'd want him to be your president cuz

513
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,158
uh he people have are having a problem

514
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,439
with him right now and he's you know he

515
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,720
went and said he was going to do all

516
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,880
this stuff for cannabis and now he is

517
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,200
putting it into effect but unfortunately

518
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,640
people are still being arrested for

519
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,319
cannabis and that's something that we

520
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,799
all feel that maybe right off the bat he

521
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,158
should have quietly told the RCMP and

522
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,879
and the policing listen no more busts

523
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:42,320
for cannabis possession now I understand

524
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,840
making that a public statement would be

525
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,399
crazy because people would just all open

526
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:48,199
up dispensaries and selling weed

527
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
everywhere because people are gung-ho to

528
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,080
make what they can make off this before

529
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,840
it changes and I had this sort of

530
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,278
discussion earlier with someone saying

531
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,199
oh they're going to lock it all up

532
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:57,720
they're going to own it all they're

533
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,038
going to make all the profit and I was

534
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,200
like okay first of all who is they

535
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:05,319
second of all who [ __ ] cares who

536
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,200
makes the profit if it's accessible to

537
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:10,158
everyone like if I could buy uh high

538
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,759
quality resins in all sorts of different

539
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,640
cultivars uh land race uh and long

540
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:18,480
flowering uh cultivars included and they

541
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,559
were at a reasonable price I would be so

542
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,558
happy to do that because I know how hard

543
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:26,158
it is for me to collect keep CL keep

544
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,119
clones alive oh now I'm a mothering room

545
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,240
and then flowering and vegging now I'm a

546
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,199
vegging room and a flowering room plus a

547
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,759
mothering room well that's a full-time

548
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,720
job let alone being a father having uh

549
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,400
businesses all of these other things I

550
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,519
need to do it's not that easy to do he

551
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,798
should stop the arrest absolutely but

552
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,558
making it a public statement people

553
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,519
would go [ __ ] nuts Alexi they would

554
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,720
be like selling everything everywhere

555
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,278
look what happened when they gave

556
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,120
licenses to grow cannabis just licenses

557
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:57,278
to grow cannabis for our own personal

558
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,278
needs look how much that changed

559
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,400
everything that dropped the price of

560
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,480
weed because those licenses all that

561
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,759
herb that was grown got put into the

562
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,558
black market which of course those

563
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,319
licenses were never to sell the herb

564
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,798
they were only to grow the herb and use

565
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:14,639
the herb as medicine and it was

566
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,558
unfortunately that very action that

567
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,679
undermined the entire mm program and had

568
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:22,000
us you know basically have to fight for

569
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,600
our right to grow again while [ __ ] it

570
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,759
up for everyone else I don't mind

571
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,079
telling you every single person who had

572
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,960
an mm license and was selling that herb

573
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,158
for profit shame on you not because I

574
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,000
think it's wrong to sell herb for profit

575
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:36,760
I think that's a great thing to do but

576
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
don't [ __ ] do it under the guys of a

577
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:42,798
federal exemp license that people need

578
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,679
and require just go do it and break the

579
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,480
law the way we used to that's that you

580
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,278
know if you have to if you have to make

581
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,798
profit off of cannabis and you can't get

582
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,159
a license to sell it legally well then

583
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,240
obviously what you're doing is you're

584
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,919
selling it illegally and I believe in

585
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,519
practicing Civil Disobedience and I

586
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,960
believe that obviously the compassion

587
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,639
clubs need to have their medicine

588
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
acquired from somewhere but I'm just

589
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,440
like it's a it's a tough point of

590
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,000
contention with me where so many people

591
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,200
sold so much of their weed from the mm

592
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,359
that they they pulled the mm license and

593
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,679
then even those same people would always

594
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,278
say well I hope that they're going to

595
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,759
grandfather Us in and I'm like

596
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,798
grandfather you in shame on you they

597
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,158
can't be grandfathering anyone in this

598
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:27,200
has to be for everyone everyone has to

599
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,799
have the ability to get this if they

600
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,278
want it now trust me most Canadian

601
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:34,798
citizens do not want to have to grow

602
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,000
their own cannabis for medicine

603
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,599
guaranteed they want to have access to

604
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,880
it just like they have access to their

605
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,480
everything else they buy their food and

606
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,840
their clothes and their alcohol and

607
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,960
there everything we buy for the most

608
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:51,720
part comes from large companies you

609
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,519
might want to support a smaller uh Craft

610
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,360
Company that's great Bubble Bag started

611
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,359
out as a small craft company now we're a

612
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,038
larger company well we still love

613
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,759
getting support we are a corporation we

614
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,519
don't want to be called evil because

615
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,599
we're a corporation I I donate money to

616
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:09,119
the right things I give medical

617
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,000
discounts and sometimes people lose

618
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,519
sight of the fact that if you can be a

619
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,159
corporation you can be fairly big and

620
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,679
you cannot be evil it's okay I don't

621
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,360
know how Mark emer's doing up here in

622
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,080
Canada I think he's damn happy to be

623
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,240
free from prison and be with his

624
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,000
beautiful wife jod and have his

625

wonderful businesses that they that they

626
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,640
both have and he seems to be pretty

627
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,319
happy but I don't hang out with him on

628
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,679
the regular I very rarely see him I did

629
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,398
uh talk briefly to jod today about maybe

630
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,000
throwing a tpine party at cannabis

631
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,359
culture who here is from Vancouver I'd

632
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,640
like to see where you guys are all from

633
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,278
if you don't mind just typing where

634
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,278

635
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,480
right

636
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,000
now it'd be great to see if we had a

637
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
couple of vancouverites in the room

638
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,960
because I do want to get your idea about

639
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,319
a potential Blue River tpine party I've

640
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,120
had medical discounts 25% from day one

641
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,798
of my company day one

Growers for the BC Compassion Club I

645
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:09,798
procured cannabis for the BC Compassion

646
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,600
Club at a loss for the whole time that I

647
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:13,558
procured I would never make profit off

648
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,079
the BC Compassion Club it was just not

649

have a little session and we went and

674
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:17,558

678
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,480
you absolutely don't know maybe less so

679
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:27,720
for you I don't know cuz you might feel

680
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,480
that you know me better than I know you

681
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,440
cuz you watch all these videos and you

682
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,200
you've you've seen me talk on hash

683
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,919
Church etc etc but for me it was

684
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,679
definitely trippy what's up Kyle chain

685
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,278
happy birthday on the 29th there brother

686
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,080
it was it was neat for me to meet

687
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:43,398
someone that I absolutely did not know

688
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,480
and then just have a session and a

689
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:47,918
conversation with them uh I don't know

690
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,720
about TPS on eBay Jamie Jamie James

691
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,519
Jamie house I would stick to Blue River

692
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,839
if I were you obviously I'm biased um I

693
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,880
don't trust a lot of folks out there in

694
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,558
the extraction world uh they all say the

695
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,960
same thing their [ __ ] is the cleanest

696
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:03,918
the cleanest the cleanest and uh well it

697
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,000
just can't be that way not everyone can

698
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,320
have the cleanest so some of them must

699
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,519
be wrong um I got my camera for the very

700
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:13,599
reason to show the cleanliness and the

701
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,558
purity of what I have the ability to

702
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:19,879
accomplish missed out on the tur party

703
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:21,558
in Barcelona dude Adam it was a good

704
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,440
party we're going to do a better thing

705
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,240
next year though honestly we should we

706
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,320
should talk actually cuz DNA might want

707
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,599
to be a part of that if we could get

708
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:32,158
sort of like the the dabbable product to

709
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,000
be like a strawberry banana or a Tangi

710
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,640
or whatever Kosher Kush get two or three

711
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,278
varieties of you know some of the [ __ ]

712
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,960
that's grown down there and produce like

713
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:45,278
a little Blue River bubbleman brand DNA

714
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,200
[ __ ] the party I think the three of

715
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,200
us could kill it bro talk to Don and

716
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,360
Aaron about that because um they're

717
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,240
welcome to be a part of it we're going

718
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,759
to do it regardless and of course

719
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,120
they're invited but I like the idea of

720
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,519
seeing their name up there and I like

721
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:01,479
the idea of the base material IAL that

722
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,120
we're dabbing being DNA genetics that

723
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,519
would uh that would go very well what do

724
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,918
you guys think about that those turs

725
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,000
don't lie

726
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,759
bro those turps do not

727
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,398
lie that's a fact of

728
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,919
it

729
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:18,278
sangi sour

730
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:24,519
Tangi

731
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:28,640
oh DNA tur party uh-huh no Blue River

732
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:31,038
DNA bubble man turp party

733
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,519
so let's let's keep make that sure in

734
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,480
fact I think the bubble man name should

735
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,839
go in the front what do you guys say

736
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,278
totally K kidding I'm a humble pie guy I

737
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,000
would put my name right at the back no I

738
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,278
don't think it would be at lalada again

739
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,759
I think we would up it if I got it to

740
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,798
the point where it was Blue River bubble

741
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,240
man brand and DNA we would make a point

742
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,398
on getting a really [ __ ] not saying

743
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,440
that L lalada isn't a great venue those

744
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,839
people are [ __ ] incredible awesome

745
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,080
people they were so uh just really

746
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,879
amazing hosts uh their resin quality it

747
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,720
was just very like the the it's an

748
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,480
Italian place and they smoke an enormous

749
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,440
amount of cigarettes in there and it's

750
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,120
just not the exact Vibe I want for an

751
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,679
updated version of the party nothing

752
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,398
against those guys I'd throw a party at

753
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,720
their place again for sure but I think

754
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:21,918
for this particular Blue River party uh

755
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,600
we would find uh another

756
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,200
venue I need to buy an eail and glass

757
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:27,759
where should I buy online well Heath you

758
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,200
know and a lot of people might flip out

759
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,440
from me saying this um it really depends

760
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,360
on your level now my mentor for instance

761
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,440
um now I never I always supported the

762
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,278
most expensive [ __ ] Mothership glass for

763
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,240
[ __ ]

764
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:44,599
$4,000 uh denail with the quartz for for

765
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,319
900 or whatever the 1100 the the 2.0 I'm

766
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:48,359
always down with getting the best of the

767
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,558
best of the best and that's what I

768
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,918
promote but I do realize that some

769
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,599
people are not it's not viable for them

770
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,200
to go and spend $6,000 on their email

771
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,678
and and pipe so so recently the West

772
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,159
Coast concentrate guys I went over to

773
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,000
their place and they they have the

774
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,320
dhgate motherships for $30 and I puffed

775
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,119
out of them and I was like wow like I

776
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,319
have to admit like I'm not going to go

777
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:13,119
buy one but [ __ ] it sure got me dabbed

778
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,839
out and sure got me bubbled up and I

779
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,199
ended up telling them if they could

780
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,278
order one of those with an email that

781
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,200
was literally like $30 or something for

782
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,960
my mentor Ron because he's hard on

783
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,840
things he's he's clumsy he's going to

784
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,159
break the [ __ ] pipe for sure

785
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:30,398
eventually so a $30 pipe for him to

786
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,720
break is no problem in the meantime he

787
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,158
has that pipe right now he is loving it

788
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,120
he's got a cheap little electric nail he

789
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,039
is loving it he paid he paid a hundred

790
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,879

confident to use it as a carb cap and I

825

942
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:00,358
there's some good people Alex finle and

943
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,519
Greg deot um the 710 crew I London would

944
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:05,838
be another easy place to to to link

945
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,358
people up with I do generally like to

946

know the people I'm linking people up

947
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:14,960

948
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,039
do it's a good thing to do on cannabis

949
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,639
Liberation day I think I need one more

950
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,400
rip you know I think it's I think it's

951
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,960
happening here let's give this dish a

952
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,960
little oh my god did that ever clean

953
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,960
amazing

954
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,439
got to be careful when you're using the

955
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,679
Q-tip and you spin it the wrong way

956
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,679
because you can loosen this

957
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,519
dish and you don't want to

958
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,399
uh loosen a red hot

959
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:46,519
dish

960
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,079
because it could fall off and break and

961
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:50,880
you'd be doing the Hot Potato holy

962
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,800
[ __ ] [ __ ] don't want to do that all

963
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,838
right let's have a rip now that she's

964
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:01,000
