know what nothing like oh I first thing

66
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,679
I'm looking at and you notice how that's

67
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,039
the first thing that you did is you

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
protected myk yeah I understand I know

69
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,560
it was like I didn't think you were

70
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,199
going to bang it but I figured just in

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,959
case my hand would be there I've got the

72
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,238
flower matate as well as the mighty

73
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,959
vaporizer as well that we're going to

74
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,959
bring with us on our journey John's got

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,598
some beautiful Jamaican from uh The

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,640
Strain that I gave

77
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:13,039
him uh jeez V last last May it's been

78
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,238
about a year maybe a few months after I

79
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,318
cracked this this was the first plant

80
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,439
that I found it looks super dank and

81
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:21,919
beautiful real nice lime green color a

82
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,878
very almost odd smell and taste I can't

83
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,958
I don't even know how to describe it I

84
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:30,199
need to get back to know it it was

85
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,199
almost minty when you opened that

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,158
oh very nice we've already squeezed a

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,319
little bit through uh and made some

88
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:40,318
rosin and we've hit that already but uh

89
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,958
I have not hit this Barb so why don't I

90
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,280
do that you hit Barb no I just mean now

91
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,799
we we filmed this once already and the

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,560
mic wasn't working so now this is our

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,840
second attempt at it it's a little bit

94
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
different than it was the first time you

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,878
guys will never know what we said the

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,879
first time because we we won't even know

97
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,158
I don't know lip readers might know you

98
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:02,078
know what so you can do little cut no

99
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,359
I'm

100
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,480
Kidd oh here's some other hash I wanted

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,439
to press this out too so so what's been

102
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,280
happening is pressing out Tash is what's

103
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,078
going on um pressing I was thinking

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
about pressing pressing this is some

105
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,799
really nice 45 smell this I was think

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,478
about maybe pressing that for us to try

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,120
that that's I got so much of it I got

108
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,560
like that's the stuff that presses the

109
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,280
best for me I'm telling you so I'm more

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
getting into pressing the cash now cuz

111
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,000
for me all I've been pressing is Bud as

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,240
you can see um well it'll be a good idea

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,360
actually let's press some of that

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,000
because I forgot to mention um uh the

115
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,919
gentleman I can't remember his name now

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,918
his name is dank Supply Company at least

117
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,439
one of his companies he's got this cool

118
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,279
kind of logo on the T here he sent me a

119
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,000
couple of these Tes sent me a cool

120
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,079
t-shirt as well I'm I'll wear it one day

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,240
and and and mention him but he sent me

122
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,198
some of these sarama pens which are

123
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,560
similar to a Trippy Stick at least by

124
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,960
appearance in to the The Minis and uh he

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,519
just wanted us to try them out so I

126
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,519
wanted to give you one you can give it

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,359
your honest opinion that's so

128
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,839

let you know uh I mean aside from 5

130
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,560
minutes ago when I gave it to you and

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
then I know and I was surprised then I

132
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,160
was going to say it's my birthday but

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,840

134
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,680

135
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,799
cool right like yeah it's nice to get

136
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,720
the gift you know I love to destroy pens

137
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,000
I mean see whats I'm really hard on them

138
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,919
too I have to admit I still have found

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,680
trippy and Apex to be the ones that I

140
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,519
usually roll around with but uh um I

141
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,079
tried boss boss uh recently it worked

142
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,839
pretty good until I broke the globe I

143
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,120
saw you had a broken Globe over there as

144
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,318
well several I've broken the the glass

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,280
on most of the unit so I'm not calling

146
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,319
out any one company they're all you know

147
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,439
doing their best and it's really all

148
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,319
about doing research uh there's so many

149
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,199
different pens I personally don't think

150
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,840
of a pen as something that I want to use

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,038
every day but in my life when I'm not

152
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,918
around this and then I'm out and about

153
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,959
and maybe the torch just ran out at that

154
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,959
point it becomes a great option or if

155
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,079
I'm in a concert or concerts that's what

156
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,000
has been the key player lately I'm

157
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,279
meeting maybe meetings were good too

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,360
Safeway Lup you know Safeway lineup

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,199
for the pen so uh we give you thanks

162
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,400

163
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,400
tuned for that and what do you think

164
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,879
let's go eat this pizza and head to Hope

165
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,159
I think that's a great idea all right

166
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,839
cool let's do it actually after a rip

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,520
you showed me this dry sift this was the

168
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,560
combo yes no h H what's that um that

169
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:37,079
would be the

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,240
HPS uh Barbara and that would be the LED

171
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,279
Barbara that one way pressed up this

172
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
here is the

173
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,638
Congo yeah this is

174
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,280
Congo your LED is way way stronger of a

175
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,560
smell I know that's what I say it's it's

176
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,359
got so much that's what I was but there

177
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,439
is but there is way more of it too h no

178
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,639
but it was like that when I I even got

179
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:04,439
more resin from the LED it was was quite

180
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:06,918
surprised I got like 2.4 G uh of uh LED

181
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:11,519
uh sift and uh like static clean and I

182
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:14,159
got 1.1 of the HPS and I found uh it was

183
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,959
a real learning experience to be honest

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,720
um I I I spent six months on that

185
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,560
project and uh I I learned uh that um

186
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,400
like the medic Kush with the Daner buns

187
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,240
didn't give me the yield that I was

188
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,959
getting in the resin as in when I have

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,280
the two different there uh I get more

190
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,159
rosin from the HPS with the kushes but I

191
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,598
get more resin with the um like the

192
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,360
Barbara with the Congo with the My

193
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,878
Little Pony but so always best to have

194
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,598
them both so so it's really it's it's

195
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,879
it's really dis playing it's I'm just

196
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,639
seeing right now the variety of Lights

197
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,280
maybe and not choose one over the other

198
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,680
I just tested six plants the light to

199
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,758
see if it worked yeah that was the first

200
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,400
test and uh so you know what it's

201
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,240
working so um now it's uh dialing it in

202
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,279
and learning more about it so uh I'm

203
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,120
sure they're changing new bulbs already

204
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,918
and they come up with different this and

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
that and yeah I see Brad Higgins always

206
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:10,878
posting unique things about bulbs oh

207
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,400
yeah watt bulbs and stuff like e yeah he

208
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,280
got some cool stuff definitely well

209
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,878
we're going to head off on this

210
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:20,839
adventure we'll bring you guys with us

211
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,840
so get ready I'm doing a rip

212
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,958
guys this the

213
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,360
view we got the

214
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,319
river the bubble

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,440
man so we're heading up to a waterfall

216
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,839
yeah very good we were a little bit

217
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,200
worried we didn't have have a torch this

218
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,800
is the endless problem with dnails not

219
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,000
having an inverter to run the power of

220
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,120
the denail or not having a torch to heat

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,839
up your nail we've got the denail no

222
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,959
inverter we've got the the dabs no torch

223
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,480
so luckily I remembered that I had

224
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,958
grabbed the mighty and the flower mate

225
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,959
so we've each got our own vaporizer

226
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,838
John's got some beautiful herb and we're

227
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,078
still going to head up here I don't know

228
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,880
why we feel so compelled to have to Puff

229
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,078
for these videos but I guess it is a big

230
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:32,838
part of the videos the puffing aspect of

231
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:35,479
it so we are going to have our Puffs and

232
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:39,839
we're going to head up there so yeah

233
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,839
join us it's going to be a

uh maybe set up a little session over on

258
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,480
this

259
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:22,240

talking about it's kind of Hardcore to

266
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:39,519
have a little bike like this Trails

267
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,320
literally right over

268
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,360
here Silver Lake angling regulations

269
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,160
release all fish bait bands single

270
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,240
Barbie's hook all

271
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,958

right

273
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,119
well we're going to set ourselves up

274
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,559
here and we'll see you guys uh in a few

275
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,198
seconds

276
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,198
hey guys all right we found ourselves a

277
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,758
nice little Lake here Silver Lake and uh

278
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,958
we looked everywhere for a torch we

279
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,639
looked everywhere for a inverter to

280
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,958
power the dils that are in the truck

281
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,720
over there we didn't find one he even

282
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,599
stopped by my dad's house we did we even

283
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
stopped by John's dad house he

284
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,879
apparently brought the torch and the

285
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,160
inverter to Uma umaa Yuma apparently of

286
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,480
all the things I don't even know where

287
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:30,439
the hell that is but sounds like it's

288
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,480
hours away so we decided with the flower

289
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,920
mate and the mighty so these two little

290
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,519
Dodgers are going to be our sessions do

291
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,319
you have a preference here Johnny B um

292
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,799
you know what closest one to me yeah

293
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,399
whatever you like um which was kind of

294
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,879
funny is as I was running out the door I

295
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,639
grabbed a medtainer that had butd in it

296
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:48,600
perfect cuz that's exactly what we need

297
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,680
right now a medtainer full of Bud

298
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,519
so good on you oh do you want to just

299
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,439
squeeze it up and break break it up in

300
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,600
your medtainer style you know what I

301
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,279
guess we're just going to grind it get

302
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,879
us some pow pow get us some pow pow man

303
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:01,879
beautiful mountain Mountain back here on

304
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,240
the back side like that is some epicness

305
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,600
for

306
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,278
certain think P right into the mighty

307
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,120
there too won't it yep there's actually

308
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,720
a piece that they that it comes with a

309
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,919
little sort of plastic grinder piece

310
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,600
that screws into it and then it's got

311
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,278
the grinder that fits on top of it and

312
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,199
you just grind it right into the unit

313
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,759
but uh I just always used the medtainer

314
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,599
and just kind of done this going to like

315
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,560
okay that one just goes oh that's I like

316
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
this look at

317
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:30,559
that yeah I can tell you how that works

318
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,758
too yeah yep so you got uh I've never

319
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,439
tried these before so it's pretty

320
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,959
cool your herb will go in there okay

321
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,720
you'll just screw that on top of it

322
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,359
you'll hit this three times it'll turn

323
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,839
on and then I think you hit it a couple

324
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,639
more times each time you want to raise

325
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,160
the temperature of 5 or 10° okay so to

326
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,480
to raise the temperature and yeah that's

327
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,759
hey you know that's can we can we stop

328
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,519
stuff on there t no no the one thing fit

329
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,919
in else you got in there so I just

330
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,078
turned the mighty on pretty simple push

331
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,439
the side button the digital display

332
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,599
turns on uh it's in both Celsius or

333
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
sorry it's in the the the temperature

334
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,920
that you want is in the bottom and then

335
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
the temperature that it's at is on the

336
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:14,399
top so you can see it going from 63

337
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,120
upwards to climb towards 203 so got this

338
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,039
one on celsi so this one's a quick three

339
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,120
clicks yeah let me just make sure one

340
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:25,439
two

341
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,759
three 1 two 3 4 five it was five so

342
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,759
there it's

343
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,839
blinking so I believe it blinks

344
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,560
until it gets up to temperature okay and

345
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,319
then um once it gets up to temperature

346
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,638
you can hit it a few more times uh and

347
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:44,439
you'll change like it goes It goes from

348
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,318
Blue it goes from uh blue uh to red or

349
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,279
to Orange to Red so you're knocking over

350
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:51,958
your buds there or what that's what

351
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,600
happens when you don't put the the the

352
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,679
lid yes back on I guess the lid won't go

353
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,680
on without this piece on that would be

354
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,519
nice if it had the Dual lid properties

355
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,439
though three part system did you have

356
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,679
butt in here already uh yeah I put some

357
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,439
in there oh okay great so perfect that's

358
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,439
going to go like that and one two

359
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:20,838
three all right there's yours good nice

360
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:24,240
mine is just getting up to 200°

361
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:26,838
now so mine's good to go

362
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,400
right should be getting there

363
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,279
yeah oh yeah

364
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,679
right

365
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:37,079
away nice nice flavor I like

366
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,480
this I like them both that one was a

367
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,079
little more confusing for me cuz it took

368
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,240
me a while to realize I could tap it a

369
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,480
few more times and get the temperature

370
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,839
up but this one's just really easy cuz

371
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,079
it tells you literally you're at 199

372
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,079
you're at 200°

373
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,480
C it's kind of nice sitting here doing a

374
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,000
nice V way pin on the lake beautiful

375
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,759
view it's nice out it really is I mean

376
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,159
I'm definitely uh I've never been to

377
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,640
this Lake before so this is actually a

378
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,320
first for me coming to this particular

379
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
Lake little bit more of Johnny's

380
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,158
neighborhood than myself so uh he

381
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
pointed it out and said we should make

382
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,840
it up here you know what when we drive

383
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,000
out we'll uh take a look at that little

384
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,439
waterfall that we talking about that

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,079
sounds great I'm sure you guys want to

386
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,159
check it out there are so many endless

387
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,879
places in British Columbia just like

388
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:32,919
this literally any River any Lake

389
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,919
any sign that you see to a waterfall or

390
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:38,799
is generally going to be of of of epic

391
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,240
epic Beauty you know not just uh not

392
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,599
just your average but really beautiful

393
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,880
oh yeah there's tons of nuggets down

394
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:48,319

they they sit right in nice on the Moss

396
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,399
though don't they and what's really nice

397
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,640
is because these are all Little Rock

398
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,880

406

swim that'd be nice a little bit cool

407
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960

408
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,399
summer we're close we're getting really

409
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,840
close to the summer right now that's for

410
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,038

ones but there is one right in behind us

417
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,279
over here that's covered in snow so it

418
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:47,679
just depends on how high up you go you

419
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,678
can usually find it even in

420

Avalanches we'll just be staring at the

447
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,759
mountains and then all of a sudden

448
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,639
you'll just see a little Avalanche start

449
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,879

469
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,159
adventure well guys we just had a funny

470
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,918
experience we just rolled up to the

471
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,840
Cactus Club one of the all-time

472
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,720
favorites for food on the west coast

473
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,759
here pretty delicious menu I would say

474
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,038
wouldn't you it's an awesome menu we'll

475
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,440
show it we'll show you some of the food

476
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,000
when we get in there I don't usually

477
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,200
share too much food when we're eating

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,440
but we'll do that and uh what did we

479
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,440
find

480
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:02,639
John in the door of my truck a small can

481
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:06,038
of of butane and a blowtorch I had the

482
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,799
mother ship and the DC Banger so I

483
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:11,200
suspect he had some rosin and some dry

484
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,720
sift I've got some of uh LH and some

485
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,319
full melt I guess we're hitting a few

486
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,839
bowls here in the parking lot before we

487
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:18,839
go in well you know what we missed it on

488
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,199

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,919
too mad to heat up the nail it is the

500
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,079
best part about

501
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,759

them um you know what they're probably

510
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,480
puffing yeah worst case scenario they

511
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,200
aren't and they could just whatever

512
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,200

515
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,558

516
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,240
real she's having a cigarette she can be

517
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,039

518
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,079
like she might

519

and and just quite nice it's beautiful

542
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,398
just like that I think we're going to

543
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:54,959
follow it up then w we we talking about

544
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,959
that and how search about you know a lot

545
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,120
of people try not to cough for a minute

546
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,519
but when you're smoking the half

547
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,278
and the Epic you don't cough you don't

548
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,679
have to worry about trying not cough not

549
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,359
unless you take some you know oversized

550
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,798
rip that's really you know it's going to

551
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:12,319
make any any person cough we're not

552
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,480
really doing that we're just kind of

553
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,038
lightly

554
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,240
medicating lightly medicating micro dabs

555
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,079
really I mean not really micro dabs cuz

556
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,240
the these are much bigger than the dabs

557
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,599
I give don't worry I'm going to scrape

558
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,159
that off for your hit I know I'm to a

559
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,439
smile on my face when I just saw that I

560
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,080
was like that's going to be nice I could

561
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,880
have helped you out with that that's

562
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,519
okay if you notice it sits perfect on

563
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,080
the three the back two prongs I love

564
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,679
that un I definitely like this little

565
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:39,519
unit it's um I'm going to cool this off

566
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,798
quite a bit more for the um the LH due

567
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,000
to the fact that it doesn't really

568
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,879
bubble it's already the oil melts

569
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,038
obviously because it is a liquid already

570
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,799
even if it's a solid it still becomes a

571
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,919
liquid instantly water hash and dry sift

572
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,918
has the wax membrane that wax membrane

573
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,880
takes a little bit of time to break down

574
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,000
start boiling and then gain access to

575
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,240
the inside so I think it's always a

576
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,960
better idea to leave it a little bit

577
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,319
longer than you would with the uh with

578
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,440
the dry SI or the wet wash not the rosin

579
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,759
though what's interesting

580
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,120
is I never really used to let it cool

581
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,720
down I justed to hit it really hard all

582
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:13,439
the time and learning from what

583
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,200
everybody is doing it's just the best

584
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,240
part is is really is is going down to

585
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,319
those temperatures even trying lowering

586
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,720
my Dil the other day down to 500 and

587
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,798
then I was turning it off and I got

588
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,798
really nice hits around 630 it was

589
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:27,319
really tasty so I was finding some new

590
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:28,918
temperatures for myself too that was

591
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,480
literally a perfect

592
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,399
hit I just took I think Horatio would

593
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,399
even be proud of me well you know what I

594
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,158
guarantee Horatio would be

595
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:41,439
proud I mean he's it's it's like his

596
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,760
baby he's a scientist he sits at home

597
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,519
and spends hours and days doing things

598
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,038
and thank God he's doing the good work

599
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,119

602
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,120
in the upcoming months I don't know

603
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,399
exactly what he has to share it's always

604
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,000
on Horatio's terms I just eager to to

605
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,359

00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,839
of like listen we really got to leave

652
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,080
and get there now especially cuz we were

653
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,439
going to have a wicked session when we

654
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,240
got there but also cuz our friend was

655
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,759
waiting for us yes so without further

656
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,519
Ado tell us what you got going on here

657
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,158
dude cuz this is all new I'm actually

658
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,399
glad you brought your older unit with

659
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,799
you mhm uh we had to revamp it and give

660
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:24,918
you all the stuff that was missing that

661
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:28,599
we came up with lately so we have we

662
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:30,960
have the V4 which is ATT attachable to

663
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,959
to my you're already ex unit you put

664
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,000
this here and the carb cap is directly

665
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,519
on top of it like this that I like so

666
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,679
you put it on our new sublimator

667
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,558
glass that's pretty sweet yeah yeah it's

668
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,000
all heavy glass uh it works with

669
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:44,720
anything works with the sublimator or

670
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,240
you can actually smoke out of it if you

671
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,960
still desire to and uh yeah basically

672
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,880
that's it so uh what we do is we'll take

673
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,640
like a t of a gr because it also worked

674
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,320
with weed so you can see so you've got

675
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,159
this thing all heated up and ready to go

676
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,879
absolutely I'm sorry I was waiting for

677
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:00,039
you so I have nothing to do so oh of

678
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,320
course I'm going to jump in there all

679
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:04,319
right John so I'm going to move this for

680
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:08,200
you right here so you can try it

681
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:12,759
without so now you're on low T oh

682
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,038
yeah nice nice nice That's good oh you

683
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:16,720
got your carb cap you would you still

684
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:17,960
lift it out or just lift the carb cap uh

685
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,759
you can lift the carb cap or lift the

686
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,558
whole thing out it's up to you either

687
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,440
way whatever your too you went too slow

688
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,158
on the on the in on the intake Johnny

689
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,558
too slow that was perfect it was perfect

690
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,640
for you oh yeah

691
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,720
so tell there is a particular

692
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,240
particularity to the sublimator and I

693
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,600
know where enrio is coming from because

694
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,599
I find myself when I use it and I get

695
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:44,199
everything right I'm super happy then

696
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,439
when I don't do it right and it doesn't

697
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,240
work I'm like oh [ __ ] what the why is

698
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,399
this thing not working and every single

699
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,480
time it's happened it's been my own like

700
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,719
lack of paying attention to a certain

701
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,639
variable like you saying leave the carb

702
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,600
cap on I can guarantee you I would have

703
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:01,278
left that off yeah a lot of people do

704
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,599
leave it off but if you leave it on

705
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,839
you're just going to have a different

706
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,119
Thermo thermodynamic to your unit if you

707
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:09,798
have a carb cap that is cold and you put

708
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,119
it on that which represent about 15% of

709
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:13,720
the mass represent uh in front of you

710
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,558
here and you put a cold cold carb cap on

711
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,038
if you'll cool off you'll cool off your

712
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:19,038
unit right away you want to have the

713
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,558
same uh effect that if you just lift it

714
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:26,278
up and once you put your organic or your

715
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:27,720
soft organic or or or or hard or resin

716
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,119
uh once you put your carb cap on top it

717
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,440
will create another reaction on top by

718
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:35,239
having the the the cap also heated up by

719
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,360
also oh I can't speak today what's wrong

720
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,159
with me no

721
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,918
but no I got you and and for for me one

722
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,760
of the things I noticed in a in a big

723
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,880
way where a lot of people thought that

724
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,480
it was all about the sublimator wand and

725
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,760
I kept trying to explain to people I'm

726
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,558
pretty sure that bowl is as as important

727
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,359
that is the because I always noticed if

728
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,678
I didn't keep this that perfect

729
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,918
temperature you'll just vaporize yeah

730
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,840
this was just to keep it at that

731
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,320
temperature and get it to that

732
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,000
temperature but most people really think

733
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,839
this wand is the sublimator unit no the

734
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,240
sublimator the wand is actually the

735
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,278
first the first part of heating up the

736
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:16,278
heating up your your uh your herb and or

737
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:18,798
your concentrate and uh mixing it with

738
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:21,359
the the most like the highest how can

739
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:24,759
you call this the mixing it with

740
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:27,678
the the most um what do you call this um

741
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:29,960
the most thermal radiant that you can

742
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,080
but passing it through a lot of uh it's

743
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,399
a little too hot for us right now so I'm

744
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,038
going to bring it down a little B

745
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,638
apologize oh man that was a beautiful

746
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:41,079
head unbelievable like for how well it

747
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:44,918
vaporizes or sublimates I guess is more

748
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:48,439
of an accurate term but it really

749
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,960
is quick and fast and it gives this

750
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,440
punch that you're kind of you just don't

751
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,840
get from most units you know what I've

752
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,000
been having fun with I've been throwing

753
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,879
my 25 hash in there that doesn't melt in

754
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,558
the bottom oh yeah and that kind of

755
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,919
stuff well it's like a pre this is like

756
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,558
also a rosin machine in a sense except

757
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,440
you can just hot air extract your rosin

758
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,038
it creates it creates rosin as you go if

759
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,798
you don't use if you don't use um if you

760
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:17,000
do not use um if you do not use a like a

761
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,839
a BHO or anything like this and you just

762
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,359
use your flowers what you will

763
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,839
recuperate from here is uh is quite

764
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,240
delicious it's going to be for more and

765
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,879
this is nice and open so I guess you

766
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,000
just pull out the plug that the bowl is

767
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,039
going into and dip in with a little dab

768
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,398
tool yeah for this one yes normally on

769
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,278
our units yeah on our units like this

770
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:38,678
one here you actually we actually have

771
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,119
like a a little uh okay do you have one

772
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,919
of these uh no would you have one of

773
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,319
these I wouldn't say I'll you up right

774
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,000
now give a little shot so let me see

775
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,000
that little guy so there you go your oil

776
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,679
actually accumulates here and you can

777
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,599
redab your oil and like I'm saying if

778
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,880
you're using only herbs no hash nothing

779
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,918
just herbs the the the the resin rosin

780
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,559
that you'll get out of there the

781
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,080
extraction the

782
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,798
the re uh the re condensation of the

783
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,359
fragmentation the fraction that we're

784
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:08,838
doing here is uh is delicious it's just

785
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,440
delicious I'd go as far as saying it's

786
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,759
even ridiculously medicinal cuz it is

787
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,480
the very thing that I used to remove a

788
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,839
big nasty mole on my neck two

789
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,440
applications 5 days it fell off dude

790
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,878
really this mole dried up like a raisin

791
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,440
and fell off with rosin with the reclaim

792
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:26,679
out of my sublimator bro you got to be

793
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,000
kidding I'm not joking I've told the

794
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,079
story like 10 times it's a true story

795
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,239
even my wife and when I say fell off

796
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,839
like with surgical Precision there's no

797
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,358
there's no Mark I just I took off the

798
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,599
Band-Aid and I was like w where is it

799
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:42,078
and then I looked in the Band-Aid and it

800
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,960
was there the mole that was on my neck 5

801
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,839
days prior wow with that uh reclaim and

802
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,440
but I was mostly hitting herb and hash

803
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:52,639
so it was a concentrated version of

804
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,720
those two you know yeah resins just

805
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,399
building up in it and I just never have

806
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,439
the chance like you to have like quality

807
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:01,838
hash so I'm just like with herbs I I got

808
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,159
good hooks for good herbs but the ash is

809
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,719
just a way out of my uh you got to you

810
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,000
got to do you got to be professional

820
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,279
yeah and Kelly from neutral life who I

821
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,960

828
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,199
first 10 the first like you're hitting

829
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,960
the king's hits exactly that's what I

830
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,519
normally do that's very

831
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,159
nice like yeah not that normally Mark I

832
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,838
can speak very well I don't know why

833
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:56,399
today you're asking me question and I

834
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:58,799
feel like I'm a little bit you know on

835
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,880
the slow side I think you're doing fine

836
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,359
man we're all getting sublimated up yeah

837
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,119
and yeah you were talking about Kelly

838
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,480
Kelly neutral life my associate yes 35

839
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,599
years in the business first uh first

840
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,159
hydroponic shop in uh Canada I believe

841
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,680
that's pretty incredible if I'm wrong uh

842
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:17,159
somebody uh he's definitely goes way

843
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:19,159
back I think I first met him 25 plus

844
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:22,719
years ago through one of my mentors Ron

845
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:24,399
hickey who also owned a a shop in

846
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,639
Manitoba a couple of shops called

847
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,240
Nature's nutrition back in the day so

848
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,719
that was uh

849
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,479
these guys are the old school guys that

850
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:34,199
have been doing this for a while

851
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,199
pioneering this

852
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,880
[ __ ] well nice and Blaze they'll tell

853
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,920
you that much the sublimator never

854
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,680
denies you of an extreme go bring it a

855
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,920
little harder if you don't mind there

856
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,159
you go now we're going to get you a real

857
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,159
good

858
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,400
hit I don't know you guys do that man

859
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,199
that was a good

860
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,720
one super tasty on that

861
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,960
what uh how many temperature notches did

862
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:05,598
you turn that down uh no I put it to six

863
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,240
uh for this one I put it to six um last

864
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,119
one though the first one that we hit the

865
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,279
first one was uh the thing is I first

866
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,800
heated it with the torch so I was a

867
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,079
little bit uh a little bit lost on where

868
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,640
I should go but you know what we should

869
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,440
try right now was it a little too hot

870
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,159
Mark yeah no that was perfect the first

871
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,960
one was a little bit too hot that one

872
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,559
was like full tpine deep in my lungs

873
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,880
rocker of a hit I'm satiated I'm

874
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,358
wonderful John you want to do a big one

875
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,039
Bree hard if you know a little bit

876
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,239
faster it shouldn't be too much hard and

877
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,559
fast hard and fast there you go I swear

878
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:37,838
it always affects you in a different way

879
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:40,199
when you puff uh instead of the way you

880
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,519
would the way someone requests that you

881
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,000
puff it's quite a nice uh uh change of

882
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,559
pace if you can just you know get out of

883
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,159
your comfort zone and go here and I'll

884
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,119
puff like this I'll never forget the

885
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,000
first time I hit Horatio's

886
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,519
LH and he was like all right I want you

887
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,039
to take a real slow long hit it'll take

888
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,759
about 20 25 seconds hold it in for a few

889
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:04,079
then exhale I never hit like that but I

890
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,960
did for him and it uh it rocked me I'll

891
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
tell you the difference uh the reason

892
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,159
why I'm I'm telling you to breed a

893
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,280
little faster is just because we have a

894
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,719
lot of mass and this thing is like a if

895
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,000
you if you don't cool The sublimator

896
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,239
Works a little bit differently is you

897
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,679
have so much hot Mass when you put your

898
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:22,439
100 milligram of organic if you don't

899
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,679
cool it off with air Som yeah there a

900
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,519
sweet spot you have to throw a little

901
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,039
bit more hard uh breid a little more

902
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,519
arer to go through the atomizer also if

903
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,960
you make it [ __ ] atomizer at the certain

904
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,119
at at the proper PSI will you have a

905
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,720
better uh atomization of your or

906
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,599
fragmentation of your product your

907
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,759
product does have in in common with mine

908
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,400
I have to say you give yourself a nice

909
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,359
one here um what I find it has in common

910
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,280
with bubble bags is that the users

911
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:51,199
really are required to learn how to use

912
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,880
the unit and use it properly because if

913
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,759
you don't it doesn't give you the

914
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,240
same benefits you know I'm always most

915
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,960
stoked hitting the sublimator with enrio

916
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:04,000
because he knows how to use it

917
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,119
perfect so but it's pretty simple once

918
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,960
you got it you need about like two three

919
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,200
HS and then you got it for sure you got

920
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,039
it I mean like for the dab it's not very

921
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,118
difficult you just put it at the it's

922
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,800
just with the herb with the herb depend

923
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,200
if you have the dab master or this one

924
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,079
this one's a little bit more mass the

925
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:22,118
thermodynamic is different we got to

926
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,160
work at a lower temperature and how

927
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:28,358
often will this turn off every hour but

928
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,719
if you just do this uh uh see he had a

929
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:31,838
little

930
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:33,439
normally wow it doesn't he doesn't even

931
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:36,199
turn off right now in front of me oh

932
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,838
just because I I broke that little knob

933
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:39,639
Ah that's what it is okay I'll give you

934
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,799
another Knob right now normally you have

935
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:43,480
one hour every time you just got to pass

936
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,240
in front of it click click and uh you

937
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,800
have another hour normally okay so at

938
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:48,919
any point in time if you go click click

939
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,359
it extends it for an hour yes okay so

940
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,119
that's very good for me to know I find

941
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:54,480
that I like my unit to be on all day yes

942
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,559
and just have it on and whenever I want

943
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,480
to go to it I it happened a few times

944
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,358
where I went to my the cator and I was

945
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,400
like what the heck I was like oh it's a

946
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,279
good safety feature well you remember

947
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,838
the first unit M's always yes uh was was

948
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,119
difficult I apologize for interrupting

949
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:12,358
it was difficult for us to keep a unit

950
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,920
that was functional like

951
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:19,239
247 2-year warranty on it the diod would

952
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,000
not last right so I ended up having to

953
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:23,039
to exchange a lot of unit at the

954
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,199
beginning because of these mistakes that

955
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:29,639
I let people leave it on 24/7 you sleep

956
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:33,399
9 12 hours so it's just conveniently on

957
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:36,118
for you I have one that is on at at Al's

958
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,838
house for like 9 months now it's been on

959
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,760
it's been on we're just testing like

960
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,440
it's on we pass it's on it never went

961
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,480
down really on the but um I I shut mine

962
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,679
off at night but I do tend to leave them

963
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,599
on like in the day for but now that I

964
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,799
know that that's really convenient cuz I

965
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,200
can just hit that every 50 minutes I'm

966
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,039
right sitting right there on my computer

967
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,078
anyway it's not like it's far away no

968
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,519
it's literally right here the way we see

969
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,560
it is if you forget to reset your button

yeah

1012
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,358
dude yeah that's what is that that's the

1013
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:55,280
lhl that's the L to the H to the O

1014
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:59,118
that's that's the decarb THC and you

1015
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,119
just took a pretty huge rip of it so

1016
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:12,519
turn like that was a medium siiz rip and

1017
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,359
it was a head rocker you took a great

1018
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:18,759
hit I'm impressed honestly the the L has

1019
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:21,400
a kick it's very strong I have to say

1020
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,400
guys I mean

1021
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:30,440
uh L yeah doesn't that hit you hard

1022
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,838
distill it distillate so he heated it

1023
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,000
all up through an rotovap and basically

1024
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:39,039
got a very small percentage of the pure

1025
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,480
pure pureness out of it and Le left

1026
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,599
everything else in it so it was you know

1027
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,000
he lost quite a bit of material W in

1028
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:49,838
that process

1029
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,679
so this is decarbox totally active you

1030
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,519
could eat it you could rub it on your

1031
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,719
skin it's already active before we heat

1032
00:43:53,519 --> 00:44:00,400
it up it's definitely uh how you finish

1033
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,519

Johnny I don't need to smoke myself into

1084
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:13,318
a

1085
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,760
coma how was

1086
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,599
that I prefer the king's hit as well I

1087
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,680
have to say not even that first little

1088
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:31,480
boom little boom yeah

1089
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:33,159
how would that but when you dab the oil

1090
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,838
and you expand the oil you make it go

1091
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:37,440
through the process and lay it over the

1092
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:40,000
bed of weed yeah uh that's nice it

1093
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,679
creates uh it makes it last much longer

1094
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,159
it creates a different type of feeling

1095
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,919
inside you get hit by two places get the

1096
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,279
fracking of the weed and your oil on top

1097
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,599
and oil is [ __ ] I feel like I'm drunk

1098
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,680
well I I rarely hit more than one in a

1099
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,079
row I'll just get one and I'm good to go

1100
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,000
for a while if you really want to get

1101
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,519
yourself ripped puffing two or three

1102
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,920
those in a row is uh a good way to get

1103
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,280
there and you're welcome to hit more if

1104
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,559
you like it's a what I'm going to do now

1105
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,040
is I'm going to wait for this to get hot

1106
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:10,359
you're going to do a torch torch one

1107
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:14,079
we're going to do a little torch here

1108
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:17,279
M that's how you do it right there many

1109
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,880
minis the torch the the on the ghost of

1110
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,920
her head what yeah it's a small torch I

1111
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,599
should be it's a very small

1112
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,880
torch hey it's nice it was in the door

1113
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,880
once you're

1114
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,558
at absolutely I just seeing where you

1115
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,440
were like heating it from there well the

1116
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,640
thing is like you can eat for a longer

1117
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,559
time just the head till your atomizer

1118
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:43,679
gets

1119
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,599
hot or you can heat up the torch and

1120
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:49,159
your atomizer at the same time till

1121
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:52,920
they're both hot H it's up to you but

1122
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:56,440
once once it's at good temperature

1123
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,039
it's it does that in bowls there's like

1124

1128
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,318
in a nice even way and I just found

1129
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:13,239
every time I put the torch near the top

1130
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:15,279
of the hole it would go and blow out so

1131
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:17,199
obviously I never really got to use the

1132
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,319
unit I was worried about holding the

1133
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:22,519
torch in one spot and and breaking the

1134
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:25,960
ceramic so I understand well like this

1135
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:27,679
one doesn't seem like the the best uh

1136
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,240
glass piece to

1137
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,480
the torch with well it's a pretty fancy

1138
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,959
one for sure with all these different

1139
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,159
arms coming off of it and whatnot

1140
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,159
frosted on the bottom too with your logo

1141
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:40,159
yeah sound blasted

1142
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:44,358
in I think we should be ready to try

1143
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,240
something here all right show us what

1144
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:47,598
you

1145
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,838
got so what I would do is I would put

1146
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,838
this

1147
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,559
here oh don't worry about it the we

1148
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,719
in so this is the camping version there

1149
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,720
you go

1150
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:06,558
I guess that was not hot enough that was

1151
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,639
just o tasty though oh yeah it's like a

1152
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,400
really low dab hat tast it oh I'll tell

1153
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:13,558
you I still felt it in the head oh yeah

1154
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,599
for sure yeah but I would have just uh

1155
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:17,000
heat it up just a little bit longer Mark

1156
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,000
you would have get a real full

1157
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,440
sublimator hit like you just uh well

1158
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,960
Johnny will show us how to do it my

1159
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,280
torch like I said is a very small torch

1160
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,079
and it's really for for smaller uh

1161
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,559
titanium heads and yes yes yes I'm uh

1162
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,640
I'm realizing this as we

1163
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,798
speak uh we had oh I didn't even give

1164
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:37,960
you the right weed anyway I give you

1165
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:40,239
that we instead of that one well I had a

1166
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,920
great hit Johnny B's up for the next

1167
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:44,439
one can't forget about Johnny B on a

1168
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,240
puff Wednesday and we are definitely

1169
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:50,079

1170
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:55,039
puffed well we've puffed at John's we've

1171
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:57,640
puffed next to the lake we puffed here

1172
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,759
in the vehicle oh Cactus Club yeah

1173
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:01,480
Cactus Club and then we' puffed here so

1174
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,280
it's been a good puff Wednesday so far

1175
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,559
and uh sublimating both with the uh

1176
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,798
plug-in version and the camper version

1177
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,040
the torch version I also like that one

1178
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:12,280
you had didn't you have one for like

1179
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:13,558
putting for the fire yes yes yes yes yes

1180
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,040
that was pretty

1181
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:19,000
cool we uh we used it the the campground

1182
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,798
version man you had one that you could

1183
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,400
put in the coals of the fire and pull it

1184
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:25,639
out and I was like man that's pretty

1185
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,639
good a campfire

1186
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,639
version yeah he always puts the same

1187
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:32,199
amount in just a perfect amount he knows

1188
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:33,960
exactly how much herb to put in now

1189
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:36,879
these are the difficult variables do you

1190
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,798
find are hard to share with the audience

1191
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,400
or your customer base when they're is it

1192
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:43,519
difficult to get across to them like how

1193
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,200
much herb you need to put in or is it

1194
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:49,440
just a simple showing them a

1195
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:52,358
video uh normally I just I show them the

1196
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,200
video but normally we try to go a01 like

1197
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:57,199
a tenth of a gram you know so they can

1198
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:59,679
weigh it out yeah

1199
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,960
very cool very

1200
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:05,039
