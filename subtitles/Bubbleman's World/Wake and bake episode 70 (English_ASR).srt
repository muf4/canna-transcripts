00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,679
anxious to get the boat out it's been

99
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,729
taking a while all right everybody if

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,730
you're ready

101
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:23,519
I have not seen him chillin like a

102
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,269
villain why is he pretty [ __ ] up

103
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,269
what's going on

104
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,200
I don't think I mentioned that I'm gonna

105
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:51,799
go get my boat every day

106
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:54,139
maybe I mentioned it a few times oh I

107
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,340
could care less chillin like a villain

108
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,269
you know he turned out to be not a very

109
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:02,789
nice person

110
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:04,620
I tried to be his friend for some time

111
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,560
and he just kind of turned into someone

112
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,180
that I should have known when Remo was

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,639
having problems with him that something

114
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,980
was wrong because Remo is basically the

115
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,649
nicest [ __ ] dude this whole family

116
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,830
are so nice and once they started having

117
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:22,739
problems with Mark the weed guy and

118
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:24,599
stopped filming with him is not too too

119
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,810
long after I sort of made the same

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,590
decision that maybe my life was gonna be

121
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,939
better without him in it whereas Remos

122
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:35,039
an awesome person and my life would be

123
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,149
worse without him in it so I'm happy

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,169
that he's in my life

125
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:43,139
him and Sandra are very very kind people

126
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:53,069
yes cleaning the Chas no Chas here all

127
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:54,810
Chas free all right so yeah dry sifting

128
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:57,839
a little bit of dry sifting knowledge

129
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,209
for you guys today I sell a four-screen

130
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,369
kit and its really two different methods

131
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:05,310
I sell the one ten micron which is about

132
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,949
160 mi sorry the 110 lines per inch

133
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,540
which is about 160 micron and then that

134
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:12,209
comes with a 200 line inch which is

135
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,270
about 70 micron and of course everyone

136
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:19,199
knows the basics of that method which is

137
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:21,359
gently sift over top of your 110 collect

138
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,879
your farmers grade sift break it up

139
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,699
nicely almost like you would with flour

140
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:30,180
sifting it over the screen and getting

141
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,750
it ready for carding or some DVD static

142
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,129
which is also carding and you can do

143
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,680
your separation on those two screens

144
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,689
like that then we also sell the 60 and

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,329
the 90 mesh which is two hundred and

146
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:43,860
fifty microns and 180 and

147
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:45,300
is a simple trick that a guy was showing

148
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,979
on icy mag for a while where you

149
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,069
separate the screens by about an inch

150
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,240
they're very large screens larger holes

151
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,650
than I would ever dry sipped with

152
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,379
normally but the trick is when you just

153
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:57,779
throw things down on it gently the way

154
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,370
the resin heads fall they fall solid and

155
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,918
the way everything else falls it kind of

156
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,658
does this you get a lot of this sort of

157
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,728
contaminants sticking into the screen

158
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:08,519
like a little tree or a blade of grass

159
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:10,199
and you can clean up some difference

160
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,859
some decent sift with this little trick

161
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,360
obviously the static parchment method is

162
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,340
going to clean up much quicker much

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,080
faster but it's nice to have the option

164
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,000
sometimes you want to just throw

165
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,769
something down lift up the screens and

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,360
have what you're ready to smoke other

167
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:28,560
times you want to put a real time and

168
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,199
investment in and make it actually Scott

169
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,839
he was told the method but yes the guy

170
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,060
who has popularized this method is a

171
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,329
huge douche and I won't even mention his

172
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,069
name because of it the crazy taste

173
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,658
difference between the titanium and

174
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,360
quartz yeah there's definitely a

175
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:48,329
difference you know it's the way the

176
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,689
heat is relieved the way the surface

177
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:56,250
area holds heat and releases heat thank

178
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:59,009
you Scott much love for that hard to get

179
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,718
in UK your shop in London is sold ASAP

in London as head I'm not sure what

182
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:12,000

microns well some will ones that are

186
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,028
smaller than 90 micron but the ones that

187
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:24,028
are left on top are gonna be the ones

188
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:26,338
that I want some of the ones that fall

189
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:30,060
underneath like the 70 I catch the 70

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,810
dark crystal quartz tastes really nice

196
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:49,379
I mean I'm blessed with a whole variety

197
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,888
of cannabis terpenes so I've got you

198
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:53,230
know at least 10

199
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:56,558
front ones here just on the desk from

200
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:00,459
Karma's [ __ ] two Swiss tsunami to Koval

201
00:08:56,558 --> 00:09:05,198
a Sour Diesel yeah pretty happy with all

202
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:07,599
that I'm pretty happy with all that I

203
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:09,399
was smoking on an original cut of orange

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,199
skunk extract well that's good good

205
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,269
goods bubbleman smaller heads equals no

206
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:14,918
medicine not necessarily mr mount you

207
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,239
know often the heads for whatever reason

208
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:18,489
that i've seen growing in some really

209
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:21,069
extremely warm tropical spots like

210
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:24,939
australia tends to produce a really

211
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:30,969
lovingly high-grade high quality lower

212
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:33,909
micron head like 25 micron full melt

213
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,668
super beautiful reminiscent of what 73

214
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:38,198
or 90 looks like so I'll do like I do

215
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:40,869
like the DC banger I would absolutely

216
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:42,338
recommend DC the guy's great he's got a

217
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:44,589
good a good little company's real

218
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,319
friendly Canadian dude and it's got good

219
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,549
customer service so those are important

220
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,958
to me you know it's one thing to

221
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:51,338
purchase something I want it to be a

222
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,418
good product but I also want to be able

223
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,449
to get in touch with the people I

224
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:57,519
purchased it from if I require uh high

225
00:09:55,448 --> 00:10:01,719
integrity dish nails I have not yet used

226
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,668
the high integrity or dish nails do you

227
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,739
get more return from rosin if make the

228
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:07,539
pucks first what's the terpene profile

229
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:09,309
like on the notorious Aussie strain well

230
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:12,338
I don't know the terpene profile but it

231
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:14,558
was very unique and wonderful and yeah I

232
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,139
think that you're gonna be more

233
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:19,899
efficient it really depends here's the

234
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:23,289
thing with rosin it's it's there's a

235
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:26,019
multitude of ways to get your yield out

236
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,998
for me the key is to get the yield out

237
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:30,759
without sacrificing the quality

238
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:32,499
so most people sacrifice the quality by

239
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,298
pressing and pressing and pressing or

240
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:36,220
heating it up for at higher temperatures

241
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:39,519
just because they want that last little

242
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,528
five or ten percent I could do without

243
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,470
that five or ten percent I'd rather keep

244
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:48,149
the stuff a nice beautiful color I like

245
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:51,480
a nice color or almost no color at all

246
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:55,808
that's you know compared to this like

247
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,949
dark sappy just I'm known as inspired by

248
00:10:55,808 --> 00:11:00,629
this one I have to say I wasn't

249
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:00,628
impressed with this particular one but

250
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:04,659
yeah I love your bubble box you're going

251
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,310
to come up with a bigger bubble box now

252
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,439
Pedro I've got the screens a bigger

253
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,779
bubble box would be like a thousand box

254
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,270
like it would got so expensive the

255
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:16,419
bubble box doubled in price over I mean

256
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:18,429
my costs doubled in price the bubble box

257
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:22,179
itself went up about 30 bucks that year

258
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:24,759
but all my costs went up double so we

259
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:27,309
law we lost a fair chunk of our

260
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,740
marketplace profit market marketplace in

261
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:32,139
that and it's just gone worse and worse

262
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,019
and worse as the years go by so very few

263
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,939
people would ever purchase a larger

264
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:38,799
bubble box just because of the

265
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,550
investment of money that it would

266
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,089
require are you dumping distillate or

267
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:48,459
was that just some really fire rosin

268
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,980
rosin rosin and more rosin and then a

269
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,050
little bit of bubble hash I'm still got

270
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:57,909
like a tiny little I've been using this

271
00:11:53,049 --> 00:12:00,459
jtk jar as a well it works better on my

272
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:03,809
sapphire but yeah it fits right over top

273
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:07,330
of my sapphire as a carb and then the

274
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:09,849
bubble hash inside of it heats up slowly

275
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,420
and mounts down it's it gives you a

276
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,629
ninja dabs all day long oh yeah

277
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:18,699
Kayne I have definitely run some sleaze

278
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:24,100
stack beautiful cultivar as well as the

279
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:26,620
Sleestak cross was gun I believe they do

280
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,480
survivor one time I do believe they do I

281
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,210
think that we will learn in the near

282
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,750
future with cannabis that certain

283
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:37,660
terpene expressions are going to be what

284
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,200
we would consider better when grown

285
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:44,259
properly with probiotics and you know

286
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,050
proper nutrients proper organics proper

287
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:47,950
living soils you know beneficial

288
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:50,500
microbials

289
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,180
and just being allowed to put that plant

290
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,210
in a situation where it can express

291
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:57,549
itself to absolute perfection that's

292
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,490
really what we're all going for as

293
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:03,939
growers although I will admit that

294
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,580
prohibition really hit us to a hard left

295
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,750
ball a curve ball in a sense whereas all

296
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,310
of a sudden it seemed like a lot of

297
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,529
people were actually just growing for

298
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:13,119
profit and they didn't really care as

299
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,350
much about the quality in the end

300
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,509
results because it was

301
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,940
about it ends to a means for them which

302
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:21,939
was I'm not dissing them you know I get

303
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,830
it cannabis is a wide-ranging plant that

304
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,140
can help you pay your mortgage if you

305
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,120
like but I think that it was prohibition

306
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,710
of cannabis that was helping people pay

307
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,710
their mortgages more than cannabis

308
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,840
itself but I like the future that we're

309
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,090
moving into I hope prohibition falls to

310
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,389
the wayside Oh Monica that looks like

311
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:45,250
someone that's gonna have to go sorry

312
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,960
I know it's coming grohl for health

313
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,639
that's it drew Robertson have you tried

314
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,280
hardcore OG if you have what do you

315
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,840
think well you know oh jeez oh jeez are

316
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,490
great in the sense that they you know as

317
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,940
a hardcore smoker I love their strength

318
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,519
I love the hit I love the headspace

319
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,170
flavor for me is is less incredible I

320
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,730
mean don't get me wrong I like a nice

321
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:09,519
Kush but oops let me get rid of her real

322
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,320
quick but I prefer exotics I prefer

323
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,199
things like the Congolese and things

324
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,930
like lemon Thai and the Cambodian from

325
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,060
Doc atomic and Jesus Christ how many of

326
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,009
these bots am I gonna have to boot the

334
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,950
to talk about boobs I'm sure there's a

335
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,359
lot of other channels that people are

336
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,879
talking about boobs but we're here

337
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,050
talking about the endocannabinoid system

338
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:49,779

346

348
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,610
be real [ __ ] up imagine if I

349
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:21,490
accidentally made one of the boob BOTS a

350
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,990
moderator or an admin Abby scary anyway

351
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,810
those boob BOTS really didn't kind of

352
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,490
take over the conversations didn't they

353
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,119
right let's get back to what we were

354
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,339
talking about

355
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,778
dry sifting so for those of you that

356
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,360
want to jump into the game and get

357
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:35,769
yourself involved the dry set screens

358
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,700
are available over at fresh hettie's

359
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:42,189

360
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,720
can go check that out and we've got a

361
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,770
ton of bubble bags in right now so I

362
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,110
think we're probably gonna have a little

363
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:49,990
sale some type of a tan or 20% discount

364
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,750
thing going on you would absolutely love

365
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,570
the Solis dunk Sleestak skunk

366
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,820
hell yeah they are killer BG they

367
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,060

368
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,850
well as men so there is that put our

369

ever limit yourself always go with both

371
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,278
that's the way it is there is no choice

372
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,769
in this day and age the choice is

373
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,990
everything you know you just don't want

374
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,720
to not you don't want to cut yourself

375
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:23,049
off thinking this is the best way when

376
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,730

endocannabinoids systems so that's just

390
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:58,470

391
00:16:55,539 --> 00:17:00,849

392
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,610

396
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,959
and he's been offering me some very very

397
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:15,879
lovely things and if some of those

398
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,209
things come through I will announce it

399
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,579
and I will mention it we're still trying

400
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,500
to figure out our greenhouse you know

401
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:25,500
forever flowering they inspired me I

402
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,490
really loved having him on the show I

403
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,319
contacted them I asked them what kind of

404
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,019
deal we could get I guess they didn't

405
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,519
really reply back with a deal as much as

406
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:35,619
well let us know what kind of deals you

407
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,079
find and we'll match it or something

408
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:39,849
like that so I've been in touch with a

409
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,039
few greenhouse companies we've been

410
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,869
offered cost so far

411
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,720
would be super killer if in the future

412
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:48,939
we could actually be given potentially

413
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,190
one the amount of advertising that we're

414
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,029
gonna do is going to be large so we'll

415
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,440
see what happens

416
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,690

talking about the greenhouse so yeah

421
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,440
some greenhouse companies are basically

422
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,289
having interest they're looking at

423
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,210

whoever offers us the the best quality

430

greenhouse for the best price because

431
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,100

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,790
myself but I'm going to be very

489
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:55,509
fortunate to learn with all of you and

490
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:57,460
have Ron my old mentor running the grow

491
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:59,769
and I think it's gonna be fun probably

492
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,350
gonna whack you know fill it up maybe

493
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:05,200
for the first time who knows with some

494
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:07,599
Congolese but we'll see what reform and

495
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,549
soon maybe something else how do I feel

496
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,189
about freeze-dried dry safe well I think

497
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:14,049
it's unnecessary but to each their own

498
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,720
you know if people want to run their

499
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,519
[ __ ] through a vac I support it but

500
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,299
remember the only thing you're going to

501
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:24,730
do is you're going to be effecting

502
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:26,470
nothing other than the texture of the

503
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,759
hash the quality of the hash is never

504
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,380
going to be changed and I try to teach

505
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,720
this to the oil people for the longest

506
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,550
time the quality of your oil doesn't

507
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,339
change when you make it honeycomb or

508
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:40,089
simple and snap or butter these are all

509
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:42,939
marketing methods to sell a product but

510
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:45,730
it doesn't have anything to do with the

511
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,590
quality and how that product is going to

512
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,150
affect you so when bubble hash is no

513
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:51,579
different whether you press it or leave

514
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,350
it unpressed and I know Frenchie cannoli

515
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:56,649
claims that when he presses his hash

516
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:58,990
it's creating more terpenes but I just

517
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,640
don't I don't see the science agreeing

518
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,759
with that personally so I'll have to

519
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,470
agree to disagree with him on that I

520
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,220
like 12 to 14 weeks I think a typical

521
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,379
Congolese would go for

522
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm not sure what knowledge on fight all

523
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:13,849
I have no knowledge on fight all I don't

524
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,339
know what you're talking about true

525
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:18,418
don't buy into the hype by the way it's

526
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,888
awesome that you're working with forever

527
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,509
finally I've wanted since the earlier

528
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:23,189
well I hope to be working with forever

529
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,480
flowering to be honest I mean if they

530
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,509
would have just written me back and said

531
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,159
we'll hook you up with cost or some even

532
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:31,139
beyond cost cuz these things are like

533
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,940
fifty plus thousand dollars for these

534
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:34,558
greenhouses with the full and I want to

535
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,808
be able to show it in all of its glory

536
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,759
I'm not looking for a handout but I

537
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:41,339
don't want to spend retail on something

538
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:45,179
that I'm going to literally put you know

539
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:47,099
serious serious value into promoting in

540
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,538
a sense and you know will promote it

541
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,099
honestly we're not gonna promote like

542
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,048
we're not getting paid to do the review

543
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,418
I just think it's a great idea for the

544
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:57,089
channel Oh franceska Pittman you must be

545
00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:01,679
looking to be blocked from my channel

546
00:22:57,089 --> 00:23:03,329
forever yeah I mean pharmacy you know

547
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,950
some might see it as an opportunity some

548
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:06,269
might not so I respect that because

549
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,970
sometimes people offer me opportunities

550
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:10,409
and I don't see it and that doesn't mean

551
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,548
that the opportunity's not there not

552
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:17,000
just I'm like you know what I'm not

553
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:19,528
seeing it so I can understand if they

554
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,669
don't see the value you know what I mean

555
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:22,829
looks like that's a YouTube channel

556
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,009
whatever but what we could grow it into

557
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:28,859
and what it could become could be

558
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:31,200
something very good so I'm kind of

559
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,599
looking forward to it I'm not gonna lie

560
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,700
just having Ron out here is a huge bonus

561
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,148
for me he's like a father figure and a

562
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,340
mentor and a best friend and a

563
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:43,648
grandfather figure to my kids so I'm

564
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,058
very much looking forward to getting Ron

565
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:46,288
out here getting this project off the

566
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,730
ground and I guess a little bit more

567
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:49,950
that I talk about it the more it'll

568
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,690
become a reality I'm gonna try and work

569
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,610
out the green house in the next couple

570
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,679
of weeks like I said we have been

571
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:59,459
offered some pretty good deals from a

572
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,710
few we just have to make sure that yeah

573
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,139
of course here you go big squirrel nuts

574
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:07,139
this is a Bill Hicks quote on top of

575
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:10,558
some Liberty Cap mushrooms these are of

576
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:12,418
course the Semillon sea otters also

577
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,250
known as Liberty caps quite popular

578
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,659
along the west coast and probably many

579
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,109
other places around the world I think

580
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,450
they grow in like Peru and

581
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:23,149
until America as well a very small

582
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,039
mushroom that almost dissipates to

583
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,080
nothing when dried but wow how

584
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,170
psychedelic and of course Bill Hicks

585
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:32,089
don't forget it's just a ride if you

586
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,610
don't know who Bill Hicks is I really do

587
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:36,230
implore you to go do a little googling a

588
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:38,419
little youtubing and go listen to some

589
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,929
Bill Hicks because man I'm telling you

590
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,929
the guy he was real he was the real deal

591
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:47,298
it's uh and he was he was crass and he

592
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:49,940
was on the edge and you know it kept his

593
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:51,849
career stunted it kept him from getting

594
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,230
on to shows like The Tonight Show I

595
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:56,149
think David Letterman had him on maybe

596
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,250
one time which makes sense cuz David

597
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,690
Letterman is a wild man but most

598
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,250
networks would have nothing to do with

599
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,640
Bill Hicks he was much more than a

600
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:08,480
comedian but he was truly a comedian as

601
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,299
well make you think make you think make

602
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,610
you think that's so when I think of

603
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:16,910
these Semillon Seattle mushrooms which

604
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:19,490
also promote this notion of language

605
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:22,070
within ones being the logos as Terrence

606
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,740
called it which really creates dialogue

607
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:26,569
and which really makes you think it's a

608
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,910
beautiful shirt to put the two together

609
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:29,928
Bill Hicks one of his quotes with the

610
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,750
Semillon Seattle

611
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:37,370
Liberty Cap mushrooms so that's the

612
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:39,440
shirt ah yes well I mean Dave probably

613
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,879
has apologized for being a dick more

614
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,548
than a few times in his life but that's

615
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,480
okay hope you have doing things in front

616
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:46,579
of the camera helped up with your

617
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,929
cleanliness have doing so much things in

618
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,548
front of the camera helped out with your

619
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:50,690
cleanliness I'm not even sure what that

620
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,179
means

621
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:56,240
Linnaeus my cleanliness as in like my

622
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:58,790
personal hygiene never try to drag

623
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,150
cannabis under pressure yes I have Bill

624
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:06,109
Hicks resonance hey man DK is in is in

625
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:08,419
Channel DK Denmark hey bubble man Robert

626
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:10,969
Landry awesome nice to meet you nice to

627
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:13,250
see you thanks for showing up whatever

628
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,759
whatever you were very clean shaven when

629
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:19,640
you came home yes I was Oh with my

630
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:22,609
stache I don't know I mean I my stache

631
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,890
is you know what here's the thing for me

632
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:26,479
I'm not really acting I'm not an actor I

633
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,280
just come on here and do these live

634
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,269
videos I film videos when I film

635
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:31,160
generally I'm a little

636
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:32,690
but like a director I'll set up my shot

637
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,509
and I'll make sure that certain things

638
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,340
aren't in it mainly because when I first

639
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:39,609
got onto YouTube I had no idea how

640
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:43,939
savage people were I had no idea how

641
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:46,639
quick people were to want to hijack the

642
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,650
purpose of the conversation or the

643
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,600
dialogue that I was trying to start and

644
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,920
it's just human nature it is what it is

645
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,869
but there's always someone that wants to

646
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,480
direct something over to here and over

647
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:58,879
to there the classic of course being my

648
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,829
puffing the hash joint where I must have

649
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,710
gotten literally a thousand people asked

650
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:06,349
me why I had toilet paper on my desk

651
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,299
which was like well I would clean my

652
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:10,969
dabber with it and of course I blow my

653
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:12,440
nose with it I never thought what people

654
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,210
were writing they're just like oh this

655
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,580
is bubble man's a sick pervert

656
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:20,170
it was well no you know what I'll tell

657
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:23,329
you why I care Amelia mainly because

658
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,279
they hijacked the conversation so all of

659
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:27,289
a sudden that becomes the conversation

660
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,240
so I've learned to film videos where I

661
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:32,299
clean things up a little bit but for the

662
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,120
most part I'm not you know my did I

663
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:36,980
don't I'm not setting up too much when I

664
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,449
do these little videos so and it's been

665
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,620
a while since I've even done an actual

666
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,569
video I haven't pulled my video camera

667
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:44,149
out and what seems like almost a month

668
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:46,250
and summer about that thank you for

669
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,660
smoking pot but just having an honest

670
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,369
conversation I was like man are you

671
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,540
serious is this what people are doing is

672
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:52,849
that what people do with toilet paper

673
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:55,430
next to their computer desks I guess I'm

674
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:57,529
living in a different world do I condone

675
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:01,940
hemp seeds in your food not only do I

676
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:04,160
condone hemp seeds in your food i-it and

677
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,710
not necessarily just hemp seeds it can

678
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,480
be the essential amino acid rich oils

679
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,059
that are inside those seed embryos that

680
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,809
have been squeezed or the D hauled seed

681
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:16,849
or whatever of course well big chew you

682
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:17,750
know what you edit because okay for

683
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:19,849
example I'll give you a wonderful

684
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,380
example why edit your gonna like this

685
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:23,809
when I first started filming with Johnny

686
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,190
B I found that people were really mean

687
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,829
and that they would say mean things

688
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:30,920
about my friend particularly if I left

689
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:33,769
particular things in the Edit so I

690
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,110
learned with Johnny B that there were

691
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:38,150
things I needed to edit out or people

692
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,689
would jump down his throat and really

693
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,310
attack

694
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,259
him and be mean and I just thought

695
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:43,609
that's that's not what I'm trying to do

696
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:46,009
and I want to I want to show people what

697
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:48,109
a great friend my buddy is and what a

698
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:50,329
great person he is so I want to show him

699
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:52,549
in the greatest light so of course I'm

700
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:55,699
gonna remove little errors or mistakes

701
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:57,470
or slip-ups that he says and does and so

702
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,970
you know for example my friend Lincoln

703
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,350
we did the pig we did the video the

704
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,240
other day where I gave it away where

705
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:05,149
Lincoln basically sticks his ass crack

706
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,730
in front of the camera I forgot to edit

707
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:10,880
that out okay because I forgot to edit

708
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:12,890
it out many many many bad people said

709
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,230
bad things about it and I wasn't quick

710
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,850
enough to see it to delete it that my

711
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,200
friend went and saw it and was like all

712
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:20,629
people are talking you know he laughed

713
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,390
and he said hahahaha but I could tell he

714
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,250
was a little bit hurt and so you know

715
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,530
what we're not trying to make videos and

716
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,180
share and educate and create dialogue

717
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:32,539
with people so that people can come be

718
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:34,970
mean and [ __ ] cancerous and savage so

719
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:36,829
yeah the haters of the haters you got to

720
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,519
be no I don't print these shirts I

721
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:41,049
bought this shirt

722
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,970
100% pure hemp from spannabis last year

723
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:46,460
vampires exactly so this is why I do

724
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:50,630
slight editing and why I try to protect

725
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:54,230
my friends at least oh what's my opinion

726
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,360
on th co acetate I don't have much of an

727
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,970
opinion on that to be honest what would

728
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,889
John be do to cause people to just be

729
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,539
you know what people just hate dude I

730
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,400
mean I just explained it perfectly I

731
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:05,809
think you can fill in the blanks but all

732
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,759
I'm saying is those are the reasons why

733
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:09,589
I do a little bit of editing it's not

734
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,890
about keeping it real I keep it as real

735
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:14,899
as real can keep it although I do love

736
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,670
the Dave Chappelle videos another great

737
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,820
skit if you guys haven't seen that when

738
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:22,070
keeping it real goes bad that is one

739
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:25,639
reason right there to not maybe keep it

740
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:29,389
real too bad for latisha that these

741
