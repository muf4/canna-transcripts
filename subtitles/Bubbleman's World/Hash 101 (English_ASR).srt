2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,099
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,550
and welcome to hashish 101 with bubble

4
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,159
man I'm here today to do a little bit of

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,480
a new show in bubble man's world and

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,539
what I kind of wanted to talk to you

7
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:40,799
guys about today was the difference

8
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:42,628
between drying and curing your final

9
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,000
product I'll take the assumption that

10
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,189
most of you have tried the bags have had

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,780
your go up making water hash and you've

12
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,159
ended up with an end product whether

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,660
you've chopped it up with a razor blade

14
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,909
or pushed it through a strainer or a

15
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,769
microplane did and maybe you dried it on

16
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,599
a plate or you dried it on wood or you

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,059
dried it on parchment or cardboard or

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,170
all these are the different options and

19
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,390
some things worked and some things

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,430
didn't work I'm not really gonna go over

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,719
all the best ways to get to the point

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,080
that we're talking about today I'm gonna

23
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,340
start right at the point of drying and

24
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,859
curing and it's a two-part system

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,909
because when we're dealing with water

26
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,049
hash obviously the gland heads

27
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,580
particularly fresh frozen which I have a

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,180
little fresh frozen here right today

29
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:27,298
I've got the astroboy that I ran with

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,310
Johnny beyond puff Wednesdays just last

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,990
week so why don't we right off the bat

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,000
start out with a nice little rip of that

33
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:37,649
this is the this is the the newest hash

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,700
that I have so it's it's really really

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,920
flavorful the way fresh fresh fresh

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,299
material is really really flavorful now

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,180
that's not to say that I couldn't cure

38
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,170
this material and maintain a wonderful

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,600
flavor in it but it is very fresh it

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,780
hasn't you know this is literally like

41
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,938
seven days old this is closer to seven

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,379
years so I have all the different gamut

43
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,179
so I'm gonna talk a little bit about the

44
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,368
difference in them how they were cured

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,780
how they were dried and of course the

46
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,459
different on my the difference on my

47
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,560
palate

48
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,509
I hid them in addy nail or if someone -

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,729
were to smoke them in a joint or smoke

50
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:17,120
them in a vaporizer a different variety

51
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:21,049
of ways so let's take that rip of the

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:26,200
fresh frozen this is 73 micron fresh

53
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,200
frozen Astro Boy

54
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:56,560
[Music]

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:59,620
great flavor on that astroboy to a known

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,629
to a well I don't want to say

57
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,300
well-versed patois to an experienced

58
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,609
hash smoker particularly a full mouth

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,170
hash smoker on a dry stiff den wet wash

60
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,520
because I don't believe that you can get

61
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:14,349
this same level of olfactory or taste or

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,640
smell when all you're doing is hitting

63
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:17,829
wet wash but when you have that

64
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,019
foundation of dry said you know what

65
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,209
resin is supposed to taste like without

66
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,250
the water present so when you hit the

67
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,979
same resin and it has the water present

68
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,270
it becomes you become aware of it so one

69
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,459
of the things you'll notice when water

70
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,320
is present tiniest little bit of water

71
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,020
which this still has a little tiny bit

72
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,639
left in it it'll be a little bit sharp

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,760
on your throat and that's from the heat

74
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,829
of the water heating up and just not

75
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,139
being smooth like the resin but but just

76
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,530
heating up and so that is part of drying

77
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:49,359
to get rid of that sharp sharp feeling

78
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,979
on your throat you want to drive the

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
resin and because it was fresh frozen

80
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,549
you have to imagine the wax membrane on

81
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,009
the trichome head that holds all the

82
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,989
cannabinoid profiles inside that head is

83
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:04,000
wet the more the wax is moist it has

84
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:06,759
moisture in it while it's living and if

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,189
you take it from the living hash right

86
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,349
into washing it the head never actually

87
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:13,389
gets dried and therefore it holds the

88
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,159
moisture from the water process just a

89
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,379
little more readily than it would had

90
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,478
you say dried that material for a month

91
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:21,399
or two now I know that might sound

92
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,918
extreme to a lot but if you think of

93
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,359
third-world hash supplying countries

94
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,519
countries that have been supplying the

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,850
majority of the the world's hash for the

96
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:36,668
last 30 40 50 years they're doing just

97
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:38,379
that so okay so let's see what else

98
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:41,740
we're going to hit here we are going to

99
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:43,060
hit well let's hit the dry cept we just

100
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,639
hit the wet wash the dry stuff has a

101
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,439
quite a beautiful color to it you can

102
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,310
see it's a powder yet when I flip the

103
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:54,490
card upside down it doesn't fall off

104
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,189
it's very very well isolated gland heads

105
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,780
and this of course we know that it's dry

106
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,168
we know that it's not going to have any

107
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:02,418
sharp feelings

108
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:05,408
regards to moisture because it was never

109
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,408
exposed to water

110
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,619
great taste on that super floral can't

111
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,969
even tell you I'm not I can't even

112
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,250
remember what strain this particular

113
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,190
hash was I think was one of my friends

114
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,319
hash plants the taste is so floral in

115
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,810
bouquet and the fact of the matter is

116
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,759
the astroboy is a tastier strain and

117
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,680
even in fresh frozen bubble hash it

118
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,310
still doesn't come across the palate the

119
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,410
way that bone-dry florally plant matter

120
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,569
that has all of its water soluble

121
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,980
terpenes intact that's going to be the

122
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:53,620
major difference with the water and the

123
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,900
dry the water-soluble terpenes are going

124
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,180
to be lost in the washing and of course

125
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:00,879
you know the strains that have majorly

126
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,800
mostly alcohol soluble terpenes these

127
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,509
strains will maintain their flavor and

128
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,590
people will wonder what you're talking

129
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,089
about what do you mean your resident

130
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,399
doesn't have a good flavor after you

131
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:12,789
make water hash - smells just like the

132
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,620
bag that's alcohol soluble terpenes so

133
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,140
it melted not quite as much as the fresh

134
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,418
frozen this particular sift is about

135
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:25,180
four months old it's been wood curing in

136
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:26,918
my bubble box on a card open-faced not

137
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,829
sealed and the bubble box isn't

138
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,750
hermetically sealed it's just wood much

139
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:33,668
like a humidor and it's been settling in

140
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,569
here and curing for the last six months

141
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:39,759
and I'd say with the with the dry sift

142
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:42,250
what I noticed mostly when I care dry

143
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,779
sift is that it really brings out rich

144
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,430
overtones of the earthy herb flavored

145
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:52,479
tastes so that's what I would say about

146
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,610
that next up we're going to go to some

147
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,790
more cured astroboy bubble hash this

148
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,460
astroboy is from I guess May so we got

149
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:02,260
May June July August September October

150
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,389
I guess we're six months cuz we're not

151
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,849
in October yet so five months this is

152
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:10,959
five months cured and it's been curing

153
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:15,250
in an oil slick it has been curing in an

154
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,689
oil slick for its entire lifecycle so

155
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,990
let's give that a shot and see how that

156
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,990
one goes

157
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:42,138
all right so there's that beautiful

158
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:44,598
astroboy flavor and when you remove that

159
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,280
tiny little bit of moisture that little

160
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,490
bit of water that's not only making it

161
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:52,158
sharp you also remove some of the flavor

162
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,720
masking and the flavor is unveiled now I

163
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:55,279
don't really understand exactly what's

164
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,490
going on and how the water is masking

165
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,679
that flavor but it does the hash still

166
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,949
melted beautifully I believe that was a

167
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,228
73 microns so it's 73 to 73 the test was

168
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:09,310
accurate two separate plants that I grew

169
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:11,449
but definitely both still astroboy and

170
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,908
yeah so we get back to the drawing

171
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,978
versus the curing the drying is allowing

172
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:19,219
the wax membrane on the on the glandular

173
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:22,189
trichomes to dry fully before you

174
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,349
actually start aging the hash like what

175
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,000
we have here this is six and a half year

176
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:32,658
old Master Kush I've shown it on the

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
channel before extremely stable almost

178
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:36,918
as hard as a rock yet it's very bendable

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,110
I could separate these two out easily

180
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,809
enough put them back on an oil slick

181
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,419
check this out just snap that like a

182
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,179
shatter and when I put them both on the

183
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:48,199
oil slick they'll melt back together so

184
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:51,588
we're definitely gonna take a hit of

185
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,089
this this is the master Kush and one of

186
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,920
the amazing things about this master

187
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,709
Kush which is truly almost seven years

188
00:08:54,919 --> 00:09:01,370
old and the cure now is how much the

189
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:03,639
terpenes have changed and I usually say

190
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,409
degra gated as the age of terpenes

191
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,600
oxidization and the exposure to light

192
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,969
all changes the terpenes they're very

193
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,690
volatile even at room temperature they

194
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,910
evaporate they lose flavor the change

195
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,990
this master Kush which was six and a

196
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:20,539
half years cured

197
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,159
I had it cured probably for two and a

198
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:24,620
half to almost three years it was in

199
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,659
glass and spent two years in the bubble

200
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,600
box in wood and then it's probably spent

201
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:32,000
another close to a year plus now outside

202
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,550
on an oil slick just exposed because the

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,339
outside is now so hard and out of all my

204
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:41,179
hashes the taste on this one is probably

205
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:44,720
the best extremely flavorful very deep

206
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:46,278
and earthy deep aftertaste satiates the

207
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,709
throat and gets in really

208
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:52,749
and bubbles and melts into into a

209
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,748
beautiful liquid reddish liquid

210
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,959
so this one reminds me almost of a

211
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,350
perfume in the aftertaste and as I'm

212
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:20,129
talking oh as I'm talking and exhaling

213
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,500
slowly you can feel the strong presence

214
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:24,779
of those terpenes I wish I could get

215
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,250
this stuff tested before and after

216
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,899
because whatever degradation has

217
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,970
occurred in the terpene it is powerfully

218
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,620
aromatic spicy perfume me it's just a

219
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,870
really wonderful taste that I can sing

220
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,879
none of my other hashes have taken on

221
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,919
that taste and initially when it first

222
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,129
started changing into that taste which

223
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:46,110
was around year 4 I honestly thought it

224
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:47,879
had been contaminated and I was really

225
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,470
worried and I searched everything around

226
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,480
and I was wondering if some sort of

227
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,029
thing dumped into it or it got affected

228
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,860
and over the years has it changed more

229
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,449
and more into that taste I realized it

230
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,320
was just a natural terpene degradation

231
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,879
so now remember one thing to add while

232
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,460
I'm talking about this stuff is that

233
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,289
it's very important to dry the hash

234
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,900
first if you haven't wet washed it if

235
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:12,149
you if you fresh frozen in particular

236
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,590
and you already have that wet membrane

237
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,449
and now you've moistened it even more

238
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,519
with the washing process please do

239
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,430
everything you can to join our coat our

240
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,009
our group on Facebook which is water

241
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:25,049
extraction drying technique I'll put the

242
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,659
link in the comments of this video join

243
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,789
that group learn how to properly break

244
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,339
up your bubble and dry it properly so

245
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,199
that when you get to this point you know

246
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,750
you can play safely because when you

247
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,090
start sealing up water hashes in plastic

248
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,519
or glass or wood or whatever you look

249
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,230
you are looking to seal it up in if

250
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,269
there's moisture present that moisture

251
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,060
will degrade the wax membranes it will

252
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:49,799
eat up at your oils and it will you know

253
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,019
potentially mold your hash which is

254
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,409
definitely non-medicinal in fact anti

255
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,519
health and in every aspect that I know

256
00:11:54,409 --> 00:12:00,750
so understand the differences between

257
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,159
drying and curing and have fun with it

258
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,690
if you've got a lot of bubble and you're

259
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,669
one of those guys that's making a lot I

260
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,250
would urge you to take ten grams or five

261
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:10,199
grams of this kind and that kind and you

262
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,179
know split them up so you have ten ten

263
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,009
and ten you know you grab 30 grams and

264
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,000
you put ten grams in a glass and you put

265
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:16,470
another ten grams and

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,320
would and you put ten grams in a

267
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,710
high-density plastic or platinum grade

268
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,270
silicone like oil slick and you cure out

269
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,950
your hash and you don't let anyone tell

270
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,929
you what they think is better or worse

271
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,180
and you learn from your own bio ass and

272
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:32,009
it's amazing to sit in front of a little

273
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,959
box of hash like this and say oh this

274
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,639
dry sift is a year that dry six three

275
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,800
years there's a seven year old hash in a

276
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,970
six and a half year old bubble hash and

277
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,129
I guess we should probably hit this

278
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,600
seven-year old guy - this is a long this

279
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:44,399
this could even almost be eight years

280
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,190
old this one because I lose track of it

281
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,669
and I'm not really hung up on how old

282
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,650
it's getting I'm more like just very

283
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:55,229
interested in the flavor profiles how

284
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:57,689
they change and how the terpenes that

285
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,149
clearly modulate those cannabinoids th

286
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:03,450
C's and CBDs and CBS and all these

287
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:05,309
wonderful things still modulate it once

288
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,990
the terpenes change but obviously it

289
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:08,969
modulates it when you're affecting the

290
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,310
modulators obviously you're going to

291
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,480
affect those medicinal compounds and how

292
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,250
they interact with someone's

293
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,800
endocannabinoid system I think there'll

294
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,019
be a real value in the future to have

295
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,829
cured medicine not just for the

296
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:25,289
recreational user but for the cannabis

297
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:28,139
user who's using medicinal cannabis that

298
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:31,549
needs a specific degradation of CBN or

299
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:36,080
CBD and that requires long-term storage

300
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:36,079
here we go with the seven plus year

301
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,160
so that was a stunk 100 then that was

302
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,010
groomed by a master grower amazing guy

303
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:00,490
if you ever saw me in the zipline over

304
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:02,759
top of the grow he grew this resin and I

305
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,079
haven't seen him in a long long time and

306
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,328
this is the last of his resin that I

307
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,859
have on tap and I'm gonna keep that for

308
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:12,009
a long time it'll make 10 years no

309
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,959
problem I suspect this seven and six and

310
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:17,559
a half year will also make ten to

311
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:20,349
fifteen years and then I have a seven

312
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,319
year old another cush mixture and I have

313
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,930
half of it is in glass and half of it is

314
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,200
in a thick strong plastic and they both

315
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:31,659
are in the wood and they both now have

316
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,410
no lids for the last I'd say about a

317
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:36,819
year I don't really keep a super journal

318
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:38,350
and all this stuff I have a pretty good

319
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,360
memory but you know if you're if you

320
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,278
don't have a good memory then mark down

321
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,379
the dates that you're storing your hash

322
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:45,789
and you're starting your cure how long

323
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:48,220
it took you to dry it's really nice

324
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:50,860
information to know and it's just a

325
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,750
really nice way to enjoy your cannabis

326
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,370
when you've got different levels of it
