00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,809
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,618
have been a little m.i.a since the my

4
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,719
Orca filming I have to admit I've been a

5
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,420
little bit nerve-racked about some of

6
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,399
the well-established cannabis-based

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,380
channels that have been deleted recently

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,120
off of YouTube making me very nervous

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,469
terrible news about Raynald the urban

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,299
grower the pot TV lost theirs and some

11
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,879
others so I've just been really kind of

12
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,649
holding back but today I figured we

13
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,479
would do a little unboxing I've got a

14
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,160
little treat in the mail here and I

15
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,628
thought this would be a good video to

16
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,750
get up on the channel and let everyone

17
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:01,140
know what's going on so I have got this

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,299
from putco puffs Co sent me a little

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,659
something-something so I figured we will

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,149
use the happy daddy dabber here to get

21
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,118
into the box

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,409
and we'll see what's going on in here

23
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:17,129
we'll see what's going on what

24
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,320
wonderfulness they sent me today I think

25
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:22,819
I know I think at this point you guys

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,109
even probably know but you never know

27
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:28,679
nothing better than just opening the box

28
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:30,780
to actually find out let's see what we

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,320
got off to say this about these guys

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,659
this came in like three days from the

31
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,629
time it was ordered to the time it was

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,810
sent to the time it arrived was three

33
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:45,390
days literally ordered on this day sent

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,710
on this day received on this day so very

35
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,930
cool and we're I'm in Canada and this

36
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,118
came from Valencia California so that

37
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,490
was pretty cool to be able to get it

38
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,159
that quickly real quick and easy

39
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:59,548
shipping a box within a box a little bit

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:06,170
of bubble wrap my receipt here on the

41
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:11,200
price of the unit he's go for 399 us and

42
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:13,060
indeed it is the PUF Co Peak

43
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,000
so I've been quite excited about

44
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,840
grabbing one of these I'm not gonna lie

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,400
I had tried just a couple of times I got

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,650
to try the unit and I was quite

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,270
impressed with it but I've mentioned it

48
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,730
before you know today is really just

49
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,350
gonna be the unboxing video obviously I

50
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:33,219
can take a DAB from it but for me to

51
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:35,259
really try a unit I need to be able to

52
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:38,370
take it around this is a very portable

53
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:43,389
unit I'm often carrying you know my mini

54
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:47,439
the carb cap the container the dabber

55
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:50,259
the terpenes the hash you know all of

56
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,300
these different things the q-tips and so

57
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,859
I like the compact thickness of this

58
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,560
obviously it's still going to be a pipe

59
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,880
it's still going to be a dabbler that

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
needs to fill and I'm still going to

61
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:03,069
need q-tips and I'm still gonna need the

62
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,839
carb cap but I really like the

63
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,609
portability of it I really like the

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,289
cleanliness the lines I think it's very

65
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,650
much like receiving an Apple product

66
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:15,039
almost so far so you get out what you

67
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,069

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,100
know

118
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,350
the atomizer cover the ceramic bowl the

119
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,210
atomizer and the base and that's

120
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,220
basically what you see on this page

121
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:28,120
right here all of those little units are

122
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,880
right there QuickStart so step one fully

123
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,680
charge device before first use so we're

124
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,870
going to do that right away we're gonna

125
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,560
fully charge this device before first

126
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,199
use oh it's very clean very very clean

127
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,780
look at this little unit isn't that a

128
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,089
nice little unit right there gotta say

129
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:49,599
if they've had a real hype with this

130
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:52,029
unit and I can kind of see why so

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,650
there's your base right there got our

132
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,909
atomizer in there we've got our nice

133
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:58,839
little glass top

134
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:02,590
oh yeah they've got they've got a little

135
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:05,709
uh a little cover on this a little

136
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:08,560
plastic cover I guess that's unique

137
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:11,409
holes Zorro there's the hole right there

138
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,060
on the back so there's a nice little

139
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,730
hole right on the back of the glass and

140
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,790
then it also explains if I can get that

141
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,560
to you how to line up the holes to fit

142
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,650
this base this is a very nice little

143
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,990
base feels like it's well made it feels

144
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:29,228
thick if you want to

145
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,970
there we go it feels very thick and it

146
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:33,879
feels just well made it does not feel

147
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:37,080
cheap whatsoever so does this this feels

148
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,610
heavy heavy heavy very nice I like that

149
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,459
I'm gonna read it before I start trying

150
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,470
to play around with it empty water

151
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:48,098
before storing glass that makes sense

152
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,720
just fits in so tightly as well I'm

153
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:51,848
really a fan of things that fit into

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,650
their cases well there's the little

155
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:57,759
dabber that it comes with they've got

156
00:06:53,649 --> 00:07:01,049
their own unique dabber that comes with

157
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:07,270
the unit nice little scoop there and

158
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:09,430
we've also got our carb cap very very

159
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:11,529
tiny little carb cap it's definitely not

160
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,620
a big carb cap which is great probably

161
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,239
just fits the unit to perfection and

162
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,478
I'll show all that here in a little bit

163
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,889
let's just read the booklet shall we so

164
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,199
we're gonna fully charge the device

165
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,699
before first use device pulses white

166
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,310
while charging and turns off

167
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,389
automatically when complete so we're

168
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,839
going to do that

169
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,519
I guess the yep look at that right here

170
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,198
so I'll make sure that I've got all

171
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,740
these components back in here properly

172
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,240
so I can turn it sideways again so this

173
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,550
is the base this is the glass this is

174
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,710
the carb cap this is the dabber and then

175
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:50,550
right in here you've got your cables so

176
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:57,158
we're gonna pull those cables out

177
00:07:50,550 --> 00:08:01,509
nice little charger okay take that

178
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:05,579
plastic off right away nice and clean

179
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:09,430
seems like a nice quality charger there

180
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,629
feels good in the hand and what else we

181
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,329
haven't got a couple of cotton swabs

182
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:16,930
that they've given us just a small

183
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:21,098
amount there four of them and then we've

184
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:25,000
got also a ceramic dish I guess if you

185
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:25,719
use probably an extra one I'm guessing

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,120
as

187
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,940
yuuna did have one inside of it I'll

188
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,810
just check that out again

189
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:36,009
yeah it's got one inside of it there

190
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,658
guess that just unscrews although I'm

191
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,819
not going to attempt to do anything

192
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:42,009
without reading it first you know it's

193
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,629
such a natural thing to start playing

194
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,189
with things and moving them and pulling

195
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,720
them and twisting them but you know what

196
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,340
this is a unit that I've never seen

197
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,279
before I've never seen anything like it

198
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:54,850
it's very unique so why not just follow

199
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,120
the instructions to the tee nice short

200
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,560
little cable you know another thing that

201
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,789
people tend to do is you know they'll

202
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:05,559
see this universal plug and although you

203
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:07,480
might have many plugs like this what I

204
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,079
suggest and I do this based on my own

205
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,300
pan is use the one that you got with the

206
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,120
unit you know my pen for instance if you

207
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:18,490
use a super fast charging from Samsung

208
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,139
which is the same plug it actually will

209
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,700
blow out the battery it's not going to

210
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,620
blow it up but it'll burn out the

211
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,030
battery it just won't work properly and

212
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,139
so I'm always letting people know that

213
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,850
chargers right on the front the chart

214
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:36,789
tools right on the front of the unit

215
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:39,610
there and as you can see so I'm gonna

216
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,529
charge this little bad boy I think I'll

217
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,480
just plug it in right here into the wall

218
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:48,399
I've got a nice little charger and lip

219
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:55,710
open the box is upside down make a

220
00:09:48,399 --> 00:10:00,549
perfect table for the charger alright so

221
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:04,000
and it is indeed flashing light it's

222
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:06,939
going real slow pulsating white and then

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,139
off white and then off so let's read the

224
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:13,270
rest of the book step 2 after fully

225
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:16,269
charging is fill glass with water just

226
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:19,179
above the air holes do not fill glass

227
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:21,279
while attached to the base do not allow

228
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:24,579
water in lower sections so this is a

229
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,379
pretty important factor here here's the

230
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:32,080
unit right here I guess I can pull off

231
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:34,789
the plastic that says align air hole

232
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,639
with atomizer

233
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:38,899
so that comes off real nice and like I

234
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,680
said I'll show you that again

235
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,509
there's your hole right there and so

236
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,698
we're gonna line that up properly when

237
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:49,789
we when we put this in and obviously we

238
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:51,859
don't want to get water inside this

239
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:53,360
lower chamber because it could come

240
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,310
right out this whole drip into your

241
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,860
atomizer or drip into your battery base

242
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,599
and probably cause some problems so

243
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,909
we'll follow those instructions really

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,778
well you can see how we're supposed to

245
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:07,958
fill it up with water right there all

246
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:11,769
right there we go

247
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:14,689
hope I'm not going too fast for anyone

248
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:17,360
all right carefully push glass into the

249
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:21,800
base align inlet holes on the front of

250
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,769
the glass with atomizer step four to

251
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:27,229
lock and unlock the device hold down the

252
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:29,209
button for three seconds all right so

253
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,730
that's cool once you click this glass

254
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:33,289
piece into the base I guess you can push

255
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:37,190
the button and it'll push a little piece

256
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:39,078
out that keeps it locked in step five

257
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,670
single click to toggle here I'll show

258
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:42,559
you the pictures of those as well there

259
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:44,870
we are putting it into the base here we

260
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,719
are holding the button down to get it to

261
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,339
lock into place then we're going to

262
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,889
single click to toggle through the heat

263
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:54,709
settings so blue is a small load it's

264
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:56,539
about 450 degrees Fahrenheit the green

265
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:59,239
light is a medium load it's gonna be

266
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:01,759
about five hundred degrees the red is a

267
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,709
large load and that's 550 degrees that's

268
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:09,289
actually what I hit my hotbox d-mail

269
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:11,958
davon ater at and then white XL load is

270
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:15,559
a 600 degree and so you can see those

271
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:21,169
right here these are the settings right

272
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:23,059
here for the puff co peak and then six

273
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,979
step six use loading tool to place

274
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,539
contents on the bottom surface of the

275
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,269
bowl well that's pretty self-explanatory

276
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:33,948
take your dab and drop it into your

277
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:36,440
little atomizer base there and then we

278
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:39,198
go step seven this is where it kind of

279
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,209
is unique in the sense place the carb

280
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:41,879
cap on top of the atomizer often people

281
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,948
will put their

282
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,568
they'll start hitting it while they're

283
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:49,049
putting the dab in and then they'll put

284
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:51,539
the carb cap on this is load it put the

285
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:53,429
carb cap on and then start hitting it

286
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,349
but not right away because we're gonna

287
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,958
get the heat to initialize and that's

288
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,819
step eight and so what we do is we

289
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,458
double click to initiate the heat up

290
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:05,338
that's about a 20-second average heat up

291
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:08,099
time press and hold the button every any

292
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:10,110
time to exit pulsing light indicates

293
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,740
heat up mode is active so depending on

294
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,259
the color that you chose in step five

295
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,110
which are the single click to toggle

296
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:22,079
through heat settings one is blue two is

297
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:24,089
green three is red four is white then

298
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,769
you go back and then you engage it once

299
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:27,540
you've loaded your hit so when we choose

300
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,429
our heat settings it's not actually

301
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,019
engaging the heat we don't engage the

302
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,338
heat until we put the hit in so this is

303
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,620
very different from dabbing where we

304
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,540
heat the quartz up and then we drop it

305
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,379
in and I've heard some people complain

306
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:43,500
about oh well I don't want my my rip

307
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,448
heating up in the bowl while it's you

308
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,000
know like while I don't want it in there

309
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:50,129
while it's heating up well trust me I've

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,750
hit this thing before it's not gonna

311
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,278
make a difference especially with turf

312
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,429
dipping especially with high grade

313
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,110
materials plus you've got your carb cap

314
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,338
on top and it's not gonna be releasing

315
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,899
anything so anything that may have

316
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,600
apparate into the air and start

317
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,068
vaporizing is still trapped in that bowl

318
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,709
you're still gonna get that flavor in

319
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:08,370
that taste so don't worry about that

320
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:11,068
step 9

321
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,159
device will vibrate and lights will

322
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:17,338
flash when ready inhale repeatedly until

323
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,740
devices finished producing vapor see see

324
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,319
page 11 for sesh mode sesh mode

325
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,299
obviously is a mode where you're not

326
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:25,919
gonna have to heat it up every time I

327
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:29,609
believe we're gonna get there soon we're

328
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,559
already on page 8 page number 10 once

329
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,959
you you're done use a cotton swab to

330
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,208
clean the chamber after use so that's

331
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,549
all pretty self-explanatory I think you

332
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,198
guys all know how to clean a unit this

333
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:43,729
is gonna be different because your units

334
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:46,490
not going to vibrate and flash lights

335
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,509
when it's ready so that's pretty cool

336
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,948
here's a nice little page on your

337
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:51,419
temperature settings as well as your

338
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:52,229
battery cycling through the four

339
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,019
temperature setting

340
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,450
click the button once lo is a small load

341
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,480
450 twenty-second heat up medium is a

342
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:04,410
medium load 500 degrees 20-second heat

343
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,480
up high is a large load 550 degrees

344
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:08,639
that's a 25 second heat up in the peak

345
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,019
the excel load the one that a lot of

346
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,419
people are probably going to be using is

347
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,370
a 600 degree and that's 25 seconds to

348
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,439
heat up as well and you can see that up

349
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,310
in the top corner there and then you've

350
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,620
got your battery percentages there from

351
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:26,759
a hundred to sixty percent from 60 to 30

352
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,980
and from 15 to zero so click the button

353
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,750
three times to check battery life color

354
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,090
will indicate remaining battery life so

355
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,620
you click it three times if it's green

356
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,060
you've got between sixty and a hundred

357
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,789
percent if it's yellow you've got

358
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,799
between thirty and sixty percent and if

359
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:43,949
it's red obviously that's time to get a

360
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,439
charge in and yeah cleaning it's

361
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,420
breaking it down right here on how

362
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,790
simple the unit from the carb cap to the

363
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:54,299
cover to the little ceramic dish to the

364
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:56,209
atomizer all unscrewed from the unit as

365
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,109
well as the glass being removed

366
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,300
preparation remove glass before

367
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,870
unscrewing and reinserting atomizer

368
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:05,939
don't over tighten the atomizer clean

369
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,470
your carpet glass and atomizer by smoke

370
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,840
stow soaking in isopropanol alcohol I'm

371
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,340
guessing I could also probably use my DC

372
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,110
glass cleaner I'm gonna check with them

373
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,460
I know I can for the carb cap and the

374
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,980
glass but we'll find out about the

375
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,920
atomizer it says it can be cleaned fully

376
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,750
assembled or disassembled number two be

377
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,339
sure to clean gold connector on base and

378
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,830
bottom of atomizer with an alcohol

379
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,660
soaked cotton swab I'm gonna find out as

380
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,759
well a fake if I can use the DC glass

381
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:34,799
cleaner for that number three is a

382
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,049
warning after cleaning rinse and allow

383
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,449
all parts to dry before use this is

384
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:42,299
going to be pretty important obviously

385
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,710
different liquids are not safe to use

386
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,509
when electrical currents are flowing

387
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,680
through when batteries are being used so

388
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:48,809
you want to make sure things are really

389
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,169
dry once you start getting going again

390
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:54,329
and yeah before removing the atomizer

391
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:56,329
make sure bowl has cooled do not get the

392
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,509
base wet it's electric it will break

393
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,530
third

394
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:03,539
clean device after every 20 uses and

395
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,949
then we've got advanced features I want

396
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,470
to cover the advanced features really

397
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,730
quickly sesh mode this is something that

398
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,860
I think we're gonna be using here at

399
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,720
Bubble man's world sesh mode haven't

400
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,879
reached your peak we got you covered

401
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,529
we created a sessom Oh a session mode

402
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,230
that increases heat and extends your

403
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:21,180
session by 15 seconds use it to boost

404
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,610
heat or to share with your friends if

405
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,860
vapor production is low double-click to

406
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,529
initiate sesh mode still not hot not

407
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,059
enough damn your hardcore sesh again you

408
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:32,579
can double click as many times as you

409
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,349
want to keep the session going and then

410
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:36,000
it's got a whole variety of warnings

411
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:38,519
might as well go through them multi

412
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,230
click colored light flash when there is

413
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:41,940
poor or no connection between the base

414
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,670
and the atomizer you'll see a rainbow

415
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,460
lights 5 red light flashes indicates a

416
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,529
short-circuit red light holds means the

417
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,029
device has overheated I think we're

418
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:53,849
probably going to end up seeing that at

419
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,500
one point in time here and then basic

420
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:57,299
things do not allow water in the bottom

421
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,460
chamber of glass do not let water seep

422
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,289
into the atomizer do not overfill glass

423
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,200
do not store device with water in the

424
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:06,539
glass remove glass before unscrewing and

425
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,610
inserting atomizer attached detached

426
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,639
glass carefully do not force wait one

427
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:14,490
minute between uses do not fire atomizer

428
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,220
four times consecutively several short

429
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,259
inhales produce more vapor do not place

430
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,329
contents on the sidewalls of the bowl

431
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,289
do not overfill chamber if you

432
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:23,909
experience a bug

433
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:26,460
turn the device on and off should the

434
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,200
issue persist contact support keep away

435
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,549
from extreme hot and cold temperatures

436
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,980
and keep away from moisture and high

437
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,950
humidity now you know if more people

438
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,039
read those simple warnings so simple

439
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,490
that simple list I bet you nine out of

440
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,059
ten times this unit [ __ ] up pardon my

441
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,490
french

442
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,559
people have not listened to these simple

443
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,000
very very simple rules and they'll be

444
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,799
like well I didn't know I shouldn't fire

445
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,750
the atomizer four times consecutively

446
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,579
well if you read the instruction booklet

447
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,890
it would actually tell you that that's

448
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:57,539
what you're not supposed to do so it's

449
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,850
yeah they want to make sure we have a

450
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,859
consistently perfect experience should

457
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,740
comm pretty sweet little unit I'm gonna

458
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,230
let it heat up

459
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,599
sorry not heat up but charge up and once

460
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,339
it's fully charged we're gonna come back

461
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,259
and we're gonna do a little session and

462
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:25,389
we're gonna see how how well this thing

463
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:27,129
back here guys you'll probably notice

464
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,900
that my head and shoulders are missing

465
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,170
but I kind of took a little page out of

466
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,269
sneaky pete vaporizer reviews i really

467
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,700
liked the way his was tied up and closed

468
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:39,819
and that's how we're gonna do it so I've

469
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,130
got my little unit all charged up here

470
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:45,549
and I guess we'll just follow the

471
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:53,470
booklet real quick we've got it on I'm

472
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:55,000
gonna hold the button to lock alright I

473
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,650
held that down for three seconds it did

474
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,529
a little vibration so I'm guessing it's

475
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:05,460
locked down now single clicks to toggle

476
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:08,319
through the settings so one that's green

477
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,779
- we're on red already let's go for

478
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,669
large we'll set it at large so it's got

479
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:16,119
a red light that goes all the way across

480
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,980
the sides here you'll see it very very

481
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:21,179
sweet it just turned off actually but

482
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,829
the way the light lit up was very nice

483
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,650
well load the surface to place the tool

484
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:31,149
so we're gonna grab our tool I'm gonna

485
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:33,400
do a little turf dip I believe got some

486
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,640
nice material here that we're gonna load

487
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,720
up not too too much but at least a

488
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:47,980
decent amount all right so let's get

489
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:49,779
that in there boom well I get my second

490
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,049
tool here so I can get it off nice and

491
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:56,940
clean cuz it said not to just leave it

492
00:20:53,049 --> 00:21:02,859
on the sides boom fell in perfect

493
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:04,960
alright so place the carve cap on top

494
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,429
steps lose using loading tool to place

495
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,490
contents on the bottom surface of the

496
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,798
bowl not the side

497
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,859
we will place our carb cap on the top

498
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:18,480
there and then double-click to initiate

499
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:20,569
heat up so we'll go one two alright so

500
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:26,069
that's going to initiate on our heat up

501
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:28,980
wait about 20 seconds pulsating light

502
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:32,569
indicates heat up mode is active alright

503
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,569
pretty excited about this little guy

504
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,660
all right let's give it a shot

505
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:09,970
I have not turned it on yet so let's try

506
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,970
that again

507
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:19,039
please carp get double click to initiate

508
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:22,220
heat so we'll go one two all right let's

509
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,079
give that another shot it's starting to

510
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,829
pulsate now the light has turned on this

511
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,829
time my bad

512
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:42,810
alright let's see what we got here it's

513
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,340
very different way of dabbing

514
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:47,759
yes I'll probably get quite used to it

515
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:52,750
once I've got the time line down and

516
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:54,670
understand how the unit heats up looking

517
00:22:52,750 --> 00:23:01,180
for that pulsating light to let me know

518
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:05,100
it's good it's definitely not heating up

519
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,100
so I'm gonna try and figure this out

520
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:25,769
all right so that was a little bit

521
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,420
different it's always about the learning

522
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:29,730
curve on these units I was pushing it

523
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,740
and then pushing it and this time I went

524
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:37,339
click click so a little bit different

525
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,339
and pulsating so here we go

526
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,250
[Music]

527
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:05,740
Wow

528
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:07,890
third time's the charm on that I'll tell

529
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,890
you

530
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,700
really really nice flavor on that

531
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,940
obviously I Terp dipped it but that was

532
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,940
tasty

533
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,809
three good-sized rips so far from

534
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:54,200
something that would normally just give

535
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:59,659
me a single dab off my nail give you a

536
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,640
little see inside the unit there so that

537
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,960
was a little bit at first difficult they

538
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,890
like to be honest though I'm not gonna

539
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,660
do one I'm not going to edit that out it

540
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,290
was hey it took me a couple of times to

541
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,250
get it right and it was the simpleness

542
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:19,279
I'm gonna just give them out a nice

543
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:21,440
little clean it's got the straight the

544
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:26,930
the pointy ones as well which is great

545
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:30,440
to get into those corners and she is as

546
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:34,400
clean as a whistle

547
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,880
great little unit right there HuffPo

548
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,650
peak medicated I'm gonna take one more

549
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,740
dab this time with the camera a little

550
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:47,290
further back so you guys can see and how

551
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,289
that was really really nice

552
00:25:55,419 --> 00:26:01,159
all right we're going to give one more

553
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,808
shot here grab another little dab this

554
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:07,039
time I'm going to dip that time I dipped

555
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:12,048
it into the ACDC and this time I'm going

556
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:13,579
to dip it into the gills lemons so let's

557
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:16,519
see if we can't get that happen and real

558
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:21,230
nice and fast a little bit of Gil's

559
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:24,378
lemons in there a quick little drop into

560
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,319
the chamber definitely having two divers

561
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:30,888
I think is helpful getting it in a

562
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:36,558
proper all right so we'll hit that in

563
00:26:30,888 --> 00:26:38,148
there much quicker on the double and I

564
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,038
can see the light on the back I can see

565
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:41,839
it all the way around and I guess what

566
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,940
happens is once it reaches temperature

567
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,678
it's going to the lights going to

568
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,548
pulsate a little bit it only takes about

569
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,570
20 seconds and you're ready to go

570
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:55,519
looking forward to hitting the gills

571
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:58,298
lemons and the CBD isolate on this one

572
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,298
here we go

573
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:13,808
sounds like my dog wants a little rip

574
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,659
right now so anyway that was great

575
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:17,829
little review of the puff coke peak

576
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,690
really wonderful little unit I'm gonna

577
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:20,710
take it to 420 in a couple of days I'm

578
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,649
gonna hit it with a bunch of my friends

579
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,389
and we'll see how it goes so far with

580
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:27,119
the first few rips I have to say I'm

581
00:27:25,388 --> 00:27:29,379
very impressed with this little unit

582
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,079
fits right in the palm of your hand

583
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,070
easy to clean fairly easy to use you saw

584
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,319
there was a little bit of a learning

585
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:38,138
curve there as I tapped it slow the

586
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:40,089
first few times but definitely impressed

587
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:41,709
with that unit so thanks a lot

588
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:44,548
puff Co we'll see you next time on

589
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,548
