we're all good here and that we're

73
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,959
actually live because I don't see people

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,920
coming into the other chat now let me

75
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,280
see what I did here I probably made a

76
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,639
mistake no we live

77
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,519
oh look there's M West there he is I

78
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:41,559
haven't seen your face good to see your

79
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,480
face hello Grayson how are you well I

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,120
don't know why the chat's not

81
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,479
working uh on YouTube but we'll figure

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,680
it out I will also say yeah it says

83
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,399
chat's not working on the new stream

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,920
well that's going to be a

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,640
problem that's really kind of a problem

86
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,958
I wonder why the chat's not working on

87
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,598
the new stream ouch it's starting to

88
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,719
appear now it's it is isn't it you're

89
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,399
right there it is

90
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,479
y was a little breath it's okay deep

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,239
cleansing cannabis Laden

92
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,639
breath

93
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,439
cross that was scary all right so what I

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,840
want to start with today um because it

95
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,439
really is kind of a big deal especially

96
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,839
for just this whole not just the

97
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,439
Cannabis conversation and the

98
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,959
Psychedelic dialogue and all these

99
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,680
different dialogues that we all know are

100
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,560
super important to have right now but

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,000
recently I got turned on to this app

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,000
that we were just talking about called

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,279
Clubhouse um it was actually Stephen who

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,639
turned me on um and then Dr Allison gave

105
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,918
me a bunch of uh tips and tricks for it

106
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,038
but it truly is a

107
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,319
phenomenal well it's it's a double-edged

108
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:53,000
sword it's both a phenomenal app and it

109
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,918
will literally steal all your time for

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,160
you if you let it and the way I look at

111
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:01,478
this app is it seems like it's like hash

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,039
Church times 10,000 like there's just

113
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:06,839
10,000 hash Church rooms going now the

114
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,959
only difference from a hash Church to a

115
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,239
clubhouse in my opinion is that it's not

116
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,279
recorded you can't go back and save it

117
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,160
you can't go back and listen to it which

118
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,079
is definitely somewhat of a problem but

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,080
also also hey Marcus actually you can

120
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:26,639
record it um you you are able to record

121
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,279
them you can um you just have to put it

122
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,519
in the topic section that you're

123
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,879
recording it and then you can record it

124
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,879
on your own and then share it I guess

125
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,240
through other like your podcast or

126
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,478
whatever yes a lot of people are doing

127
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,000
that okay well that's amazing because to

128
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,038
not be able to sa it I thought was a

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,839
little bit of a downer um but at the

130
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,560
same time it seemed to create unique

131
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,279
conversation that uh I just can't really

132
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,079
say enough about it it's super trippy

133
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,279
it's an invite only app it's not

134
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,120
available to Android it is available to

135
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,918
iPhone users they're going to make it

136
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,959
available to Android users eventually

137
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,000
but I would get on it figure it out I'm

138
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,638
going to have a presence over there at T

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,399
and and and Allison and Mike and a ton

140
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,478
of people are over there already um it's

141
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,478
really Dynamic like it's definitely

142
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,719
pretty trippy the different rooms that

143
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,159
you can go into based on they've even

144
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,599
started there's a there's a German

145
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,000
cannabis room I was in earlier today I

146
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:24,120
couldn't understand an entire word they

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,079
said but they were just talking about

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,959
cannabis and German that is so awesome

149
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,120
no I'm really stoked on the app it's

150
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,399
definitely unique I think the fact that

151
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,800
it takes the video out of the um you

152
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,239
know the the sort of people are are

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,038
really eer to share when that video

154
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,038
isn't there when it's less you know

155
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,120
exposed it's a little bit more private

156
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:51,478
they're just a voice and uh yeah it's

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,560
how can we get an invite now that is a

158
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,120
thing I'm not too sure I would ask

159
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,759
around if you go on and you go and

160
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,038
reserve your name it should show you who

161
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,520
in your Conta are on clubhouse and you

162
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,439
could potentially hit them up in a

163
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,198
private message and say hey do you have

164
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,759
a clubhouse invite for me uh that would

165
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,720
be you know potentially one way of uh of

166
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,400
getting it done I just had Stephen send

167
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,160
me an invitation and then I used my two

168
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,878
that the thing about those invitations

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,639
is if you send them out to the wrong

170
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,520
people if you send them out to people on

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,400
Androids or you accidentally send it to

172
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,359
an iPad instead of the the actual phone

173
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,719
the invites are gone and it is a little

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,680
bit rough in that sense that uh they

175
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,360
there it it's it's very easy to blow

176
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,240
your in your invitations and you only

177
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,598
get a couple but uh if I had the more

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,598
I'm I'm gonna interrupt you real quick

179
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,478
the more that you talk and the more that

180
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,878
you moderate the more invites you get I

181
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,918
did get three more after my initial two

182
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,120
but I've given them all away three of

183
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,758
them were like Matt Stang ones where

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,800
they were just pooched I accidentally

185
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,158
gave them to people who I don't even

186
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
know if their phone number is the same

187
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,000
phone number anymore so I have I have an

188
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,918
invite for you

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,199

on clubhouse but if you guys aren't on

219
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
it if you can figure out a way to get on

220
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,799
it if there's people on this panel that

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,640
have an iPhone and want to get an

222
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:22,559
invitation I mean Mark you would

223
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,360
absolutely Crush Clubhouse um there's

224
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,719
been times where I've wanted to ping you

225
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,879
into the room where people have been

226
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,480
going off on sort of science what

227
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:32,320
exactly is it I'm I'm just joined so I

228
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,519
missed something what is Club well

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,200
Clubhouse is just an app and it to me it

230
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,200
feels like an app that's really turning

231
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,519
the corner it's not an Instagram it's

232
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,759
not a Twitter it's not a Facebook it's

233
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,120
not it's not about getting likes it's

234
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,480
not about posting pictures it's just

235
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,078
audio um you can go into all these

236
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,680
different rooms I was in a room the

237
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:53,759
other day with uh G well it's just been

238
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,519
an incredible like experience tons of

239
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,639
amazing people I even ended up with a in

240
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,399
a room with Todd McCormack the other day

241
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,360
on a on a panel where we were both

242
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,480
speaking it was kind of funny I kept my

243
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,800
mouth quiet cuz I knew the last time I

244
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,879
went into a room that he was in he left

245
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:11,039
right away and I felt bad but um it's

246
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,000
kind of cool like there's conversations

247
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,958
going on and dialogues taking place that

248
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,200
you absolutely can't imagine the

249
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,399
psychedelic mushroom one blew me away I

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,040
was amazed at how diverse the group of

251
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,958
people in the rooms were tons of people

252
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,159
from America that are just like what's

253
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,679
going on with these psychedelic

254
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,039
mushrooms tons of great knowledge and

255
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,519
and shares going on in that uh in that

256
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:38,078
sort of area and just really unique

257
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,480
conversations like think hash church and

258
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,319
you know you can start more diverse

259
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,879
diverse more diverse you think hash

260
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,639
Church in the sense of like joining

261
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,879
together with 10 or 15 people and having

262
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,039
a conversation but it's just like an

263
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,679
endless group of people imagine if in

264
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,838
the chat room right now in YouTube if I

265
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,439
could just click on a name and bring

266
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,200
them right up into here because that's

267
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,399
how it is you've got like 10 or 20

268
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,360
people on the panel you got another 50

269
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,039
to 100 that are coming into the room and

270
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,480
and leaving and coming and if one of

271
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,278
those people come in that you want to

272
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,200
hear you just rightclick their name if

273
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,200
you're the moderator you invite to speak

274
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,639
and now that person is up on the panel

275
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,200
and it's it's pretty darn good people

276
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,600
are pretty good in regards to keeping

277
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,600
their mics um muted when they're not

278
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,839
talking and it's just super super

279
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,159
diverse in the sense of I mean my

280
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,760
goodness were you in that room the other

281
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:33,958
day with the Nigerian uh princess

282
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:37,559
yeah yeah yeah the other thing is um you

283
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,239
can um there's there's different ways

284
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,039
that you can connect with people I mean

285
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,839
like you can't message in the actual app

286
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,360
itself which is kind of cool because

287
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,920
there's no back messaging during the

288
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,519
conversation but you can uh connect your

289
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,919
Instagram and they can DM you and you

290
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,039
can follow it uh people and engage with

291
00:11:53,919 --> 00:12:00,000
them that way it's very much like an

292
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,000
immediate audio connection um

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,278
one of the most fascinating things I I

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,919
was just told I was too long um one of

295
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,000
the most fascinating things that I found

296
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,240
so it's not only subject matter experts

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,120
I mean they're just regular so regular

298
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,399
folks can join the discussion without

299
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,959
knowing much of anything and you're

300
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,720
called up your moderator at top so it's

301
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,039
kind of three three levels you've got

302
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,519
the speakers at the top which are the

303
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,240
moderators SL speakers then you've got a

304
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,600
second section that are those that are

305
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,959
followed by the speakers which are not

306
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,959
on the stage and then you have the

307
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,599
general audience at the bottom the

308
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,958
moderators up top can bring anybody up

309
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,519
from any level and there's a rais hand

310
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,078
function so if somebody has a question

311
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,120
you allow them to raise hand then you

312
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,439
can bring them up ask them the question

313
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,600
then dismiss them off the day or keep

314
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,839
them up there to have further

315
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,320
conversation so it's a fun I'm learning

316
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,279
a lot I'm teaching it's it's a great way

317
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,720
to absorb information and because you're

318
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,720
not on video you can just listen to it

319
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,079
on the side so it's who owns the

320
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,680
platform is it a public

321
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:08,919
company most likely yeah it I've heard a

322
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,519
bunch about these guys not super good

323
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,958
things I definitely heard a couple of

324
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,600
bad things when I first did some

325
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,479
research but yeah I saw the other day

326
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,959
they had like a billion dollar valuation

327
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,920
on this app and it's uh I think it's

328
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,078
been around for a while like since April

329
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,159
but it seems to have only just caught my

330
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,638
attention here in the last week or so

331
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,519
but it's I kind of can't say enough

332
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,680
about it it's very addicting and uh it's

333
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,639
very unique to just be able to it's nice

334
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,319
for me to go into rooms and just listen

335
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,278
not be invited up not have anyone know

336
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,480
me at all and just listen and just be

337
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,759
like wow okay this is actually really

338
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,440
really cool so I've been how do they

339
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,240
make their money like what's their

340
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,519
business

341
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,320
model good data I would suspect like all

342
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,198
of these companies how they all make

343
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,278
their money it's all through data and

344
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,559
and what so there there's got to be some

345
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,639
you know you got to follow the money

346
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,198
with these things man right I mean don't

347
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,759
they own the content like when when you

348
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:11,120
so um kind of like no more than YouTube

349
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,399
no more than Instagram no more than like

350
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,720
it's pretty standard I mean the lawyers

351
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,720
the the sharks that wrote that stuff up

352
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,278
years ago it's now just getting

353
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,680
regurgitated into new versions and I I

354
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,278
would be certain that uh just like

355
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,758
Instagram everything you post on there

356
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,838
belongs to them kind of thing but well

357
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,480
not not wanting to bring Poli

358
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,600
disc but I'm wondering if if like you

359
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,120
know like the way that they ended parlor

360
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,879
or the way that they took away the the

361
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,360
the the what the hosting service of of

362
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,159
parlor could this be a way again for

363
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,560
hate groups to sort of assemble or do

364
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:50,719
they police that in any way

365
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:53,359
or that's that's a great question yes no

366
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,839
they do they do um you can block people

367
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,399
and report people I have found that

368
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,120
people are very kind to each other and

369
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,078
when someone like a troll comes in they

370
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,360
are blocked and kicked out

371
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,958
immediately and so uh there is a

372
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,519
reporting feature uh I don't know like I

373
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,159
don't know the ins and outs of parlor

374
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,639
because that's just not my game but um

375
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,719
you know there there is a reporting

376
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,159
feature and it's been everyone has been

377
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,680
very kind and we kind of police each

378
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:25,559
other I I found that also the people

379
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:28,519
have been absolutely like really kind

380
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,159
like really like respectful I've only

381
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,000
really had one experience in a room

382
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,559
where the wrong person got made into a

383
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,278
moderator and you kind of got to be

384
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,239
careful about that because that person

385
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:39,720
can kick you out of your own room they

386
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,440
could kick every moderator out of the

387
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,639
room and and basically take over your

388
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,639
room so that I experienced once already

389
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,159
not a guy taking over a room but one of

390
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,318
20 moderators just you know cutting the

391
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,838
in fact it was an incredible

392
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,078
conversation because it was about it

393
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,680
started about men cutting women off and

394
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:00,919
she said you know she was talking she

395
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,159
got interrupted she said you know I get

396
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,240
this happens to me all the time men cut

397
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,600
me off and it's a real problem and I'm

398
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,839
going to mention it right now and we're

399
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,480
going to have a discussion and then it

400
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,040
kind of took a turn because another

401
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,720
woman came in and said you know like I

402
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,240
would like it to share a different

403
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,519
perspective and she was like you know

404
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,198
some people have OCD some people have

405
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,198
dyslexia some people have all these

406
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,919
little tweaks with their personalities

407
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,399
they're using this app because they want

408
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,919
to come in and and and interact but they

409
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,240
have these tweaks and ticks of their

410
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,078
personalities and she was kind of saying

411
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,318
she was one of those people she tends to

412
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,679
cut people off and so she came in with

413
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,318
this really different unique perspective

414
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,439
and then the other girl was like no I'm

415
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:45,479
not buying it I'm I I'm owning this he

416
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,519
was cutting me off the guy had already

417
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,600
apologized but it was still and it

418
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,159
reminded me of hash Church like many

419
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,120
times there's been many men cut many men

420
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,078
off as well as many women off but I

421
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,600
think it's just cuz we get excited Wade

422
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,758
can shake his head cuz literally the

423
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,838
only one that has never done it um but

424
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,519
we've done it we've all done it and uh

425
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,879
we talk louder and we try to get our

426
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:10,679
point across and so this discussion

427
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,959
started and the girl was like I'm not

428
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,519
having it like I he cut me off and bl

429
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,279
and then like one of the moderators from

430
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,879
the room bounced her out of the room and

431
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,240
so it became a whole thing and I

432
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,280
actually listened for about 40 minutes

433
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,160
and it was awkward and it was difficult

434
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,519
but I felt like there was value in that

435
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,120
dialogue having that dialogue and like

436
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,119
sitting through these cringe you know

437
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,119
worthy moments that uh that were

438
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,000
occurring but as as a man I felt like uh

439
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,798
it was a learning experience and I I

440
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,119
definitely saw both perspectives of of

441
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:43,759
both uh of these girls but uh you'll

442
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,439
find all sorts of things like that on

443
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,879
clubhouse it's a hey Marcus go back to

444
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,960

445
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,440
like the Nigerian came in and like had

446
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,400
no idea and was just asking

447
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,600
questions remember that I went into I

448
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,440
just went into her room so I don't

449
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:02,158

450
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,159

457
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,879
I'll go listen to her for a bit and I I

458
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,678
was in one of the games rooms the other

459
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,960
day talking about like um you know

460
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,080
social equity and social justice and you

461
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,319
know basically making space for for

462
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:32,319
brown and black people to be a part of

463
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:34,119
this uh industry and uh there's just

464
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,599
been a lot of you know kind of unique

465
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:38,119
people that you wouldn't normally have

466
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,439
access to I don't do too much of that

467
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,479
mostly I hit rooms that I see Dr Allison

468
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,038
in in psychedelic conversations or

469
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,599
cannabis conversations those are the

470
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,400
ones that I really enjoy I mean Mike

00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,759
psychedelics and when we get into a

488
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,639
psychedelic experience where it's a bad

489
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,480
trip and people were like well it's not

490
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,480
really bad it's about working those

491
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,798
particular muscles and it feels rough

492
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,759
because it's hard when you're working

493
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,798
things out but you end up getting out

494
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,038
the other side and so this African guy

495
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,918
came in and he was like you are speaking

496
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,679
about drugs you you are smoking drugs

497
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,720
and he was really loud and and people

498
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,559
were kind of jumped all over him and got

499
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,319
real negative and I I don't know if you

500
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,440
remember this at T but I sort of said to

501
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,038
everyone I said Hey listen you know like

502
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,440
here we are talking about how to deal

503
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:03,119
with bad trips and then one potentially

504
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,360
comes into our actual reality in this

505
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,119
moment and this is how we deal with it

506
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,038
cuz people were really jumping on that

507
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,719
guy to kind of bounce let's get him out

508
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,240
he's a troll and it's like well maybe

509
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,279
he's a troll but maybe he's just a guy

510
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,038
from Africa who has a cultural

511
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,918
difference who wants to interact with us

512
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,519
and maybe we could be a little bit more

513
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:27,320
patient so yeah I found that funny as

514
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,480
well let him start his own room the

515
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:32,399
anti-drug room

516
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,640
yeah exactly how you doing Sam

517
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,519
welcome I'm I'm alive a few minutes late

518
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,080
but I'm here there was a really big

519
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,759
conversation yesterday in one of the

520
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,158
rooms Donnie worter was there Dale Hunt

521
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,960
was there they were talking about

522
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,960
patents and IP in the Cannabis industry

523
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,720
and it was an entire conversation about

524
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,000
GW Pharmaceuticals and canopy growth uh

525
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,159
suing GW Pharmaceuticals because of the

526
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,519
CO2 patent that they acquired that runs

527
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,240
out in about a year

528
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,000
and that was also a very interesting

529
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,839
conversation I hadn't heard from from

530
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,880
Donnie wora in a very long time so it

531
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,599
was neat to kind of hear him up on the

532
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,039
on the stage talking about these things

533
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,319
he obviously has a fairly um in-depth

534
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:19,960
perspective of such things but I was

535
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:23,599
thinking about you Sam well Donnie is a

536
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,600
a lawyer but he also has narcolepsy so

537
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,959
while you're talking to him he'll fall

538
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,839
asleep yes that's true I've had that

539
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,679
happen many times with Donnie as I've

540
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:36,319
known him for gez about 30 years now

541
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,360
he's one of the people that goes back

542
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:42,960
very very far he thought we went back to

543
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:49,119
96 yesterday but it's actually more like

544
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,840
94 95 when I actually first met uh Mr

545
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,079
wora

546
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:55,839
so had a lot of influence because uh his

547
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:01,879
uh

548
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:04,199
uncle was uh the famous uh Progressive

549
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:08,080
Insurance Company

550
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,558
Uh crap I can't remember his name right

551
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:14,439
now but uh he he put in millions for

552
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,839
marijuana

553
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,440
legalization Peter

554
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:23,119
Lewis yeah good old Peter yes uh he when

555
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,798
I visited with him it was in Amsterdam

556
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,199
on his boat which at the time was the

557
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,879
10th largest private boat in the world

558
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,278
Donnie was also one of the original

559
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,960
hamsters he had the Ohio hempy and was

560
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:37,558
uh importing uh hemp seed oil and all

561
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,038
that stuff uh yeah because when I was

562
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,079
working for ecolution we used to work on

563
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:46,278
Imports exports and um trading wholesale

564
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,278
stuff like that back in the mid

565
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:51,278
9s that's how we met him basically

566
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,120
through hemp he came out to Manitoba and

567
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:55,319
we threw this big hemp kind of

568
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,759
conference pageant almost like a hemp

569
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,759
pageant and we brought the the the

570
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,079
Harvester from Holland and we had the

571
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,919
big scissor cut we had the acreage going

572
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:08,879
on this was like in the mid

573
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,559
90s and we were trying to get live seed

574
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,600
at the time and you know you could buy

575
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,639
hemp seed from China that was sterilized

576
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,798
and dead and put it into hemp seed food

577
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,840
and promote it as a health thing but

578
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,720
really there was nothing left alive in

579
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,000
it whatsoever the embryos had just been

580
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,558
steamed to death before they could ship

581
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,839
out of China and that was about $800 a

582
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,879
ton but if you wanted to bring living

583
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,519
seed to actually plant and it was like

584
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,320
certified seed and registered in Canada

585
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,240
that was the zolotonosha that we were

586
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,359
getting out of the Ukraine the 11 the

587
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,240
13th and the 15th now obviously Sam

588
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,719
could probably go on for hours about the

589
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,000
different varieties of hemp because

590
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,400
there was the phola that he had things

591
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,519
to do with and there were many other

592
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,038
varieties from different countries in

593
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,440
Europe but we here we are at the 90s

594
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,079
we're having this event we've got a

595
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,519
whole room full of farmers and we've

596
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,278
brought our zolotonosha in and it's it's

597
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,679
not cheap it's like 3,000 bucks a ton or

598
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,079
something that these Ukrainian guys

599
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,000
wanted for this seed and you know it was

600
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,480
viable we figured no problem we'll make

601
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,119
it work and so we bought all this seed I

602
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,038
think we bought about uh I want to say

603
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,678
10

604
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,359
tons um and we brought that over and we

605
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,200
were trying to sell it to Farmers and

606
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,558

611
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,840
we were trying to get like 3,500 bucks

612

know that in my heart one of the main

651
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,320
reasons I have ATT tenden to do that and

652
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,640
I know I do it is because I think of

653
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,960
something that I think's important and I

654
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,880
want to say it and I should just get a

655
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,960
pencil and paper but I

656
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,440
don't before you forget it I get it I

657
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,200
get it you know what I'm so not offended

658
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,159
it's totally

659
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:23,038
fine I'm so not offended and actually I

660
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,480
was thinking so don warsha is on our um

661
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,200
he's on the center for cannabis and

662
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,880
social policy board with me and he's

663
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,960
it's funny because we were we were

664
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,120
talking about Jack herrer on clubhouse

665
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,679
as well and um about how Jack herrer

666
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:40,639
like if you had weed he would just come

667
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,600
over and be like what God and like look

668
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,240
in your back and like take a handful of

669
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:49,158
it well Don does the same

670
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,359
thing well how about this okay let's

671
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:55,320
talk about the difference between that

672
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:57,639
and skunkman Sam skunkman Sam doesn't

673
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:00,000
even accept things from people generally

674
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,159
like for the for a very long time I was

675
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,880
blown away when I could actually produce

676
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,880
something that he would smoke so it's

677
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,080
almost the opposite not only will he not

678
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,960
take your stash he's probably not going

679
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,199
to smoke it in any way shape or form

680
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,640
unless it's up to a certain level of of

681
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,759
quality which I also always was uh

682
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,200
impressed with that uh you had some

683
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:21,798
people that were just willing to kind of

684
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,919
get in there and and take whatever they

685
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:26,359
could get and then you got Sam who's

686
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,960
just like I've sorted out everything I

687
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,439
need for myself I'm

688
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,558
I'm I'm not taking

689
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,919
anything well I can't say that I gave a

690
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:41,839
lot of canvas away I did give quite a

691
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,799
bit but compared to seeds I used to walk

692
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,798
in the Million Man March here in

693
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:49,599
Amsterdam and I would take a 2 kilo bag

694
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,879
of seeds with me and I would hand out a

695
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,519
handful to anybody who wanted it and I

696
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,440
would listen to them because they were

697
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,960
mostly Dutch people and I'd hear them

698
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,320
what is this and the otherone would say

699
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,159
oh it's h it's you know it's just in the

700
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,158
meantime he's giving away stunt number

701
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,880
ones dude you told me those stories

702
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,600
before of giving away like nice genetics

703
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,000
to people that just had no idea and

704
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,398
that's also there's something really

705
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
wonderful about that CU you have to know

706
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:22,959
that some of those random people went

707
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,480
home and plugged that into some some

708
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,319
dirt and grew that up and was just like

709
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,200
what the [ __ ] is this it was it was the

710
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,879
best H they've ever

711
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,880

712
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,840
down that's awesome that is awesome some

713
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,000
of those stories too you know those uh

714
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:46,240
the million dooll March the Million Man

715
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,240
March and also the um the Queen's Day

716
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,319
celebration where you'd pull out those

717
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,440
goo

718
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:58,119
balls yep those were absolutely

719
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:03,480
wonderful uh clarifi ghee with uh about

720
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:07,079
R of THC and uh extracted from scun

721
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,558
number one actually or from aach I

722
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,119
mean I got to think some people had a

723
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:12,720
pretty intense trip like you couldn't

724
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,479
just give those to

725
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,600
anyone no I would tell people that uh

726
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,480
you should only eat a half one first to

727
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:24,000
wait a few hours before you eat anym

728
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,278
except for people like n who she could

729
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,519
pop two or three in her mouth and uh

730
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:33,000
walk down the street you know no problem

731
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:36,759
at all so could uh our friend Robbie but

732
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,398
uh you know and I if I would eat like

733
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,798
five of them I would start sort of

734
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,278
getting shaky and I couldn't stand up

735
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:46,119
very

736
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:49,398
good 5,000

737
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,398
milligrams that's

738
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:57,158
T that that's a heroic dose I take 50 at

739
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,319
a time but that's got to be something

740
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,320
that's beyond a eroic dose dude what the

741
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,319
[ __ ] five dried grams and he's like Oh I

753
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:39,000
in

754
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:41,720
2008 beautiful beautiful I see Johnny B

755

just joined Clubhouse I actually I had a

756
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,278
link to it and I was like Wow Clubhouse

757
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,319
someone was trying to get me to join I

758
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,278
clicked onto it and I was like okay so I

759
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,158
went over to Mark checked out your

760
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:53,519
Clubhouse follow what you're following

761
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,639
because that just makes sense because we

762
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,599
like the same [ __ ] and um I'm going to

763
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,158
check it out I think you're going to way

764
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:03,719
more than check it out John you'll be

765
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,840
living on Club I promise living with the

766
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,360
amount of time that you have you will be

767
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,678
out you'll probably spend 10 plus hours

768
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,519
on clubhouse a day and I I'm not even

769
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,840
joking I was just told you were on a

770
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,558
group with somebody else that I know I

771
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,519
was like really and I and then within

772
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,678
two seconds I'm like okay that just made

773
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:24,359
sense and Johnny it's okay to not go on

774
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,720
the stage you want to be and have the

775
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,719
energy sometimes I won't go on stage I

776
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,240
just want to go in and listen so don't

777
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,159
feel compelled sometimes that you have

778
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,319
to go on stage it's okay to just sit

779
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,039
back and just listen if you're not in

780
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,759
the mood to speak so just

781
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,839
FYI moderation because a lot of us fall

782
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:44,599
in quickly deep and your next year

783
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,638
everyone's inviting you to every single

784
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:48,158
room to talk and discuss and there's

785
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,038
nothing wrong with that but you want to

786
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,960
be able to match the levels in the rooms

787
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,519
and those levels can be Mighty High so

788
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,798
just realize check yourself before you

789
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,759
wreck yourself sort of

790
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,440
thank you good advice I like that it's

791
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,960
good advice because that site is

792
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,320
absolutely Bonkers and the

793
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,720
caliber uh I've I've been in some rooms

794
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,359
where it's just been kind of really

795
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,919
noobs and they're all like willing to

796
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,479
learn and then I've been in other rooms

797
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,320
where it's like you know you just have

798
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,919
the highest caliber of people talking

799
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,720
about the things they know everything

800
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,919
about and it's really nice to listen to

801
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,839
people um you know speak ELO eloquently

802
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,038
and uh um

803
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:32,759
articulately let me just talk to for a

804
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:36,158
second about the diversity yeah I I have

805
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,798
noticed that um just the different

806
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,559
cultures and how they regard cannabis

807
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,879
and how they use cannabis is blowing me

808
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,918
away as well as some of the knowledge

809
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,440
some of them actually have and are

810
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:54,159
bringing into their communities I'm just

811
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,440
I I'm stunned with the um the

812
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,559
information that they do have and I'm

813
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,519
also so appreciative of the different

814
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:04,398
cultures I agree I've been I've been in

815
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,638
rooms where I've definitely been a

816
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:10,079
minority in the room and just loving the

817
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:12,240
conversation and really getting into

818
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,638
sort of these difficult conversations

819
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,638
that maybe some people don't want to

820
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:18,558
have you know and I've just I've enjoyed

821
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:20,798
it all I I can't say enough about it

822
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,200
it's uh it's extremely

823
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,359
diverse I actually brought it up in a

824
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,278
very diverse room about how that there

825
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,119
seems to be a difference between um

826
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,638
white culture and Black Culture when it

827
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:36,678
comes to cannabis and I got schooled and

828
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:39,519
I appreciated it um I mean I was just I

829
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,559
asked questions because I wanted to know

830
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,200
um not because I was trying to have a

831
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:48,200
bias and they they were open and honest

832
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,080
and it was so refreshing and so

833
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,519
appreciative totally yep for sure it

834
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:57,079
wasn't in clubhouse but recently I was

835
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,679
visiting a shop on Commercial Drive um

836
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:03,038
here in Van couver run by this really

837
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:07,200
great woman who is super Dynamic and

838
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:08,960
she's um African Canadian woman she said

839
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,679
to me uh when I was speaking where we

840
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,240
were talking about the different markets

841
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,159
and we were we were like oh the gray

842
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,358
Market the the legal Market the black

843
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,280
market and she said you know what I

844
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,559
don't use the term the black market it

845
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,760
it sort of is a negative connotation and

846
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,440
it sort of was the end of my using that

847
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,440
term she's like I just appreciate if you

848
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,480
called it the gray Market uh and and uh

849
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,679
and I was like you know what thanks for

850
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,679
sharing sharing that with me and thanks

851
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,440
for putting me in check and uh I will

852
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,599
make sure that I don't say those words

853
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,639
out my mouth anymore that Green Market

854
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,159
is easy enough for me and it was you

855
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,440
know it was nice like free market what's

856
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,200
that free market yeah free market that's

857
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,838
even better free market we also used

858
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,398
traditional Market to signalize the

859
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:51,519
previous Market that seems to be a

860
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:53,719
better understanding for what the

861
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,918
Underground Market is that we like here

862
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,399
in California came from so we tend to

863
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,239
use traditional markets so when we're

864
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,960
saying traditional Market that's what

865
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,719
we're me meaning that that has been

866
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,679
traditionally The Underground Market

867
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,199
yeah ATN that's how we've called it on

868
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,440
on the East Coast New York um you know

869
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,199
all these these states that are coming

870
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,880
online we've always consistently called

871
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,519
it uh the traditional Market because

872
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,920
that's traditionally how we would get

873
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:20,440
our

874
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,240
cannabis so I concur with

875
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,159
that no clature

876
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:30,639
matters IR how ironic that it like I I I

877
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:33,879
used to use the term Black Market all

878
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:38,078
the time and not even think about the

879
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,320
origin of the word until this year when

880
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,519
black lives matter really brought it out

881
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,160
that hey wait a second the reason why

882
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,119
it's called the black market is because

883
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:49,159
they wanted to associate it with black

884
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,920
people it's like that's totally wrong

885
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,639
I'm never going to use that again well

886
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,599
exactly and there's a guy in the room

887
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,400
right now who says I don't think a black

888
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,160
market is having a negative connotation

889
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,880
and that might be part of of your white

890
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,399
privilege but when I spoke with this

891
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,358
black woman she guaranteed had a problem

892
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,519
with it she she wasn't upset but she

893
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:08,679
asked me respectfully not to use the

894
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:10,838
term around her and I was absolutely

895
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:13,239
happy to comply it's like why would you

896
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:14,920
use terms that that create

897
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,318
uncomfortableness or a hostile

898
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,960
environment with well and I think you

899
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:20,000
hit the nail on the head when you say

900
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,400
White Privilege mark because we're all

901
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
white here and we don't understand that

902
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,960
you know for us and so for someone to be

903
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,199
in a different color skin and for them

904
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,480
to react to those words and to school us

905
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,639
I mean hey I that's a schooling that

906
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,480
I'll take please absolutely I agree with

907
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:41,199
you Mark and if someone's telling you

908
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:44,280
that it's like why not just respect them

909
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,598
you know why why Buck them just say okay

910
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,599
and it's just um it's about everyone

911
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,280
appreciating different cultures and

912
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,280
that's the love that's it's funny how

913
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,760
much this conversation is upsetting

914
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,440
people in chat right now there are

915
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,200
absolute people in chat who are like

916
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,559
you're being too sensitive oh gez I'm

917
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,279
leaving and it's like you know that's

918
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:05,440
your one privilege bro

919
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,640
like you have to accept it with humility

920
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,639
you cannot you know again that's coming

921
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:12,318
from a place of privilege if you cannot

922
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:14,318
L listen to other cultures and listen to

923
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:17,079
look through their eyes in their

924
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:20,400
perspective then you need to step back a

925
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,599
second because uh I have an a bald

926
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,200
person and so you know just being bald

927
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,160
going to Dead shows I was considered a

928
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,399
narc or a cop because I looked a

929
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,000
particular particular way so I

930
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,519
understand what it felt like I've been

931
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,280
chased up trees because I was a punk I'd

932
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,000
have eggs thrown at me I've had people

933
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,560
try to beat me up and challenge me so I

934
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,400
understand from a slight perspective but

935
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,639
I'm still a white male so I don't

936
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,838
understand from a black brown Native

937
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,519
American perspective Etc from every

938
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:54,039
other color so it behooves me to humble

939
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:57,800
myself to listen as a student of of

940
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:59,639
Earth as opposed to a white person of

941
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,599
privilege depending on my monetary

942
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:05,598
status so um you know people can't

943
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,720
accept being challenged too people can't

944
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,119
accept humility sometimes so you know

945
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,159
that's something that is a challenge to

946
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,519
every being but you we must listen we

947
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,559
must listen to these perspectives and I

948
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:22,039
I grant Clubhouse one of the most

949
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,880
amazing things is that you are forced

950
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:26,039
into diversity and these diverse

951
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,559
discussions because they are the

952
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,880
moderators they are having the disc

953
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:31,880
sessions and sometimes they are specific

954
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,119
and I recommend going into these rooms

955
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,960
I'm part of various other rooms of

956
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,280
equity and color because I want to learn

957
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,559
I want to listen I want to absorb so

958
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,400
that I can be aware of that perspective

959
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,559
because it's important because we've

960
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,838
ignored perspective for so long it's

961
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:52,039
become dangerous we need to be more

962
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:54,880
listening than necessarily talking yeah

963
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:57,199
NTN your words are resonating very very

964
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,640
very strongly with me if I could hug you

965
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,039
through through the computer I'd be

966
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,440
hugging

967
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,679
you let's all hug each other come on

968
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,960

969

smoking a little hash this morning it's

970
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,639
I would love that

971
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:15,719
Marcus I think it's a brain hug is a

972
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:17,318
brain hug let's get a brain hug for

973
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,919
everybody what is everyone smoking on

974
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:22,480
right now that's a that's a question I'd

975
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,440
like to oh I love that what is that

976
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,838
Marcus this is a little strawberry

977
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,599
banana hash

978
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:32,078
rosin oh look at me I got this I got

979
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,400
stra Nana right here too Man

980
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,359
Nice N

981
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,680
sash y smoking on that's always fun this

982
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:44,358
white

983
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:46,960
fire Kelly yay Alien OG G I think they

984
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:50,358
just showed aigo in at the perfect time

985
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:55,159
a full vat Jesus Christ dragonfly Earth

986
00:39:50,358 --> 00:40:01,358
what the hell is that jar of Love yum

987
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:03,078
yum yeah Jack herrer nice my favorite we

988
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,920
got even though it's low yields on the

989
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:11,280
hash I still love it's my my alltime

990
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:14,400
favorite just little of some many cush

991
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,880
tur what Jack is a low yielder is that

992
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,880
right yeah it's so so uh the resin on

993
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,358
Jack is for me at least I don't know

994
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,559
what Jacks you guys are growing because

995
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,759
there's everyone has their ideology of

996
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:28,559
what chck herrer is but um I find that

997
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,720
resin to be too greasy

998
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,519
uh in the Micron sizes are are lend

999
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,279
towards smaller head sizes so I get a

1000
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,880
larger yield in a

1001
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,319
45 than I would in let's say the 90 and

1002
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,318
73 and

1003
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:47,440
120 um however the tpin on that varietal

1004
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:50,199
in that that just that particular cut

1005
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,800
that I have are just unbelievable and

1006
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:56,679
I'll I'll spend all day making it just

1007
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,960
for my head um but it's yeah I you know

1008
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:00,639
I I walk around and I feel the resin and

1009
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,760
I have you know over the years I've kind

1010
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,480
of developed my own version and I'm sure

1011
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,040
everyone has their own version of what

1012
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,559
resin works for them and their

1013
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,880
particular process so I find the things

1014
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,119
that are less that are more greasy to be

1015
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,680
lower yielding in in the the bags that

1016
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,160
I'm not you know honing in on as much

1017
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,679
such as the 90 and 73 but I still love

1018
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,559
it I you know I just like I said I'll

1019
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:25,919
I'll watch that all

1020
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,679
day all day I found Jack to be a great

1021
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,318
mortgage maker but not necessarily

1022
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:33,719
something that's in my stash you know

1023
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:36,079
again from the hash to the flower I've

1024
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:40,279
just never been a fan of that particular

1025
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,680
varietal and i' I've yeah know I

1026
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,119
remember the year it was released in

1027
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,799
Amsterdam I remember Sensei had a big

1028
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:47,960
plant of it on the top floor of the

1029
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,760
Pack's Party House in the back corner of

1030
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,920
the room and uh I'm not sure if it was

1031
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:57,000
like 95 or 9 yeah it was 95 cuz I was at

1032
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,680
the no I think it was 96 cuz I we went

1033
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,159
to the castle when they actually did it

1034
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:05,159
with exactly yeah C Castle yeah that was

1035
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,679
a wow because we got to then go see the

1036
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,598
flowering uh father that was all

1037
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,719
flowered out downstairs you have an

1038
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,680
actual father that was fully flowered

1039
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:15,799
out that was like because I've never

1040
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,480
seen a fully flowered out male to that

1041
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,079
point and I was just like holy [ __ ]

1042
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,000
that's [ __ ] badass and we're in a

1043
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,240
cannabis Castle

1044
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,960
nuts so is is the pH is the phenomena

1045
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:30,879
that leads to low yield is is that um

1046
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,920
what you were saying Colin like a

1047
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,760
certain degree of of greasiness that has

1048
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:42,280
to do with not being able to get

1049
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,400
good head recovery or what what's what's

1050
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,400
exactly the so there's a few things that

1051
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,680
you know this is anecdotal we we need to

1052
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,000
get deeper on the understanding of why

1053
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:55,118
tricomes are collected in seed easier

1054
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,960
than others um but I think there's a

1055
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,838
there's a trifecta happening you have

1056
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,358
that head size you have the tpin that

1057
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,719
are being created and then you have the

1058
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:08,000
way that it's grown right and all these

1059
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:11,679
things together create what I consider

1060
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,639
the the the Pyramid of how you can

1061
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:17,838
select for resin and and select for a

1062
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:19,199
yield and um that is not a silver bullet

1063
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,318
you're you're going to have every

1064
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,159
varietal and every feno and even every

1065
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:25,440
even kenot type is going to have a

1066
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:27,480
different um expression and that

1067
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,599
expression is going to be needed to be

1068
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,440
treated differently every time you in

1069
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,240
the process and in your process of

1070
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,880
selection has to do right now for me um

1071
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:39,318
very it's very intuitive I walk the room

1072
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,920
I feel the resin I I look at how it

1073
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:44,440
snaps off my finger I then do test

1074
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,760
washes that are smaller washes I try to

1075
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,800
understand what the the resin is doing

1076
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,280
when I when you do these smaller washes

1077
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,680
um you know I look for color I look for

1078
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,640
clarity I look for all that stuff but it

1079
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,598
all has to do with the the the three

1080
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:00,838
things I was talking about

1081
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,920
um but we need to better understand why

1082
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,279
um you know this is happening you I'm

1083
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,920
sure Marcus has a lot of insight on that

1084
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,079
too um but some some you know I found

1085
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,720
that for instance some heads are

1086
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,920
hydrophobic they they want to they want

1087
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,239
to float in the water so you know i'

1088
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,318
I've definitely looked at things under a

1089
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:20,399
microscope and I'm I'm trying to better

1090
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:23,400
understand it but we're still a long

1091
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,280
ways away from really having like hey

1092
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,920
this is what you need to look for um so

1093
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,240
there's yeah I would say one other point

1094
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,079
that you're missing is when you're

1095
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:39,679
making dry sift how long you've dried

1096
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:43,079
and cured and age the resin before you

1097
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:45,519
sift it was on the plant uh we always

1098
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,680
tried to do it for three months because

1099
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:51,639
that gave us more of a of a raisin

1100
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:53,679
rather than a grape and uh it was a lot

1101
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,558
easier to work with do you ever take a

1102
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,039
look at just looking at the the act of

1103
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,319
water or taking a look at the relative

1104
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,119
humidity in the room because I like my

1105
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:03,920
when I do my collecting of like say

1106
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,480
first bounce I always wait hang dry for

1107
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,639
about three weeks and then that last day

1108
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,838
or two I dropped the humidity from like

1109
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:14,078
65 down to like 50% just to do that

1110
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,039
first little bounce and then it raises

1111
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,880
back up in the room so that's something

1112
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:20,920
that I do um to get that kind of like

1113
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,039
that first little first

1114
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,440
melt so Johnny are you you talking about

1115
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:28,880
doing a a dry like dry material is that

1116
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,639
what you're talking about just making

1117
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,599
your first bounce like hang drying your

1118
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:36,480
plants and then taking that first little

1119
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:39,079
dry sip then from there I well I used to

1120
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,318
like I got different methods of of of

1121
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,039
doing like making for hash but I'm just

1122
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,759
Ling in the conversation I really like

1123
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,318
it because I mean I look at some yields

1124
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,559
like I'm having problems pulling bags

1125
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:51,199
now so it's it's just getting really bad

1126
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:54,040
on my back so I'm trying to find other

1127
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,358
ways of of actually uh like you're

1128
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:57,159
saying how the resin's collecting

1129
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,759
because I get like less yields on

1130
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:01,519
strains but I mean when I just took

1131
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,680
right now I took some of my stuff and I

1132
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:07,920
gave it to Tim to make an extraction for

1133
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,838
me and it came back like fire like the T

1134
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,880
beIN everything is like something I've

1135
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,719
never really had before so a lot of the

1136
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,400
work I I'm speaking on is just fresh

1137
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:19,118
frozen stuff now I do do dry um washes

1138
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,039
often but in terms of what I've been

1139
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,039
doing for the past couple few years is

1140
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,159
really focusing on fresh frozen washes

1141
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,039
and trying to up the yield in that realm

1142
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:29,598
because I'm looking mainly the stuff

1143
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:32,318
I've been looking for a lot of the the

1144
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,680
fresh tpes off the plants not not so so

1145
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:38,199
much the you know the terpenoids if you

1146
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:40,598
will so so I I think that you know if we

1147
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:41,879
can clarify for the audience here the

1148
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,559
thing that I was talking about was

1149
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,480
really about fresh frozen but but I

1150
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:46,359
think when you're getting into what

1151
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,358
Johnny's talking about I think he's

1152
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:49,880
right there's you know there's dry

1153
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:52,279
there's techniques for your dry cure

1154
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,160
that you really need to pay attention to

1155
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,040
um that go beyond fresh frozen and it's

1156
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:59,838
it's almost sometimes a different

1157
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:02,440
approach if you will to um to to

1158
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:05,159
collecting the resin

1159
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,679
heads like I just say I just uh I put

1160
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,078
everything in the freezer this time so I

1161
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:10,679
got like 10 pounds of wheat in my

1162
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:14,400
freezer to start

1163
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:17,039
washing yeah but yeah

1164
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,880
so sorry I was just gonna gonna say you

1165
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,759
know there's there's so many different

1166
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,119
ways for everyone to collect heads and I

1167
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,880
think we're you know we've all been

1168
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,519
doing this for I mean since I was we

1169
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,440
were young and you know two decades

1170
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,358
later I think we're and even Sam just

1171
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,599
pointed out something really helpful is

1172
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:37,358
your curing and how you cure it um is

1173
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:39,400
really specific to your you know to what

1174
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,759
you're doing and and ultimately in the

1175
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,760
in the regulated market I don't have I

1176
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,079
actually don't have the luxury to to dry

1177
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,119
a cure that long um I wish I did and I

1178
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,960
think that's a another conversation in

1179
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,960
itself um you know um a lot of people

1180
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,318
look at dates and they want to know that

1181
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,480
that was harvested on a specific date

1182
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:01,119
and if it's like x amount of months old

1183
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,199
they kind of look at it in an adverse

1184
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,880
way um and I think to you know Sam's

1185
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:07,639
Point that's not really a right way to

1186
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,680
look at it you know you have varying

1187
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:12,799
quality of different techniques to get

1188
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:16,118
to the same place well you did lose a

1189
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:20,039
bit of tpin when you age for three

1190
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:25,318
months I I'll admit that but I prefer

1191
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:27,400
the smoke from aged dried cannabis and

1192
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:32,558
uh I I find

1193
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:36,280
uh wet uh Frozen fresh frozen stuff it's

1194
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:39,359
too turpy for me and and maybe it's the

1195
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,319
wrong Turing the the more volatile ones

1196
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:44,519
are still there and I'm getting rid of a

1197
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:47,480
little bit more of those but but

1198
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,920
whatever people like I'm in favor of and

1199
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,880
uh there is a million ways to do it

1200
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,079
that's for sure it's a very different

1201
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,079
product I will say because the year that

1202
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,519
I went to the cup and I had made some

1203
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,480
dry sift from Matt the great Gardener's

1204
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,159
sweet

1205
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,039
skunk and it was incredible really

1206
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,838
beautiful stuff it was well long cured

1207
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,759
and then I sifted it and kept it for

1208
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:11,000
like six plus months before I ended up

1209
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,000
at the cup and everyone this was kind of

1210
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,559
one of those years where it was all just

1211
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,358
starting the faux melt crew caught on

1212
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,040
like I can't make faux melt but I can

1213
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,400
certainly make faux melt if I start

1214
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,558
using fresh frozen material and I shred

1215
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,440
the heads with a microplane I've got

1216
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,240
melty hash and I coined that term faux

1217
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,599
melt

1218
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:31,838
and that was really the initial start of

1219
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,680
fresh frozen and capturing all of these

1220
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:36,719
monot Turpin that generally we've been

1221
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:39,558
curing out of the product for decades

1222
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:42,480
because they're super [ __ ] harsh

1223
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:45,079
they're not lovely Tarpin to inhale into

1224
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,159
your lungs and that year was a year that

1225
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:49,318
tons of people had fresh Frozen bubble

1226
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:51,399
and live rosin and everyone was bragging

1227
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:53,960
about their fresh frozen and you take a

1228
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,720
hit and it was just like razor blades in

1229
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,480
your throat it would just stop you dead

1230
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:59,919
and you cough cough cough cough cough

1231
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,838
well this sweet skunk Ro resin that I

1232
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,000
had I remember smoking it with Tony from

1233
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:07,920
sagam Mara seeds and we were at uh I

1234
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,679
think we were in Hank's apartment above

1235
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,599
the uh bulldog in the Liza

1236
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,719
plane and so he had been smoking and it

1237
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,240
was kind of the end of the night and

1238
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,318
there was a ton of people in the room I

1239
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,039
remember rare dankness and DNA and Remo

1240
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:23,838
and tons of good folks were in the room

1241
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:25,519
we were all puffing and Tony's just like

1242
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:26,719
he came up to me he's like man bubble

1243
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:28,960
man you got to have something for me to

1244
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,519
smoke like I can't smoke this this stuff

1245
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,159
anymore it's killing my throat and it

1246
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:34,280
was why we all left with you know one of

1247
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:36,480
the reasons we all left with the

1248
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,000
Cannabis cough like with those monot

1249
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,719
turps for sure and he hit some of this

1250
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,719
sweet skunk and I'll never forget him

1251
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,959
sitting back on the chair and blowing

1252
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,639
this huge Cloud out and just looking

1253
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,838
over at me and being

1254
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:52,400
like now that is what I'm talking about

1255
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:55,239
a properly cured hash that doesn't cut

1256
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,480
your throat and shred your throat and it

1257
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:59,719
was just it stood out as an anomaly at

1258
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,719
the cup that year because literally you

1259
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:03,118
know maybe the only person that the only

1260
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:04,439
other person that had something like

1261
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,760
that would have been Sam where he

1262
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,480
actually had cured the flour dried it

1263
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:12,799
out dry sifting is not a misnomer like

1264
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:15,920
making those heads look like look like

1265
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:18,159
um raisins is definitely part of the

1266
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,039
trick you know getting them off of the

1267
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,679
plant when the wax membrane is still

1268
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:23,679
like full of moisture and it's still

1269
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,318
whole and doesn't have those Ripples and

1270
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,558
wrinkles in it uh is also you know

1271
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:30,279
you're end up having to uh reduce the

1272
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,160
moisture content of your hash down the

1273
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,599
road I'm sure Cuban must have to be

1274
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,279
doing that because he's extracting those

1275
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,280
heads when they're when they're barely

1276
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,440
dry you can tell by photographing his

1277
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,559
resin they're all full and have very

1278
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,679
little wrinkled in them whatsoever if

1279
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,280
you look at the heads that I

1280
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,239
photographed from Sam they've all been

1281
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,839
properly cured out for I mean I don't

1282
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,439
know how long you did it Sam but it

1283
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,880
seemed like the material must have sat

1284
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,880
for months before I cured him for three

1285
00:51:53,880 --> 00:52:00,599
months the plant material after I Dr it

1286
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:04,358
for two weeks in the dark hanging then I

1287
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:07,838
boxed it for three months and cured it

1288
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:10,119
and then I sifted it and uh I always

1289
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:13,279
sifted it when the humidity was super

1290
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:16,000
low because if you tried for example if

1291
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:20,760
you tried using one of Mila's machines

1292
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,239
in a hot humid place the uh the resin it

1293
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,559
just gunks up it gunks up the screen it

1294
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:29,639
gunks it's horrible your yields are

1295
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:33,240
ridiculously no you weren't a Tumblr guy

1296
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:35,798
though no but I used it just you know

1297
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:40,279
because uh it was available and it was

1298
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:42,519
easy you're right I used big flat uh

1299
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:46,599
they were aluminum stretched silk

1300
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:48,880
screens with po clock and they were

1301
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:52,400
really quite big I mean most of the ones

1302
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,280
I used were like 6x4 ft or something

1303
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,880
like that yeah I think you even had like

1304
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,680
I I think it was like 8T by 5 foot I

1305
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,318
measured one time and I'll never forget

1306
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,480
how much we made how fast we made it

1307
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,480
when you me and our other friend were

1308
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,760
there and I was just like he's just like

1309
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,318
go grab one of those go grab one of

1310
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,040
those barrels and he's just got like a

1311
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:14,239
wall of these barrels and I'm like

1312
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:15,679
what's in the barrel and he's like oh

1313
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:19,479
that's we're going to sift it it's just

1314
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:22,440
like full of like like material to sift

1315
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,519
and we just dumped it out on this it was

1316
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,960
actually the leftover from being deeded

1317
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:30,960
right but what an amazing experience to

1318
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,318
dump half a 55 gallon barrel drum over a

1319
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,838
screen rake it with two of my my best

1320
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:39,920
hash buddies and then lift the screen up

1321
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:44,759
and I think we made 4,000 grams of sift

1322
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,760
and it was like I want to say like four

1323
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:48,400
minutes I think it took more like 10

1324
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:50,879
minutes but

1325
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,880
whatever whatever 10 minutes to make

1326
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,760
4,000 G is ridiculous dude and the

1327
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,559
picture of after you cleaned it and you

1328
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,400
were like here this is all the garbage

1329
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,160
but it still looked like sift and I

1330
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,160
threw it in your toilet and took a

1331
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,558
picture of it in your toilet man people

1332
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,920
could not wrap their heads around that

1333
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,240
[ __ ] at all people were having a hard

1334
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,280
time with that picture for years

1335
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:17,598
afterwards they were just like

1336
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,640
what tossing kilos of sift down that's

1337
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:24,119
the difference when you have enough to

1338
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:27,199
do things right then you know I would

1339
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:31,119
have preferred to not even use DC

1340
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:34,199
but I had a lot of that available

1341
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,960
so right that's true indeed good the

1342
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:38,039
good old days I always like a

1343
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,280
three-month cure it's just right now

1344
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:43,798
High North uh Frenchie canoli and laan

1345
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,079
are doing these really awesome testing

1346
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:49,719
with curing hash and what happens with

1347
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:52,000
the cannaboids and the tpin and it's

1348
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:54,199
just really cool to be watching that so

1349
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,798
he's got really old old hash and then as

1350
00:54:54,199 --> 00:55:00,199
it's aging they're testing it and it's

1351
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:02,559
just super awesome to follow landh that

1352
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:05,960
theyed wasn't

1353
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,839
thaten here you just inspired me Kelly

1354
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,400
you just inspired me this little dab

1355
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:14,239
right here yeah is 12 years old I just

1356
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,760
took a little chunk off my deck I'll

1357
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,719
I'll have a little dab of the 12year

1358
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,920
Master Kush that tastes like uh the most

1359
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:25,399
perfumed out tpin you could ever imagine

1360
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,519
the tpin have changed completely but

1361
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,519
they're still present in this hash after

1362
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,079
this long how was the material was the

1363
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,519
material kept

1364
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:37,318
Frozen nope the material hardened on the

1365
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:40,318
outside and sealed the inside it's as

1366
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:42,599
hard as a rock it's like I understand

1367
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:46,358
yeah because Marcus what was the stuff

1368
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:49,640
that we used in in Canada what was that

1369
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:52,880
sorry I kept stuff for about 15 years

1370
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:55,199
Frozen and uh it's it seemed like it was

1371
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,760
only a month older I mean it really

1372
00:55:55,199 --> 00:56:02,279
hardly changed I remember that stuff I

1373
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,839
believe it was from your 91 Harvest am I

1374
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,559
correct you've got a better memory than

1375
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:09,519
me I just remember because our our our

1376
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:11,119
friend the fat man also used to have a

1377
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:14,119
little bit and he would always come to

1378
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,760
my hotel at the kulski and be like I

1379
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:18,318
brought you a little bit of the of the

1380
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,240
50 and it's like uh it's 16 years old

1381
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:24,358
now or it's 14 he got it actually he got

1382
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,759
it up to like I think 19 or 20 years old

1383
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:29,719
he still had a little bit but his

1384
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,119
was completely red and it was void of

1385
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,798
all flavor and Tarpin by the time it was

1386
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:36,838
20 years old it was because it was also

1387
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:39,759
in powder uh and it just uh it was very

1388
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:42,558
unique in the sense that when I hit it

1389
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,000
it was the most creeper weed product

1390
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,839
I've ever hid in my life and I don't

1391
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,880
know if that was because it was vo I

1392
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:51,558
don't think he kept that stuff Frozen I

1393
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,480
don't think so either yeah exactly if

1394
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:57,680
you keep it frozen and away from oxygen

1395
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,318
and light and heat it really really

1396
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:02,159
barely

1397
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:04,519
changes marate you all for doing that

1398
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:08,719
for science because I smoke it all I

1399
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:12,199
would never save a h for 10 years I mean

1400
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:15,519
not what we had when you're making a

1401
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:18,879
kilo or 10 kilos of hash a day you can't

1402
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:22,119
smoke it really believe me true then

1403
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:25,358
true true hey Marcus what was the stuff

1404
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:27,440
that you and I had uh a couple years ago

1405
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,759
uh when I came to visit you and

1406
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,960
Vancouver um do you remember the variety

1407
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:37,720
that was with Daniel and I just remember

1408
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:39,798
it being super Dynamic and I was so lit

1409
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:42,239
all day from that was it where as my

1410
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:44,599
bike I don't remember it was like over

1411
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:46,439
10 years old that you it was just you

1412
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,680
just you're like look we got to try this

1413
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,240
this is like I've had this for over a

1414
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:54,838
decade gez it was probably the master

1415
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:57,919
cush it was probably this master

1416
00:57:54,838 --> 00:58:00,038
cush it was it was yeah it was just

1417
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,079
really Dynamic it was very different

1418
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:05,480
from what i' at the time had been you

1419
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:07,720
know you know used to the motps and the

1420
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,079
sesat turps that you know are so in your

1421
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:12,279
face and then you have this totally

1422
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:15,000
different experience off this material

1423
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,480
that's been aged and um it's just super

1424
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,559
different in terms of of you know the

1425
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,880
the feeling and the overall effect

1426
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,119
profile but it was amazing it was just

1427
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,640
well I'm excited to be going in for a

1428
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,400
dab of it right now so how about that

1429
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:29,558
you can I'm looking at I'm looking at

1430
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,318
Frenchie's data that he posted look at

1431
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:34,160
this [ __ ] still

1432
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:37,920
boiling week or so ago I

1433
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:40,000
think 12 years 13 years Sam and I had

1434
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:44,318
commented on this I think I'm looking at

1435
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:48,039
an Angel Vasquez comment here but if you

1436
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:51,440
look at it um he's just seeing decarbox

1437
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:55,599
silation on storage which

1438
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:58,280
is be expected really and and I guess

1439
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,599
the only interesting aspect of this is

1440
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,119
if you look at the age stuff all of a

1441
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:04,599
sudden there's

1442
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:07,599
thcv and in all the other previous

1443
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:10,559
examples there weren't any thcv so what

1444
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:13,039
that tells me is that the age sample has

1445
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,319
lost considerable amounts of tpes which

1446
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:18,559
basically now moves the amount of thcv

1447
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:21,159
which was always there to begin with but

1448
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:23,760
was diluted by the fact that the earlier

1449
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:27,920
samples had tpes in there just deluding

1450
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,640
the thcv now that the age hash sample

1451
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,480
has lost its tur beans you could

1452
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:34,798
actually get a more better

1453
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,920
representation of the of the canono

1454
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:39,318
profile it's interesting though like

1455
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:43,639
from one to one one data point to the

1456
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:45,159
other he shows uh thca going down which

1457
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:49,400
is what you would expect right because

1458
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:51,199
thca DEC carboxilate to make THC a THC

1459
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:54,358
number goes up a little bit accordingly

1460
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:58,519
and you see a little bit of rise in CBN

1461
00:59:54,358 --> 01:00:01,000
but actually very strangely cbda goes up

1462
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:03,519
what the [ __ ] man how do you make more

1463
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,440
cannaboid acids on standing you don't do

1464
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:07,798
that so what that tells you again is

1465
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,679
somewhat of the sensitivity of the hlc

1466
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:14,159
measurement itself I mean you're getting

1467
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:16,199
into the weeds where making small

1468
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,519
differences of these numbers are really

1469
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:23,879
going to have a big impact and whether

1470
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:25,519
it's 67% or 68% or you know 65% it's

1471
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,680
going to really make a big difference

1472
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:30,159
because

1473
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:32,598
as you start to lose your tpine content

1474
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,519
in age Tash material what you're going

1475
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:36,240
to be left with is the nonvolatile

1476
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:38,798
components of your extract which are

1477
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,838
going to be the canabo canabo don't

1478
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,920
volatilize they will DEC carboxilate

1479
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:46,599
with time and you'd expect to see that I

1480
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:50,358
recently ran a test of a piece of uh

1481
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:55,400
Panama Red that was 10 years old and had

1482
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:58,519
no thca in it whatsoever it was just it

1483
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:02,119
was all TC so everything that was left

1484
01:00:58,519 --> 01:01:03,960
on the plant material had completely DEC

1485
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:05,559
carboxilate so it's not out of the

1486
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,720
ordinary to

1487
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:09,798
seeting from room

1488
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:11,358
temperature yeah it happens at room

1489
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:14,559
temperature it's just really slow at

1490
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:17,679
room temperature and and the reaction is

1491
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:21,160
is first order and linearly increases

1492
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:23,239
with an increase in temperature so a as

1493
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:25,679
you increase temperature the reaction

1494
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:28,199
rate goes faster and faster and faster

1495
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:30,118
and faster so yeah it happens at room

1496
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:33,078
temperature it's just really slow and

1497
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:35,280
you know 10 years I I expected to see a

1498
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:38,680
little bit of Trace cannaboid acids but

1499
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,880
no a flower sample 10 years old kept

1500
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:42,679
aerobically that's really important and

1501
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,920
this is kind of like what what Sam and

1502
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:48,838
Colin were pointing to earlier and there

1503
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:50,639
was a comment in the in the um chat room

1504
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:54,078
about this too which is the difference

1505
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,159
between cured and uncured you know it's

1506
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,278
really there's there's there's two

1507
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,879
aspects about post

1508
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:02,599
harvesting uh or production in cannabis

1509
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,880
and one is drying right because there's

1510
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:07,119
a lot of water in material right so

1511
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,079
plant material has to be dried but then

1512
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:11,079
there's curing and they happen

1513
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:13,760
independent from one another they're not

1514
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:16,599
necessarily related although curing

1515
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,079
happens during the drying process drying

1516
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:21,480
happens pretty quickly getting down to

1517
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,519
the point where you're drying the flower

1518
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,318
material below the point at which it

1519
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:29,719
could support mold growth typically that

1520
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,440
number used to be 14% I've seen the hemp

1521
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:33,480
industry here in the US want to move

1522
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,440
that number down to

1523
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:38,318
11% typically when we take biomass in a

1524
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,200
building we like to see anywhere between

1525
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:44,038
10% or lower in in just water activity

1526
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:47,078
in the biomass that'll tell you that it

1527
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:50,160
won't it won't foul but where that is

1528
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:52,720
also really really important too is that

1529
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,118
if you're measuring cannaboid content

1530
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:57,719
and you're measuring it on Fresh biomass

1531
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,440
that's got water in it versus dried

1532
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:01,558
biomass which has got no water in it

1533
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,559
you're going to get a completely

1534
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:07,160
different result right so you have to be

1535
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:10,000
able to take your fresh cannabis weigh

1536
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:11,879
it characterize it dry it right pull all

1537
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,679
that water out because that water

1538
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,640
creates weight and all of that weight is

1539
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:18,480
going to throw your canabo measurement

1540
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,358
off it's going to make it seem like it's

1541
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:24,679
a lot lower than it is when actually the

1542
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:26,679
canabo and the dried biomass are are are

1543
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:28,440
greater than they are in the wet biomass

1544
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:31,318
because water there's quite a bit of

1545
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,159
water in freshly grown biomass but just

1546
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:35,838
to mention one thing about the Cure is

1547
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:37,920
that it's important and I guess this

1548
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:40,119
speaks to something that Sam has always

1549
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,680
talked about you know that that

1550
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:46,760
harshness of fresh canabus and what we

1551
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:49,318
know from doing um turine profiling is

1552
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:53,000
that there's an abundance of a

1553
01:03:49,318 --> 01:03:54,838
particular single turpine called Marine

1554
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,960
you could think of marine is kind of

1555
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:00,078
like the mother of all tpin merine can

1556
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,679
go in five different ways to five

1557
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,039
different tpin which can go to five

1558
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:06,879
different tpin and so on and so on so

1559
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,640
what happens in the curing process is

1560
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,318
actually that merine doesn't only

1561
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:14,759
evaporate it also is oxidized and

1562
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:17,358
converted over into oxygenated T

1563
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,400
oxygenated tpin or Turpin noids right so

1564
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:23,598
once tpin react with oxygen so

1565
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:26,559
oxygenated tpin an example is linol like

1566
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:30,599
lolu has an oxygen and there's other

1567
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:32,960
tpes like camper that have oxygen uh so

1568
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:35,318
as soon as they have an oxygen molecule

1569
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,159
now it's going to completely change the

1570
01:04:35,318 --> 01:04:41,358
flavor profile because the flavor of

1571
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:45,118
those oxygenated terpenoids changes the

1572
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:47,078
overall essence of the Native turpine

1573
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,960
profile when the plant is freshly

1574
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:54,519
harvested so I believe that that that

1575
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:56,599
curing process is not only evaporating

1576
01:04:54,519 --> 01:05:00,199
which again maybe Cuts back a little bit

1577
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:03,798
on the harshness of just too much tpin

1578
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:06,598
but it also changes the tpin chemically

1579
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:10,079
into a kind of like an

1580
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:13,079
aged uh uh wine profile or an aged

1581
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:15,200
cheese profile you know cheese and wine

1582
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:17,119
in particular are things that are aged

1583
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:19,439
and when they're aged they're

1584
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,720
aerobically reacting with air and kind

1585
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,358
of changing up things a little bit to

1586
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:27,318
make them a little bit different in how

1587
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:29,960
they taste and what their flavor is okay

1588
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:31,639
now we're getting so mark that you know

1589
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,519
I've noticed over the years with dry

1590
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:37,400
Sith versus fresh Frozen versus you know

1591
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:39,440
dry material processing the experience

1592
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,119
and the tpine profiles are vastly

1593
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,519
different and The Taste profiles are

1594
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,880
vastly different even though they

1595
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:48,239
represent one another in some form

1596
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,760
factor or another um the tpine and the

1597
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:55,199
turpenoid are very different in terms of

1598
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,640
taste um on the on the on one's palette

1599
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:03,719
so do do you have any explanation for

1600
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:07,159
why uh this age process you know is is

1601
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:10,358
similar Prof but very different feelings

1602
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:14,420
the oxygenated turpins are uh you know

1603
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:17,119
uh God uh carvone is is one

1604
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:20,159
[Music]

1605
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,318
Carone one an isomer of carvone so you

1606
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:23,598
know when I say isomer or an antimers

1607
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:24,719
they're kind of like your hands and so

1608
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,559
there's a right-handed version and

1609
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:29,919
there's a left-handed version right left

1610
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:33,240
right left Y and one of them smells one

1611
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,680
of the versions of carvone smells like

1612
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,798
Ry bread like caraway seed so you know

1613
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:40,598
if you get freshly cut rye bread and

1614
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:42,519
it's got the caraway seed that Caraway

1615
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:45,000
the other one which is just the mirror

1616
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:48,679
image of this molecule is completely

1617
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,159
spearmint peppermint so you know how the

1618
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:55,960
human pallet has developed um the

1619
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:58,558
ability to assain the differences in

1620
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,440
these molecular structures to give

1621
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,559
different you know elicit different

1622
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,400
reactions it's just it's amazing it's

1623
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:08,039
how sophisticated the human pallet is

1624
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,639
and and why we can taste different

1625
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:13,000
elements of cannabis and so like we were

1626
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:16,278
talking last week about what the most

1627
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,440
valuable tpine and I'm on I'm on team

1628
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:20,599
terpinolene well you know

1629
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,039
terpinene again actually there's a

1630
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:26,039
couple different versions of terpinolene

1631
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:29,880
and and cannabis again creates this

1632
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:31,760
opportunity to really exploit all these

1633
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,119
compounds in different ways that they

1634
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,520
manifest their different flavors and

1635
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:39,519
scents and I've said it before I'll say

1636
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:42,880
it again it was tpes that Drew humans to

1637
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:45,639
Canvas it was cannaboids that made them

1638
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:49,640
stay I I just wanted to say Mark that

1639
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:54,679
when we did analysis stability

1640
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:57,558
testing uh gz this was 25 years ago uh

1641
01:07:54,679 --> 01:08:00,798
what we found was that even after two

1642
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:05,240
years of storage most of the THC was in

1643
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:08,358
the acid form most of the tpin were gone

1644
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:10,278
and that there was little to know uh

1645
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:12,880
CBN

1646
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:15,559
yeah yeah I don't

1647
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,960
know this nugget of Panama Red I think

1648
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:20,079
was just in a in a in a baggie and a in

1649
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:23,798
a dresser drawer for like 10 years so I

1650
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:25,960
think there's no special care to its uh

1651
01:08:23,798 --> 01:08:28,880
storage or anything like that but you

1652
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,679
know it's not at all you know uh

1653
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,560
unbelievable to think that again

1654
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:35,399
prolonged storage you know in the right

1655
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,319
environment that that stuff is going to

1656
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:39,399
decarbox that's why when I looked at

1657
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:42,679
Frenchie data I'm like oh yeah yeah this

1658
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:45,399
looks I I would expect to see exactly

1659
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:48,880
exactly this and you know again it would

1660
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:52,278
be interesting to look at um I guess the

1661
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:54,520
tpine profile on Aging because what I

1662
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:56,239
would expect and again this is the stuff

1663
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,799
that we've already talked about about

1664
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:02,399
episodes prior on hash church is that we

1665
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:04,798
would see hash hashen am I not saying it

1666
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,479
right we would see the formation of

1667
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:10,278
hashen on the outside because it's a

1668
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:13,798
light catalyzed reaction so where light

1669
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:15,920
is able to sort of react with the tpes

1670
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:17,519
that are on the surface of the hash I

1671
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,000
think what that paper talked about was

1672
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:23,000
sort of scraping off the surface and

1673
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,679
they found sort of like this oxidative

1674
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,520
degradation coat that were this aen

1675
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:32,158
degradation T would be but I I would

1676
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:35,239
expect that if you follow the tpine

1677
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:37,479
profile in the curing of the flow that

1678
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:39,759
you would see exactly what what what

1679
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:42,198
Frenchie sees in his data too which is

1680
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,439
that not only do the tpin change but

1681
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:46,439
they probably they're they're they're

1682
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:48,479
fugitive meaning that they evaporate and

1683
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:52,039
once they evaporate they they go

1684
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:55,209
away in India you don't find hasene you

1685
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:56,600
find charine

1686
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:59,640
[Laughter]

1687
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,440
so Mark you know I over time I I have

1688
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,280
some tpine samples that I've kept for

1689
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:06,639
around four years now um in freezing you

1690
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:10,000
know you know minus in freezing

1691
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,640
conditions and I'm seeing um it being

1692
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,399
coming less viscous and more jellylike

1693
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,440
over time and I'm waiting another six

1694
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:20,039
months to get that the samples tested

1695
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:22,678
because I have a timeline on the te on

1696
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:24,960
the shelf life study but I'm curious to

1697
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:27,840
see how this consistency is going to

1698
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,920
match up with the profile's you know

1699
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,719
ability to to show the the spectrum of

1700
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,199
all the tpin that were once present when

1701
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,920
we first put them in versus when we took

1702
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:40,198
them out versus what they've actually

1703
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:42,960
turned into and some have oxidized and

1704
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:46,158
some have not so you're seeing color in

1705
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,439
some but in others you're not so there's

1706
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:50,198
you know that alone what you're touching

1707
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:53,158
on is is really interesting to me

1708
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:54,759
because it's it shows in and you know

1709
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:56,679
just illustrates what we're actually

1710
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,880
seeing real time in terms of a shelf

1711
01:10:56,679 --> 01:10:58,880
life

1712
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:07,000
study yeah well and and canabo act as

1713
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,960
antioxidants so cannabinoids actually

1714
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,399
stabilize the Turpin from oxidizing and

1715
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,158
in certain ways shapes or form it's

1716
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:16,079
really interesting because with a lot of

1717
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:18,679
the hemp processing that's going on

1718
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:22,158
these days you know I think the first

1719
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:25,079
goal of of of hemp was to sort of get

1720
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:26,319
get CBD out the door and I think now

1721
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,760
they're paying a little bit more

1722
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:32,639
attention to the minor cannabinoids and

1723
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:35,159
now finally the tpin you know so again I

1724
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,800
think what's really fascinating here is

1725
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:40,079
I think that like most of these people

1726
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:43,440
who are growing these beautiful

1727
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:45,479
varieties of hemp and then just

1728
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,638
basically treating it as just a raw

1729
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:49,559
ingredient to make CBD isol it are

1730
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:51,679
really missing most of the value that's

1731
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,679
what's in the hemp plant which is all

1732
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:56,840
the minor canono the minor tur beans and

1733
01:11:54,679 --> 01:12:00,119
everything and even if you're trying to

1734
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:03,039
make a business model today of opening

1735
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:04,439
up a facility to turn hemp into CBD

1736
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,920
isolate you're probably going to be

1737
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:09,519
pressed to not uh well you're probably

1738
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,279
going to be pressed to look at other

1739
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,560
adjacent opportunities because you're

1740
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,359
not going to be able to make a whole lot

1741
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:18,840
of money just selling CBD isolate these

1742
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:21,679
days Sam you've tested some probably

1743
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:24,560
some of the oldest uh hashish or

1744
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:28,760
cannabis in the world what are some of

1745
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:31,080
the things that have been found in those

1746
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,199
resins that are still left over what

1747
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:33,198
what

1748
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:39,760
are still active

1749
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:43,440
inactive I I I never tested hash that

1750
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,840
was older than about 15 20 years number

1751
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:50,479
one and number two I kept it frozen away

1752
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:54,319
from oxygen away from light and uh it

1753
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:57,279
barely changed you preserved it I felt

1754
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:59,198
this I had Herb in my freezer for six

1755
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,439
years that I pressed into rosin and it

1756
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:04,238
was as loud as it would have been six

1757
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,519
years prior had I pressed it in before

1758
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:08,519
the only problem was rosin did ex didn't

1759
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,920
exist when it went into my

1760
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,679
freezer but it did exist when I took it

1761
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:16,800
out six years later well then

1762
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:19,239
Afghanistan they used to bury their the

1763
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,400
Keef right a certain amount of feet deep

1764
01:13:19,238 --> 01:13:25,319
to keep it cool back in the day before

1765
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:27,119
they actually pressed it correct Sam so

1766
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:30,719
you know is that where you learn just to

1767
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:34,880
keep it refrigerated and story along

1768
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:38,158
with the story of a an India naked uh

1769
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,600
people running through the uh the the

1770
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,399
plantation to SC scrape the hash off

1771
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:46,320
their

1772
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:51,399
bodies but uh I'm not sure how much hash

1773
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:56,559
was actually buried or the reason or or

1774
01:13:51,399 --> 01:14:00,359
yeah I'm not sure but uh yeah uh I'm not

1775
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:02,920
sure hash gets better after being buried

1776
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:06,759
a year depends the temperatures if it

1777
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:10,920
was really cold it'd be fine I I I just

1778
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:14,000
when I hear a story from from Farmers or

1779
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,840
traditional hashes people I I take it

1780
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,639
with a grain of salt

1781
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:22,440
because one of the like in India I

1782
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:25,920
talked to Farmers there and they said oh

1783
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:28,519
yeah the papaya is from India

1784
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,520
but it's

1785
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:35,039
not thank you for dismissing that

1786
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:37,319
misinformation we appreciate you I think

1787
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:39,439
that it's also interesting just to bring

1788
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:41,079
um you know the microbiology into this

1789
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,879
discussion is that when you keep it in

1790
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:47,519
the freezer and away from light you're

1791
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,359
really uh you not allowing colonization

1792
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,679
of

1793
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:53,880
microbiology on that hash so you know

1794
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,679
that's a big part of the breakdown as

1795
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,920
well oxidate

1796
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,279
oxidation um you know also makes

1797
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:05,679
microbiology come alive which is be

1798
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:08,439
really cool to see aging studies and

1799
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,719
microbiology and the DNA of what comes

1800
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:15,119
alive and what is you know consuming the

1801
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:16,399
tpin and the canabo just like totally

1802
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:18,399
mind blowing I'll let you say something

1803
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:21,079
in just one sec Mark but it would be

1804
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:25,279
interesting to do you know a

1805
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:27,238
resin uh um curing test with a

1806
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:29,000
hydroponic you know herb and then

1807
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:30,879
something with a fully living soil one I

1808
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,520
bet the living soil or the soil one

1809
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:38,840
would last longer and have longer

1810
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,840
probably tpin in it what do you

1811
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:46,439
think I think microbes are going to eat

1812
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,479
up cannaboids like it's you know young

1813
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:49,479
kids going to Dairy

1814
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:55,439
Queen you know it's it's readily

1815
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:58,320
available carbon and hydrogen

1816
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:01,158
energy for microbes and yeah it doesn't

1817
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:04,079
stand a chance everything you know M

1818
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:06,119
microbes have figured out how to eat

1819
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,238
everything except the Caron carbon

1820
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:10,198
Florine Bond right they haven't figured

1821
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:12,799
out how to metabolize that but they

1822
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:15,079
figured out everything else they could

1823
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,760
do what well what we used to call in the

1824
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:20,559
field mineralization right when you put

1825
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:24,520
samples out there and basically they're

1826
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:27,199
they're consumed immediately I was on a

1827
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:30,600
a project where we were looking at

1828
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:33,519
treatments for wood

1829
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:35,360
preservation right not Viagra not the

1830
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,480
little blue Pillow People we're talking

1831
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:40,359
about things that you know are chemicals

1832
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:43,158
that they inject in the wood so wood can

1833
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:46,439
last in an outdoor setting without being

1834
01:16:43,158 --> 01:16:50,039
eaten by termites or bugs so as it turns

1835
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:53,479
out the first infestation into

1836
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:56,880
wood is not by termites you know the

1837
01:16:53,479 --> 01:17:01,039
things that eat uh or Not by Fungus it's

1838
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:03,319
by bacteria bacteria get into the wood

1839
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:05,479
and they basically ring the dinnerbell

1840
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:06,880
for everybody else because the bacteria

1841
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:09,678
has to go in there and they have to

1842
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,840
start loosening up things in order for

1843
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:14,800
the termites and the fungi and all the

1844
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,400
other stuff to come in and start rotting

1845
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:20,480
the wood so it's just a microbial zoo of

1846
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:24,439
things that again has had the time

1847
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:25,399
course of evolution to figure out how to

1848
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:29,479
properly

1849
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:32,399
you know utilize all of the carbon

1850
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:36,399
that's in the biosphere and the reason

1851
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:40,039
why you don't see heaps of huge you know

1852
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:43,759
wood on the sides of the road is because

1853
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:46,719
it degrades fungus has figured out how

1854
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,920
to degrade dead wood and dead logs and

1855
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:52,880
so when they fall in the forest and no

1856
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:55,158
one hears it right silent but golden the

1857
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,279
you know fungi gets in there and before

1858
01:17:55,158 --> 01:18:00,000
you know it the termites start eating up

1859
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:02,519
it becomes a house for all kinds of

1860
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,359
microbes and rotten wood is really

1861
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:07,840
really important to reestablish the

1862
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:11,079
microbial Flora of the forest floor so

1863
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:15,000
it's really important to basically have

1864
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:18,119
this cycle that's been going for eons of

1865
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,119
evolution to

1866
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:26,359
continue I'd like know how we started on

1867
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:28,760
that sorry um i' just been learning my

1868
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:30,759
Discord in the background what I saw was

1869
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,480
I you know I I figured out this Discord

1870
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,719
thing a little bit through watching

1871
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,479
these Harry Mack freestyle raps that

1872
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,319
he's been doing on Omega which if you

1873
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,799
haven't watched you should absolutely

1874
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:42,880
watch this guy's got the like highest

1875
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,199
vibration possible he's absolutely

1876
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,239
crushing it but he turned me on to

1877
01:18:44,198 --> 01:18:47,799
Discord I haven't really been using it

1878
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,158
but someone in the chat was like I wish

1879
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,840
there was a Discord I said I have one I

1880
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:55,039
shared it and now there's a whole chat

1881
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:57,079
going on uh over here you can kind of

1882
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:58,960
hear it in the background going b b I'll

1883
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:00,840
have to turn that off soon but uh you

1884
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,600
can share videos you can share pictures

1885
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,159
the chat room will be up forever now

1886
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:09,320
because it's a Discord channel so it'll

1887
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:11,000
be a 247 hurch Channel um the address is

1888
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:14,079
kind of strange I'm going to put it in

1889
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,079
the link to this video when we're done

1890
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:17,760
uh but I did share it as well and it's

1891
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:20,039
can you put it in the chat so I can join

1892
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:24,400
I have Discord yeah I'll put it in the

1893
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:25,960
chat no problem and uh it's uh it's very

1894
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:27,839
it's like

1895
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:30,359
discord.gg and then it's a bunch of

1896
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,920
silly s silly silly letters like five or

1897
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:33,679
six which I won't mention here but I've

1898
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,880
got it in the chat room I've got it in

1899
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,920
the private Zoom chat and I'll put it in

1900
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,920
the comment section of this video when

1901
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,239
we're done and I would I would suggest

1902
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:46,199
join us on Discord the chat room will

1903
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:48,279
stay up forever I'll keep the link uh

1904
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:51,439
going as long as I can and then it'll

1905
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:53,000
really kind of create these other six

1906
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:54,319
days of hash church that aren't

1907
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,560
happening where we could kind of maybe

1908
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:58,920
build through the chat room find out

1909
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:01,000
questions that people have create a

1910
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,119
topic base for us to talk about on

1911
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,560
Sunday and maybe even find some great

1912
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:08,238
new people to invite on um as panelists

1913
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,560
so I just wanted to kind of chime in on

1914
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:11,039
that didn't want to change the subject

1915
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,639
too much because I really appreciate

1916
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:16,279
what you guys are talking about but uh

1917
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:18,480
Discord it's pretty just gonna say Mark

1918
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:20,399
um I have Discord but set up a couple

1919
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:22,198
different different chat rooms inside

1920
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:24,839
Discord I have a general set up some

1921
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:26,559
rules set up stuff on like dry syst set

1922
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,840
up stuff on hash just like you have on

1923
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:31,600
your Facebook group um so it's really

1924
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,000
fun I have a Johnny B girl room on

1925
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,079
Discord I've had it for like over a year

1926
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,520
but uh it's definitely awesome so create

1927
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:39,439

thing in the first uh place and I yeah I

1953

think Discord is kind of like a place

1954
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:40,760
isn't it kind of like a MailChimp where

1955
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:42,759
you can kind of have all your social

1956
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:45,600
medias running through Discord and have

1957
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,000
your chats and I haven't really played

1958
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,039
around with it too much but it seems

1959
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,359
pretty good and so many different Topics

1960

1979
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:33,119
in there it's kind of like that first

1980
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:36,320
one you showed us with

1981
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:38,119
um Clubhouse yeah I got I got 58 people

1982
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:40,479
online in the chat room right now which

1983
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:42,559
is obviously not as much as we have in

1984
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:44,638
the YouTube we have and I want to say

1985
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,920
this you know the consistency that we

1986
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:51,239
offered in the last four weeks has

1987
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,480
raised our live viewers by about 20% we

1988
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:56,399
were in and around the 400 range today

1989
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:58,439
we were at 500 67 people when we topped

1990
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:01,920
out for live people right now there's

1991
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:03,759
actually 523 so we bumped up about a

1992
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,359
hundred people and it might not sound

1993
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,679
like that much but when you when it's

1994
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:11,559
only 500 people that's literally 20% uh

1995
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:13,359
increase so I like the consistency even

1996
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,320
if we don't have a conversation to talk

1997
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:17,079
about I love the idea of gathering on

1998
01:23:15,319 --> 01:23:19,479
Sundays shooting the [ __ ] sometimes it's

1999
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:21,238
going to be stories about concerts and

2000
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:24,079
the old days and other times it's going

2001
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:26,158
to be in-depth breakdowns on science and

2002
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:28,679
uh you know some days it'll be both but

2003

2023
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:21,239
of a sausage party sometimes maybe often

2024

01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,960
about you know rolling out your hash and

2039
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:05,039
I asked you can you share any data on

2040
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:07,399
this are are you are you able to tell us

01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,800
about how great this material is that

2042
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:11,279
you guys are rolling out throughout

2043
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,920
Canada well okay what I can tell you is

2044
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:15,238
a few things I got to be careful and

2045
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,960
anyone that hasn't muted their Discord

2046
01:25:15,238 --> 01:25:20,319
and is still listening have their mic

2047
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:24,800
open up here and I'm looking at you

2048
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:27,799
Johnny B um mute that [ __ ]

2049
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,480
okay so I can tell you a few things I

2050
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,639
and it's all you know it's all kind of

2051
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:33,238
funny like we can't mention the company

2052
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:35,199
that grew it because we don't have a

2053
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:38,158
deal with them to mention their company

2054
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:40,118
so we're not keeping them in the shadows

2055
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,000
for any reason other than out of respect

2056
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:44,279
for them because they may go to market

2057
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,319
and release their own thing down the

2058
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:47,920
road so we can't mention their their

2059
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:51,359
name but what I can mention is the

2060
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:55,440
cultivar it was an Afghan Kush it is an

2061
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:58,559
Afghan Kush we are uh using flower

2062
01:25:55,439 --> 01:26:00,000
and because of the system in Canada you

2063
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,600
know when I first made my first batch

2064
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,479
and I got my seven to eight varieties

2065
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:07,320
you know 220 down to

2066
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:09,879
25 you know I understood suddenly that

2067
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:11,399
in order to get that to Market if you

2068
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:13,400
want to keep all of those microns

2069
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:16,439
separately you will now need to do a

2070
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:20,638
$1,500 full test on like yeasts and

2071
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:23,559
molds counts pesticides herbicides tpen

2072
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:27,118
canabo uh the full test and you'll have

2073
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:30,760
to do it time eight so you increase

2074
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:33,198
$1,500 a test in Canada correct Canadian

2075
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:35,239
yeah so about like ,100 bucks us or

2076
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:39,960
whatever for a for a full this isn't

2077
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:43,678
just canabo or tpin whatever not paying

2078
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:46,158
4,000 us a pound so I no I mean I'm just

2079
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,639
saying like for for you it's like

2080
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:53,519
because I pay 650 and it's like to me

2081
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:55,560
that's tough right us I pay 685 685 for

2082
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,320
full panel exactly everything you just

2083
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:59,239
describe I was thumb Dow because it's

2084
01:26:57,319 --> 01:27:01,639
just too much in my mind in terms of

2085
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:03,799
cost well imagine I also but to your

2086
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:07,520
point Marcus what are we gonna do we

2087
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:09,000
have to do it right well you know and so

2088
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,520
you also have to make sure here's

2089
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,118
another thing if you're going to sell to

2090
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,040
retail here the provinces are the ones

2091
01:27:13,118 --> 01:27:17,399
that order so you're selling to like an

2092
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:19,319
entire State that's who's ordering for

2093
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:21,960
every store in the state so when you get

2094
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:24,198
a province and we've already gotten two

2095
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,800
it's a big [ __ ] deal it's a province

2096
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:28,079
there's millions of people that live in

2097
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,560
it and you just got a PO from a province

2098
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:32,639
so here's the here's the kicker you want

2099
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:36,039
to release your 90 Micron hash and you

2100
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:38,400
want to pay your 685 times eight bags to

2101
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:40,439
figure out what each Micron is and keep

2102
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,439
them all separate well the province

2103
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:45,279
might order 20 kilos of that from you

2104
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:47,158
maybe even 30 and if they sell it really

2105
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:49,719
quick because it's such a spectacular

2106
01:27:47,158 --> 01:27:51,799
material you had better have another 20

2107
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:54,800
30 kilos ready for them when they want

2108
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,679
to order it and if you don't you drop to

2109
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,840
the bottom of the key it's not a good

2110
01:27:56,679 --> 01:28:01,600
look if you can't Supply what you've

2111
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,480
already supplied now if you have five of

2112
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,800
these provinces and they're all ordering

2113
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:08,479
20 or 30 kilos at a time and selling

2114
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:10,679
through it in a couple of months how the

2115
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:13,799
[ __ ] are you going to produce that much

2116
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,639
90 Micron hash so it becomes a little

2117
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,880
bit of a trick what most people do with

2118
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:20,520
smaller batches here in Canada is they

2119
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,679
sell them into the medical market and

2120
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:24,960
you end up having the ability to kind of

2121
01:28:22,679 --> 01:28:27,960
give a good deal sell direct to

2122
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,920
customers but it's quite different from

2123
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:33,639
um from the recreational so what I

2124
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:35,520
managed to do was and it was it was

2125
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:38,039
fairly easy because the material I'm

2126
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:40,560
running is quite nice and almost all of

2127
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:42,800
it is this beautiful consistent golden

2128
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,560
color it's only really the 220 that we

2129
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:49,800
have to keep out and that even tested at

2130
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:52,159
almost 50% THC the the 220 so we're

2131
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:56,560
getting the rest of it testing in

2132
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:58,599
between the oh 55 to 70 plus percent and

2133
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,600
so what I was able to do was make two

2134
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:05,039
grades I took sort of what I felt like

2135
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:06,960
were the best microns 12 73 90 45 those

2136
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:10,719
all went into one grade and then I made

2137
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:14,520
a b-grade which was like uh 190 160 25

2138
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:17,319
which was still over 60% uh THC with a

2139
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:19,080
decent tarpine content um when I hit it

2140
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:20,359
with a hair straightener I hit a tiny

2141
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:22,158
little bit of the powder and it's

2142
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:23,920
beautiful you know for me when I hear

2143
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,079
the smokers in the room who are pulling

2144
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:28,239
the bags and I'm at the back of the lab

2145
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:30,960
and I hear them pull the 90 Micron bag

2146
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,959
and I hear them

2147
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:37,238
go I know that that's good hash but

2148
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:40,158
there's no mechanisms for me to smoke it

2149
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:42,238
to test it to try it but what I did do

2150
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:44,158
is I took a little bit of powder and I

2151
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:46,198
gently hit it with a tiny little bit of

2152
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:49,118
heat and what that did was it created

2153
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:50,638
this beautiful stained glass window and

2154
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:52,000
we have shipped out our first batch of

2155
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,118
this so I'm going to go buy some in the

2156
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,520
next couple of days probably tomorrow

2157
01:29:54,118 --> 01:29:56,839
and I'll smash it with the hair

2158
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,920
straightener and I'll be able to take

2159
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:01,400
some nice pictures of showing how clean

2160
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:03,319
and gold leafy it is I suspect it's

2161
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:06,399
going to melt and boil into a beautiful

2162
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:10,238
liquid but is it a six-star is it a five

2163
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:12,079
star is it a four star I hope we fall in

2164
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:14,118
the five plus but because I haven't been

2165
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:15,920
able to try it I'm certainly not going

2166
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:18,000
to put my name on the line and tell

2167
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,600
people that it's the full melt six-star

2168
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,800
hash like I've seen plenty of companies

2169
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:24,679
doing we've taken a more pragmatic

2170
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,800
perspective where we're going to release

2171
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:28,920
this hash without calling it full melt

2172
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,279
and if it tends to be full melt like I

2173
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:32,800
suspect it's going to be um then we'll

2174
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:35,000
share that with people and I'm looking

2175
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,000
forward to the reviews and to people I

2176
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,319
mean man I'm so excited that hash has

2177
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:43,520
finally gone out from my company it's

2178
01:30:39,319 --> 01:30:46,079
under the brand Hank Co um and it is uh

2179
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,639
sold throughout British Columbia the the

2180
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:50,559
province has it now so if you own a

2181
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:52,359
store and you want to give it a shot

2182
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:55,400
give them a call and it'll be sold under

2183
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:57,399
the Hank brand it'll be the AF and Kush

2184
01:30:55,399 --> 01:31:01,319
and that's uh that's about what I can

2185
01:30:57,399 --> 01:31:03,439
share for now Dr Mark that's super cool

2186
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:05,279
Marcus thanks smart you've been working

2187
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:07,439
on that project for a really long time

2188
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:10,399
and that's that's like you know I've

2189
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:13,399
watched you you know start that thing

2190
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:15,359
awesome yeah it's amazing man what does

2191
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:16,599
the hash analyze for like what what

2192
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,000
what's its

2193
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,239
potency about you know ballpark like

2194
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,079
what do you expect to see what's typical

2195
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:26,319
of the of the potency of the hash in

2196
01:31:23,079 --> 01:31:28,039
regards to the th C content yeah thca

2197
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:31,158
right wouldn't it be thca yeah yeah yeah

2198
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:35,238
sorry exactly thca um in and around like

2199
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:37,039
between like you know 60 to 70 this

2200
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:40,319
particular hash the b-grade is around

2201
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:43,079
the 60 the a grade is around the 70 so

2202
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:45,439
you got about a 10% bump on the a to the

2203
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:47,800
B it's all from the same cultivar I like

2204
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:50,198
the idea of giving people the idea they

2205
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,520
don't all know about Micron sizes but

2206
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:52,879
they're going to start learning with

2207
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,199
these two grades they're going to be

2208
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,039
like wow like the grade a is definitely

2209
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:00,079
different from the Grade B like I said I

2210
01:31:58,039 --> 01:32:03,118
haven't been able to try it because our

2211
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:05,319
system it has created this this system

2212
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:07,719
that does not allow for Pathways

2213
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:09,439
apparently in Canada you can apply for

2214
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:11,359
R&amp;D licenses where you can get

2215
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:13,319
permission to actually try the product

2216
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,960
this is very important this would be the

2217
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:16,639
equivalent of letting people open up

2218
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,679
restaurants but not allowing them to

2219
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:21,880
test the food before they put it on the

2220
01:32:18,679 --> 01:32:23,880
plate for people now I'm not completely

2221
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,679
blind and I suspect if Gordon Ramsey

2222
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,440
needed to bust out a fat meal and wasn't

2223
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:30,719
allowed to test it he could probably

2224
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:33,238
still do a pretty good job on that but

2225
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:35,880
obviously we want and need the ability

2226
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:37,959
to test uh and I should you know give a

2227
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:39,560
shout out to uh Mike West as well who's

2228
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,880
in the room who's been working with me

2229
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:44,840
since like tirelessly on this project

2230
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:48,118
since the beginning he's been he's gone

2231
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:51,119
above and beyond any human being's

2232
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:54,198
ability to put more of his time into

2233
01:32:51,118 --> 01:32:57,238
this project uh probably second only or

2234
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:59,079
or tied with Craig who's also one of my

2235
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:01,198
colleagues uh Adam bark and I just want

2236
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:02,479
to shout them both out because uh

2237
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:04,079
without the work they've done we

2238
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:05,919
wouldn't be where we are right now and a

2239
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:08,359
shout out to the whole team for that

2240
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,800
matter well if you guys are running at

2241
01:33:08,359 --> 01:33:12,960
the scale that those reactors are at I

2242
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,760
mean I'm sure everybody in the chat room

2243
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,920
all the hash makers who are listening

2244
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:21,119
right now they appreciate you know I

2245
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:23,920
mean when you go from like home scale or

2246
01:33:21,118 --> 01:33:26,279
you know like small production scale to

2247
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:29,279
that scale and you have that much

2248
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:31,840
material at stake you're talking you

2249
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:35,039
know hundreds of thousands of dollars in

2250
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:37,079
one batch I would assume you know and

2251
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,880
again it's great to have Alec on here

2252
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:42,519
because again like that thirdparty

2253
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:45,920
testing result and the relationship that

2254
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:48,080
you have with your third- party testing

2255
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,480
uh lab is really really important to be

2256
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:54,198
able to get compliant stuff out into the

2257
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:56,158
market that meets the label requir ments

2258
01:33:54,198 --> 01:33:58,559
and all the other regulatory

2259
01:33:56,158 --> 01:34:00,960
requirements of these new markets I

2260
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,119
concur with you man I I gotta I just

2261
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,600
want to say this out loud for the

2262
01:34:02,118 --> 01:34:06,719
viewers what Marcus is doing at scale

2263
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:10,239
everyone and from my perspective I I

2264
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:12,399
mean I I was a lot at scale as well but

2265
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:14,678
you know to put that many grams in

2266
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:18,638
perspective to continuously make at

2267
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:20,319
scale at a specific quality level is

2268
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:23,039
very very

2269
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:24,920
detailed um and that's not something you

2270
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:28,158
just do over and that's not something

2271
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:30,079
that you could take an at home setup and

2272
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:33,519
really scale overnight with that's

2273
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:35,760
that's years of Marcus honing in on on

2274
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,480
on all of this and and it goes beyond

2275
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,600
hash making in a lot of respect too so

2276
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:44,039
it's you know major respect Marcus on on

2277
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:47,760
all that that's you know it's an

2278
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:49,719
incredible you know it's incredible you

2279
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,239
know I I would be remiss if I didn't

2280
01:34:49,719 --> 01:34:55,639
shout out Whistler Technologies and uh

2281
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:58,118
the two Daves and Kelvin and Aaron and

2282
01:34:55,639 --> 01:35:02,199
obviously the owner Daniel and the

2283
01:34:58,118 --> 01:35:04,799
entire sales team uh brishna and Tyler

2284
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:06,439
and you know just the other Tyler and we

2285
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,679
got a great team over there they've done

2286
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:10,479
an incredible job I wasn't sure where I

2287
01:35:08,679 --> 01:35:12,600
was going to land in this commercial

2288
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:15,359
commercial industrialized aspect of

2289
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:17,159
water extraction but their heads they

2290
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:19,679
came from the right place they did all

2291
01:35:17,158 --> 01:35:22,079
their their R&amp;D at Whistler medical over

2292
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:23,880
the course of years and uh it's been

2293
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:25,559
really a blessing to link up with them

2294
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,039
to hook up with them go check them out

2295
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,440
on Instagram at Whistler Tech uh

2296
01:35:28,039 --> 01:35:31,439
Whistler technologies.com

2297
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:57,360
they're they grow veggies they grow all

2298
01:35:56,118 --> 01:35:59,079
sorts of different things and now

2299
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:01,000
they're getting into the hemp game they

2300
01:35:59,079 --> 01:36:04,399
didn't want to be the same same old

2301
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,118
ethanol extractors hydrocarbon CO2 they

2302
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:09,039
went a totally different route and

2303
01:36:06,118 --> 01:36:12,880
they've got this monster 4,000 liter

2304
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:14,920
reactors 2times 2 that was the first one

2305
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,679
we ever built at Whistler Technologies

2306
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:19,158
it's up on my Instagram if you want to

2307
01:36:16,679 --> 01:36:22,000
go check it out it's definitely

2308
01:36:19,158 --> 01:36:24,000
ridiculous and yeah huge shout out to

2309
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,279
the entire team at Whistler techn Oles

2310
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,439
for really um you know for doing a ton

2311
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:32,519
of this work I could never take credit

2312
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:35,279
for it uh uh on my own I am merely one

2313
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:37,239
small component of it and like I say

2314
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:39,639
from guys like skunkman Sam being able

2315
01:36:37,238 --> 01:36:41,519
to stand on the shoulders of giants to

2316
01:36:39,639 --> 01:36:44,199
all of you panelists to the people that

2317
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,560
are in the room we're all in this

2318
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:48,559
together you're the sherpa right the

2319
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:51,159
sherpa someone's got to lead the way and

2320
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:54,280
you know I mean you can't climb Mount

2321
01:36:51,158 --> 01:36:56,599
Everest without a sherpa and you know I

2322
01:36:54,279 --> 01:36:58,279
know they don't look very organized but

2323
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,560
they they're the people who get you

2324
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:02,000
there they're the heroes man those

2325
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,960
getting the industry to where they need

2326
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,079
to go and you probably didn't think

2327
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:08,639
about this when you were first making

2328
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:11,198
bubble but you know it's like how cool

2329
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,960
to see that not only and you know again

2330
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:15,559
we talked a little bit about this last

2331
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,359
time but I don't think your viewers or

2332
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,600
the viewers really really understand

2333
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:24,238
that when you spec something into good

2334
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:26,079
manufacturing process to GMP it is just

2335
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:28,559
like all of your food and all your

2336
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:30,158
Pharmaceuticals are made this way and

2337
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,560
now you're applying this to the

2338
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:36,238
production of cannabis products so it

2339
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:38,760
has all to do with your quality control

2340
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:41,198
and how you Source your ingredients and

2341
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:43,280
your processes and the types of

2342
01:37:41,198 --> 01:37:45,799
stainless steel you use in your tanks

2343
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:47,960
and everything it impacts everything

2344
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:51,079
that's why all the people you see back

2345
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:54,279
in margus place are all gowned from head

2346
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:57,399
to toe because you can't have be hair or

2347
01:37:54,279 --> 01:38:00,279
mustache hair or you know and sure

2348
01:37:57,399 --> 01:38:03,598
during Co it must be a extraordinary

2349
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:04,880
challenge again to have people who again

2350
01:38:03,599 --> 01:38:06,039
you don't know where they social

2351
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,000
distancing you don't know who they're

2352
01:38:06,039 --> 01:38:10,399
coming in contact with right and now you

2353
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
need to bring people into a facility you

2354
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:15,960
have to basically know exactly who's

2355
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,760
coming into to where because you know

2356
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,239
there's a lot of material and

2357
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,000
inventory at at risk in in these

2358
01:38:21,238 --> 01:38:26,598
facilities and again this is why testing

2359
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,439
is Oho important and so Mark the

2360
01:38:26,599 --> 01:38:30,000
question I really have and again this is

2361
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:31,238
you know you don't have to answer it but

2362
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,599
certainly something that I think we

2363
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:37,079
could try to figure out which is like

2364
01:38:33,599 --> 01:38:39,239
now that you're making like a a a water

2365
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:41,399
hash product you know really it's

2366
01:38:39,238 --> 01:38:43,519
probably really important to know like

2367
01:38:41,399 --> 01:38:46,319
what the shelf life of of these things

2368
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,760
are and like how you package it and how

2369
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,840
you produce it and how it's packaged and

2370
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:52,920
then the quality control measures of

2371
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:55,719
okay there has to be like a certain

2372
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:58,560
level of moisture a certain level of

2373
01:38:55,719 --> 01:39:01,439
whatever tpes in there and when you're

2374
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:04,840
out of that window sorry that product is

2375
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:06,719
not meet specifications by GMP standards

2376
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:09,960
that actually has to be removed and

2377
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:11,319
destroyed or reworked you're nail whole

2378
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:13,239
thing yeah the whole thing about

2379
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:15,639
reworking the great thing about cannabis

2380
01:39:13,238 --> 01:39:18,198
is something like hash like if it does

2381
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:20,199
foul or something like that you could

2382
01:39:18,198 --> 01:39:22,198
essentially rework it back through

2383
01:39:20,198 --> 01:39:23,960
making distillate or you could do

2384
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:27,638
something to clean it up

2385
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:29,920
but part of your GMP quality control

2386
01:39:27,639 --> 01:39:32,679
production processes that have to be in

2387
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:35,079
place for these facilities have to go

2388
01:39:32,679 --> 01:39:37,760
through every type of scenario that you

2389
01:39:35,079 --> 01:39:40,960
could possibly imagine where you ship

2390
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:44,079
the material to atn's dispensary and now

2391
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:46,198
somebody buys it at ATN dispensary they

2392
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:48,479
take it home they send it to a lab now

2393
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:50,000
it doesn't test for what the label says

2394
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:52,079
and that guy comes back and wants his

2395
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,719
money back and say hey this stuff was

2396
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:58,039
supposed to be 74% % it's only testing

2397
01:39:54,719 --> 01:40:00,520
at 65% what the hell well this guy went

2398
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:02,960
to this Shady lab over here and this guy

2399
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:05,040
wants to his business so he's going to

2400
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:08,000
give him the result that he wants and

2401
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:11,238
starts this Loop of you know how you get

2402
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,960
third-party testing result Labs sort of

2403
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:15,079
competing with one another to provide

2404
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:18,480
the results that are needed to meet

2405
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:21,319
label requirements but it's not a small

2406
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:22,839
task to meet when you're trying to

2407
01:40:21,319 --> 01:40:25,238
produce these and what you're saying is

2408
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:27,800
that you're winning over government

2409
01:40:25,238 --> 01:40:30,000
contracts for entire provinces I mean

2410
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:32,119
you're talking about going from this

2411
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,399
level of production up to this level of

2412
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:37,799
production overnight that is not trivial

2413
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:40,238
so my hats off to you Marcus and all the

2414
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:42,400
team of folks that you mentioned because

2415
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,598
I know you don't do this by yourself and

2416
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:47,198
it's all these talented people but these

2417
01:40:44,599 --> 01:40:49,440
are people who bought into your vision

2418
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:51,519
and saw that hey you know what we can

2419
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:54,079
take this high quality product that we

2420
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:57,000
can make at an artisan level and scale

2421
01:40:54,079 --> 01:41:01,719
it up for the masses and so I applaud

2422
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:03,719
your your your instincts your bravery

2423
01:41:01,719 --> 01:41:05,599
and the people who basically put money

2424
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:07,719
behind you to make this

2425
01:41:05,599 --> 01:41:09,639
happen you wanna you want to talk a

2426
01:41:07,719 --> 01:41:12,560
little bit about that Mike in regards to

2427
01:41:09,639 --> 01:41:17,279
how we're kind of keeping that going

2428
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:21,520
on yeah so the part of the how's it

2429
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:23,920
going Budd Mar good can you guys hear me

2430
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:28,440
okay can you guys hear me

2431
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:30,800
okay yes sir yes okay yeah so part of

2432
01:41:28,439 --> 01:41:34,238
the government's provincial rules they

2433
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:37,760
they allow up to a 5% variance from your

2434
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:39,879
labeling so when anytime you list a

2435
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,280
product you actually have a basically a

2436
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:45,440
plus or minus 5% of what you list on

2437
01:41:42,279 --> 01:41:47,880
that label it when and if you your

2438
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:51,000
product is deemed to have gone through

2439
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:54,039
the degradation uh either by shelf life

2440
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,238
or by storage to be more than 5% you

2441
01:41:54,039 --> 01:41:57,560
actually have to have that Best Buy Date

2442
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:00,799
listed on your

2443
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:02,599
label um I'm sure Alec could probably

2444
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,800
talk a little bit more about determining

2445
01:42:02,599 --> 01:42:08,440
shell fight tests but once once those

2446
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:10,719
tests have been determined for the for

2447
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:13,439
the hashes we actually have will have to

2448
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:15,399
recall them as well so part part of what

2449
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,198
we've we've done is actually taken a

2450
01:42:15,399 --> 01:42:19,759
couple a fairly

2451
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:22,359
standardized batch of

2452
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,280
flowers ran it through a whole

2453
01:42:22,359 --> 01:42:26,559
assortment of tests separating all all

2454
01:42:24,279 --> 01:42:29,319
the microns testing them figuring out

2455
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:32,440
which blends would work well with to try

2456
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:34,759
and fit some desirable potency targets

2457
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:37,678
and then uh combine those different

2458
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:41,320
types of hashes to as Mark mentioned

2459
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:43,960
kind of a a grade and a bgrade I think

2460
01:42:41,319 --> 01:42:45,719
is what they're calling it right now um

2461
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,760
you know kind of two different blends

2462
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:51,599
they're different broad spectrums of uh

2463
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:53,840
different microns and then as we

2464
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:56,159
actually start adding different product

2465
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,880
above and below those different uh

2466
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:01,439
grades you'll actually start seeing the

2467
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,880
different uh grades come out at just

2468
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,079
like we see with the different star

2469
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:07,760
ratings Mike do those two fractions test

2470
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:10,319
differently like would you see

2471
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:12,560
variations in cannabinoid and turpine

2472
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:14,920
levels between those two so when you

2473
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:17,760
homogenize them they make a a sort of

2474
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:21,679
like a statistical mixture

2475
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:23,560
so in general the smaller tpine the

2476
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:27,279
smaller microns will have a higher

2477
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:30,039
tarpine to canono ratio um obviously T

2478
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:32,920
some of those tpes and peridine

2479
01:43:30,039 --> 01:43:35,599
precursors are then stacked at the basil

2480
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:39,399
cells into the canabo through within

2481
01:43:35,599 --> 01:43:43,800
that uh glandular Drome so the highest

2482
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:47,198
potencies are in that um 90 to 120 or

2483
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:52,560
150 Micron range depending on the

2484
01:43:47,198 --> 01:43:54,638
strain um but you know what we kind of

2485
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,080
did is figured out okay we know that

2486
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:59,079
these are going to be the ones that have

2487
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:01,719
the most mature glandular triome heads

2488
01:43:59,079 --> 01:44:04,000
they also test the highest and are going

2489
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:05,719
to contain the highest turpine content

2490
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,079
blend those into kind of a higher grade

2491
01:44:05,719 --> 01:44:11,520
one which ended up coming out with a

2492
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:12,960
tpine Content which I I don't have the

2493
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,199
paper in front of me marked but I think

2494
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:19,840
it was 8% potency difference between our

2495
01:44:16,198 --> 01:44:22,439
spread and the b-grade and our a grade

2496
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,639
um which had the basically the a the

2497
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:26,279
b-grade had

2498
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:27,760
one or two of the larger glandular trior

2499
01:44:26,279 --> 01:44:30,158
heads to get a lot of potency and then

2500
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,199
one or two of the smaller glandular

2501
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:35,039
heads which would have high higher

2502
01:44:32,198 --> 01:44:36,919
chirpping contents right I mean it's

2503
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:39,399
interesting to think that maybe even

2504
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:41,520
with the physical size and difference

2505
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:44,638
that just in storage like if you had

2506
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:47,960
this like in a five gallon pale that the

2507
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:50,118
dust at the bottom would test higher

2508
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:53,039
than say like the stuff at the top of

2509
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:54,639
the container is I mean you'd see you

2510
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:57,399
you'd be able to see some type of

2511
01:44:54,639 --> 01:45:00,039
gradient just on

2512
01:44:57,399 --> 01:45:04,198
storage that you know would would be

2513
01:45:00,039 --> 01:45:07,279
either within that 5% window or or or or

2514
01:45:04,198 --> 01:45:08,519
or not but I guess the question is and

2515
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:10,399
again Mike maybe you have already

2516
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:13,599
figured this out so if you're packaging

2517
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:17,158
this say like in a in a puck or like a

2518
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:18,800
container like that and you're um

2519
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:22,238
putting it out on the market but

2520
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:25,199
obviously there's you know you know it

2521
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:28,279
stays in inventory and warehouses or

2522
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:30,719
wherever I mean at what point does tpine

2523
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:33,920
law start to really move the needle on

2524
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:35,439
cannaboid content so like if you look at

2525
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,560
if you look at this data that we were

2526
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:41,198
referring to earlier uh this was some

2527
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:44,719
Frenchy canola uh data that he po posted

2528
01:45:41,198 --> 01:45:47,559
on Facebook it just showed again tpine

2529
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:50,319
loss that you would expect over a month

2530
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:53,239
yeah there's less tpin there so actually

2531
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:56,639
you could see the impact now on canabo

2532
01:45:53,238 --> 01:45:59,039
content so is there a point at which say

2533
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:01,800
well we made that hash say six months

2534
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:03,920
ago now the tpping loss has been

2535
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:06,320
sufficient enough that if you were to

2536
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:08,158
test it for cannaboids now you're going

2537
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:11,158
to find a different

2538
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:14,759
number the so the the governments only

2539
01:46:11,158 --> 01:46:15,960
only regulate the uh they say they

2540
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:18,440
basically say anything you put on the

2541
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:22,279
labels um have to fall within a certain

2542
01:46:18,439 --> 01:46:23,799
5% range before it falls out of spec um

2543
01:46:22,279 --> 01:46:26,118
they don't regulate the tpin but

2544
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:29,320
unfortunately the government of Canada

2545
01:46:26,118 --> 01:46:33,639
doesn't require tpin to be listed on

2546
01:46:29,319 --> 01:46:37,599
labels okay I wish they would but it's

2547
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:39,560
not required not done producers yeah

2548
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:42,279
here in Pennsylvania they they they put

2549
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:44,400
on like the five most prevalent ones

2550
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:47,279
that they find but I think they run a

2551
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:48,519
test for I believe 20 different tur beIN

2552
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:50,880
and I think if you want you could

2553
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:52,400
actually go to the when you go to The

2554
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,400
Dispensary they can actually give you

2555
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:56,920
the report from the lab itself so wow

2556
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:59,479
what a bummer that they not testing for

2557
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:01,760
tpin man they do that's not true Mark

2558
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:03,559
they do test for tpin what said if you

2559
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:07,800
listen to him was that the government of

2560
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:12,119
Canada does not require it but some and

2561
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:13,639
everyone tests for them okay yeah so so

2562
01:47:12,118 --> 01:47:15,799
so what we're able to do is kind of

2563
01:47:13,639 --> 01:47:19,520
collect those tests for our own

2564
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:21,560
data uh but but you know in order to

2565
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:24,360
actually put them on the label you have

2566
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:28,480
to actually fit them within the is not

2567
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:32,238
required um so yeah well well we ended

2568
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:35,799
up I think our Mark where we were

2569
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:38,559
required to put the total canabo THC

2570
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:40,920
CBD um I don't think that they require

2571
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:44,599
labeling on the minor canabo but many

2572
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:46,599
producers will if they see uh minor

2573
01:47:44,599 --> 01:47:50,199
canono Peaks they will list

2574
01:47:46,599 --> 01:47:54,159
it um but there's no no government

2575
01:47:50,198 --> 01:47:56,479
mandated uh labeling of tur profiles yet

2576
01:47:54,158 --> 01:47:59,719
on the on the consumer

2577
01:47:56,479 --> 01:48:01,519
packaging so but yeah what they did what

2578
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:03,399
they did require is you whatever you

2579
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:05,199
label and you yeah when you actually

2580
01:48:03,399 --> 01:48:08,000
submit your labels there's a range that

2581
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:11,079
you have to submit your labels into and

2582
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,960
so and and plus or minus 5% within that

2583
01:48:11,079 --> 01:48:15,238
range every you know every sample or

2584
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,560
test that they pull they're going to

2585
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:19,479
have to test that so when we had to go

2586
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:22,039
through and list you know what are what

2587
01:48:19,479 --> 01:48:24,559
are our proposed products for bubble

2588
01:48:22,039 --> 01:48:26,279
hash anytime you you have that spectrum

2589
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,840
of different ranges each one of those

2590
01:48:26,279 --> 01:48:33,000
potential product lines has to be listed

2591
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:35,800
as a uh new and novel cannabis product

2592
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:41,399
nncp um just like you're listing a

2593
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:45,480
different grade of uh Alcohol Tobacco or

2594
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:48,679
regulated substance so it it becomes a

2595
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:50,158
relatively complex uh thing but what

2596
01:48:48,679 --> 01:48:52,079
most of the proven want to be able to

2597
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:54,719
see is that you have you relationships

2598
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:54,719
with existing

2599
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:03,679
because the province has essentially a

2600
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:06,000
monopoly Distribution on the the

2601
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:08,359
distribution we we as producers ship to

2602
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,920
the province they Province then ships to

2603
01:49:08,359 --> 01:49:13,839
the retailers or puts it online for sale

2604
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:16,800
um so we have to end up shipping big

2605
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,239
orders to the provincial warehouses

2606
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:22,079
within the the

2607
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:23,839
states um so it's it makes it a lot

2608
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:26,000
harder for the craft Farmers because

2609
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,119
they can't just start marketing to the

2610
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,520
small local shops in the

2611
01:49:28,118 --> 01:49:32,439
neighborhood but there are a few

2612
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:34,960
provinces that have started allowing

2613
01:49:32,439 --> 01:49:38,118
what's called Farmgate retail

2614
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:40,000
distribution yeah so that that's our

2615
01:49:38,118 --> 01:49:41,920
what Mark showing right now is the

2616
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,639
pallet that we were wrapping up getting

2617
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:47,880
ready to ship to the province of British

2618
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,440
Columbia and that went to a undisclosed

2619
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:53,800
location here

2620
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:57,638
in uh DC and you know how much product

2621
01:49:53,800 --> 01:50:00,920
is that right there Mike so that's 600

2622
01:49:57,639 --> 01:50:06,039
Kil of packaging and

2623
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:09,039
5.4 kilos of hash so 5,400

2624
01:50:06,039 --> 01:50:12,519
gram um but when you look at all the

2625
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:15,359
cardboard and inside of black Myron jars

2626
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:18,440
with it its own custom

2627
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:20,479
labeled um and then those had to be kind

2628
01:50:18,439 --> 01:50:22,719
of packaged into what the government

2629
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:26,638
wants as Master cases just like they

2630
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:29,279
wants specific numbers of uh you six

2631
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:31,400
packs of beers a lot of the provinces

2632
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:33,679
want set units in the cases that they're

2633
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:35,839
offering to retail

2634
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:38,158
stores Mark I have a question for you

2635
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,840
when you do make seven or eight

2636
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,559
different bags of hash and you separate

2637
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:43,400
them all out and you find that you know

2638
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:45,840
that you you it's well it's worth

2639
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:49,158
testing the 90 and the 73 and maybe the

2640
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:51,400
120 can you take the other ones combine

2641
01:50:49,158 --> 01:50:53,198
them and make rosin out of that make one

2642
01:50:51,399 --> 01:50:55,519
product out of that and then test that

2643
01:50:53,198 --> 01:50:56,399
one product yeah oh yeah you can do that

2644
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,000
no

2645
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:01,679
problem yeah you just have to kind of

2646
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:04,319
Target you know the minimum provinces

2647
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:07,520
want to order is a couple of kilos so

2648
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:09,799
each one of those fractions have to be

2649
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:11,400
uh a couple of kilos right well we

2650
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:13,639
already explained that and if it goes if

2651
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:16,000
it goes higher it becomes impossible how

2652
01:51:13,639 --> 01:51:18,520
are you going to make 10 kilos of 90

2653
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,279
Micron hash from a certain skew within

2654
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:23,239
5% of a range and then have the province

2655
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:24,840
order more like a month later and say

2656
01:51:23,238 --> 01:51:27,039
well we want double that we want 20

2657
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:28,920
kilos now and Ontario saw what we were

2658
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:30,238
doing they want 30 kilos can you make

2659
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:32,920
that happen because we need it right

2660
01:51:30,238 --> 01:51:35,919
away you get yourself into a situation

2661
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:37,920
where you you can't maintain the

2662
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:40,039
pathway well and you have to do it in

2663
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:43,880
one batch too right Mark you can't do it

2664
01:51:40,039 --> 01:51:46,319
in like like small Artisans who don't

2665
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:48,800
have the size of equipment that you have

2666
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:49,920
they'd have to make that in 10 batches

2667
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,679
well now there there going to be

2668
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:54,920
variation in those 10 batches where you

2669
01:51:52,679 --> 01:51:56,319
have one big Master batch because of the

2670
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,480
size of your

2671
01:51:56,319 --> 01:52:00,198
vessel you know it's definitely

2672
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:02,439
challenging you know it's definitely

2673
01:52:00,198 --> 01:52:04,359
challenging but M Mike and I love a good

2674
01:52:02,439 --> 01:52:07,198
challenge so we've been uh We've really

2675
01:52:04,359 --> 01:52:09,479
been kind of enjoying the journey and

2676
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:11,678
this is just the beginning of it and I I

2677
01:52:09,479 --> 01:52:13,279
am definitely going to get to a place

2678
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:16,679
where I can have my own bubble man

2679
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:19,238
branded hash under Micron specific you

2680
01:52:16,679 --> 01:52:21,199
know microns but it's just uh it's you

2681
01:52:19,238 --> 01:52:23,638
know it took me 30 years just to get to

2682
01:52:21,198 --> 01:52:24,839
this might take take some more months to

2683
01:52:23,639 --> 01:52:27,719
get to

2684
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:29,599
that I was wondering maybe if if we've

2685
01:52:27,719 --> 01:52:31,679
talked a lot about that to bring um

2686
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:33,279
Alice to it and talk about what's

2687
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:35,560
happening in California what kind of

2688
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:38,479
things are you having to get through to

2689
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:40,400
get hash to the market in the current

2690
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:42,399
situation in California and I just

2691
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:43,879
wanted to say really quick adding on to

2692
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:46,719
what Mike was saying just for the

2693
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:49,679
listeners when something is not required

2694
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:51,599
such as listing Tarpin then that means

2695
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:53,719
that you know the small farmers and the

2696
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:55,520
small micro licensed people that are

2697
01:52:53,719 --> 01:52:57,679
growing these beautiful flowers or

2698
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,400
products would really like to have that

2699
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:02,279
listed they pass it over to the lp and

2700
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:04,319
the LP because it's not required they

2701
01:53:02,279 --> 01:53:06,639
just won't put it on there so it doesn't

2702
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:10,359
really stand out at all so this is the

2703
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:12,840
problems of um you know not not

2704
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:15,799
requiring it because then the LPS have

2705
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:18,279
the the power to decide what to do and

2706
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:19,679
yes I would love to to hear from you

2707
01:53:18,279 --> 01:53:23,639
Alice as to what's going on in

2708
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,639
California and Flynn

2709
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:29,599
actually Flynn is better yeah to answer

2710
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,800

bit yeah California I'm just hearing

2719
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:57,679
everything you were just describing

2720
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,039
about Canada um with packaging labeling

2721
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:01,078
requirements you know a lot of that's

2722
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:06,560
very similar in the new license based in

2723
01:54:01,078 --> 01:54:06,559
California and so um you know kind

2724
01:54:13,158 --> 01:54:18,359
of pretty much labeled and package

2725
01:54:16,118 --> 01:54:20,439
testing face but um you know kind of

2726
01:54:18,359 --> 01:54:23,158
enforce you to be plus or minus 10%

2727
01:54:20,439 --> 01:54:26,198
final label you know I was mention it's

2728
01:54:23,158 --> 01:54:29,039
like incredibly difficult you know for

2729
01:54:26,198 --> 01:54:32,078
um I mean it seems like Canada kind of

2730
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:34,039
took all the kind of greatest of kind of

2731
01:54:32,078 --> 01:54:35,840
a lot of the States including California

2732
01:54:34,039 --> 01:54:38,920
and then kind of really

2733
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:41,679
went good um you know from from what

2734
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:46,639
I've seen um there's definitely a lot

2735
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:47,880
more um there yeah there's there's uh it

2736
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,239
makes it really really difficult for

2737
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,679
people to to get

2738
01:54:49,238 --> 01:54:52,919
Pro one after work with incredibly

2739
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:54,639
dialed last

2740
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:57,000
that can kind of ensure that their

2741
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:59,920
quality and accuracy and precision

2742
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:03,078
across time can you know be able to be

2743
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:04,639
you know uh meet meet the the labeling

2744
01:55:03,078 --> 01:55:06,599
you know that you because if you know if

2745
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:09,359
somebody does an R&amp;D test kind of along

2746
01:55:06,599 --> 01:55:12,760
the way and they find um you know kind

2747
01:55:09,359 --> 01:55:14,479
of 75% tronoid content you know and they

2748
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:17,079
they're going to end up using that on a

2749
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:19,118
label they put in final form you know it

2750
01:55:17,078 --> 01:55:20,439
requires that you know the the trust and

2751
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:21,799
faith in the laboratory that you're

2752
01:55:20,439 --> 01:55:24,479
doing testing with is going to be able

2753
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:27,560
to even hit those kind of quality kind

2754
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:29,559
of plus or minus measurements 5% is

2755
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:32,079
incredibly close and I would imagine

2756
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:32,760
just on that L level you know kind of

2757
01:55:32,078 --> 01:55:35,920
you

2758
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:37,960
know I I seriously question how many

2759
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:41,920
labs are actually able to be accurate

2760
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:43,399
precise kind of in that level um but uh

2761
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:46,078
you know and then beyond that too just

2762
01:55:43,399 --> 01:55:48,158
the the way Canada kind of uh really put

2763
01:55:46,078 --> 01:55:50,519
you know you know California I guess

2764
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:52,519
like a lot of the pesticides and suchu

2765
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:54,520
you fail for you know have action Li

2766
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:58,079
established you know and it seems like

2767
01:55:54,520 --> 01:56:00,040
California or it seems like uh Canada

2768
01:55:58,078 --> 01:56:03,399
took those action limits and

2769
01:56:00,039 --> 01:56:05,198
severely um made it tighter so like from

2770
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:07,638
what I saw it was about what 10 part per

2771
01:56:05,198 --> 01:56:09,598
billion is the average allowed level of

2772
01:56:07,639 --> 01:56:11,679
what's going to create a fail which is

2773
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:13,599
on its own it's pushing the boundaries

2774
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:16,599
of analytical chemistry's ability to

2775
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:18,360
test at those tiny levels um not to

2776
01:56:16,599 --> 01:56:19,960
mention the accuracy and precision that

2777
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:23,960
those labs are going to be able to kind

2778
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:23,960
of do on an ongoing level

2779
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:33,719
yeah no I'd agree I'd agree with like

2780
01:56:31,399 --> 01:56:36,238
everything everything you said for sure

2781
01:56:33,719 --> 01:56:40,158
and then a lot of it comes down to like

2782
01:56:36,238 --> 01:56:41,959
the cost of testing the cost of um

2783
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:43,679
putting your product in the marketplace

2784
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,480
and then having to be really conscious

2785
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:49,118
of like the super high levels of taxes

2786
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:51,479
that your product's going to have even

2787
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:53,359
before it hits the like retail level so

2788
01:56:51,479 --> 01:56:56,519
to speak because you'll be taxed at the

2789
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:59,118
distribution level um and then you'll be

2790
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:01,960
taxed three different times on the sales

2791
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:03,920
so you have to be ultimately conscious

2792
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:06,399
about when you're doing a batch and you

2793
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:08,319
have to pay for testing how many dollars

2794
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:11,078
or how many cents does that add to each

2795
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:14,359
unit and keeping that cost to a minimum

2796
01:57:11,078 --> 01:57:17,238
stuff like that and then also a lot of

2797
01:57:14,359 --> 01:57:19,679
the things are really hard to control

2798
01:57:17,238 --> 01:57:21,718
because you're forced to use other

2799
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:25,359
businesses that you might not own or

2800
01:57:21,719 --> 01:57:27,239
have control of through the line of

2801
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:30,078
products like we need to use a

2802
01:57:27,238 --> 01:57:32,519
distributor for example to sell be able

2803
01:57:30,078 --> 01:57:34,000
to sell our product to retailers so

2804
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:35,880
since we don't have a distribution

2805
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,238
license I have to rely on someone else

2806
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:40,719
to handle our product correctly and

2807
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:42,919
actually follow our Sops for when it

2808
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:44,920
gets delivered to the retailer and then

2809
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:46,880
the each retailer too has to know how to

2810
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:48,560
like intake that product correctly put

2811
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,840
it in the freezer put it in the

2812
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,840
refrigerator stuff like that and keeping

2813
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:55,560
control of your product the way down to

2814
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:58,360
when the customer actually gets it is a

2815
01:57:55,560 --> 01:58:00,400
lot harder in this system uh that

2816
01:57:58,359 --> 01:58:02,679
they've created and for full mot is

2817
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:06,759
crazy like how

2818
01:58:02,679 --> 01:58:08,880
hard like It's just tough preserve like

2819
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:11,199
perfectly like heads full melt for the

2820
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:14,159
final customers to it's kind of so I

2821
01:58:11,198 --> 01:58:16,000
feel like hard on the market a lot of

2822
01:58:14,158 --> 01:58:18,319
kind of where we've been moving in the

2823
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,719
market for California has been toward

2824
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:23,078
like a heavily controlled like delivery

2825
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:25,679
service and more like a subscription

2826
01:58:23,078 --> 01:58:27,639
service because with our product it's

2827
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:30,359
really hard to communicate to each

2828
01:58:27,639 --> 01:58:34,039
individual retailer how to handle it and

2829
01:58:30,359 --> 01:58:36,279
then each buyer because let's say oh you

2830
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:38,118
talk to the manager who's there on

2831
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:40,000
Monday Wednesday and Friday but then

2832
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:41,759
your delivery comes in on Tuesday and

2833
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,920
the dud who's taking in your product you

2834
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,880
never talked to and he never got

2835
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,480
communicated to how to handle your

2836
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:49,760
specific product because it's so

2837
01:58:47,479 --> 01:58:52,439
different so then your product gets

2838
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:54,920
intake and then sits on a Shelf at like

2839
01:58:52,439 --> 01:58:57,158
80 degrees in their warehouse for like a

2840
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:58,679
week before the other person realizes

2841
01:58:57,158 --> 01:59:01,158
like oh my God this should be in a

2842
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:03,960
refrigerator so then you have like a

2843
01:59:01,158 --> 01:59:07,158
kilo or two of product that essentially

2844
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:09,359
like almost got spoiled and you know you

2845
01:59:07,158 --> 01:59:12,479
have to take that hit essentially and

2846
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:16,439
decide well do we pull back the product

2847
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:19,039
and maybe discount it do we just not

2848
01:59:16,439 --> 01:59:21,158
release it at all and you know have to

2849
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:23,039
put it in maybe Edibles or something

2850
01:59:21,158 --> 01:59:24,679
like that but once it hit it's a certain

2851
01:59:23,039 --> 01:59:26,560
level like once it gets past

2852
01:59:24,679 --> 01:59:28,279
distribution you can't pull it back

2853
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,679
always so you either have to sell it or

2854
01:59:28,279 --> 01:59:34,279
destroy it so Mak some decision making

2855
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:34,279
very

2856
01:59:34,359 --> 01:59:39,000
difficult it's definitely not easy the

2857
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:41,039
way we get kind of pushed into these

2858
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,078
corners but I remember the old Corners

2859
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:45,078
with the gun in the face the 10 years to

2860
01:59:43,078 --> 01:59:47,118
shoot your dog to take your kids and

2861
01:59:45,078 --> 01:59:48,920
that was definitely worse like this

2862
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:51,880
sucks and there we can moan and whine

2863
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:54,399
and [ __ ] about it but it's not as bad

2864
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:56,359
as as what it was just like 10 plus

2865
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:58,399
years ago or whatever and and it's still

2866
01:59:56,359 --> 02:00:00,598
happening to a degree of course but at

2867
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:02,559
least we have Pathways and we're kind of

2868
02:00:00,599 --> 02:00:04,520
having this conversation in the room

2869
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:06,360
right now where people are saying wow

2870
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,719
lots of people are being kept from the

2871
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:10,158
business it's like lots of people are

2872
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:11,880
kept from every business like are you

2873
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:13,559
kidding me just because you grew weed

2874
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:14,880
and you paid some of your bills does not

2875
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:17,239
give you the entitlement to

2876
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:19,239
automatically be involved in a business

2877
02:00:17,238 --> 02:00:20,919
that is a business it still involves

2878
02:00:19,238 --> 02:00:23,598
having to do All the Right Moves it

2879
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:25,279
still you know like anyone can play to a

2880
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:26,480
degree but you have people saying oh

2881
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:28,000
well I'm going to need hundreds of

2882
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:30,158
thousands of dollars if I want to get a

2883
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,118
license well I would need millions of

2884
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:33,759
dollars if I wanted to build houses and

2885
02:00:32,118 --> 02:00:35,238
and flip them I don't have the skill I

2886
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,880
don't have the money so I avoid the

2887
02:00:35,238 --> 02:00:38,479
business doesn't mean I don't want to be

2888
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:40,800
a part of it I'd love to be a part of

2889
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:42,399
that business are they keeping me out of

2890
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,760
that business because I'm not in that

2891
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:45,960
business because I don't have millions

2892
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:48,039
of dollars to buy homes and flip them on

2893
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:49,599
the and so I I'm kind of have a hard

2894
02:00:48,039 --> 02:00:52,198
time with that conversation where it's

2895
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:54,319
like at what point do we let every

2896
02:00:52,198 --> 02:00:56,238
single person be a part of this business

2897
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:58,519
when it's not like that for any other

2898
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:01,678
business in the world you either find

2899
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:03,360
your way or you don't I think the big

2900
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:05,920
difference though is you don't have the

2901
02:01:03,359 --> 02:01:08,039
same Financial tools that other

2902
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,760
businesses do in the in the in the quote

2903
02:01:08,039 --> 02:01:12,679
unquote

2904
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:14,320
mainstream uh Society like if I if you

2905
02:01:12,679 --> 02:01:17,118
know I have a college education or

2906
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:18,799
whatever if I had experience and had

2907
02:01:17,118 --> 02:01:20,920
worked under someone I could go out and

2908
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,920
get a loan to start a construction

2909
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:25,158
company seriously you could go and get a

2910
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:27,199
million dollars from a bank as a normal

2911
02:01:25,158 --> 02:01:29,078
person and you can do it as a cannabis

2912
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:31,039
person tons of people have done it like

2913
02:01:29,078 --> 02:01:33,279
in my country we raised hundreds of

2914
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:34,840
millions billions of dollars you could

2915
02:01:33,279 --> 02:01:37,039
have moved to Canada and started your

2916
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:39,599
legal cannabis business you're you live

2917
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:41,880
in North America you could have easily

2918
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:43,920
come to Canada you could have EAS go to

2919
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:45,639
Canada though when California alone is

2920
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:47,359
bigger than because they're limiting you

2921
02:01:45,639 --> 02:01:49,480
you just said they're not giving you the

2922
02:01:47,359 --> 02:01:51,479
ability that you can go and take a loan

2923
02:01:49,479 --> 02:01:52,519
so then you shift you want to be in this

2924
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:54,439
business

2925
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:56,199
just up and move to a whole new country

2926
02:01:54,439 --> 02:01:57,559
though well lots of people have done it

2927
02:01:56,198 --> 02:01:59,719
believe it or not you're sitting next to

2928
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:04,239
a girl who literally up and mov to a

2929
02:01:59,719 --> 02:02:06,960
complete country and then married you I

2930
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:09,198
like it's true no but it I mean I feel

2931
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:10,719
like there are some obstacles like as a

2932
02:02:09,198 --> 02:02:13,158
legal business you know like I don't

2933
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:15,198
know get a or like have a bank account

2934
02:02:13,158 --> 02:02:17,598
you know like legal businesses here have

2935
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:19,439
a have a hard time having just a bank

2936
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:21,920
account like a bank that accepts like a

2937
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:24,319
legal cannabis business so there are

2938
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,319
toally

2939
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:31,000
you I'm on the east coast in regulated

2940
02:02:29,319 --> 02:02:33,359
market and it's just it's nearly

2941
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,880
impossible um in terms of how where

2942
02:02:33,359 --> 02:02:38,078
where does your money come from where

2943
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,440
does it go and I I agree but I also

2944
02:02:38,078 --> 02:02:41,719
agree with Marcus you got to go where

2945
02:02:39,439 --> 02:02:45,039
your opportunities are and try to forge

2946
02:02:41,719 --> 02:02:47,840
a pathway forward and I'm I I firmly

2947
02:02:45,039 --> 02:02:49,519
believe what Marcus believes you gotta

2948
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,239
find your path I didn't have millions of

2949
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,040
dollars I didn't I didn't invest

2950
02:02:51,238 --> 02:02:54,839
millions of dollar to start this company

2951
02:02:53,039 --> 02:02:56,719
I did it with knowledge and I connected

2952
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,639
with people and I just you know it's

2953
02:02:56,719 --> 02:03:00,239
just like of course I want everyone to

2954
02:02:58,639 --> 02:03:02,039
have the ability to do all the things

2955
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:04,078
that they want to do but I hear a lot of

2956
02:03:02,039 --> 02:03:06,359
people complaining that they're that

2957
02:03:04,078 --> 02:03:07,639
they're being kept out of the industry

2958
02:03:06,359 --> 02:03:10,238
and I'm like well what does the industry

2959
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:11,719
have to do like to to allow everyone to

2960
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:14,319
C you know I've never been in an

2961
02:03:11,719 --> 02:03:15,599
industry that literally is open to any

2962
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:17,158
single person it doesn't matter if you

2963
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:19,480
started a day ago and have no

2964
02:03:17,158 --> 02:03:21,920
information or no knowledge you get to

2965
02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:25,158
start a business in this industry and

2966
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:27,520
it's kind of crazy the the levels of

2967
02:03:25,158 --> 02:03:30,319
entitlement that are people are feeling

2968
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:33,199
in particular with cannabis I've I've

2969
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:35,559
never seen it with any other business

2970
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:37,279
the way I've seen it with cannabis and I

2971
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:39,159
you know Marcus the music industry is

2972
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:41,078
kind of like that you know because it's

2973
02:03:39,158 --> 02:03:43,879
all about your hands it's about your

2974
02:03:41,078 --> 02:03:46,319
knowledge it's about what you put into

2975
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:48,118
the thing that you put out and I think

2976
02:03:46,319 --> 02:03:50,238
that what you're illustrating is is kind

2977
02:03:48,118 --> 02:03:52,238
of just that is is your your knowledge

2978
02:03:50,238 --> 02:03:55,039
and your passion really more importantly

2979
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:57,519
is what brought you to where you are and

2980
02:03:55,039 --> 02:04:01,198
I share that same that same vision with

2981
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:02,840
you man I think it's only about you know

2982
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:05,359
what you what you're passionate about

2983
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:07,239
and how you you you kind of choose to to

2984
02:04:05,359 --> 02:04:09,198
go down that pathway with it you know oh

2985
02:04:07,238 --> 02:04:11,319
banging our head against the wall for 30

2986
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:13,558
plus years certainly nothing happened

2987
02:04:11,319 --> 02:04:17,000
easily I was arrested I was put in jail

2988
02:04:13,559 --> 02:04:18,760
like I I I felt all of these things that

2989
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:21,880
people are saying the that the industry

2990
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:23,280
did you know like I caught charges I had

2991
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:25,480
like all of these different things

2992
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:26,960
happened to me and I just kind of worked

2993
02:04:25,479 --> 02:04:29,359
through them and I just traveled and it

2994
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:31,279
was my journey and you know I definitely

2995
02:04:29,359 --> 02:04:33,479
support people in their journey I have a

2996
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:36,840
ton of people asking me all the time how

2997
02:04:33,479 --> 02:04:38,519
do I break into this industry how do I

2998
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:40,078
get into the Cannabis industry and I'm

2999
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:42,000
always like man I don't know like what's

3000
02:04:40,078 --> 02:04:43,920
your passion like to me cannabis is

3001
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,880
everything if you're a scientist you can

3002
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,920
get into the Cannabis industry if you're

3003
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:50,159

02:04:56,520 --> 02:05:00,280
a processor if you're an accountant if

3009
02:04:58,559 --> 02:05:02,559
you're part of leadership and you want

3010
02:05:00,279 --> 02:05:04,279
to be a CFO or there's so many different

3011
02:05:02,559 --> 02:05:06,279
things you can do today that you

3012
02:05:04,279 --> 02:05:08,479
couldn't do 20 years ago in the Cannabis

3013
02:05:06,279 --> 02:05:11,158
industry that it's brought a lot of

3014
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:12,959
people into the ability to to be a part

3015
02:05:11,158 --> 02:05:15,198
of this industry you know even if it's

3016
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,960
just like a a laborer and you want to

3017
02:05:15,198 --> 02:05:18,238
learn how to grow in a greenhouse or you

3018
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:20,439
want to you know learn how to be a

3019
02:05:18,238 --> 02:05:22,598
labtech these things are kind of all

3020
02:05:20,439 --> 02:05:24,598
available and these were jobs that were

3021
02:05:22,599 --> 02:05:26,880
not available like 20 years ago in

3022
02:05:24,599 --> 02:05:29,480
Canada they just didn't exist and so the

3023
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:31,559
fact that kids are excited to go back to

3024
02:05:29,479 --> 02:05:33,198
University these Sciences because they

3025
02:05:31,559 --> 02:05:35,199
see positions are going to be opened up

3026
02:05:33,198 --> 02:05:36,638
for them and that they can you know like

3027
02:05:35,198 --> 02:05:38,359
wow this is opening up I'm going to go

3028
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:39,840
get my degree I'm going to come out and

3029
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:41,719
I'm going to be a part of this industry

3030
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:44,480
like I think all of that is uh is

3031
02:05:41,719 --> 02:05:46,039
amazing but I definitely have a hard

3032
02:05:44,479 --> 02:05:47,519
time with people but people in Canada

3033
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:49,158
for the longest time were complaining

3034
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,599
about the micro grow oh you got to have

3035
02:05:49,158 --> 02:05:52,558
a million dollars you got to have a

3036
02:05:50,599 --> 02:05:54,880
million dollars and then some woman did

3037
02:05:52,559 --> 02:05:56,320
it with like I don't know like $50,000

3038
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:59,118
and she was like no it can be done it

3039
02:05:56,319 --> 02:06:00,920
can be done like trust me it's just just

3040
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:03,039
instead of complaining that it can't be

3041
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:05,719
done and creating problems for the

3042
02:06:03,039 --> 02:06:07,639
solutions flip the script and create

3043
02:06:05,719 --> 02:06:11,960
solutions for the problems because it

3044
02:06:07,639 --> 02:06:13,840
can be done absolutely agree yeah and I

3045
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:15,920
I do too and and although you know in

3046
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:18,719
California and kind of across the United

3047
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:21,118
States for that matter you know um for

3048
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:25,760
in legal cannabis markets odds have you

3049
02:06:21,118 --> 02:06:25,759
know with regulation been put in place

3050
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:40,440
uh responded groups today you know and

3051
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:42,078
we we've been able to find back against

3052
02:06:40,439 --> 02:06:43,598
this small guy there's also tremendous

3053
02:06:42,078 --> 02:06:45,679
Advantage you know from a lot of what

3054
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:47,199
we're seeing and and uh you know with

3055
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:49,000
the banks you know the banks are is a

3056
02:06:47,198 --> 02:06:51,919
whole definitely issue you know we've

3057
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,639
over the last uh 11 10 years um you know

3058
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:57,840
we we definitely had like 25 bank

3059
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:59,679
accounts shut down and uh and so it's

3060
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:01,639
been a constant kind of process to kind

3061
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:04,520
of roll through and find and you know

3062
02:07:01,639 --> 02:07:07,000
work through this real complicated space

3063
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:09,000
but you know I mean that's kind of the

3064
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,520
journey you know and and you know if you

3065
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,719
have the passion you'll find a way um

3066
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:16,520
and so you know I do agree with you know

3067
02:07:13,719 --> 02:07:18,480
the complaint or Pro you know creating

3068
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:21,960
problems out of existing problems or you

3069
02:07:18,479 --> 02:07:24,039
know just uh

3070
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:28,359
yeah to to find a way it's like passion

3071
02:07:24,039 --> 02:07:28,359
will find a way and

3072
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,599
yeah it's not that everyone's unhappy

3073
02:07:32,359 --> 02:07:35,198
they're just trying to work towards

3074
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:37,279
better system because the system's

3075
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:38,919
oppressive and it makes it incredibly

3076
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:41,279
difficult for people to enter the system

3077
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:44,599
but big up to the people that can that

3078
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:44,599
can forge the way and make the

3079
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:50,439
changes I I I don't know I mean maybe

3080
02:07:48,679 --> 02:07:52,559
I'm thinking about this in a different

3081
02:07:50,439 --> 02:07:57,359
way I mean here in United

3082
02:07:52,559 --> 02:08:00,400
States um you know if you go to ind.com

3083
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:05,319
and you put cannabis

3084
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:08,479
extraction you get a NeverEnding list of

3085
02:08:05,319 --> 02:08:12,359
jobs in just about every state that has

3086
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:14,839
cannabis programs they need people

3087
02:08:12,359 --> 02:08:17,479
cannabis extraction cannabis

3088
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:19,880
dispensaries you can go to these just

3089
02:08:17,479 --> 02:08:23,519
job sites just to you know we were

3090
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:26,000
recently uh looking to hire somebody and

3091
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,639
we were thinking about um having like a

3092
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,639
full-time person to run our

3093
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:36,279
hlc and so uh we looked and my god there

3094
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:38,159
had to be 15 other places looking for

3095
02:08:36,279 --> 02:08:40,719
exactly the person that we were looking

3096
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:42,359
for we want someone that's you know kind

3097
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:43,920
of analytically trained they didn't

3098
02:08:42,359 --> 02:08:45,880
necessarily need to have a college

3099
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:48,840
degree because we were paying them by

3100
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:52,480
the hour but we wanted them to basically

3101
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:56,039
take ownership over the hlc and run our

3102
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:58,519
analytical uh in-house analytical lab

3103
02:08:56,039 --> 02:09:00,960
and I I don't know man it seems like

3104
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:04,480
there's a lot of jobs out there right

3105
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:06,800
now for people who are looking for

3106
02:09:04,479 --> 02:09:08,319
people to get into the industry so I I I

3107
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,920
don't know what what what they're

3108
02:09:08,319 --> 02:09:13,599
talking about I mean a lot of entrylevel

3109
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:16,239
jobs are out there I think it's a lot of

3110
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:17,960
people look at their computers trying to

3111
02:09:16,238 --> 02:09:20,039
wanting to be a part of things but just

3112
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:21,880
not knowing how to execute and sometimes

3113
02:09:20,039 --> 02:09:23,439
it's easier to just you know I listen

3114
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:25,000
we're all having difficulties this isn't

3115
02:09:23,439 --> 02:09:26,399
the easiest thing we're in a global

3116
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,319
pandemic we're all trying to deal with

3117
02:09:26,399 --> 02:09:30,319
these businesses we're involved in

3118
02:09:28,319 --> 02:09:32,920
something that's never happened before

3119
02:09:30,319 --> 02:09:36,000
in the world cannabis has never gone

3120
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:38,639
from a 100 plus years federally illegal

3121
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,479
to federally legal you guys down in the

3122
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:42,800
states are probably going to pop Federal

3123
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:45,118
here in the next two to five years it's

3124
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:46,719
it's almost inev God we hope so we hope

3125
02:09:45,118 --> 02:09:48,639
so it's got to happen man it's got to

3126
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:50,599
happen now will it happen the way we

3127
02:09:48,639 --> 02:09:52,639
want it to happen probably not it'll

3128
02:09:50,599 --> 02:09:54,559
probably be scar it'll probably be

3129
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:56,960
handed over to Big Business and and

3130
02:09:54,559 --> 02:10:00,960
Pharma and all these trap Labs that

3131
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:03,039
think they're you know GP GMP Labs but

3132
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,480
they aren't they're like bare arms not

3133
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:07,279
wearing the proper gear those labs are

3134
02:10:05,479 --> 02:10:08,799
going to go to the to the Wayside and

3135
02:10:07,279 --> 02:10:11,639
you're going to see the labs open up

3136
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:13,960
with much more regulations and it's it's

3137
02:10:11,639 --> 02:10:16,279
a bit scary but at the same time I I run

3138
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:18,239
a lab like that and you know what like

3139
02:10:16,279 --> 02:10:19,960
if I have to jump through certain Hoops

3140
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:22,198
to be a part of this industry you're

3141
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:25,559
damn straight I'm going to jump through

3142
02:10:22,198 --> 02:10:27,719
them yeah one

3143
02:10:25,559 --> 02:10:29,800
other and one one other thing I'd like

3144
02:10:27,719 --> 02:10:31,920
to add to that too is you know because I

3145
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,920
feel like since over the last 25 years

3146
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:36,199
you know in California with a medical a

3147
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:38,199
medical program in place you know it was

3148
02:10:36,198 --> 02:10:39,719
in this time you know that was probably

3149
02:10:38,198 --> 02:10:42,118
one of in my opinion one of the most

3150
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:44,039
unique times of an industry of an

3151
02:10:42,118 --> 02:10:45,039
emerging industry that will ever ever

3152
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:48,000
taken

3153
02:10:45,039 --> 02:10:50,399
place will ever come it if there will

3154
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,559
ever be anything quite like it but you

3155
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:55,078
know if you had $5,000 and you know some

3156
02:10:53,559 --> 02:10:56,760
you know some gleam in your eye and

3157
02:10:55,078 --> 02:10:59,479
passion for the plant you know you could

3158
02:10:56,760 --> 02:11:02,480
kind of start up set up a garage grow

3159
02:10:59,479 --> 02:11:05,439
have 10 lights you know plus do whatever

3160
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:08,039
and be able to make make a living and

3161
02:11:05,439 --> 02:11:10,198
make make a you know career at the time

3162
02:11:08,039 --> 02:11:11,960
out of working with this plan you know

3163
02:11:10,198 --> 02:11:14,399
and so I feel like the States you know

3164
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:16,719
with regulation kicking in you know kind

3165
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:19,558
of have have made it such that you know

3166
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:21,880
the barrier of Entry is absolutely like

3167
02:11:19,559 --> 02:11:23,920
greatly more expensive to get because of

3168
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:26,359
all the reality of compliance and

3169
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:27,960
regulation all the things but you know

3170
02:11:26,359 --> 02:11:30,279
that was the most I feel like that's the

3171
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:32,840
most unfettered capitalism like free

3172
02:11:30,279 --> 02:11:34,399
market that uh that we could have ever

3173
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:37,000
been part of you know just working with

3174
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:38,759
this plan the time before legalization

3175
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,559
and so I feel like that's where so many

3176
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:43,239
people kind of you know have been cut

3177
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:46,320
out because they you know were were once

3178
02:11:43,238 --> 02:11:49,759
an owner operator of a business now you

3179
02:11:46,319 --> 02:11:52,039
know kind of grumpy and and and jaded

3180
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,599
you know because they they they didn't

3181
02:11:52,039 --> 02:11:56,639
you know necessarily do their diligence

3182
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:58,159
and stack money and you know like you

3183
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:59,520
not take the you know outrageous

3184
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:01,719
vacations all over the world all the

3185
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:03,920
time you know um because for those that

3186
02:12:01,719 --> 02:12:05,960
saw that time as time of Proving Ground

3187
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:08,920
to like work out the train you know the

3188
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:11,719
the the you know proof of concept and

3189
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:14,440
and the the the ability to sustain and

3190
02:12:11,719 --> 02:12:17,000
not just break even each row or each

3191
02:12:14,439 --> 02:12:18,719
kind of rounds but but to but eventually

3192
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,880
stack over time to point where they

3193
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:21,760
could get into a position where they

3194
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:23,239
could help sell fund

3195
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:25,520
you know kind of a project to kind of

3196
02:12:23,238 --> 02:12:27,799
become licensed but due to the fact that

3197
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:30,159
you know kind of that didn't happen you

3198
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:33,400
know I feel like a lot of people kind of

3199
02:12:30,158 --> 02:12:35,598
uh they see like they got cut out but

3200
02:12:33,399 --> 02:12:37,158
you know and in a bit of a way they did

3201
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:39,760
you know because the barrier of entry

3202
02:12:37,158 --> 02:12:42,158
and financial investments kind of went

3203
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:44,360
so much greater but but that was also

3204
02:12:42,158 --> 02:12:46,558
you know got all they all everybody also

3205
02:12:44,359 --> 02:12:47,960
has to recognized that themselves that

3206
02:12:46,559 --> 02:12:50,440
you know there was there was that was

3207
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:53,359
the time you know and once legalization

3208
02:12:50,439 --> 02:12:56,158
here tonight I mean all that works is to

3209
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:58,279
get ready for this moment there's also

3210
02:12:56,158 --> 02:13:00,638
the fact that a lot of these people were

3211
02:12:58,279 --> 02:13:04,039
just so stoked on selling four and five

3212
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:07,000
and $6,000 pounds and $808 under the

3213
02:13:04,039 --> 02:13:09,399
guise of medical oh yeah where it's like

3214
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,238
the the vacations and the cars and all

3215
02:13:09,399 --> 02:13:13,359
of the things that these people gained

3216
02:13:11,238 --> 02:13:15,558
through this prohibition pricing was

3217
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:18,198
like you know how many of them want to

3218
02:13:15,559 --> 02:13:19,880
sell $80 eights instead of like you know

3219
02:13:18,198 --> 02:13:23,879
give those eights away or sell them for

3220
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:25,078
10 or 50 like so it it turned into that

3221
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:26,840
too there was like you know a lot of

3222
02:13:25,078 --> 02:13:27,920
people now are like [ __ ] cannabis it's

3223
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:30,480
like well yeah I guess you're not

3224
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:32,840
getting your four or 5,000 usar a pound

3225
02:13:30,479 --> 02:13:34,839
anymore I could see where you [ __ ] the

3226
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:36,880
legal cannabis business because the

3227
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:39,400
illegal cannabis business was so good to

3228
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:40,920
you unfortunately instead of just people

3229
02:13:39,399 --> 02:13:42,638
having shitty jobs that weren't paying

3230
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:44,199
them enough it actually involved locking

3231
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:47,039
up hundreds of thousands of people

3232
02:13:44,198 --> 02:13:49,598
around the world and so I gotta lean

3233
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:52,599
back into the new being still better

3234
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:54,159
than what we came from what's that Josh

3235
02:13:52,599 --> 02:13:56,039
I'm just saying you can't say it was

3236
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:57,799
good at 4,000 but then it was not good

3237
02:13:56,039 --> 02:13:59,960
say you were getting a gun to your head

3238
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:01,760
I think it's just evolving now and it's

3239
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:03,520
really important for us to stay calm and

3240
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:05,760
try and help everyone that wants to

3241
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:07,840
enter you know entered which is what

3242
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:10,039
we're doing we're showing people are

3243
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:12,039
success is there different levels of

3244
02:14:10,039 --> 02:14:14,519
Entry happening right now there's

3245
02:14:12,039 --> 02:14:17,000
different levels of play happening and

3246
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:19,320
you know let's let's try and keep

3247
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,719
cannabis sacred and try and keep a soul

3248
02:14:19,319 --> 02:14:23,639
in cannabis and move forward I think

3249
02:14:21,719 --> 02:14:25,439
Alice had something to say and also I

3250
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:26,960
just wanted to say that you know Marcus

3251
02:14:25,439 --> 02:14:30,039
what what you're talking about is

3252
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:33,000
representative to the experience that

3253
02:14:30,039 --> 02:14:35,319
you're having in the experience that you

3254
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,840
know maybe your friends are having so

3255
02:14:35,319 --> 02:14:40,479
you're really speaking for yourself

3256
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:42,559
you're speaking for what's happening

3257
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:45,319
your evolvement and that's all that we

3258
02:14:42,559 --> 02:14:47,599
can speak for so you know what you were

3259
02:14:45,319 --> 02:14:50,719
saying I can't at all you know a lot of

3260
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:53,520
it can't necessarily transfer to a

3261
02:14:50,719 --> 02:14:55,399
culture cultivator in the experiences

3262
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:59,159
that we've had in the industry working

3263
02:14:55,399 --> 02:15:02,039
our asses off to try to be a part of it

3264
02:14:59,158 --> 02:15:04,759
you know or recognizing maybe the

3265
02:15:02,039 --> 02:15:08,000
reality that this is a system that

3266
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:10,199
because we are so integral in working

3267
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,238
with plant medicine that it might not

3268
02:15:10,198 --> 02:15:16,158
want to be an industry that we actually

3269
02:15:13,238 --> 02:15:19,598
enter into so there's that incredible

3270
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:22,920
push and pull too so here as cultivators

3271
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:25,119
we're working with incredible integrity

3272
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:27,679
and what we see when we put it out into

3273
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:30,558
the universe is like all this other

3274
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:33,199
mishmash and maybe you know it doesn't

3275
02:15:30,559 --> 02:15:35,279
totally match that energy so there's a

3276
02:15:33,198 --> 02:15:38,039
lot going on here and I just wanted to

3277
02:15:35,279 --> 02:15:39,399
mention that each one of us have our own

3278
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:42,639
individual

3279
02:15:39,399 --> 02:15:45,598
experiences in the industry so because

3280
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:47,599
it's evolving everything is going to

3281
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:51,520
come to the table all at once and that's

3282
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:54,639
what's happening right now

3283
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:56,760
on a subject too that is u i mean

3284
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:59,599
contining what Kelly was saying that

3285
02:15:56,760 --> 02:16:01,960
it's actually about privilege uh I mean

3286
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:03,599
I can talk through my own experience as

3287
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:06,078
you could talk through your own Marcus

3288
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:09,319
like in Brazil as I told before here I'm

3289
02:16:06,078 --> 02:16:11,279
a privileged white girl right so I I

3290
02:16:09,319 --> 02:16:14,359
have the standpoint of view from a

3291
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:16,880
privileged white girl in Brazil here in

3292
02:16:14,359 --> 02:16:19,000
United States it's totally different so

3293
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:21,679
I I managed to travel in between these

3294
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:24,520
two places in the world like how I I see

3295
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:26,279
myself and how I recognize myself and

3296
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:29,079
being able to be part of a cannabis

3297
02:16:26,279 --> 02:16:31,439
industry at least in Brazil I don't see

3298
02:16:29,078 --> 02:16:33,318
a possibility for everyone I don't see

3299
02:16:31,439 --> 02:16:35,920
something that would be almost Merit

3300
02:16:33,318 --> 02:16:38,840
meritto critical how do you say that mer

3301
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:40,478
Merit meritocracy meritocracy like I

3302
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:42,719
don't see it like that I see it as

3303
02:16:40,478 --> 02:16:45,438
something that would do totally do do

3304
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:47,678
with privilege all the business owners

3305
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:51,079
here at least that I see here in

3306
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:53,239
California they're white I don't see

3307
02:16:51,079 --> 02:16:55,799
black people I don't see Latinos I don't

3308
02:16:53,239 --> 02:16:58,959
see people that are from Mexico so I

3309
02:16:55,799 --> 02:17:00,599
feel like uh yeah it's not for every

3310
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:02,398
it's not every person that has a place

3311
02:17:00,599 --> 02:17:04,760
in this business

3312
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:07,239
honestly that's like every business it's

3313
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:09,679
true 100% like every business but

3314
02:17:07,239 --> 02:17:11,478
there's a difference between the

3315
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:14,719
Cannabis business and every other

3316
02:17:11,478 --> 02:17:17,920
business in the world we live in a

3317
02:17:14,718 --> 02:17:20,438
prohibitionist society and this business

3318
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,519
that we have nowadays has a historical

3319
02:17:20,439 --> 02:17:24,079
repar

3320
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:27,239
to take care of different than other

3321
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:30,000
businesses like people uh in the last

3322
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:32,718
like 50 60 years people have been

3323
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:35,799
massive incarcerated all over the world

3324
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:38,398
through like a drug policy still today

3325
02:17:35,799 --> 02:17:42,000
and where are where I agree with you is

3326
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:44,358
that uh with regulations things are

3327
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,558
safer this is where this is where I

3328
02:17:44,359 --> 02:17:48,280
agree there there are good good good

3329
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:50,358
sides and bad sides too like not

3330
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:52,399
everyone can be part of it but at the

3331
02:17:50,359 --> 02:17:55,040
same time looks safer you know there's

3332
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:57,279
less criminality so it's just I just

3333
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:59,240
wanted to sign shine a light on this

3334
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:02,479
because it's important for us to

3335
02:17:59,239 --> 02:18:05,760
recognize our own Privileges and uh

3336
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:07,879
understand that yeah for I mean for me

3337
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:10,519
I'm finding my place here in United

3338
02:18:07,879 --> 02:18:12,398
States too but I feel it that if I was

3339
02:18:10,519 --> 02:18:14,280
like a black girl that would be totally

3340
02:18:12,398 --> 02:18:16,279
different and that would be way harder

3341
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:20,079
and would be way harder to find

3342
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:21,800
Opportunities and possibilities and a

3343
02:18:20,079 --> 02:18:24,120
light on that if you want to have a ton

3344
02:18:21,799 --> 02:18:26,478
of great conversations about this very

3345
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:28,599
conversation and Dr Allison mentioned it

3346
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:32,840
at the start of the show this is

3347
02:18:28,599 --> 02:18:35,318
happening on clubhouse like every day

3348
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:38,359
every minute huge groups of people

3349
02:18:35,318 --> 02:18:40,398
talking about this both from from the

3350
02:18:38,359 --> 02:18:41,960
minority perspective from the privilege

3351
02:18:40,398 --> 02:18:44,760
perspective both in the room

3352
02:18:41,959 --> 02:18:47,279
simultaneously and it's really really

3353
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:48,920
great conversation uh to be a part of

3354
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:50,479
and it's it's of course true and it's

3355
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:53,519
not just the Cannabis business Believe

3356
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:55,318
it or not it's happening in a ton of

3357
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:56,719
different kinds of businesses privilege

3358
02:18:55,318 --> 02:18:59,000
passes through more than just the

3359
02:18:56,718 --> 02:19:01,159
Cannabis business and the best thing we

3360
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,638
can do is recognize our privilege do the

3361
02:19:01,159 --> 02:19:05,840
best that we can to share it with those

3362
02:19:03,638 --> 02:19:08,000
who don't have that privilege you know I

3363
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:09,679
share my time and my energy with

3364
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,840
everyone regardless of what they look

3365
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:14,120
like regardless of what color their skin

3366
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:16,719
is I'm always willing to help and share

3367
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:18,079
my time with people and and and you know

3368
02:19:16,718 --> 02:19:19,959
that's what we're doing right now today

3369
02:19:18,079 --> 02:19:22,079
this show is certainly not for any one

3370
02:19:19,959 --> 02:19:24,478
group of people this show is for every

3371
02:19:22,079 --> 02:19:26,280
people you know all the people can

3372
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:29,039
listen to Hash church and hopefully you

3373
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:30,519
know enjoy the conversation and have

3374
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,760
some disagreeance and have some

3375
02:19:30,519 --> 02:19:34,719
agreeance to me some of the best hash

3376
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:36,239
churches is when it gets a little Rocky

3377
02:19:34,718 --> 02:19:38,079
and we have a little we get into the

3378
02:19:36,239 --> 02:19:40,359
core subjects where there's really some

3379
02:19:38,079 --> 02:19:42,920
nerves being poked and I'll tell you

3380
02:19:40,359 --> 02:19:45,639
when we started talking about this the

3381
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:47,439
chat room started going off in in on

3382
02:19:45,638 --> 02:19:49,879
YouTube so it's like and sometimes it

3383
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:52,439
goes pretty slow and yeah people want to

3384
02:19:49,879 --> 02:19:53,920
have these difficult conversations and

3385
02:19:52,439 --> 02:19:56,000
kind of and there's learning from them

3386
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,760
like I have these conversations so I can

3387
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,000
personally learn from them so I can

3388
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:02,719
shift my perspective so I can you know

3389
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,559
help help become a better person

3390
02:20:02,719 --> 02:20:08,318
basically well I mean look I I'm a

3391
02:20:05,559 --> 02:20:10,359
legacy operator I'm also man of white

3392
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:13,879
privilege but I use my white privilege

3393
02:20:10,359 --> 02:20:16,800
to for further the issue as well as

3394
02:20:13,879 --> 02:20:19,799
Advance the issue because I knew my

3395
02:20:16,799 --> 02:20:21,879
friends of color were not able to do so

3396
02:20:19,799 --> 02:20:24,920
so what did I do I hired my friends of

3397
02:20:21,879 --> 02:20:28,279
color I hire of all different color

3398
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:30,520
Creeds uh every spectrum of the rainbow

3399
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:34,079
uh we became a support network for many

3400
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:36,479
trans employees uh going each Direction

3401
02:20:34,079 --> 02:20:39,200
and it's been absolutely wonderful

3402
02:20:36,478 --> 02:20:41,719
embracing experience but you know early

3403
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:44,040
on we were activists we were all

3404
02:20:41,719 --> 02:20:47,920
expecting to get arrested every single

3405
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:51,640
day it wasn't until the laws changed

3406
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:54,000
that you know um so yeah I understand my

3407
02:20:51,639 --> 02:20:58,239
white privilege is there so what do I do

3408
02:20:54,000 --> 02:21:00,318
I Mentor many people uh for free because

3409
02:20:58,239 --> 02:21:03,159
I want them to learn and give the

3410
02:21:00,318 --> 02:21:05,199
opportunities and get the opportunities

3411
02:21:03,159 --> 02:21:07,239
that uh no they no longer have to

3412
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:10,920
trailblaze floor uh there's a whole

3413
02:21:07,239 --> 02:21:13,879
bunch of Now shortcuts we as we say we

3414
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:15,398
built the airplane while flying it so

3415
02:21:13,879 --> 02:21:17,398
you make a lot of mistakes you build

3416
02:21:15,398 --> 02:21:19,719
extra Wings you do all kinds of stupid

3417
02:21:17,398 --> 02:21:22,039
[ __ ] because again early on we hired

3418
02:21:19,719 --> 02:21:25,398
activists because because again any day

3419
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:27,520
we're all expecting to go to jail so now

3420
02:21:25,398 --> 02:21:29,760
20 years down the line that hasn't

3421
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:32,000
happened so we continue to send the

3422
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:35,200
elevator down through education through

3423
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:39,159
mentoring I uh contribute to Supernova

3424
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:41,200
women which is uh education as well as

3425
02:21:39,159 --> 02:21:43,760
uplifting women of color in our

3426
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,479
community and I mentored various uh

3427
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:50,120
people across various spectrums because

3428
02:21:46,478 --> 02:21:53,239
I feel it's a duty as operators for us

3429
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:56,479
to still Foster the environment that we

3430
02:21:53,239 --> 02:21:58,840
want to see that you want to see because

3431
02:21:56,478 --> 02:22:01,279
we have I Ste down from the national

3432
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:03,359
canvas Industries Association because I

3433
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:06,159
wanted more people of color and more

3434
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:09,239
diversity on there so I use my privilege

3435
02:22:06,159 --> 02:22:11,959
to step down to promote that okay so

3436
02:22:09,239 --> 02:22:15,600
there's a chance and it's it's no type

3437
02:22:11,959 --> 02:22:17,279
of guilt it's more of a realization that

3438
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:21,079
we have

3439
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:23,200
to be what we want the world to be we

3440
02:22:21,079 --> 02:22:25,359
never we were told 30 years ago it was

3441
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:27,880
never going to happen in our lifetimes

3442
02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:31,040
but here we are here we are doing what

3443
02:22:27,879 --> 02:22:33,318
we're doing and that law has changed is

3444
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:35,319
it perfect no we still have to work on

3445
02:22:33,318 --> 02:22:38,079
change here in California we had to

3446
02:22:35,318 --> 02:22:40,000
fight for S sp34 to get the ability to

3447
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:43,120
still give away free cannabis to people

3448
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,200
with low income okay uh and that was

3449
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:46,920
hard to get support around and to Rally

3450
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:49,359
people around because again people

3451
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:51,318
become complacent on business so these

3452
02:22:49,359 --> 02:22:54,280
are valid and real discussions that

3453
02:22:51,318 --> 02:22:57,639
should be had because we need diversity

3454
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:59,960
we need to not only have equality but we

3455
02:22:57,639 --> 02:23:02,398
have to have equity for those that were

3456
02:22:59,959 --> 02:23:05,438
most hurt we need black brown color

3457
02:23:02,398 --> 02:23:07,680
people veterans uh of all that have been

3458
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:10,120
hurt by this drug board to get a chance

3459
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:12,079
to get an equal footing because it's

3460
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:14,000
we're losing it fast these huge

3461
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:15,478
corporations coming out of Canada and

3462
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,840
these conglomerates building in the

3463
02:23:15,478 --> 02:23:19,478
United States that if we don't do

3464
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:20,960
something soon there's going to be no

3465
02:23:19,478 --> 02:23:23,920
opportunity because

3466
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:25,559
it's just going to be 71s and Walmarts

3467
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:29,079
you know what I'm saying of cannabis per

3468
02:23:25,559 --> 02:23:30,959
se as opposed to Mom and Pop operator so

3469
02:23:29,079 --> 02:23:32,559
that's kind of a niche of where we are

3470
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:34,239
and where we've had to be we had to risk

3471
02:23:32,559 --> 02:23:37,039
our freedoms to change law for

3472
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:38,760
dispensaries but soon or later

3473
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:40,520
dispensaries are going to be a thing of

3474
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:43,000
History you're going to be able to go to

3475
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:45,239
your Costco and get your low mid and

3476
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,159
high grade and they'll be specialty

3477
02:23:45,239 --> 02:23:50,680
shops and things needed for medical but

3478
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:53,200
you know I'll be honest and say we had

3479
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:56,120
our time we had our space but change is

3480
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:58,600
coming and we're now going to be so

3481
02:23:56,120 --> 02:24:02,279
normalized that we're going to be pushed

3482
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:03,920
out um of existence because we're no

3483
02:24:02,279 --> 02:24:07,000
longer pushing the envelope we're no

3484
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:08,639
longer risking ourselves we're accepted

3485
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:12,040
we we've changed the conversation

3486
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:14,358
forever so I'm fine with being obsolete

3487
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:17,640
because I know we've changed it

3488
02:24:14,359 --> 02:24:22,318
forever that's for long large Costco

3489
02:24:17,639 --> 02:24:24,318
siiz containers huh yeah why not I mean

3490
02:24:22,318 --> 02:24:26,719
they'll still be craft just like look

3491
02:24:24,318 --> 02:24:29,199
humbo and Medina will be just like Napa

3492
02:24:26,719 --> 02:24:30,519
they'll have their craft places but it's

3493
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:32,399
just going to become like that there'll

3494
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:34,920
be mail order will be normalized here

3495
02:24:32,398 --> 02:24:38,039
eventually in America and there'll be

3496
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:40,200
just Farms large enough to support mail

3497
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:42,399
order because they've got a unique

3498
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:45,479
amazing genetic they grow in an amazing

3499
02:24:42,398 --> 02:24:51,039
way etc etc it's just it's going to

3500
02:24:45,478 --> 02:24:51,039
become a normal commodity as much

3501
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:56,439
what it'll be and you'll become more

3502
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:59,279
skeptical of going to Costco for your

3503
02:24:56,439 --> 02:25:02,079
you know your big Costco uh but maybe

3504
02:24:59,279 --> 02:25:03,880
they'll have amazing weed back you know

3505
02:25:02,079 --> 02:25:06,398
then I don't know the quality is getting

3506
02:25:03,879 --> 02:25:08,159
better but you know the larger it gets

3507
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:09,879
it doesn't mean the better it gets so

3508
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:13,359
that's why we've always felt back on

3509
02:25:09,879 --> 02:25:15,199
Craft and why Napa Valley is so

3510
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:17,720
prominent still to this day and millions

3511
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:19,520
of people come through a year because

3512
02:25:17,719 --> 02:25:21,239
there's small wineries that do nothing

3513
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:22,760
but mail order or sell directly right

3514
02:25:21,239 --> 02:25:25,318
out of their Winery they don't need to

3515
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:27,439
sell to the large box stores whereas

3516
02:25:25,318 --> 02:25:29,760
people are scaling up to be in the box

3517
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:33,359
stores right now people are scaling up

3518
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:35,000
for interstate commerce right now so

3519
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:36,880
what does that make the mom and pop

3520
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:39,120
store when you've got these huge

3521
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:41,959
conglomerates that can literally buy up

3522
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:44,760
your entire State's dispensaries just

3523
02:25:41,959 --> 02:25:46,959
like that well so you know this brings

3524
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:48,960
up a good question you a thing I wanted

3525
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:50,879
to just talk about is is the idea of

3526
02:25:48,959 --> 02:25:52,839
standardizing cannabis because that's

3527
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:55,799
really what we're talking about in terms

3528
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:57,398
of scaling and Mark's Mark sc's touched

3529
02:25:55,799 --> 02:25:59,199
on this Dr Mark you've touched on this a

3530
02:25:57,398 --> 02:26:01,639
bunch where cgmp is going to be the

3531
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:03,279
thing and you know but I I think we're a

3532
02:26:01,639 --> 02:26:05,159
long ways away from this and I'd love to

3533
02:26:03,279 --> 02:26:07,359
hear Sam's thoughts on you know the

3534
02:26:05,159 --> 02:26:08,639
genetic aspect of this because if there

3535
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:10,399
you know when this gets Federal in

3536
02:26:08,639 --> 02:26:13,039
United States it's going to be a whole

3537
02:26:10,398 --> 02:26:14,559
new world of federal they're G to have

3538
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:17,680
varietal that are goingon to need to be

3539
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:18,959
certified it's going to be specific ways

3540
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:20,880
you're going to have to grow it they're

3541
02:26:18,959 --> 02:26:23,358
going to you know there's a lot of

3542
02:26:20,879 --> 02:26:27,159
checks and balances that I foresee us H

3543
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:29,239
having to to kind of get involved in in

3544
02:26:27,159 --> 02:26:31,680
in a new way just like we had to get

3545
02:26:29,239 --> 02:26:33,639
involved in testing in a new way and as

3546
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:35,120
a cultivator you've never had someone

3547
02:26:33,639 --> 02:26:38,239
tell you you can't sell your your

3548
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:40,359
cannabis before you just never never had

3549
02:26:38,239 --> 02:26:43,680
that or your hash or your extracts you

3550
02:26:40,359 --> 02:26:45,200
know like never had that so the

3551
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:47,960
ceiling's going to get I think is going

3552
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:50,240
to get even lower um and Tighter and the

3553
02:26:47,959 --> 02:26:52,879
box is going to get tighter and it's

3554
02:26:50,239 --> 02:26:54,639
it's going to come down to being really

3555
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:58,438
good at going through these the

3556
02:26:54,639 --> 02:27:01,920
navigating these cgmp slash you know

3557
02:26:58,439 --> 02:27:05,720
clean room slash you know whatever else

3558
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:07,239
you wanna want to call it um you know

3559
02:27:05,719 --> 02:27:09,199
rules that are going to be put in place

3560
02:27:07,239 --> 02:27:10,719
in regulations and I think that's where

3561
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:13,319
it's going to start separating like

3562
02:27:10,719 --> 02:27:15,920
Marcus has been saying the individuals

3563
02:27:13,318 --> 02:27:18,519
that really understand the processes and

3564
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:20,600
the the the in you know intricacies and

3565
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:23,200
the steps in between the steps versus is

3566
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:25,880
those who are you

3567
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:28,240
know just they you know it's really it's

3568
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:31,079
going to be hard so I I'd love to hear

3569
02:27:28,239 --> 02:27:32,398
Mark's thoughts on this and ATN like you

3570
02:27:31,079 --> 02:27:35,120
sounds like you you've already been

3571
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:36,559
thinking a lot about this you know as I

3572
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:38,000
have I've been kind of thinking about oh

3573
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:39,760
my gosh you know I've been here for two

3574
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,120
decades been you know over two decades

3575
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:43,800
working with this

3576
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:47,479
plant what does that mean for us in you

3577
02:27:43,799 --> 02:27:47,478
know in the next decade you

3578
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:54,880
know I I see dispens is becoming less

3579
02:27:51,079 --> 02:27:57,680
and less uh once normalization happens

3580
02:27:54,879 --> 02:28:01,318
why can't I mean right now in New York

3581
02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:03,279
bodegas are saying hey if they can sell

3582
02:28:01,318 --> 02:28:06,079
cigarettes and alcohol why can't they

3583
02:28:03,279 --> 02:28:08,560
sell cannabis as well you're totally

3584
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:10,239
right somebody is gonna test that water

3585
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:11,519
in one of these states because they're

3586
02:28:10,239 --> 02:28:14,239
all different Laboratories and

3587
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:18,279
somebody's gonna say yeah why not and

3588
02:28:14,239 --> 02:28:21,318
then it becomes normally and accepted so

3589
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:24,279
I I wish look I wish I could say we'll

3590
02:28:21,318 --> 02:28:27,318
be around forever but I think you know

3591
02:28:24,279 --> 02:28:29,960
if you really look at normalization and

3592
02:28:27,318 --> 02:28:32,000
acceptance of society where they're even

3593
02:28:29,959 --> 02:28:34,719
talking about here with the new

3594
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,000
politicians here in the US a more act

3595
02:28:34,719 --> 02:28:39,639
which will give us Banking and other

3596
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:43,239
things you got to look 20 years down the

3597
02:28:39,639 --> 02:28:45,358
line it's just like alcohol and tobacco

3598
02:28:43,239 --> 02:28:48,359
I can go down to my local 7-Eleven and

3599
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:51,040
pick up some You Know Jack herrer 20

3600
02:28:48,359 --> 02:28:53,680
pack or you know whatever you know as as

3601
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:56,840
frightening as that thought may be why

3602
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:58,800
can't that be an accepted normalization

3603
02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:01,040
we dreamed you know oh there would one

3604
02:28:58,799 --> 02:29:02,639
day be places you could go and buy pot

3605
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:04,040
but not only one kind of pot but

3606
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:07,239
different kinds of pot and we used to

3607
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:11,279
laugh and go that'll well it happened

3608
02:29:07,239 --> 02:29:13,920
and that because the risks are there so

3609
02:29:11,279 --> 02:29:17,120
if Society accepts it and every state

3610
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:20,159
now legalizes it why won't it be

3611
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:22,439
distributed but like ABC Stores or

3612
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:25,760
something like that because of the want

3613
02:29:22,439 --> 02:29:28,279
or need for the Taxation and how narrow

3614
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:30,279
those margins become because it's a race

3615
02:29:28,279 --> 02:29:32,640
the bottom because it's an agricultural

3616
02:29:30,279 --> 02:29:34,560
crop once these states come online

3617
02:29:32,639 --> 02:29:36,920
there's going to be some amazing growers

3618
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:39,278
in certain regions that are going to do

3619
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:42,639
amazing things on mass that are going to

3620
02:29:39,279 --> 02:29:44,720
be able to challenge the market at ways

3621
02:29:42,639 --> 02:29:47,079
that we've never seen before we're not

3622
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:50,719
there yet but I don't think we're a

3623
02:29:47,079 --> 02:29:54,478
decade away either

3624
02:29:50,719 --> 02:29:57,599
no I mean I yeah we're already seeing

3625
02:29:54,478 --> 02:30:00,239
CBD products being sold in convenience

3626
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:04,239
stores you know what what's going to

3627
02:30:00,239 --> 02:30:06,840
happen across North America especially

3628
02:30:04,239 --> 02:30:09,439
across the states is you're going right

3629
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:11,920
now a lot of the states are fragmented

3630
02:30:09,439 --> 02:30:15,639
in their state byst state regulation of

3631
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:18,120
THC products into the kind of Patchwork

3632
02:30:15,639 --> 02:30:21,959
framework of different state licenses

3633
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:21,960
that are either THC or CB

3634
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,439
as Federal Law changes I'm I'm have to

3635
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:29,319
assume that federal law will evolve in

3636
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:31,920
the similar fashion of the way the

3637
02:30:29,318 --> 02:30:35,478
Canadian it will first pass some sort of

3638
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:37,719
federal Interstate me medical and then

3639
02:30:35,478 --> 02:30:38,959
they'll pass some sort of federal

3640
02:30:37,719 --> 02:30:43,199
Interstate

3641
02:30:38,959 --> 02:30:46,159
recreational so they'll when they change

3642
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:47,800
THC can avonoids from schedule one to

3643
02:30:46,159 --> 02:30:50,559
either schedule two or preferably

3644
02:30:47,799 --> 02:30:53,000
schedule three or off the scheduling but

3645
02:30:50,559 --> 02:30:56,039
when they reschedule it it'll probably

3646
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:58,959
open up for the FDA to start regulating

3647
02:30:56,040 --> 02:31:01,359
any company that wants to do interstate

3648
02:30:58,959 --> 02:31:05,199
commerce that interstate commerce means

3649
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:07,279
that hey now I can sell to any state any

3650
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:09,640
consumer now I can ship to the east

3651
02:31:07,279 --> 02:31:12,600
coast as many people may have been doing

3652
02:31:09,639 --> 02:31:14,840
in the traditional Market but in order

3653
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:17,040
to get to that interstate commerce

3654
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:20,200
license you're going to have to be able

3655
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:23,399
to meet the fda's rules and requirements

3656
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:25,240
ments about cannabis and that kind of

3657
02:31:23,398 --> 02:31:27,079
depends on how they're going to regulate

3658
02:31:25,239 --> 02:31:29,159
it if it goes schedule two it's going to

3659
02:31:27,079 --> 02:31:32,520
have to be produced in essentially a

3660
02:31:29,159 --> 02:31:35,639
pharmaceutical facility if it's schedule

3661
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:38,760
three we hopefully we'll be able to have

3662
02:31:35,639 --> 02:31:40,879
food grade facilities here in Canada

3663
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:43,639
it's a gpp

3664
02:31:40,879 --> 02:31:46,839
facility which is much it's very similar

3665
02:31:43,639 --> 02:31:48,398
to a food grade facility just very

3666
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:50,920
heavily regulated on all the

3667
02:31:48,398 --> 02:31:53,119
documentation that we have for being

3668
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:55,040
able to sterilize every surface and

3669
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:56,680
clean every piece of equipment we have

3670
02:31:55,040 --> 02:32:00,160
to have every

3671
02:31:56,680 --> 02:32:02,120
sop PCP which is a preventive control

3672
02:32:00,159 --> 02:32:04,318
plan and a list of a dozen other

3673
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:06,120
documents on every piece of equipment

3674
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:08,199
the same thing's going to happen with

3675
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:10,439
that when the FDA gets involved in the

3676
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:13,680
states and when any other country starts

3677
02:32:10,439 --> 02:32:18,120
regulating inter provincial or

3678
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:19,479
Interstate sales so people who you know

3679
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:22,359
previously were blasting in their

3680
02:32:19,478 --> 02:32:24,079
backyard shed probably won't be able to

3681
02:32:22,359 --> 02:32:27,200
because they'll have to be able to prove

3682
02:32:24,079 --> 02:32:29,959
that they can clean that building so if

3683
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:31,960
you have a barn maybe you can renovate

3684
02:32:29,959 --> 02:32:34,039
that farm to a food grade

3685
02:32:31,959 --> 02:32:36,759
facility but you're going to have to be

3686
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:38,880
able to build build it in away and that

3687
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:41,478
you can actually show to The Regulators

3688
02:32:38,879 --> 02:32:43,920
that they can be sterilized in order to

3689
02:32:41,478 --> 02:32:46,318
minimize the risk of

3690
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:48,478
contaminations so there there will be

3691
02:32:46,318 --> 02:32:50,920
Pathways go ahead go

3692
02:32:48,478 --> 02:32:54,119
ahead there will Pathways is just going

3693
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:55,520
to be you know something that you know

3694
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:58,359
the first time that it's done is always

3695
02:32:55,520 --> 02:33:00,800
the most difficult and as as the

3696
02:32:58,359 --> 02:33:01,880
licenses open up that you know every I

3697
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:04,239
think everyone's going to be able to

3698
02:33:01,879 --> 02:33:06,478
learn from everyone else to be able to

3699
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:08,359
see that yes you know just like the wine

3700
02:33:06,478 --> 02:33:11,278
industry the Hops industry there are

3701
02:33:08,359 --> 02:33:14,880
ways that we can cultivate cannabis not

3702
02:33:11,279 --> 02:33:16,359
only on the the you know a small acreage

3703
02:33:14,879 --> 02:33:18,559
couple hundred plant scale but all the

3704
02:33:16,359 --> 02:33:21,760
way up to the HEC acre scales and do it

3705
02:33:18,559 --> 02:33:21,760
in a sustainable fashion

3706
02:33:23,079 --> 02:33:28,520
I just wanted to make sure that you know

3707
02:33:25,279 --> 02:33:30,560
it doesn't uh happen with to you know

3708
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:32,319
with cannabis what happened to Tobacco

3709
02:33:30,559 --> 02:33:34,199
you know you take this sacred plant that

3710
02:33:32,318 --> 02:33:36,119
every person grew that was good for the

3711
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:38,319
Earth that was used during

3712
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:41,640
ceremony and then you

3713
02:33:38,318 --> 02:33:44,478
just what we regulate it what everyone's

3714
02:33:41,639 --> 02:33:46,719
growing it what it's at all the stores

3715
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:49,398
what it has no life what it creates

3716
02:33:46,719 --> 02:33:51,879
cancer so I think that we as to in order

3717
02:33:49,398 --> 02:33:54,159
for to keep our Consciousness as we move

3718
02:33:51,879 --> 02:33:57,920
forward let's just make sure that

3719
02:33:54,159 --> 02:34:01,119
cannabis doesn't become Pharma to table

3720
02:33:57,920 --> 02:34:03,799
and then it keeps Farm to Table and that

3721
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:06,319
maybe if it does go big and it does go

3722
02:34:03,799 --> 02:34:08,719
box store and it does go all that way

3723
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:12,000
that's fine but it's going to be back to

3724
02:34:08,719 --> 02:34:14,438
the micro brew or the micro weed or the

3725
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,680
the the farmers market to where someone

3726
02:34:14,439 --> 02:34:20,120
that wants to stay with the intention

3727
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:23,318
and still provide something clean and

3728
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:26,600
and acceptable for use by humans can

3729
02:34:23,318 --> 02:34:28,600
still have that personal you know uh

3730
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:30,960
connection and maybe it's you know

3731
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:32,920
partly a tourism thing and it's more

3732
02:34:30,959 --> 02:34:34,799
experiential I think we can use our

3733
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:38,559
Gardens to heal people just walking

3734
02:34:34,799 --> 02:34:41,159
through them so as we move forward with

3735
02:34:38,559 --> 02:34:45,359
this legalization let's keep that that

3736
02:34:41,159 --> 02:34:48,039
space open for you know for the small

3737
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:50,640
scale cultivator to be able to continue

3738
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:53,520
to uphold like the because no matter

3739
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:56,639
what when you put it into a box you

3740
02:34:53,520 --> 02:35:00,880
know it may be inevitable and let's so

3741
02:34:56,639 --> 02:35:00,879
bold let's be so bold to say let's

3742
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:09,359
hold I hear a lot about like okay in

3743
02:35:07,159 --> 02:35:12,600
these signed ledgers and we've got our

3744
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:14,159
lawyers on it and this is a this is a

3745
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:15,920
conscious

3746
02:35:14,159 --> 02:35:19,959
Awakening

3747
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:23,239
miracle healing plant and that is so

3748
02:35:19,959 --> 02:35:27,398
alive in the Cannabis culture that it's

3749
02:35:23,239 --> 02:35:29,279
absolutely imperative that we as people

3750
02:35:27,398 --> 02:35:31,079
who have been the medicine makers and

3751
02:35:29,279 --> 02:35:35,800
the people who have gotten it to this

3752
02:35:31,079 --> 02:35:39,520
point still continue to push that um

3753
02:35:35,799 --> 02:35:42,438
rhetoric that that education that energy

3754
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:45,079
forward that you know we don't want to

3755
02:35:42,439 --> 02:35:48,520
Des sacred the plant in the way that

3756
02:35:45,079 --> 02:35:50,840
tobacco was like also and also we're as

3757
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:53,720
sketchy place and the Cannabis Community

3758
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:55,639
as we move forward internationally we're

3759
02:35:53,719 --> 02:35:58,039
also opening doorways for other

3760
02:35:55,639 --> 02:36:01,318
psychedelic plant medicine and we don't

3761
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:03,720
want psychedelic plant medicine to also

3762
02:36:01,318 --> 02:36:07,398
fall in the hands of Regulation and and

3763
02:36:03,719 --> 02:36:09,519
into the hands that goes away from the

3764
02:36:07,398 --> 02:36:11,599
origins of the magic of what it is and I

3765
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:15,359
think that that's awesome like we the

3766
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:16,920
medicine makers of cannabis do have an

3767
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:19,159
incredible

3768
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:21,239
responsibility of what is going to

3769
02:36:19,159 --> 02:36:24,079
happen plant medicine in the future like

3770
02:36:21,239 --> 02:36:27,318
Josh was just saying we are holding the

3771
02:36:24,079 --> 02:36:29,920
door open to many plant medicines in the

3772
02:36:27,318 --> 02:36:32,559
future and what's going to happen to

3773
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:35,520
these conscious raising plants they've

3774
02:36:32,559 --> 02:36:38,959
helped us so much in humanity gain

3775
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:42,479
traction on an Awakening of different

3776
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:45,799
levels um and here we are at another one

3777
02:36:42,478 --> 02:36:48,679
and I think that we need to um you know

3778
02:36:45,799 --> 02:36:50,959
uh carry that voice of of the

3779
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:52,800
spirituality of this plant as well

3780
02:36:50,959 --> 02:36:55,519
that's all and the sacred Commerce

3781
02:36:52,799 --> 02:36:57,559
that's totally amazing and so right on

3782
02:36:55,520 --> 02:37:00,520
that dialogue has to be woven into the

3783
02:36:57,559 --> 02:37:02,799
fabric of where this is headed and I get

3784
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:04,840
nervous that it's being left behind and

3785
02:37:02,799 --> 02:37:07,119
let's face it

3786
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:10,398
um corporate cannabis whatever you want

3787
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:13,840
to call this it the dry cure process is

3788
02:37:10,398 --> 02:37:15,760
is is so important and and we all can

3789
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:17,719
agree here you know out in the open

3790
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:20,079
market it's always the craft it's the

3791
02:37:17,719 --> 02:37:21,639
people that have that that deep

3792
02:37:20,079 --> 02:37:24,159
understanding of the process and that

3793
02:37:21,639 --> 02:37:26,599
connection with the plant spiritually

3794
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:28,639
that allows it to to Really resonate in

3795
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:30,720
terms of of its flavor profile the

3796
02:37:28,639 --> 02:37:32,840
timing in which they're they're dry

3797
02:37:30,719 --> 02:37:34,920
curing it and and how it's trimmed and

3798
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:37,200
when it's trimmed and all the steps in

3799
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:40,318
the process and that's a deep connection

3800
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:43,520
that goes beyond any sop Beyond any type

3801
02:37:40,318 --> 02:37:45,199
of title uh any paycheck and and

3802
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:47,040
anything that goes along with any of the

3803
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:49,040
things that we call an industry if you

3804
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:51,200
will it has nothing to do with an

3805
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:53,520
industry in industry is something that

3806
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:56,200
we're as humans trying to better

3807
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:57,960
understand to call it something and and

3808
02:37:56,200 --> 02:38:00,439
let's just face it guys it's passion

3809
02:37:57,959 --> 02:38:03,519
that that that is the Cornerstone of all

3810
02:38:00,439 --> 02:38:07,960
of this it's not a paycheck it's not an

3811
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:10,960
industry the industry is a human minded

3812
02:38:07,959 --> 02:38:13,559
creation that's ever evolving and

3813
02:38:10,959 --> 02:38:16,478
changing because humans are ever

3814
02:38:13,559 --> 02:38:19,719
evolving and changing in this weird mind

3815
02:38:16,478 --> 02:38:23,119
that we create on what standards are at

3816
02:38:19,719 --> 02:38:26,519
one particular time but this plant is

3817
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:29,040
constant it's here for us yes we are of

3818
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:31,880
course interacting with it we are of

3819
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:34,240
course changing maybe its frequency

3820
02:38:31,879 --> 02:38:38,239
level but this is a plant that's been

3821
02:38:34,239 --> 02:38:40,520
here you know for an incredibly long

3822
02:38:38,239 --> 02:38:42,520
time all the way to where we have an

3823
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:46,880
endoc canabo

3824
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:50,800
system that you know there needs to be

3825
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:53,159
some kind of a a respect in in that also

3826
02:38:50,799 --> 02:38:53,159

3839
02:39:28,799 --> 02:39:31,840
love to jump in kind of just on this

3840
02:39:30,318 --> 02:39:33,600
thought too you know I mean and I I did

3841
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:36,318
mention kind of a bit of this last week

3842
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:38,318
I believe but you know kind of it's

3843
02:39:36,318 --> 02:39:39,959
fascinating that you know with

3844
02:39:38,318 --> 02:39:41,959
prohibition ending and all the money

3845
02:39:39,959 --> 02:39:45,438
coming in and all everybody trying to

3846
02:39:41,959 --> 02:39:48,199
come and find their stake in this new

3847
02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:50,439
industry you know um it's it's

3848
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:52,200
fascinating and how different it is from

3849
02:39:50,439 --> 02:39:54,159
alcohol because you know with alcohol

3850
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:56,840
you know when prohibition ended you know

3851
02:39:54,159 --> 02:39:58,959
there was the development of the big you

3852
02:39:56,840 --> 02:40:02,040
know kind of you know however many

3853
02:39:58,959 --> 02:40:04,119
decades and decades later that the craft

3854
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:06,399
bu and the craft industry Spirit

3855
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:09,120
industry really started thriving you

3856
02:40:06,398 --> 02:40:11,439
know but with cannabis you know there's

3857
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:13,439
you know with prohibition ending there's

3858
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:15,680
this effort for corporate coming in

3859
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:17,760
consolidation to occur simultaneously

3860
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:19,639
with the development of craft industry

3861
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:21,000
but you know like just to the higher

3862
02:40:19,639 --> 02:40:24,000
intelligence of the plant you know

3863
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:26,318
there's so much um you know there's so

3864
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:28,760
so many barriers to the barriers of

3865
02:40:26,318 --> 02:40:30,920
Entry that the plant itself puts up for

3866
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:35,000
people to even succeed in working with

3867
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:37,239
it if you haven't like spent your you so

3868
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:39,520
much of your own time and passion you

3869
02:40:37,239 --> 02:40:41,559
know like appreciating it and coming to

3870
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:43,359
respect it you know in all the different

3871
02:40:41,559 --> 02:40:46,079
lessons the plant will teach us and

3872
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:48,279
cultivation and hash making and and so

3873
02:40:46,079 --> 02:40:49,840
the the the builtup like tribal

3874
02:40:48,279 --> 02:40:52,479
Knowledge from the C culture and from

3875
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:55,079
the craft industry is something that you

3876
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:56,799
know you can't just learn you know and

3877
02:40:55,079 --> 02:40:59,120
and and so you see kind of

3878
02:40:56,799 --> 02:41:00,759
simultaneously with you know everybody

3879
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:02,760
going licensed and kind of you know

3880
02:41:00,760 --> 02:41:04,318
Finding their way in this new space you

3881
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:05,520
know there's a lot of fear that that

3882
02:41:04,318 --> 02:41:07,359
it's going to be like alcohol and

3883
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:10,399
there's just going to consolidate a few

3884
02:41:07,359 --> 02:41:12,399
Brands and all this but you know I you

3885
02:41:10,398 --> 02:41:13,959
know just just kind of pointing out from

3886
02:41:12,398 --> 02:41:16,559
the testing side of things it's like you

3887
02:41:13,959 --> 02:41:19,919
know I've seen some of the the

3888
02:41:16,559 --> 02:41:22,079
most the largest in and most like

3889
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:24,279
catastrophic fails happen from like a

3890
02:41:22,079 --> 02:41:27,000
lot of the biggest money people coming

3891
02:41:24,279 --> 02:41:29,439
in just you know recklessly thinking

3892
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:31,279
they're just going to come take over the

3893
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:33,040
plant take over the industry but they

3894
02:41:31,279 --> 02:41:34,640
plant you know puts them in their place

3895
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:37,120
and and so many of the people that are

3896
02:41:34,639 --> 02:41:39,519
growing around EGS it's all kind of

3897
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:41,720
popping dirty you know and and and in

3898
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:43,560
the same while all the farmers in

3899
02:41:41,719 --> 02:41:45,278
Northern California and around areas

3900
02:41:43,559 --> 02:41:46,959
that have preserved the craft and the

3901
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:48,640
Integrity of this plant and not poison

3902
02:41:46,959 --> 02:41:51,239
their land and poison the environment

3903
02:41:48,639 --> 02:41:52,799
they're in this market where there's I

3904
02:41:51,239 --> 02:41:55,159
mean everybody's looking for clean

3905
02:41:52,799 --> 02:41:57,840
abundant quality material to make into

3906
02:41:55,159 --> 02:42:00,559
products and and jar up and to you do

3907
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:02,639
all the things um but but for what it's

3908
02:42:00,559 --> 02:42:04,478
worth it's a it's a unicorn you know

3909
02:42:02,639 --> 02:42:06,760
there you the amount of material that's

3910
02:42:04,478 --> 02:42:09,920
out in the market you know that's being

3911
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:12,760
cultivated in these areas that are dirty

3912
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:14,520
is is greatly exceeds the the clean

3913
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:17,719
Supply and

3914
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:19,439
so you know I I I mean I hope it's not

3915
02:42:17,719 --> 02:42:21,318
naive to think but I feel like

3916
02:42:19,439 --> 02:42:22,359
ultimately you know like you know

3917
02:42:21,318 --> 02:42:24,199
because everybody wants you know it's

3918
02:42:22,359 --> 02:42:26,479
like it's stain your lane and in your

3919
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:29,319
Zone and don't get like freaked out by

3920
02:42:26,478 --> 02:42:29,318
like the fact that

3921
02:42:41,559 --> 02:42:47,559
there's you're breaking up pal break

3922
02:42:45,398 --> 02:42:49,358
up take over this plan have the

3923
02:42:47,559 --> 02:42:53,199
knowledge you know that you do and might

3924
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:55,279
you know but but I I see oh not an easy

3925
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:57,319
plant to learn unless you really respect

3926
02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:59,279
and and I'm just yeah just just wanted

3927
02:42:57,318 --> 02:43:00,920
to make the point that you know I think

3928
02:42:59,279 --> 02:43:03,000
the plant's intelligence is going to

3929
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:04,960
serve us and and for those that have

3930
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:07,318
been in service to this plant all their

3931
02:43:04,959 --> 02:43:09,438
life there's I I feel deeply that

3932
02:43:07,318 --> 02:43:10,959
there's the plant's got your back you

3933
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:13,239
know as long as you just keep your

3934
02:43:10,959 --> 02:43:15,438
passion and find your way and don't get

3935
02:43:13,239 --> 02:43:17,520
freaked out about the corporate agendas

3936
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:19,960
and all this because it's not like

3937
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:22,079
they're figuring out any quicker and if

3938
02:43:19,959 --> 02:43:24,799
anything their levels of face plant are

3939
02:43:22,079 --> 02:43:26,799
that much such a greater magnitude that

3940
02:43:24,799 --> 02:43:28,759
you know are crippling in a lot in so

3941
02:43:26,799 --> 02:43:30,318
many of the cases and so yeah I just got

3942
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:32,159
a lot of trust and faith that the

3943
02:43:30,318 --> 02:43:34,318
plant's going to have our back and that

3944
02:43:32,159 --> 02:43:36,639
the craft farmers and the craft Artisan

3945
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:39,439
producers are going to find their way as

3946
02:43:36,639 --> 02:43:41,439
long as they keep their passion and push

3947
02:43:39,439 --> 02:43:43,279
forward seems like at least here in

3948
02:43:41,439 --> 02:43:44,920
British Columbia more and more happening

3949
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:47,800
I see people that I know that are

3950
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:50,439
getting their um you know micro licenses

3951
02:43:47,799 --> 02:43:53,159
I saw Patrick uh one of our glass

3952
02:43:50,439 --> 02:43:54,880
blowers who got his license recently and

3953
02:43:53,159 --> 02:43:56,600
he was just blowing glass one day and

3954
02:43:54,879 --> 02:43:58,199
the next you know he was announcing that

3955
02:43:56,600 --> 02:44:00,000
he was building out his facility and

3956
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:02,600
that he got his license and I was just

3957
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:04,680
so happy to see that I know the great

3958
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:07,000
Gardener working on the same thing with

3959
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:10,079
Kirk Toad and it seems like there are

3960
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:12,040
people who are are getting through and I

3961
02:44:10,079 --> 02:44:14,239
know those are the people that will kind

3962
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:15,760
of help the next group of people you

3963
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:17,760
know where it's like it's not this fear

3964
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:20,359
and scarcity Vibe where it's like if we

3965
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:22,559
make it down a path way people are

3966
02:44:20,359 --> 02:44:24,399
pretty much happy to share uh you know

3967
02:44:22,559 --> 02:44:26,680
the the methods of of how they did it

3968
02:44:24,398 --> 02:44:29,000
and how they got there and from a

3969
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:31,479
processing standpoint we're very excited

3970
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:34,040
to uh you know find more and more

3971
02:44:31,478 --> 02:44:36,119
relationships with craft Growers because

3972
02:44:34,040 --> 02:44:38,160
um they grow exceptional quality

3973
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:40,279
cannabis they get their tpin up there a

3974
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:41,879
little higher than some of the tpine

3975
02:44:40,279 --> 02:44:44,040
contents we're seeing out of the large

3976
02:44:41,879 --> 02:44:46,478
license production facilities and it's

3977
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:48,560
uh we're excited to see all these great

3978
02:44:46,478 --> 02:44:49,599
Growers that we've known for you know

3979
02:44:48,559 --> 02:44:52,478
decades

3980
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:54,439
slowly making the the the that switch

3981
02:44:52,478 --> 02:44:57,079
and it's not an easy switch you know I

3982
02:44:54,439 --> 02:44:58,760
know that uh Kelly and and Josh

3983
02:44:57,079 --> 02:45:00,600
mentioned it earlier you know is it an

3984
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:02,120
industry we want to be a part of in that

3985
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:05,399
particular or do we want to you know and

3986
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:08,000
it's it's very much a fence sitting

3987
02:45:05,398 --> 02:45:11,439
position but it's very much the human

3988
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:13,159
nature to consistently divide and if you

3989
02:45:11,439 --> 02:45:15,200
just take the fence away you realize

3990
02:45:13,159 --> 02:45:16,680
you're actually just in a field of grass

3991
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:18,600
and it's kind of green over there and

3992
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:21,279
it's kind of green over there and you

3993
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:23,800
have a lot more motion to move and you

3994
02:45:21,279 --> 02:45:27,560
can tap into a lot more people if you

3995
02:45:23,799 --> 02:45:31,559
just take that fence down and just uh

3996
02:45:27,559 --> 02:45:35,359
justk isn't it true in Canada right now

3997
02:45:31,559 --> 02:45:38,760
there's a surplus of 1 million pounds on

3998
02:45:35,359 --> 02:45:41,120
the Shelf of the of the

3999
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:43,398
producers it's definitely possible if

4000
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:45,079
you're producing sub quality Canabis and

4001
02:45:43,398 --> 02:45:47,039
you're trying to race to the bottom and

4002
02:45:45,079 --> 02:45:49,520
produce cannabis that has you know like

4003
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:52,279
less than a percentage of tpin it's just

4004
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:54,200
not very exciting and flavor not to

4005
02:45:52,279 --> 02:45:58,040
mention if it sits in your Vault for a

4006
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:59,680
year and you lose that 7% Tarpin that

4007
02:45:58,040 --> 02:46:02,120
you actually had there and now it's

4008
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:04,398
basically distillate sitting on a plant

4009
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:07,000
you know di diluted distillate on a on a

4010
02:46:04,398 --> 02:46:09,559
plant matter um but you know that that

4011
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:11,719
doesn't surprise me it's kind of like

4012
02:46:09,559 --> 02:46:13,199
there's always been a surplus of Swag

4013
02:46:11,719 --> 02:46:17,199
you know

4014
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:19,439
also the more and more of the Canadian

4015
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:24,640
uh total that's produced

4016
02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:27,680
under licenses uh is grown Outdoors

4017
02:46:24,639 --> 02:46:29,159
now yeah there that's true too a couple

4018
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:31,040
of key companies just got some big

4019
02:46:29,159 --> 02:46:33,359
outdoor licenses just a couple of years

4020
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:35,479
ago and that really you know you saw 10

4021
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:38,239
acres here and five acres there and then

4022
02:46:35,478 --> 02:46:40,159
all of a sudden 48 North did 77 Acres

4023
02:46:38,239 --> 02:46:41,879
which was unbelievable I talked to the

4024
02:46:40,159 --> 02:46:45,318
kid who planted all those plants he

4025
02:46:41,879 --> 02:46:46,879
wasn't even 30 years old he popped like

4026
02:46:45,318 --> 02:46:49,439
228,000

4027
02:46:46,879 --> 02:46:51,199
seedlings and and like I just to give

4028
02:46:49,439 --> 02:46:52,639
and he was like you know and I walked

4029
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:54,279
through the field and some of it didn't

4030
02:46:52,639 --> 02:46:55,680
look that good and some of it did look

4031
02:46:54,279 --> 02:46:58,079
good and of course people were you know

4032
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:59,439
slamming all over them I actually you

4033
02:46:58,079 --> 02:47:00,879
know it was one of the things because

4034
02:46:59,439 --> 02:47:02,520
Josh and Kelly aren't in the industry

4035
02:47:00,879 --> 02:47:04,398
and when I went to visit that facility

4036
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:05,800
instead of like taking a bunch of

4037
02:47:04,398 --> 02:47:07,760
pictures and Blasting them on the

4038
02:47:05,799 --> 02:47:09,599
internet I thought I'll try to help this

4039
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:11,239
company there's a few key things and I

4040
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:13,920
hooked them up with Shawn from Los

4041
02:47:11,239 --> 02:47:16,719
Gardens and I was like sea is like Dem

4042
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:19,799
pure certified he's willing to help he

4043
02:47:16,719 --> 02:47:22,318
lives less than an hour away maybe

4044
02:47:19,799 --> 02:47:24,719
this is a way to sort of build a bridge

4045
02:47:22,318 --> 02:47:26,639
and help a company rather than like kind

4046
02:47:24,719 --> 02:47:28,438
of pour gas on it light it and then sit

4047
02:47:26,639 --> 02:47:30,959
there and enjoy it while it burns down

4048
02:47:28,439 --> 02:47:32,720
to the ground so I just sort of thought

4049
02:47:30,959 --> 02:47:34,719
like well why don't we just kind of help

4050
02:47:32,719 --> 02:47:37,199
the company and it's easy to be a critic

4051
02:47:34,719 --> 02:47:39,519
but it's kind of like I think it's

4052
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:41,279
better to help and to kind of like get

4053
02:47:39,520 --> 02:47:43,680
that information that Josh and Kelly are

4054
02:47:41,279 --> 02:47:45,960
sitting on and I always am begging them

4055
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:47,720
try to figure out a way to get involved

4056
02:47:45,959 --> 02:47:49,759
within this system because the system

4057
02:47:47,719 --> 02:47:51,559
really needs you and the change that

4058
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:53,559
you're doing outside of the system is

4059
02:47:51,559 --> 02:47:55,600
incredible but the change that you could

4060
02:47:53,559 --> 02:47:59,119
do within the system system

4061
02:47:55,600 --> 02:48:01,520
systematically like that is to me I

4062
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:03,720
think it would be substantial and that's

4063
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:05,640
kind of what I'm trying to do myself

4064
02:48:03,719 --> 02:48:08,039
thank you that's awesome and I think I

4065
02:48:05,639 --> 02:48:10,879
just wanted to you know be a little bit

4066
02:48:08,040 --> 02:48:14,520
more accurate with language is that

4067
02:48:10,879 --> 02:48:18,199
we're here to help the plant we're not

4068
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:20,800
necessarily here to help the system so

4069
02:48:18,200 --> 02:48:22,760
are we going to continue to be a voice

4070
02:48:20,799 --> 02:48:25,959
for the plant we're going to continue to

4071
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:28,600
educate for the plant we're not really

4072
02:48:25,959 --> 02:48:31,599
interested necessarily in educating or

4073
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:34,399
helping out the system because it's ever

4074
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:36,079
changing us entering in the system is

4075
02:48:34,398 --> 02:48:38,879
we're entering in the system with just

4076
02:48:36,079 --> 02:48:41,879
like you said bits and pieces of

4077
02:48:38,879 --> 02:48:45,239
education and and as far as like burning

4078
02:48:41,879 --> 02:48:48,000
down another facility that's growing the

4079
02:48:45,239 --> 02:48:51,318
real question is is if we're helping the

4080
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:54,398
plant and not the system of course we

4081
02:48:51,318 --> 02:48:58,119
would come in and educate that huge

4082
02:48:54,398 --> 02:49:00,478
massive organization or LP or whatever

4083
02:48:58,120 --> 02:49:03,680
you want to call it that's really having

4084
02:49:00,478 --> 02:49:06,079
a wrongful relationship with this plant

4085
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:08,359
having a hard time cultivating it this

4086
02:49:06,079 --> 02:49:12,239
is where we can step in and say oh well

4087
02:49:08,359 --> 02:49:13,520
our true Alliance is with the plant and

4088
02:49:12,239 --> 02:49:16,279
and I think that we're just going to

4089
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:18,760
continue to have that pure alliance with

4090
02:49:16,279 --> 02:49:21,238
the plant rather than have an alliance

4091
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:23,840
with this ever changing system and

4092
02:49:21,238 --> 02:49:26,159
that's all and and I love that point

4093
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:28,238
Thank you and then that's why I value

4094
02:49:26,159 --> 02:49:30,159
the show Marcus and again just thank you

4095
02:49:28,238 --> 02:49:31,478
for putting this on because it's these

4096
02:49:30,159 --> 02:49:33,439
conversations you know there's a little

4097
02:49:31,478 --> 02:49:36,238
bit of everything happening so we get to

4098
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:38,159
all see what's happening and I like that

4099
02:49:36,238 --> 02:49:40,318
there's people in different areas of the

4100
02:49:38,159 --> 02:49:41,879
world and different areas so that we get

4101
02:49:40,318 --> 02:49:44,439
to share our experience and I consider

4102
02:49:41,879 --> 02:49:45,879
it the richness of the show so I thank

4103
02:49:44,439 --> 02:49:48,760
you for this conversation and our

4104
02:49:45,879 --> 02:49:50,599
experience with the plant is awesome

4105
02:49:48,760 --> 02:49:53,359
because with den piure and what Josh and

4106
02:49:50,600 --> 02:49:56,399
I do is we're having a global experience

4107
02:49:53,359 --> 02:50:00,439
with the plant we can't be caught in one

4108
02:49:56,398 --> 02:50:04,079
US system one Canadian system one

4109
02:50:00,439 --> 02:50:06,760
Australian system one Brazilian system

4110
02:50:04,079 --> 02:50:08,840
we have to incorporate all of what

4111
02:50:06,760 --> 02:50:11,840
humanity is going through and still

4112
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:14,719
continue the education forward and the

4113
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:17,238
in the information you know dedicated to

4114
02:50:14,719 --> 02:50:20,358
the plant because the systems like I

4115
02:50:17,238 --> 02:50:22,959
said are Ever Changing so so that's our

4116
02:50:20,359 --> 02:50:24,840
Focus very well said and I appreciate

4117
02:50:22,959 --> 02:50:27,119
your perspective absolutely and it is

4118
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:30,279
definitely a language thing for sure I

4119
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:31,840
just uh you know and you are helping

4120
02:50:30,279 --> 02:50:33,640
within the system because the people

4121
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:35,439
you're helping are choosing to work

4122
02:50:33,639 --> 02:50:37,799
within that system and they're bringing

4123
02:50:35,439 --> 02:50:40,680
some of that information to the system

4124
02:50:37,799 --> 02:50:42,840
and it's uh it is what it is you know um

4125
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:45,639
I I just love cannabis I want it to be

4126
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:47,559
successful regardless of I want my

4127
02:50:45,639 --> 02:50:50,079
mother to be able to buy her medicine

4128
02:50:47,559 --> 02:50:51,680
online the way she prefers to you know

4129
02:50:50,079 --> 02:50:52,920
she doesn't want to go to dispensaries

4130
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:55,040
she doesn't want to go to the gray

4131
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:56,719
Market she likes to just go to a company

4132
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:57,920
that she can look up and see the people

4133
02:50:56,719 --> 02:51:00,238
that work there and know that it's

4134
02:50:57,920 --> 02:51:02,760
getting tested and all of these things

4135
02:51:00,238 --> 02:51:06,600
and there are millions of people like

4136
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:08,159
her and without that particular system

4137
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:10,040
they would be left out in the cold and

4138
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:12,159
there's a there's an enormous amount of

4139
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:14,000
systems you know in that sense it's not

4140
02:51:12,159 --> 02:51:16,439
just a Canadian and a Brazilian it's

4141
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:19,799
just all of these you know platforms

4142
02:51:16,439 --> 02:51:21,600
that the plant is finding itself in uh

4143
02:51:19,799 --> 02:51:23,519
it's very you know it used to be in a

4144
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:25,760
Prohibition platform and believe it or

4145
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:28,359
not we all supported that system whether

4146
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:30,238
we like to admit it or not it was the

4147
02:51:28,359 --> 02:51:32,238
system we we worked within it was the

4148
02:51:30,238 --> 02:51:34,238
Prohibition system it was the system we

4149
02:51:32,238 --> 02:51:36,600
had to work within and I'm I'm certain

4150
02:51:34,238 --> 02:51:40,079
it's the system that allowed cannabis to

4151
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:42,760
be sold for five and six and 7,000 usar

4152
02:51:40,079 --> 02:51:45,398
a pound in places like Manhattan and Los

4153
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:48,079
Angeles you know that was the system and

4154
02:51:45,398 --> 02:51:49,799
now it's not kind of the system anymore

4155
02:51:48,079 --> 02:51:51,439
and it's sort of changing and there are

4156
02:51:49,799 --> 02:51:53,278
growing pains and some people are

4157
02:51:51,439 --> 02:51:55,238
feeling a little like the grounds moving

4158
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:57,720
out from under them kind of like the

4159
02:51:55,238 --> 02:51:59,639
home dealer felt when the dispensaries

4160
02:51:57,719 --> 02:52:02,278
came out you know the BC Compassion Club

4161
02:51:59,639 --> 02:52:04,599
and all of these spots had no idea they

4162
02:52:02,279 --> 02:52:07,000
were going to absolutely decimate the

4163
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:08,479
home dealer the mom and pop dealers that

4164
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:11,279
were just sitting at home paying their

4165
02:52:08,478 --> 02:52:13,358
mortgage by selling eights they couldn't

4166
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:15,040
compete with dispensaries there's 25

4167
02:52:13,359 --> 02:52:16,680
different kinds of weed at at's

4168
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:18,640
dispensary there's like 30 different

4169
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:21,000
kinds of concentrates he had put all

4170
02:52:18,639 --> 02:52:22,959
that stuff into one amazing place and he

4171
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:25,279
created this incredible environment for

4172
02:52:22,959 --> 02:52:27,478
people to come to but on the flip side

4173
02:52:25,279 --> 02:52:29,600
there were probably a lot of people in

4174
02:52:27,478 --> 02:52:32,159
that area that were selling weed that

4175
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:33,880
suddenly that dried up for them so there

4176
02:52:32,159 --> 02:52:36,359
goes another you know one system comes

4177
02:52:33,879 --> 02:52:38,398
into place another system dries up and

4178
02:52:36,359 --> 02:52:40,000
it just keeps going and going and going

4179
02:52:38,398 --> 02:52:42,318
and all we can do is try and stay

4180
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:45,238
conscious and try and make sure that we

4181
02:52:42,318 --> 02:52:47,959
you know direct this in some form or

4182
02:52:45,238 --> 02:52:50,359
another that is you know like Kelly and

4183
02:52:47,959 --> 02:52:53,438
Josh are saying like plant-based for the

4184
02:52:50,359 --> 02:52:55,359
for the plant actually they showed up in

4185
02:52:53,439 --> 02:52:59,600
our lounge and would sell it in our

4186
02:52:55,359 --> 02:53:02,200
smoking Lounge so you know you'd be

4187
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:04,559
amazed dog you know uh they're still

4188
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:06,920
resourceful the traditional Market

4189
02:53:04,559 --> 02:53:10,478
remains traditionally unique and will

4190
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:12,799
always find ways to survive no matter

4191
02:53:10,478 --> 02:53:16,238
what happens no matter what transpired I

4192
02:53:12,799 --> 02:53:19,959
mean look 80% of the regulated market

4193
02:53:16,238 --> 02:53:23,000
prior to 64 disappeared you know and is

4194
02:53:19,959 --> 02:53:25,238
now back in the traditional market so

4195
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:29,719
the traditional Market is way bigger

4196
02:53:25,238 --> 02:53:31,318
than the the legal Market hands down and

4197
02:53:29,719 --> 02:53:34,719
that's not changing anytime

4198
02:53:31,318 --> 02:53:38,359
soon so being a scientist I try to

4199
02:53:34,719 --> 02:53:41,079
understand systems right in in in in

4200
02:53:38,359 --> 02:53:44,200
general and and and what I can tell you

4201
02:53:41,079 --> 02:53:48,238
is that yeah systems are a man-made

4202
02:53:44,200 --> 02:53:52,680
construct but that they can evolve Kelly

4203
02:53:48,238 --> 02:53:58,000
and so like humans can steer a system so

4204
02:53:52,680 --> 02:54:01,520
we can steer a system because we are the

4205
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:04,000
system if you think about it like yeah

4206
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:06,880
so like people have asked this before

4207
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:08,920
you know the Cannabis industry you know

4208
02:54:06,879 --> 02:54:11,679
industry I always thought of like as a

4209
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:14,840
kid as like you know the Industrial

4210
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:18,439
Revolution like smoke stacks and

4211
02:54:14,840 --> 02:54:21,880
factories and workers and Unions that's

4212
02:54:18,439 --> 02:54:24,318
that's industry the Cannabis industry is

4213
02:54:21,879 --> 02:54:27,318
really Just an Illusion if you think

4214
02:54:24,318 --> 02:54:29,039
about it because all it is is we're okay

4215
02:54:27,318 --> 02:54:31,439
like Colin said yeah we're attracted to

4216
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:33,120
the plant and like our passion for the

4217
02:54:31,439 --> 02:54:35,920
plant gets pulled through and these

4218
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:37,479
products and I think at some point like

4219
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:41,879
Marcus

4220
02:54:37,478 --> 02:54:44,398
made a a some hash right and he's like

4221
02:54:41,879 --> 02:54:46,278
man this is really good and his friends

4222
02:54:44,398 --> 02:54:49,199
all got around and it's like that's

4223
02:54:46,279 --> 02:54:52,200
really really good hash boy boy wouldn't

4224
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:54,880
it be great to someday produce this and

4225
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:57,600
bring this to the masses and the thing

4226
02:54:54,879 --> 02:55:00,799
when we were talking about cgmp so just

4227
02:54:57,600 --> 02:55:04,040
so everyone knows GMP stands for good

4228
02:55:00,799 --> 02:55:06,879
manufacturing uh practices and C there's

4229
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:09,399
usually a little prefix of C before that

4230
02:55:06,879 --> 02:55:11,599
and little C stands for current because

4231
02:55:09,398 --> 02:55:13,599
those are constantly changing like

4232
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:15,479
systems they're constantly changing yes

4233
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:18,159
there's systems that are in place but

4234
02:55:15,478 --> 02:55:21,679
ultimately these are systems constructed

4235
02:55:18,159 --> 02:55:25,200
by by humans run by humans and for the

4236
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:28,238
benefit of humans and so when I think of

4237
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:30,359
cgmp we we think of it in the industry

4238
02:55:28,238 --> 02:55:32,359
in the industry there you go again the

4239
02:55:30,359 --> 02:55:34,760
people who work in this business as

4240
02:55:32,359 --> 02:55:37,359
being something related to Quality and

4241
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:40,120
quality control and safety but what I

4242
02:55:37,359 --> 02:55:43,079
can tell you is that the owners the

4243
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:45,720
people who who own these businesses the

4244
02:55:43,079 --> 02:55:48,398
shareholders what they think of when

4245
02:55:45,719 --> 02:55:51,278
they think about cgmp

4246
02:55:48,398 --> 02:55:53,559
is risk management right so if they're

4247
02:55:51,279 --> 02:55:55,600
going to be producing a product and

4248
02:55:53,559 --> 02:55:58,000
they're going to be producing X

4249
02:55:55,600 --> 02:56:00,520
kilograms of that product and that's a

4250
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:04,000
lot of money and a lot of Labor and a

4251
02:56:00,520 --> 02:56:06,600
lot of electricity and a huge investment

4252
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:09,398
going into making this product what they

4253
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:11,238
want to what they want to run the the

4254
02:56:09,398 --> 02:56:13,920
what they don't want to run the risk of

4255
02:56:11,238 --> 02:56:15,879
is that product all fouling or that

4256
02:56:13,920 --> 02:56:18,318
product not meeting a labor requirement

4257
02:56:15,879 --> 02:56:21,199
or for some reason that product not

4258
02:56:18,318 --> 02:56:24,039
being able to deliver the intended value

4259
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:25,520
that it was so the people who own these

4260
02:56:24,040 --> 02:56:28,439
businesses who are putting the

4261
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:32,359
investment into good manufacturing

4262
02:56:28,439 --> 02:56:35,760
practices are doing so for the

4263
02:56:32,359 --> 02:56:39,318
management of risk and really when we

4264
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:43,159
get Marcus's product someday imported

4265
02:56:39,318 --> 02:56:45,959
into the United States or perhaps maybe

4266
02:56:43,159 --> 02:56:49,000
the the better uh production model would

4267
02:56:45,959 --> 02:56:52,358
be Marcus's business

4268
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:55,600
licenses that production process and

4269
02:56:52,359 --> 02:56:58,279
Mike and his crew come down to various

4270
02:56:55,600 --> 02:57:01,318
operations that are licensed producers

4271
02:56:58,279 --> 02:57:05,319
in the United States to produce that

4272
02:57:01,318 --> 02:57:08,840
spec bubble hash in Marcus's process so

4273
02:57:05,318 --> 02:57:12,318
ultimately when that's made in a cgmp

4274
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:15,960
process all of the quality control that

4275
02:57:12,318 --> 02:57:18,398
went into developing the process for the

4276
02:57:15,959 --> 02:57:21,398
release of that product to the Canadian

4277
02:57:18,398 --> 02:57:24,079
Market will be duplicated in the United

4278
02:57:21,398 --> 02:57:25,920
States Market in a way again where it's

4279
02:57:24,079 --> 02:57:27,279
kind of like it's interesting because

4280
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:31,799
Mike West was talking about the

4281
02:57:27,279 --> 02:57:35,040
parallels of the of hops and in many way

4282
02:57:31,799 --> 02:57:38,079
the the alcohol industry is parallel to

4283
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:41,479
the to the Cannabis industry in that

4284
02:57:38,079 --> 02:57:44,120
they're growing a crop you know grapes

4285
02:57:41,478 --> 02:57:47,799
right uh crop means good genetics good

4286
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:50,720
agricultural practices uh no pesticides

4287
02:57:47,799 --> 02:57:52,599
uh very good uh practices in terms of

4288
02:57:50,719 --> 02:57:54,000
delivering a safe product meant for

4289
02:57:52,600 --> 02:57:57,159
human

4290
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:59,879
consumption and then the extraction of

4291
02:57:57,159 --> 02:58:03,879
that uh cannabis or the conversion of

4292
02:57:59,879 --> 02:58:06,478
Those Grapes into a reproducible product

4293
02:58:03,879 --> 02:58:09,358
that can cross state lines that can

4294
02:58:06,478 --> 02:58:12,959
cross international boundaries So when

4295
02:58:09,359 --> 02:58:15,399
you buy a bottle of that wine from

4296
02:58:12,959 --> 02:58:16,959
California if you're in Canada or if

4297
02:58:15,398 --> 02:58:20,199
you're in the United States it's the

4298
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:22,159
same quality it's the same taste it's

4299
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:24,720
basically the same flavor the

4300
02:58:22,159 --> 02:58:27,520
consistency that the owners of these

4301
02:58:24,719 --> 02:58:29,398
businesses really need to understand

4302
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:32,319
that that's going to be the mechanism in

4303
02:58:29,398 --> 02:58:35,398
place and so all of the quality control

4304
02:58:32,318 --> 02:58:37,398
testing all of the shelf life testing

4305
02:58:35,398 --> 02:58:40,159
and everything that needs to go into

4306
02:58:37,398 --> 02:58:42,519
making any quality product for human

4307
02:58:40,159 --> 02:58:44,879
consumption is going to go into the

4308
02:58:42,520 --> 02:58:47,399
so-called industry because that's what's

4309
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:50,759
just needed to happen to make sure that

4310
02:58:47,398 --> 02:58:53,358
the quality the product is what what was

4311
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:55,520
intended for for for it to be you know

4312
02:58:53,359 --> 02:58:58,399
and as funny as enough none of that

4313
02:58:55,520 --> 02:59:01,000
pertains to the food that we

4314
02:58:58,398 --> 02:59:03,119
eat well you'd like to think that it

4315
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:05,318
does though I mean again when we go to

4316
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:08,319
the grocery stores and you could look on

4317
02:59:05,318 --> 02:59:10,318
say like a package of I don't know can I

4318
02:59:08,318 --> 02:59:11,760
use the word meat on this show without

4319
02:59:10,318 --> 02:59:16,159
offending

4320
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:18,318
people it says USDA right USDA is the US

4321
02:59:16,159 --> 02:59:21,719
Department of Agriculture it says says

4322
02:59:18,318 --> 02:59:24,119
that it's either what uh Prime USDA or

4323
02:59:21,719 --> 02:59:26,199
grade A I mean there's a certain grading

4324
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:27,560
of beef and then what the consumer knows

4325
02:59:26,200 --> 02:59:29,840
when he's buying that product and

4326
02:59:27,559 --> 02:59:31,920
bringing it home is that yes there was a

4327
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:35,000
government agency and that that

4328
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:37,120
government a agency made sure that the

4329
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:39,680
place that's producing this product that

4330
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:41,760
I'm bringing home to cook and feed to my

4331
02:59:39,680 --> 02:59:43,439
family is going to be something that's

4332
02:59:41,760 --> 02:59:45,600
going to meet a certain level of

4333
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:48,200
requirements and that's part of the good

4334
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:50,079
regulation that happens in government I

4335
02:59:48,200 --> 02:59:52,159
also been to restaurants with you guys

4336
02:59:50,079 --> 02:59:54,079
so I know that you eat a lot of amazing

4337
02:59:52,159 --> 02:59:55,719
food that you grow but I also know that

4338
02:59:54,079 --> 02:59:58,000
you've definitely eat food that you

4339
02:59:55,719 --> 02:59:59,840
don't grow so it's it's for the majority

4340
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:01,559
of people right like not every like I

4341
02:59:59,840 --> 03:00:04,279
can't live on a farm and grow all my

4342
03:00:01,559 --> 03:00:06,478
food for my family with what I currently

4343
03:00:04,279 --> 03:00:08,479
do and not everyone can grow all their

4344
03:00:06,478 --> 03:00:10,959
own cannabis and all their organic food

4345
03:00:08,478 --> 03:00:13,039
and it's amazing for the people that can

4346
03:00:10,959 --> 03:00:16,159
and the more people that do it like holy

4347
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:18,000
smokes it's amazing um but it's it's not

4348
03:00:16,159 --> 03:00:20,318
currently feeding the world's po

4349
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:23,600
population and the

4350
03:00:20,318 --> 03:00:25,398
world's not only that Marcus we're

4351
03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:28,520
definitely realists about that I mean

4352
03:00:25,398 --> 03:00:31,879
we're not trying to be like you know

4353
03:00:28,520 --> 03:00:35,880
what it's the continued education for

4354
03:00:31,879 --> 03:00:39,438
that is going to transform that big AGG

4355
03:00:35,879 --> 03:00:43,278
so that people can have access to the

4356
03:00:39,439 --> 03:00:45,880
very basic sort of right that we have

4357
03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:49,200
which is to Nature and to Mother Earth

4358
03:00:45,879 --> 03:00:52,519
and all of these systems have taken us

4359
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:54,920
further and further away from that basic

4360
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:58,399
right just to have a relationship with a

4361
03:00:54,920 --> 03:01:00,799
plant to have relationship maybe with a

4362
03:00:58,398 --> 03:01:03,799
beer that we Brew you know it's just

4363
03:01:00,799 --> 03:01:07,079
it's it's all in the gamut and and it's

4364
03:01:03,799 --> 03:01:08,959
like when we when we speak from one side

4365
03:01:07,079 --> 03:01:12,039
of it it's like okay well we have to

4366
03:01:08,959 --> 03:01:15,438
bring that up to make this conversation

4367
03:01:12,040 --> 03:01:17,359
more holistic so that those other points

4368
03:01:15,439 --> 03:01:19,520
you know are are brought up in it

4369
03:01:17,359 --> 03:01:21,920
because that's just

4370
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:24,159
important yeah as far as our future

4371
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:26,600
forward and and where we want it to be

4372
03:01:24,159 --> 03:01:29,559
and I love it Mark that you kept saying

4373
03:01:26,600 --> 03:01:32,040
um you know to mitigate risk that a lot

4374
03:01:29,559 --> 03:01:34,840
of these standards are in to mitigate

4375
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:39,160
risk and I have to giggle to myself

4376
03:01:34,840 --> 03:01:42,079
about the idea of R mitigating risk with

4377
03:01:39,159 --> 03:01:44,119
psychedelic plants and plant medicine

4378
03:01:42,079 --> 03:01:47,238
and that's going to be a really fun

4379
03:01:44,120 --> 03:01:50,319
Frontier what that means and then like

4380
03:01:47,238 --> 03:01:54,559
the human mind to standardize what we

4381
03:01:50,318 --> 03:01:56,920
see as risk like is seeing the devil a

4382
03:01:54,559 --> 03:01:58,119
risk oh okay well let like back off okay

4383
03:01:56,920 --> 03:02:00,079
well you know if you're gonna be seeing

4384
03:01:58,120 --> 03:02:04,120
the devil we got to have a standard on

4385
03:02:00,079 --> 03:02:06,719
that one you know I mean it's awesome

4386
03:02:04,120 --> 03:02:10,040
fair game right no devil but if you

4387
03:02:06,719 --> 03:02:13,840
could see Jesus

4388
03:02:10,040 --> 03:02:17,080
Jes all of it moham it's it's all very

4389
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:22,238
it's all very important to to to what

4390
03:02:17,079 --> 03:02:26,478
what percentage is going to be with such

4391
03:02:22,238 --> 03:02:27,600
adaptogenic conscious raising plants it

4392
03:02:26,478 --> 03:02:31,559
makes me

4393
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:33,399
giggle well let let's try and just let's

4394
03:02:31,559 --> 03:02:35,119
try and separate this between what would

4395
03:02:33,398 --> 03:02:37,278
be considered

4396
03:02:35,120 --> 03:02:39,359
nutriceuticals herbal supplements and

4397
03:02:37,279 --> 03:02:41,079
then what would be considered

4398
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:43,559
Pharmaceuticals because in all

4399
03:02:41,079 --> 03:02:45,600
likelihood any government that regulates

4400
03:02:43,559 --> 03:02:48,920
it is either going to try and treat it

4401
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:51,399
as a pharmaceutical drug or hopefully

4402
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:54,238
since they're in the plant forms more of

4403
03:02:51,398 --> 03:02:56,478
the herbal supplement forms herbal

4404
03:02:54,238 --> 03:02:58,920
supplements can have a range of of

4405
03:02:56,478 --> 03:02:59,920
products including a range of tpin and

4406
03:02:58,920 --> 03:03:02,439
Active

4407
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:04,520
Components while you know when you start

4408
03:03:02,439 --> 03:03:06,639
looking at the neutraceuticals generally

4409
03:03:04,520 --> 03:03:09,319
will have active compounds listed on the

4410
03:03:06,639 --> 03:03:12,639
label but in a range and pharmaceuticals

4411
03:03:09,318 --> 03:03:16,039
generally need really specific

4412
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:18,439
dosages with in a reproducible for

4413
03:03:16,040 --> 03:03:20,720
example pill or other other

4414
03:03:18,439 --> 03:03:23,200
pharmaceutical delivery

4415
03:03:20,719 --> 03:03:25,920
API um so you're gonna have different

4416
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:28,000
reg Mike I mean there's just food so

4417
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:30,238
some people are selling mushrooms right

4418
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:32,120
now under the guise of they're mushrooms

4419
03:03:30,238 --> 03:03:33,760
they're edible they're food oh by the

4420
03:03:32,120 --> 03:03:36,160
way they also have all these other

4421
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:40,238
properties but and and and so the

4422
03:03:36,159 --> 03:03:43,359
manufacturing of those are happening in

4423
03:03:40,238 --> 03:03:46,318
clean kitchens that you would use to

4424
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:48,318
manufacture other food products and the

4425
03:03:46,318 --> 03:03:50,359
packaging that they're going into

4426
03:03:48,318 --> 03:03:54,318
and the way that they're I guess

4427
03:03:50,359 --> 03:03:56,079
assessing some type of um again we were

4428
03:03:54,318 --> 03:03:58,559
talking a little bit about this Mike

4429
03:03:56,079 --> 03:04:01,398
last week with Alec um whether or not

4430
03:03:58,559 --> 03:04:04,439
the Cannabis Testing labs are going to

4431
03:04:01,398 --> 03:04:07,439
test for you know like the dose of

4432
03:04:04,439 --> 03:04:09,760
psilocybin say like on mushrooms and so

4433
03:04:07,439 --> 03:04:11,439
will you actually see a label kind of

4434
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:14,200
like on your cannabis products where you

4435
03:04:11,439 --> 03:04:15,600
have so many milligrams of thca will

4436
03:04:14,200 --> 03:04:17,880
there be so many milligrams of

4437
03:04:15,600 --> 03:04:19,600
psilocybin in there and then we were

4438
03:04:17,879 --> 03:04:22,959
asking the question and maybe you know

4439
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:26,600
this Mike what is the percentage of

4440
03:04:22,959 --> 03:04:28,879
psilocybin on typical you know blue cat

4441
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:31,279
mushrooms I was always thinking again

4442
03:04:28,879 --> 03:04:33,398
there was on like the single digit

4443
03:04:31,279 --> 03:04:36,079
percentage like one to two to three

4444
03:04:33,398 --> 03:04:38,840
percent but do you know what they're so

4445
03:04:36,079 --> 03:04:43,359
this would be a better question for uh

4446
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:48,079
Paul uh Stam it but potency po potency

4447
03:04:43,359 --> 03:04:52,439
ranges in uh psychedelic mushrooms range

4448
03:04:48,079 --> 03:04:54,879
anywhere from about less than half of 1%

4449
03:04:52,439 --> 03:04:57,120
all the way up to currently in the

4450
03:04:54,879 --> 03:04:59,879
literature they've described up to about

4451
03:04:57,120 --> 03:05:02,880
four and a half five% I've seen online

4452
03:04:59,879 --> 03:05:06,398
people describing up to 6% psilocybin or

4453
03:05:02,879 --> 03:05:08,278
psilocin content um but

4454
03:05:06,398 --> 03:05:10,079
obviously you know when you look at

4455
03:05:08,279 --> 03:05:13,840
psilocybin being the controlled

4456
03:05:10,079 --> 03:05:16,120
substance you're only looking at one

4457
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:18,639
biosynthesized psychedelic compound

4458
03:05:16,120 --> 03:05:20,560
within the psychedelic mushroom

4459
03:05:18,639 --> 03:05:22,519
you know when when we bring those

4460
03:05:20,559 --> 03:05:25,000
products to Market I hope I certainly

4461
03:05:22,520 --> 03:05:28,319
hope they have psilocybin content but

4462
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:31,760
also psin and bosis content and all the

4463
03:05:28,318 --> 03:05:34,238
other tpin that we can find in there U

4464
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:36,559
that's that's honestly you you would

4465
03:05:34,238 --> 03:05:38,920
imagine that in in some way shape or

4466
03:05:36,559 --> 03:05:41,478
form like like I I would just think like

4467
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:43,879
one of the more popular ways of

4468
03:05:41,478 --> 03:05:45,679
taking mushrooms that I've always done

4469
03:05:43,879 --> 03:05:47,639
is just capsules because I don't like

4470
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:48,760
eating them I don't like tasting them

4471
03:05:47,639 --> 03:05:52,439
you put it in the capsule so the

4472
03:05:48,760 --> 03:05:53,520
question is is like in a 7 m a 700

4473
03:05:52,439 --> 03:05:57,200
millgram

4474
03:05:53,520 --> 03:06:00,479
capsule how much pilicide how much

4475
03:05:57,200 --> 03:06:03,319
mushroom ground mushroom go in there and

4476
03:06:00,478 --> 03:06:07,278
what's the concentration right so I

4477
03:06:03,318 --> 03:06:12,478
believe that the azures that stamin

4478
03:06:07,279 --> 03:06:16,040
found were tested at about 4% um the the

4479
03:06:12,478 --> 03:06:18,760
liberty caps tested at around 2% most of

4480
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:22,600
the cuzi species test at about 1%

4481
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:25,079
pilicide and by dry weight right so in

4482
03:06:22,600 --> 03:06:26,559
in a gram of mushrooms that puts you at

4483
03:06:25,079 --> 03:06:29,879
about 100

4484
03:06:26,559 --> 03:06:31,318
milligrams of 100 milligrams per gram so

4485
03:06:29,879 --> 03:06:35,719
what you would want to put inside of

4486
03:06:31,318 --> 03:06:39,920
each capsule is less than a third of a

4487
03:06:35,719 --> 03:06:44,398
gram dry weight would be sub uh

4488
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:47,760
sub intoxicating sub psychotic anolas

4489
03:06:44,398 --> 03:06:51,358
like in Indonesia are even weaker I mean

4490
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:55,040
they're like 0.1% or something they're

4491
03:06:51,359 --> 03:06:57,359
they're quite low totally totally yeah

4492
03:06:55,040 --> 03:07:00,640
and you'll have that range many many of

4493
03:06:57,359 --> 03:07:02,960
the ones that are commonly found are

4494
03:07:00,639 --> 03:07:06,398
going to have less than 1%

4495
03:07:02,959 --> 03:07:08,398
potency um some of the hybridization has

4496
03:07:06,398 --> 03:07:12,519
taken them up

4497
03:07:08,398 --> 03:07:14,519
but is the is there a uh an Entourage

4498
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:19,079
effect from everything else that's in

4499
03:07:14,520 --> 03:07:21,640
the mushroom that makes the the the um

4500
03:07:19,079 --> 03:07:25,559
uh psilocybin that's there so if it's

4501
03:07:21,639 --> 03:07:28,799
only 4% psilocybin that means there's

4502
03:07:25,559 --> 03:07:30,519
96% other you know carbohydrates

4503
03:07:28,799 --> 03:07:32,199
polysaccharide what maybe a little bit

4504
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:34,040
of protein I don't think there's too

4505
03:07:32,200 --> 03:07:36,159
much protein in mushrooms right

4506
03:07:34,040 --> 03:07:39,000
mushrooms is mostly polysaccharide in

4507
03:07:36,159 --> 03:07:41,879
the fruiting body right but they they do

4508
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:45,079
produce mono and

4509
03:07:41,879 --> 03:07:48,159
diterpenoids so is is there an ent or

4510
03:07:45,079 --> 03:07:50,680
Ensemble effect in mushrooms

4511
03:07:48,159 --> 03:07:52,760
absolutely yes

4512
03:07:50,680 --> 03:07:56,920
yeah yeah I was going to say you know

4513
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:56,920
with you know because there's pilin psoc

4514
03:07:58,520 --> 03:08:03,640
Oris we we will not be able to

4515
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:06,079
quantifiably say that in in this you

4516
03:08:03,639 --> 03:08:07,519
know proven manner until it's regulated

4517
03:08:06,079 --> 03:08:11,359
in such a way that we can start

4518
03:08:07,520 --> 03:08:14,560
culturing those different plants on true

4519
03:08:11,359 --> 03:08:17,800
but at the same time if you take the

4520
03:08:14,559 --> 03:08:21,359
four compounds that uh were just

4521
03:08:17,799 --> 03:08:24,959
mentioned and you take a enough to have

4522
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:26,840
a good dose of just that single compound

4523
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:28,679
you'll see each one is slightly

4524
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:31,760
different and if you take all four of

4525
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:34,639
them together it's again it has a

4526
03:08:31,760 --> 03:08:37,840
synergestic effect Well Albert Hoff

4527
03:08:34,639 --> 03:08:40,639
synthesized theil a long time ago and

4528
03:08:37,840 --> 03:08:44,159
they they created synthetic you

4529
03:08:40,639 --> 03:08:48,358
know pilin and it's not the same as

4530
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:50,520
taking the mushroom so and they've seen

4531
03:08:48,359 --> 03:08:52,120
CH depend

4532
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:55,319
on

4533
03:08:52,120 --> 03:08:57,079
anyway silon and what I'm saying is also

4534
03:08:55,318 --> 03:08:58,600
a lot of people you know nowadays when

4535
03:08:57,079 --> 03:09:01,120
you when

4536
03:08:58,600 --> 03:09:04,159
you uh blend up mushrooms and you put it

4537
03:09:01,120 --> 03:09:07,439
in a capsule you often put other you

4538
03:09:04,159 --> 03:09:10,200
know herbs and other you know supportive

4539
03:09:07,439 --> 03:09:12,840
herbs in The Capsule that's what makes

4540
03:09:10,200 --> 03:09:16,120
that capsule good for you so when you

4541
03:09:12,840 --> 03:09:17,680
know you'll see some hopefully dragonfly

4542
03:09:16,120 --> 03:09:19,760
will be able to teach the world about

4543
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:21,359
that soon yeah well and a lot of other

4544
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:23,960
people you know just put it out there

4545
03:09:21,359 --> 03:09:26,120
but compounding is is super important so

4546
03:09:23,959 --> 03:09:28,438
just in the way that supportive just in

4547
03:09:26,120 --> 03:09:31,560
the way that we get Entourage effects

4548
03:09:28,439 --> 03:09:34,000
with all of these different types of um

4549
03:09:31,559 --> 03:09:36,439
you know mind altering or different

4550
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:38,959
types of medicinal plants we can

4551
03:09:36,439 --> 03:09:42,079
compound them with other plants to get

4552
03:09:38,959 --> 03:09:44,639
even a further Entourage and this is

4553
03:09:42,079 --> 03:09:47,000
just herbology this has been happening

4554
03:09:44,639 --> 03:09:49,119
for a really long time and we want to be

4555
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:51,840
able to be as supportive as you can you

4556
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:54,800
know you don't want to be so alpath that

4557
03:09:51,840 --> 03:09:57,719
you know this this particular compound

4558
03:09:54,799 --> 03:10:01,159
in mushroom creates this type of

4559
03:09:57,719 --> 03:10:04,478
cerebral effect when in fact it might be

4560
03:10:01,159 --> 03:10:07,680
causing a liver effect that is not so

4561
03:10:04,478 --> 03:10:10,840
beneficial so so in compounding these we

4562
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:12,398
can really look at ancient histories and

4563
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:16,120
ancient different cultures that have

4564
03:10:12,398 --> 03:10:19,760
always compounded these adaptogenic

4565
03:10:16,120 --> 03:10:22,120
psychedelic plant medicines um and and

4566
03:10:19,760 --> 03:10:24,200
it's really exciting as they come more

4567
03:10:22,120 --> 03:10:27,040
through the doorways and more where we

4568
03:10:24,200 --> 03:10:30,399
can study them that I really hope that

4569
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:32,760
that's stage two that we can start this

4570
03:10:30,398 --> 03:10:36,238
compounding and having an understanding

4571
03:10:32,760 --> 03:10:39,238
of Entourage of the whole plant medicine

4572
03:10:36,238 --> 03:10:43,359
world and how they all work together in

4573
03:10:39,238 --> 03:10:46,159
a poly culture and a myriad of

4574
03:10:43,359 --> 03:10:49,279
medicines yeah yeah because many of the

4575
03:10:46,159 --> 03:10:51,719
mushroom species actually op require

4576
03:10:49,279 --> 03:10:53,960
some of the real specific either hard

4577
03:10:51,719 --> 03:10:55,318
woods or soft Woods because they'll

4578
03:10:53,959 --> 03:10:57,559
actually be pulling some of the

4579
03:10:55,318 --> 03:11:00,359
precursor compounds out of that wood

4580
03:10:57,559 --> 03:11:02,159
material that then get brought up in to

4581
03:11:00,359 --> 03:11:03,559
then get synthesized into the larger

4582
03:11:02,159 --> 03:11:05,680
molecular weight

4583
03:11:03,559 --> 03:11:06,680
troponoids that were found in some of

4584
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:10,398
the

4585
03:11:06,680 --> 03:11:13,359
mushroom mus exactly they're a low a

4586
03:11:10,398 --> 03:11:16,079
lowlevel toxin to your body that's part

4587
03:11:13,359 --> 03:11:18,200
of the trip so to be able to take

4588
03:11:16,079 --> 03:11:19,719
supportive herbs Chinese herbs and

4589
03:11:18,200 --> 03:11:21,840
different herbs to support your body

4590
03:11:19,719 --> 03:11:24,119
while you're doing it then you're not

4591
03:11:21,840 --> 03:11:26,120
getting the depletion afterwards you're

4592
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:28,319
getting the full benefit and that's

4593
03:11:26,120 --> 03:11:30,359
often used with MDMA as well you know if

4594
03:11:28,318 --> 03:11:34,879
you're going to do an MDMA therapy you

4595
03:11:30,359 --> 03:11:37,520
often would take what is it 5 agtp or a

4596
03:11:34,879 --> 03:11:40,639
few other uh different uh supportive

4597
03:11:37,520 --> 03:11:42,520
minerals and herbs with that while you

4598
03:11:40,639 --> 03:11:44,278
do it and Mike I love what you said you

4599
03:11:42,520 --> 03:11:46,960
know it really is like what kind of

4600
03:11:44,279 --> 03:11:49,439
substrate is the mushroom coming from it

4601
03:11:46,959 --> 03:11:51,799
is such yet again I have to say it it's

4602
03:11:49,439 --> 03:11:54,238
it's an adaptogen not just an adaptogen

4603
03:11:51,799 --> 03:11:56,959
on how it makes us feel but what it

4604
03:11:54,238 --> 03:12:00,520
uptakes in its environment what kind of

4605
03:11:56,959 --> 03:12:03,438
epigenetics that it creates into its

4606
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:06,238
body and then what type how that those

4607
03:12:03,439 --> 03:12:09,120
epigenetics of the medicine translates

4608
03:12:06,238 --> 03:12:12,439
to our own individual experiences it's

4609
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:15,279
so incredibly vast you know like when

4610
03:12:12,439 --> 03:12:17,279
you get a polypour from a birch mushroom

4611
03:12:15,279 --> 03:12:20,399
you're getting betulinic acid in it

4612
03:12:17,279 --> 03:12:23,040
which changes the whole compound of that

4613
03:12:20,398 --> 03:12:25,760
mushroom completely than if you were to

4614
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:27,680
get it off of a pine tree say and then

4615
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:30,200
you've got you know those a lot of the

4616
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:32,159
TR Turpin that really come from Pine

4617
03:12:30,200 --> 03:12:34,640
just as an example I I just love that

4618
03:12:32,159 --> 03:12:36,600
you brought that up and it really it it

4619
03:12:34,639 --> 03:12:38,879
makes us realize that there is no

4620
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:41,600
ceiling is basically what I'm trying to

4621
03:12:38,879 --> 03:12:43,799
say with these plant medicines in

4622
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:45,640
reality and and we know with cannabis is

4623
03:12:43,799 --> 03:12:47,519
a dynamic accumulator it upt takes

4624
03:12:45,639 --> 03:12:49,199
toxins well we know mushrooms up take it

4625
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:50,319
even more like Kelly's saying and a lot

4626
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:52,560
of times with

4627
03:12:50,318 --> 03:12:53,579
cubensis you know you're you're

4628
03:12:52,559 --> 03:12:56,718

4634
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:21,720
that compost and all the manure and all

4635

and you're you're breaking up unless my

4637
03:13:27,879 --> 03:13:32,278
I'm having

4638
03:13:29,238 --> 03:13:33,559
trouble here we probably broke up we

4639
03:13:32,279 --> 03:13:36,600
were just saying it's incredibly

4640
03:13:33,559 --> 03:13:39,000
important to have organic compost

4641
03:13:36,600 --> 03:13:41,040
organic hay and all that in the

4642
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:42,840
cultivation of

4643
03:13:41,040 --> 03:13:45,520
cubensis because

4644
03:13:42,840 --> 03:13:48,200
they it's going to play well into being

4645
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:50,159
able to culture them you know culture

4646
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:52,279
the culture of the Cannabis industry

4647
03:13:50,159 --> 03:13:54,680
because being able to have those locally

4648
03:13:52,279 --> 03:13:56,600
biodynamic soils are going to allow

4649
03:13:54,680 --> 03:14:00,359
those Farms to be able to culture those

4650
03:13:56,600 --> 03:14:02,840
plants you know within their region and

4651
03:14:00,359 --> 03:14:05,079
you know it leads well to the evidence

4652
03:14:02,840 --> 03:14:08,238
then some of the old adage where people

4653
03:14:05,079 --> 03:14:09,639
would take strawberry clippings or

4654
03:14:08,238 --> 03:14:11,279
blueberry clippings or raspberry

4655
03:14:09,639 --> 03:14:13,599
clippings and put them into their

4656
03:14:11,279 --> 03:14:14,920
compost and then feed those into the

4657
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:17,479
compost

4658
03:14:14,920 --> 03:14:19,960
beds um thinking that they can derive

4659
03:14:17,478 --> 03:14:22,879
some of the flavor out of those the

4660
03:14:19,959 --> 03:14:24,478
broken down plant

4661
03:14:22,879 --> 03:14:26,599
materials

4662
03:14:24,478 --> 03:14:28,679
you yeah I don't I don't think you'll

4663
03:14:26,600 --> 03:14:31,520
ever have any of those tpin survive to

4664
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:33,559
the microbial no that becomes bacteria

4665
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:36,680
food as soon as that stuff becomes

4666
03:14:33,559 --> 03:14:39,680
soluble it gets eaten

4667
03:14:36,680 --> 03:14:39,680
immediately

4668
03:14:41,840 --> 03:14:47,559

4680
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:19,560

4681
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:21,840
of a cocy and cyan Essence Gill where

4682
03:15:19,559 --> 03:15:24,600
you can see the tiny little spores all

4683
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:27,478
around the the the gills there and so I

4684
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:28,800
