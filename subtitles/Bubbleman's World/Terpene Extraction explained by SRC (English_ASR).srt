2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,278
how you guys

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,560
doing right on uh you're from SRC oh

4
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,920
okay I'm from crd and you

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:33,000
can with you guys nice see you guys have

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,320
the booth set up all

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,159
nice Hydro

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
distillation can tell us a little bit

9
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,919
about Hydro distillation oh okay it's

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
actually the process by which one of the

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,840
processes by which you extract essential

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,479
oils from plants so it's Hydra because

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,160
you're using water and um you're

14
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,238
distilling the oils which are volatile

15
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,279
so what happens is that you immerse your

16
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,919
plant and it can be either fresh or it

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,079
can be either dried material you immerse

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,239
it in the water you have a heat Source

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,359
when that boils the um essential oils

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,920
come off as a vapor they condense they

21
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,799
in the coil yeah right they and they

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,680
collect in the bottom jar right this is

23
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,560
a oil TR so this is lemon grass so it's

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,520
lighter than the water so it floats on

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,640
top I see I see so that's great and so

26
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,959
what about I'm I'm not a scientist but I

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,519
know that anytime we heat something

28
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,519
particularly volatile oils like tpin and

29
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,438
terpenoids that potentially we're

30
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,679
changing their structures and producing

31
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,438
artifacts of their true molecules right

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,360
so it's the heat source is controlled

33
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:41,798
it's controlled heating right you can

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,280
actually adjust the temperature so we um

35
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,719
we get the oils off at very low

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
temperature and is this done under a

37
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,118
vacuum as well no it's not it's not

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,118
there's no need to be it's all just open

39
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,438
right okay and you can always check the

40
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:58,640
quality of your oil when you're finished

41
00:01:53,438 --> 00:02:00,438
using GC um GC or even the proton hnmr I

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,718
believe that they have it used

43
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,078
that would be amazing well that's really

44
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,599
cool thank you for explaining that I

45
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,199
know the viewers on my channel will

46
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,919
really appreciate that cuz right now

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
there's a few people in the community

48
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,318
that I live in which is the Cannabis

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,800
Community um people are desperately

50
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,079
trying to figure out how to uh extract

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,280
the tpin from the plant matter obviously

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,879
this is a great way to start the ball

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,199
rolling and then start using your head

54
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,799
to figure out okay how can I protect

55
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,159
these volatile oils that are evaporating

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,920
at room temperature and now I'm going to

57
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,400
apply heat it would be great if we could

58
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,878
do it under a vacuum under a much colder

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,200
uh conditions and still get the same job

60
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,199
done that'd be awesome

61
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:55,150
