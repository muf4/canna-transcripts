way of doing it so I don't have to send

it to through Facebook to make sure we

22

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,620
what though it's part of hashed Church

109
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:15,889

110
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,990
difficulties hey so we got nine folks in

111

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,360
start off with mr. Chris Bennett he had

119
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,490
a little bit of a thing put together

120
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,139
just a little overview whatever he wants

121
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,170
to say and then once we've done that

122
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,659
we'll do we'll we'll introduce each

123
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,490
person and sort of a quick little who

124
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,320
you are how long you've been involved in

125
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,230
cannabis when you got involved with

126
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,800
hashish and then we'll move forward into

127
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:01,790
the presence of hashish after that well

128
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,449
hello everybody hi and glad to see

129
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:08,030
another season of hash Church going on

130
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:09,860
yeah you know definitely I've had a

131
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:12,469
long-standing interest in the history of

132
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,300
cannabis most of that has been about how

133
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,500
it affects culture via magic and

134
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,600
religion and that type of stuff so

135
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,240
consciousness that type of stuff but of

136
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,650
course in my corner Santeria by looking

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,870
into that I've come across much on

138
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:25,279
hashish and stuff like that by no claim

139
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,110
to be an expert in the history like

140
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,059
Robert C Clark but I'll go over some of

141
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,710
the basic kind of information about it

142
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,629
you know much is unknown when it comes

143
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:39,319
to hashish when we started separating it

144
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:40,699
but the earliest possible reference to

145
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,610
separating Cronk homes

146
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,860
from the Leafs and flowers is the Syrian

147
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,750
reference pointed to by Ethan Rousseau

148
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,509
from about 2600 years ago and in it the

149
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:56,870
instructions require that 16 drugs thou

150
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:59,180
shalt pound dry pound and strain and

151
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,399
then fumigate there so they're obviously

152
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,189
straining it now whether this was a

153
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:07,039
full-on separation that's my bird in the

154
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:09,860
background sorry whether it's a full-on

155
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,379
separation of trichomes from the leaves

156
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,910
and flowers I don't know

157
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,259
could just be pulverized cannabis but

158
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,080
that's the earliest probably have to you

159
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,240
like strain type of cannabis and there's

160
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,490
also lots of references in the ancient

161
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,230
world to Kuna boo incense which is a

162
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,569
cannabis incense and many people have

163
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,300
suggested that this was a form of

164
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:32,199
hashish as well and some books printed

165
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,810
as a form of hashish in ancient Assyria

166
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,300
unclear a lot of ancient incense was

167
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,310
simply ground up plants mixed together a

168
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,780
powdered and you'd have to actually put

169
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,060
oil on it and stuff like that to be able

170
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:46,819
to light it so it's not clear if it was

171
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,009
a full-on resin extract however there

172
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,349
are references the oil of kanabi which

173
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,180
is oil of cannabis and this does sound

174
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,960
like some sort of oil product that has

175
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,900
been extracted

176
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:01,219
although the extraction methods used to

177
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:06,229
attain this are unknown in his book the

178
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:08,810
rig Vedic soma the Indian scholar worm

179
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,720
Cod suggests that their agent Sanskrit

180
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,660
names for cannabis leaves flowers and

181
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,540
resin which seems to indicate that there

182
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,920
would have been means of separating it

183
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,220
from the flowers and stocks back then

184
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,850
even so chair ass is pretty old in

185
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,530
Indian literature and it may go back to

186
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:32,240
Vedic references according to where up

187
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:34,669
on deck in the turn hashish itself first

188
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,879
starts to appear in the Muslim world is

189
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,250
thought to be just mean the heard and

190
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,000
kind of like the heard in relation to

191
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:47,120
cannabis like kind of the herb of herbs

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,220
and although other suggestions have been

193
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,549
made the night at nineteenth-century

194
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,240
biblical scholar John Quito suggested

195
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:55,759
that ashy

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,220
actually came from a Hebrew word as she

197
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,778
shot which was related to both a plant

198
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,490
that provided some sort of resin that

199
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:06,528
was mixed with wine and shesh a plant

200
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,778
that was a fiber plant so we have here a

201
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:13,278
resinous and a fiber plant and he says

202
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:17,200
that as shisha likely became hashish as

203
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:20,269
it carried on into the Islamic world and

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,070
in India as well like you know a lot of

205
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,958
people say that hashish didn't start

206
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,320
until the Islamic world in a cannabis

207
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:30,759
use even but that's not the case Persian

208
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,990
use of cannabis was going on long before

209
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,639
Islamic use took place amongst its

210
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,950
irrational religion and and right up

211
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,528
until the Islamic period we have a

212
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:42,379
ration relation references to the terms

213
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:44,389
manga and Banga which have been

214
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:46,278
suggested as cannabis and have also been

215
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:48,588
suggested as hashish by some people and

216
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,059
like the references to Kido this was a

217
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,649
resin that was mixed with wines

218
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:56,149
according to some sources and there's a

219
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,769
before hashish appears in the 10th

220
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,839
century in the Islamic world there's

221
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:02,449
another plant dotty which again is a

222
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,890
resin plant intoxicating but mixed with

223
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,528
one you know it's important to remember

224
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:09,919
that a lot of the hashish in the

225
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:12,799
medieval period was ingested or prayer

226
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,409
prepared with drinks and not smoke

227
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,729
smoking cannabis and hashish is

228
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,740
something that's thought to be

229
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,570
relatively new to take place after the

230
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,940
time of discovery of the new world habit

231
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,860
of tobacco smoking and then this was

232
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,540
incorporated with cannabis although it

233
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,070
was burned as an incense this was

234
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,199
generally in a fumigation type of

235
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,270
situation where they would capture the

236
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,180
smoke and inhale it but not have pipes

237
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:38,149
and things like that to smoke although

238
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:40,429
there's debate about this even right and

239
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:43,339
then hashish we start to see it

240
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:47,000
appearing in the medieval period the

241
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:49,100
alchemists Cardno makes reference to as

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,649
CSAT which is thought to be hashish from

243
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,879
the description and other references

244
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,379
like that start to appear in the

245
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,019
medieval muscle in the medieval period

246
00:10:54,379 --> 00:11:01,070
in Europe after the Crusades and some of

247
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:02,778
the first European literature novels and

248
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,020
things like that actually make reference

249
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:06,740
to hashish Marco Polo's famous escapades

250
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,230
into

251
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,769
the Islamic world was really led in a

252
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,300
big way to the Crusades as well as that

253
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:15,860
the Cameron there's an accountant the

254
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,958
camera on one of the first novels in

255
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,308
Europe and it also has a story of

256
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,448
hashish so it was pretty much taken up

257
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:25,969
right away you know and it's interesting

258
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:29,708
that it appears in fiction because after

259
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:33,110
Napoleon's war in the 18th century an

260
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:36,768
invasion of the Mideast hashish became

261
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:39,409
increasingly popular in Europe and we

262
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,839
see this taking place particularly among

263
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:47,740
literary circles like that of Victor

264
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:50,149
Hugo Alexandre Dumas defiled de Balzac

265
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,159
Gerardi interval and other writers who

266
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,470
gathered together in a group known as

267
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,438
lek Club the hash machines and in Paris

268
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,850
France and many of these authors

269
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:00,708
although they wrote over a hundred and

270
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,329
fifty years ago their books are still in

271
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,919
print movies remain about their books

272
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:05,899
these are some of the best authors of

273
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,378
the world and they all gathered together

274
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:12,289
regularly to consume hashish ingested

275
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:14,240
oftentimes a mixture of a gooey hashish

276
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:16,188
into some coffee and then they would

277
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,220
take up more of a psychedelic type of

278
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:20,719
amount of dose not the more casual

279
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,259
social amount that that most of us are

280
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,759
used to and one of the really

281
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,740
interesting things about this period

282
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,379
when hashish first starts to come up is

283
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,120
some really interesting psychological

284
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:34,519
advancement started to take place and

285
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,828
the 18th century a doctor Thomas Arnold

286
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,879
and in the 19th century hashish club

287
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:42,859
member and co-founder dr. JJ Moreau they

288
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,800
started to look at the hashish

289
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,188
intoxication and compared to things like

290
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,378
insanity as well as the ability to dream

291
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:52,428
at night and are dreaming because many

292
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,499
people when they were taking these

293
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:57,110
larger amounts we're having sort of

294
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:59,480
astral type voyages and coming back and

295
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,539
telling tales of what they saw in these

296
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,879
realms and this all led to the mapping

297
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:07,219
out of what became known as the

298
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,819
subconscious in the unconscious mind and

299
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,569
how she played a pivotal role in that

300
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:15,849
layout and understanding of that through

301
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:18,798
psychiatrists like and doctors like dr.

302
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,389
Thomas Arnold and dr. JJ Moreau so this

303
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,949
is a really

304
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:24,699
important thing and I think it's

305
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,890
comparable to the role that cannabinoids

306
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,690
have played today in understanding the

307
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:32,259
endocannabinoid system in the body of

308
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,630
man and this is equal importance because

309
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,990
really led to our understanding of the

310
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:42,009
human mind and I think that's a you know

311
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,680
a pretty good overview of the whole

312
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:46,450
thing you know there's all sorts of

313
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,399
different names I could list off for

314
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,050
five minutes probably all the different

315
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,610
names that hashish is acquired like

316
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:54,250
cannabis over the years it's one of the

317
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,440
most named things but I'll save the

318
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,220
audience that open it up to other

319
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:04,360
stoppers thank you very much boom Sheba

320
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:08,139
boom Shiva that was great thank you so

321
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,720
much for the breakdown see who we got

322

here oh yeah we're good so yeah that was

323
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,190
wonderful we got a I'm sure maybe skunk

324
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,110
man Sam has a few things he wants to

325
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,870
mention in regards to the history of

326
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,820
hashish or perhaps just in regards to

327
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,830
his history in hashish what do you say

328
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,410
Sam are you there for a little chatty

329
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:30,190
chat or did you leave the room to puff

330
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:33,279
holes you know I pay maybe that in the

331
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,620
Islamic world a lot of it was filtered

332
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,899
like you know it rained hash keeps up

333
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,019
stuff like that and in India a lot of

334
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:43,299
that was hand pressure skin press

335
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,889
there's the famous stain L of the naked

336
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,779
virgins running through the cannabis

337
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,610
fields and getting pressing cannabis

338
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,379
plants all over their bodies and skin

339
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,450
and then scraping it off of night now

340
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:54,490
that could be mythology but definitely

341
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,920
pressed together on hands and rubbed

342
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,310
into little balls that's probably the

343
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,319
earliest way I would think as opposed to

344
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:04,329
separating Keith I've always felt like

345
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,400
the running through the fields and

346
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,370
collecting hash on your body although

347
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,350
was a beautiful vision it was probably

348
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,600
more of a mythology than than reality

349
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,340
ident I think so my thinks though you

350
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,050
know it's a lot of like romantic

351
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,050
imagination went into hashish and

352
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:25,000
there's all sorts of misinformation out

353
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:26,740
there in the historical record you know

354
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,659
and I mean people writing about it it's

355
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,820
secondhand accounts third hand accounts

356
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:33,139
that sort of thing well I like that he

357
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,449
finished it off with a boom Shiva I mean

358
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,879
that was I will say after traveling to

359
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:40,488
India and kind of linking up you know at

360
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:43,159
the at the at the Maha kumbhamela in

361
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:45,399
Haridwar when I where I went in 1998

362
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:49,608
which is a very large gathering in India

363
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,399
it's almost like like it's almost like a

364
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:54,889
Lola Palooza of siddhu's where you have

365
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,539
all the different sects are hanging out

366
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:58,609
with what you know with themselves the

367
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:00,618
Nagas and the Krishna's and the Brahmas

368
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:02,660
and the Shiites and I went and hung out

369
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:04,339
with the majority of them and puffed

370
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,769
bowls with the ones that would puff

371
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,359
bowls and hung out and drank teas with

372
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,938
the ones that wouldn't puff bowls and

373
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:13,189
man if I didn't navigate and and direct

374
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:16,808
myself right into the XI vite

375
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:19,159
Baba's man were those guys the chillest

376
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:19,818
siddhu's to hang out with and I'm

377
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,188
talking

378
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:24,738
we hung out with the Nagas who are have

379
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:26,688
apparently lived this intensely hard

380
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:29,329
life and don't own clothes or really

381
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:31,969
anything and so they often get to bathe

382
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:33,948
in the gaps prior to you know

383
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,470
high-ranking military and political

384
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:39,558
officials they have this sort of you

385
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,389
know they get to bathe first because of

386
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:43,219
the life that they live but hanging out

387
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,808
and puffing bowls with them was just not

388
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,449
on the same level as hanging out in

389
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:49,548
puffing bulls with Pashupati the sheave

390
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:51,318
eyed Bubba that I met on the banks of

391
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:53,418
the Ganges and spent two to three weeks

392
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,338
straight just smoking chilling after

393
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:58,610
chilling after chilling I can still hear

394
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:01,579
him almost 20 years later or 20 years

395
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,669
actually later saying one more Chilam we

396
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:07,879
are making one more Chilam we are making

397
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:12,230
it was just such a wonderful thing to

398
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,899
hear every 7 to 8 minutes for you know

399
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,360
18 hours at a time one more Chilam we

400
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:19,038
are making oh yes one more chilling we

401
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,448
are making I know that puts a smile on

402
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,259
your face Frenchy and as it should

403
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:27,288
because yes smoking kilims is pretty

404
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:29,388
darn fun if you really want before I

405
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:32,710
smoked the hubbly bubbly at the first

406
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:32,709
legends of hash dinner

407
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:37,909
just throw Duchess on mute there that

408
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,519
was pretty crazy sounded like a vacuum

409
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,130
got turned on before I smoke the hubbly

410
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:45,470
bubbly from the Afghans I truly had

411
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,890
never you know the Chilam was the first

412
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:52,039
like serious serious serious pounding of

413
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,900
hashish that my lungs had ever taken and

414
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,899
I wasn't that old I guess I was probably

415
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,600
25 or 26 years old at the time and only

416
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,170
really maybe ten years into my journey

417
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:06,139
as a hashish in' I got into hashish I'll

418
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:12,350
start why not with myself back in

419
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:14,540
probably 89 90 I had been smoking

420
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:16,909
cannabis but being from Winnipeg we also

421
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:19,579
saw some of the import hash that came in

422
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:23,050
via Montreal which is where most of the

423
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:26,960
hash in Canada was ex imported into

424
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:29,329
whether it was Moroccan which we saw

425
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,990
very little of we saw a lot of Afghani

426
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:35,029
and we saw the odd brick of Lebanese so

427
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,700
I was able to at a very young age

428
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:40,039
experienced the red Lebanese which was a

429
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,808
little more sedated and the white

430
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,639
Lebanese which was a little bit more

431
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:45,799
energetic I guess just the difference

432
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,290
really was cutting it down a little bit

433
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:50,419
earlier or even maybe the red lab sat on

434
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:52,579
the field probably more likely for a

435
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,170
little bit longer of a time and cured

436
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:57,349
out that resin and the Sun could also

437
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,940
have been a different timeline of summer

438
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:01,519
to winter I don't know for sure

439
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,058
maybe Sam or someone else on the panel

440
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,549
has an idea in regards to that anyone

441
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:08,839
else have some history of hashish they

442
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,700
want to share before we get into

443
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,769
introducing ourselves and giving our own

444
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,370
history I just wanted to show these

445
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:19,009
antique Chile's I got here real quick

446
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:24,049
with an old postcard from about 1910 of

447
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:27,049
a sadhu who's held his arm up until it's

448
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:30,019
actually lost the ability to move out of

449
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:33,200
act of devotion but these are old 19th

450
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:35,509
the early 20th century fancy chill ohms

451
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,480
that were used by sad news you know I

452
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,670
met a guy at the Maha kumbhamela I met a

453
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,190
bunch of guys I'm

454
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,690
guy that was holding his arm up and he

455
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,460
had been holding it up for something

456
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:50,440
like 31 or 32 years that was in 1998 and

457
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,120
then I met another guy who was kind of

458
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,299
propped up on this stand and he was

459
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:57,549
holding his leg up I met a guy that had

460
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,619
closed his fist and grown his

461
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:02,259
fingernails through the top of his hand

462
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:04,629
he was just holding his fist closed for

463
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:06,670
like I think he was like also over 20

464
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,530
years and then there was a gentleman who

465
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,230
had stuck a knife right through his

466
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:13,599
forearm and had a bucket collecting the

467
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,279
blood that was dripping down and he was

468
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,980
pretty sure that he was going to be okay

469
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,259
definitely a different sort of mentality

470
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,750
the fakir mentality that removing the

471
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:25,359
the mind from the body

472
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,819
removing pain and the existence of pain

473
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,500
from the experience definitely tripped

474
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:31,809
me out it was one of the things that I

475
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,690
always tell people you know India is

476
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:37,899
like an adventure it's not really like a

477
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,910
vacation and that was kind of the main

478
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,670
reason was some of these guys at the

479
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:45,070
khumba mela were just they were doing

480
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,930
some next-level stuff i was just a hash

481
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:48,939
aficionado that wanted to smoke some

482
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,160
bowls with some side use on the side of

483
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,190
the road and exchange information but I

484
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,650
got exposed to a lot more through that

485
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,600
the culture of the khumba mela than i

486
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,519
could have ever anticipated that is for

487
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,289
sure thanks for sharing those chillings

488
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,349
I will say that most of the children's I

489
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:09,250
smoked while they're in the 90s were of

490
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:11,409
Italian creation really smooth beautiful

491
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,630
Italian chillens all the Saudis kind of

492
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,210
agreed that I met at least that the

493
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:21,550
Italian chillins were you know the ones

494
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,930
that they wanted to be smoking on well

495
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,389
why don't we go through the list we'll

496
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,600
start with dab logic and then we'll move

497
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:33,190
on to Jessica and Dru and then we'll

498
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,569
move on to the other drew and and we'll

499
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,160
go through I'll let you know each time

500
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:38,829
what I want you guys to do is basically

501
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,840
give us dabbe logic you can start it off

502
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:42,819
give us a little history as to yourself

503
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,470
and to you know where you're at right

504
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:48,599
now and how you got there in particular

505
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,600
with hashish what was your inspirations

506
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:57,808
everybody hear me yes sir

507
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:01,769
yeah I guess I got in a hashish from my

508
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:04,319
grandfather and reduced it to me first

509
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:08,879
he was big in the hashish and hashish

510
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:10,918
oil the way back and first offense then

511
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:18,020
I had a really big interest in it and

512
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:20,399
kind of devoted starting at like mm2

513
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:24,028
researching hashish and learning about

514
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:27,658
it and trying to was the biggest you

515
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:35,009
know kind of hurdle for me was quality

516
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:41,070
hash long enough time actually met some

517
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:47,089
people and good we eaten from it and

518
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:55,470
eventually that led into a switch I

519
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:58,168
passed you know sure so man I'm

520
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:07,019
with a company Verde natural they're all

521
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:10,710
organic all soil growing attics and

522
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:12,269
awesome things to work with so I'm sure

523
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:17,460
kind of going through all their

524
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:19,500
different ends and those different

525
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,870
things and finding out what works and

526
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,048
what doesn't cuz that's kind of a big

527
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:26,969
thing with hash as well is that be able

528
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:28,769
glad down on something you think is

529
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,990
gonna be really amazing just because

530
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:37,500
it's not the right lineage or the right

531
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:39,480
variety that true true can you give a

532
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,308
timeline in regards to what the year was

533
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,500
when you were 15 and got turned on to

534
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:48,178
hash just to give us an idea mm 25 right

535
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,898
now so I mean that was about ten years

536
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:54,179
ago 2008 I mean bubbleman was a huge

537
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:56,038
part I mean I honestly I've been

538
00:23:54,179 --> 00:24:02,538
watching your videos since I was young

539
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:05,308
so interesting thing do you have it

540
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:07,679
I'll say one thing your photos have me

541
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:10,048
drooling on the regular dude it's you

542
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,850
you're you're the growers and the

543
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:14,730
genetics and the hash making is

544
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:17,219
absolutely on point for dab logic I'm

545
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,899
always looking in fact all of you are on

546
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,278
this panel for almost that one main

547
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:22,888
reason of course a lot of you are

548
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:26,038
well-known but for me it's as simple as

549
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:28,138
does your photos of your hash make my

550
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,240
mouth water because I can't make that

551
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:32,729
[ __ ] up and I can say that everyone on

552
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,710
this panel has hash that makes my mouth

553
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,329
water and so that's really where the

554
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,649
invitations came out people like well

555
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:39,928
how did you come up with this panel it's

556
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:41,758
like well I came up with this panel

557
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,590
based on the fact that my mouth watered

558
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,528
when I looked at their hash which means

559
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:49,168
to me that they took that pathway of

560
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,700
instead of you know which is a really

561
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,980
important thing that you said learning

562
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,200
about the genetics because it's true you

563
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,360
know I got very lucky when I started the

564
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,750
bubble bag company in 1999 because the

565
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,618
first couple of materials I made or just

566
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:06,509
like it's hash tag hash bubble hash in

567
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:08,878
1998-99 was not really something a lot

568
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:09,298
of people loved people were pressing it

569
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:11,189
together

570
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:13,019
wets people were using genetics that

571
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,058
weren't really the ideal genetics and it

572
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,929
wasn't until I put some a breeder Steve

573
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:18,178
shish-kabob

574
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,700
into my bags and actually saw something

575
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,860
come out that was full melt and then of

576
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,139
course I lucked out into rene which was

577
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,418
a beautiful cultivar that I mean the

578
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:29,459
first time I made hash with it I picked

579
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:32,190
it up off of the ground it was it was

580
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,860
swept into the corner with dust and hair

581
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,210
and dirt and I and I remember at first

582
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:37,918
just picking up a little bit because

583
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,769
there was so much resin along the bottom

584
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,690
in a rolling paper just off the top that

585
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:44,128
was under tea and I put it in the

586
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,080
rolling paper and rolled it up and when

587
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:48,418
I got home I opened the paper up and the

588
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,548
hash was just in a tube and it was shiny

589
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,889
and I thought wow that looks like it's

590
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:55,168
really nice resin so I asked for all of

591
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:57,358
the material off of the floor I ran a

592
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:00,600
batch and basically got stained glass

593
00:25:57,358 --> 00:26:02,788
window beautiful unbelievable Renee and

594
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,788
Renee really was the whole reason why

595
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:07,888
bubbleman as a character was able to in

596
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:11,519
the early days inspire people such as

597
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:14,069
yourself because that hash that's the

598
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:17,069
real magic for a hash maker getting

599
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:18,808
either growing the proper material which

600
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:22,079
my hats off to all of you that are doing

601
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:24,058
that and also even those that are going

602
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,079
around and finding the material it takes

603
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:30,599
a real hashish aficionados olfactory to

604
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:33,148
to remove all of the bad it's almost

605
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:36,719
like being a broker for cannabis in the

606
00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:38,819
90s in Vancouver and saying no to 90% of

607
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,339
the material that broker had the highest

608
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:43,138
integrity and that broker got the best

609
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:44,459
contracts because the brokers that just

610
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:46,979
wanted to make their hundred bucks on

611
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,048
every pound and accepted everything that

612
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,278
people showed them you know I think I

613
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:52,648
hope you're getting the metaphor it's

614
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,659
just it was the wrong path to take which

615
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:56,788
was the greed path and so with the

616
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:59,039
hashish path you know we're constantly

617
00:26:56,788 --> 00:27:01,079
running things and seeing at the end

618
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,819
while this isn't really what I wanted

619
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,730
this isn't the resin that I wanted so

620
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:08,308
hats off to the hash makers that you

621
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:12,628
know to the rosin press with the subpar

622
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:16,589
melts and to Frenchie's hands for the

623
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:19,858
full melt six stars so let's let's move

624
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:21,778
on with Jessica and Andrew the beautiful

625
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:22,679
young couple here who are expecting a

626
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:25,079
child and

627
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,150
near future and some hashish aficionados

628
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,669
in the room they got their rosin press

629
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,930
they got their hash out and why don't

630
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,870
you guys tell us a little bit about

631
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:37,710
yourselves

632
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:39,750
thank you for that well I started I

633
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,930
started seeing plants when I was about

634
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:46,220
12 I don't know a year that was 2000

635
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:50,610
2001 2002 my uncle was growing up in

636
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:55,170
NorCal I was around plants before I was

637
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:59,069
making hash I was small-time selling

638
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:02,490
weed and smoking flour up until about

639
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:05,329
eighteen year old I started to work hard

640
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,349
to grow for myself and making

641
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:11,909
concentrates a lot more than the flower

642
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:15,809
and just started making passion beautifu

643
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,880
BHO from there we my one light turned

644
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:19,829
into four lights four lights turned into

645
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,010
ten lights and ten lights turned into a

646
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:25,019
job in with some commercial grows in the

647
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:27,059
Bay Area and from there I started taking

648
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:33,230
him material and making hash from that

649
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:37,769
and I had to hash in let's say early

650
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:39,509
2011-2012 wasn't as hyped as it was now

651
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:42,750
there wasn't a lot of people behind hash

652
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:46,349
and so it was a lot of using using the

653
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:48,779
BHO money to make my own hash so I can

654
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:52,699
smoke the hash and kind of you know make

655
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:56,490
money off the BHO from there we built

656
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:59,580
milk the hash brand up until I can

657
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,839
afford to not make pho anymore and I

658
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:04,829
sold all my pho question equipment but

659
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,259
condenser and refrigerator the

660
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:10,470
refrigeration unit set up a hash room

661
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:14,039
and from then on it's just been hash you

662
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:18,240
know that's all we make now and but now

663
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:20,940
we started from started from growing for

664
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,710
people and now we have a permit ranch up

665
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,080
in Calaveras County that were growing

666
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:28,650
our own material to make our own hash so

667
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:31,109
nice now I met Jessica about three and a

668
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,269
half years ago and she joined the team

669
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:34,879
and she's been a blessing ever since

670
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:40,180
helping me with everything

671
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:44,450
got introduced the hash in around 2013

672
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:48,890
and through that was how I learned about

673
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:52,269
hash was through Instagram seeing it on

674
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:55,759
profiles such as yourself and mica tea

675
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:58,430
and and then I I found her YouTube

676
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,759
channel bubbleman and I started watching

677
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:06,740
your videos you're making hash I believe

678
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:09,200
with Sam I'm not sure but but yeah that

679
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,980
was a great resource for me and I was so

680
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,930
intrigued but there was a way to

681
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,049
separate the trichomes without using a

682
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:23,120
chemical just ice and water and I

683
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:28,159
started reading forums and yeah just I

684
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:33,259
started I was a house consumer and then

685
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:36,710
I met Andrew 2014 the end of 2014

686
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:41,240
mm the early 2015 and then you became a

687
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:43,789
half and she suited up in the colder in

688
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,539
the start they can have me and that's

689
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:48,589
our story

690
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:50,119
yeah that's awesome about as well oh let

691
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:53,659
me put you in the road so I'm even gonna

692
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:56,839
get a read I got you I put a smile on my

693
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,640
face to see the giant bags of herb that

694
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,259
are like sitting on the counter behind

695
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,150
you guys right now I was just like damn

696
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:06,890
these guys are like seriously coming in

697
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:08,810
with like 25 30 pounds of weed the hash

698
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,400
makers it's neat to hear that you got

699
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:12,649
turned on to it through Instagram

700
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,410
because wow you know it was probably

701
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,450
only four and a half to five years ago I

702
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,019
broke my collarbone quite badly

703
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:22,069
thus it's sticking out very ugly

704
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:24,200
snowboarding up in Whistler and I was

705
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:26,839
crippled I was just like couldn't move I

706
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,730
was on my couch and I was very much on

707
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:32,329
to this sort of phone thing I got onto

708
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:34,970
Twitter within two or three weeks of it

709
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:37,369
coming out Instagram I got on within the

710
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:40,579
first month but it was an on cannabis

711
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:43,159
account it was mostly Asian people that

712
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:45,710
were on Instagram at the time a lot of

713
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,060
people from Hong Kong and I you know I

714
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,740
couldn't even read what they were saying

715
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:50,480
but it was a real photography app

716
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,279
sharing photography and as a

717
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,589
photographer I had a real affinity and

718
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,329
love for that and the way to be able to

719
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:57,709
kind of link up with people from the

720
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:59,359
other side of the world and see what

721
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,340
they're shooting and getting ideas and

722
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,259
inspirations through them it was being

723
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:05,750
crippled on my back that I finally

724
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:09,079
picked up my iPad and I thought you know

725
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:11,839
I have like 10 years of images epic

726
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:14,480
cache images 10 years of images that

727
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,819
I've been taking so I compiled them all

728
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,039
onto my iPad and I just started posting

729
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:22,279
like five or six of these images every

730
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,678
day you know probably for close to a

731
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,480
year or six months whatever it was I

732
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,580
think I posted eight hundred plus images

733
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,920
in a very short period of time and

734
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:34,099
that's how I built the BC bubbleman

735
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:37,910
account on Instagram so and I also was

736
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:43,069
inspired I mean solid 'less mind your

737
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:45,080
guys itself dab logic soil groan dr.

738
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:46,609
ladybug who i've invited in later when

739
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,799
we get a little bit of maybe in an hour

740
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:52,359
and a bit we'll do a little switch and

741
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,769
we'll get some new some new folks in the

742
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,899
full-blown inspiration to just be able

743
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:59,240
to look on your phone and see hash of

744
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,670
the utmost highest quality the six star

745
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,700
where you just know just by looking at

746
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:06,830
it there's not really any way to fake

747
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,130
that and so I've had a real appreciation

748
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:12,769
for Instagram it's neat to hear about

749
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:15,410
the past of hashish and these authors

750
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:17,389
meeting and eating hashish and now in

751
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,308
the future you have well which is now

752
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,950
the present I think they call it a

753
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:24,049
present because it is indeed a gift you

754
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,299
have all of us sharing our information

755
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:29,539
and our photos and growing cannabis and

756
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:31,669
sharing genetics and just sharing tips

757
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:33,440
and tricks on in ways to get this

758
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:37,100
product even cleaner and cleaner of

759
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,380
course one of my huge inspirations way

760
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:43,009
before Instagram existed and even way

761
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,960
before overgrow and sites like that was

762
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:47,150
with skunk man Sam even though he's very

763
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,900
very private man and he wasn't exactly

764
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:52,040
posting it out there if you were on that

765
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,840
underground scene if he went to the

766
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:56,329
cannabis cut back in the early to mid

767
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,490
90s you could maybe cross paths with Sam

768
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:01,129
maybe you'd see him speak at a large

769
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,910
cannabis and hemp conference and kind of

770
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,130
just be like

771
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,680
that stuntman Sam like there he is over

772
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,419
there and what a huge inspiration to be

773
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,880
able to finally meet him to come good

774
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:13,849
friends with him become beyond inspired

775
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:17,570
from his how she's processing even at

776
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:19,130
first just from photographing it I think

777
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,519
that that was a game-changer when the

778
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:25,099
first 99.999% gland heads was

779
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:28,699
photographed at his place in Amsterdam

780
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:30,049
that that that was as effective as

781
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,869
changing the way people thought about

782
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,580
hashish as the first water hash that was

783
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:37,668
being shared with people which made it

784
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:39,380
very easy for regular people you know

785
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:41,289
that had no knowledge whatsoever to

786
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,700
become along you know I can say for

787
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:45,619
perfect example is my mother who worked

788
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,480
for the police for 35 years and has no

789
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:50,029
cannabis knowledge whatsoever

790
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,909
I sat her down and she made some full

791
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,160
melts on her first batch ever of bubble

792
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,409
bags just because I gave her the simple

793
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,420
instructions and it's kind of like when

794
00:34:57,409 --> 00:35:01,819
you don't have this huge ego thinking

795
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,260
that it's really a lot more being done

796
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,030
than it's being done and you're just

797
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,800
like okay so I mix it up and make sure

798
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,860
it's cold I filter it through the bags i

799
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,570
spoon it out I break it up and it's sort

800
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,990
of sort of anyone can kind of do it

801
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,980
whereas you know Sam's art form was a

802
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:20,169
little bit different

803
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:24,440
getting glands that are dry sifted

804
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:27,050
removed and cleaned to that level it

805
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,329
just did not exist in our community and

806
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:32,750
even now today with a few people

807
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:34,789
learning the DVD carding static trick

808
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,769
and some other tricks it's still very

809
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:40,429
very much what I would consider the holy

810
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:42,380
grail of hashish I don't put water hash

811
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,869
down I think the highest level of water

812
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,240
hash the highest highest level six star

813
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:50,029
is is right on point with the highest

814
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:52,069
level of dry sifted resin but that's

815
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,050
going to be you know the alcohol soluble

816
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,760
terpenes the ones that don't wash out

817
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,100
and water the ones that stay present

818
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,780
right till the end and of course behind

819
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,449
me you can see some pictures I think

820
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:06,650
this one's from Cuban I think we got one

821
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:09,710
from Sam right here and yeah dry sifting

822
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:12,650
there's some large amounts of resin

823
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,750
being sifted almost 4,000 grams in about

824
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,430
ten minutes dry sifted farmers grade

825
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,869
hash

826
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:19,028
but it would be a good idea to put up

827
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,338
some fun pictures behind me so that we

828
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:23,920
could scare a beautiful hashish and the

829
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:26,139
cannabis plant that we love so much so

830
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,210
that was a wonderful history lesson from

831
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:32,578
Andrew and Jessica and I guess we're

832
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,579
gonna move up to Drew who's next in line

833
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:37,598
what do you say drew unmute your mic and

834
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,879
give us give us give us that history

835
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,400
what what name do you go under is it is

836
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,619
it dr. ladybug yeah that's cool that's

837
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,500
what I thought you know but you came on

838
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:49,809
under drew so dr. ladybug was an account

839
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,239
that I just came across he's kind of the

840
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:56,260
wild card I knew nothing about him but I

841
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:58,689
knew that his hash was 100% on point and

842
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,819
that alone is you know it's kind of like

843
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,010
how people used to ask me about legends

844
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,940
of hashish how do I get a ticket to

845
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,880
legends of hashish

846
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,829
you know I'm soma or I know soma or I'm

847
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,390
a well-known person in the industry I'm

848
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:12,640
like well that doesn't actually get you

849
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:15,190
a ticket what gets you a ticket is

850
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,960
having great hashish and so that's how

851
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,028
you got your golden ticket into this

852
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:24,909
room so give us a little history lesson

853
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:28,059
on - thank you yeah so my first exposure

854
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:33,639
to hash was when I was in high school I

855
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:36,609
was probably 14 or 15 and the alert we

856
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:40,028
were smoking a lot of weed and even at

857
00:37:36,608 --> 00:37:44,108
that age and then my buddy went to

858
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:47,650
Europe we went to Amsterdam for about

859
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:50,348
two weeks or so and he brought back some

860
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,869
hash in a little shampoo bottle he

861
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:56,349
wrapped wrapped in cellophane ah the

862
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:58,838
classic shampoo bottle PS it's not safe

863
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:04,150
to smuggle in shampoo bottles anymore

864
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:05,230
all right yeah so he brought something

865
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,358
that back and was really it was really

866
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,460
nice-looking it was like it was blond it

867
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,469
was like no the old style hash of like

868
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:15,519
pressed as she - it was really nice it

869
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:17,798
was who's pretty melty - and but you

870
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,929
know that we don't really like know like

871
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:23,288
what it was like the process how to make

872
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:25,118
it really all we knew is that it was you

873
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:28,829
know made with ice of water and it was

874
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,829
you know a natural extract

875
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:33,480
we don't really see too much of it other

876
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:38,070
than that so I didn't see it for a while

877
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:41,849
but then when I started growing totally

878
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:44,880
after high school when I was about 19 my

879
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:47,159
growing mentor he would make hash from

880
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,980
his trim he had he actually had the bone

881
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,149
bags he had the one gallon bags you know

882
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,090
back then we were just throwing him like

883
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:56,550
you know like little 4x4 tents so and

884
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,519
you know we weren't move the concept of

885
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,260
washing cool flowers back then never

886
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:05,690
even crossed our mind it was offered

887
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:08,970
includes like I'll trim run but um so I

888
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:11,039
started making hash because I preferred

889
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:12,809
smoking hash they I pretty much didn't

890
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,750
smoke any of the flower that I threw all

891
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:18,110
that stuff was sold and I just ran all

892
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:23,179
my trim and just like smoked that and

893
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:25,440
the rest is nothing stages hash is a

894
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:28,259
good really big part of my life that's

895
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,590
what sure did take it a small break from

896
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,970
it for a while over I've been doing this

897
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,340
on and off for about twelve years now

898
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:36,869
and right in the middle I did take a

899
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,440
break stepped away for a little while

900
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:46,349
went back to school but um you know ever

901
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:50,849
since 2013 or so I got a job in the

902
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:53,519
industry as a delivery driver and just

903
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,989
to make some connections and I made some

904
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,030
connections and you know made some

905
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:59,759
things happen and you know now now I'm

906
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:02,250
here and it's actually really crazy just

907
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,490
surreal moment to you be here beauty

908

00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:09,359
connections you made growers are you

00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:53,080
fell in love with hashish because this

926
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:58,960
guy absolutely is in love with hashish

927

Zeus right there where some of my fellow

941
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:44,079
leech writer when I was a kid I grew up

942
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:47,949
reading Thousand and One Nights and

943
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:51,170
before even speaking ash I was he

944
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:54,139
dreaming of time being in juice County

945
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:57,619
your answer about Jana Cooper oh and our

946
00:41:54,139 --> 00:42:00,949
Zoo Story so that the first time when I

947
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:04,699
smoked which was like it like in I was

948
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:08,059
17 I smoked with special

949
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:12,909
lebanese-american kids and I was

950
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:16,250
introduced to their family so that I was

951
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:20,480
like I was I've always been in that

952
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:23,539
future flower for me it's just was just

953
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,820
the materials that all the pleasures

954
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:30,710
raised in everything was in Elysium and

955
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,470
when I was a kid that didn't believe

956
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:37,519
that it would become illegal in my

957
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:41,059
lifetime so to feel like I wasn't really

958
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:44,480
the stem of the world I want and I've

959
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:47,239
earned into country where it was not

960
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,940
illegal but accepted you know what I

961
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:53,629
mean so I can eat a bunch of ash funky

962
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,920
and then I went to India where it's

963
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,720
religious

964
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,510
it's part of the body journey its

965
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,778
machina Shalom is dedicated to the card

966
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:06,099
the grant was born in the drop of the

967
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:09,440
a-league seal of realize that fall from

968
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:10,309
from the sky una in the Himalaya is like

969
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,679
it sir

970
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:18,528
it takes a good dimension that was much

971
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:21,980
bigger than what they had experienced

972
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:23,900
before you know what I mean and and then

973
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,548
when I came here to the states I

974
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:31,220
realized that it was actually also

975
00:43:25,548 --> 00:43:33,469
medi-cal it was discoveries like I'm so

976
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:38,179
much in love it because it's a long

977
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:40,368
story I was 17 years old I'm 61 and I've

978
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:44,088
been smoking a short that time like my

979
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:48,048
life is truly dedicated to it I didn't

980
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:55,818
really know it until lately but it's

981
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:57,710
what it is beautiful beautiful I love to

982
00:43:55,818 --> 00:44:02,298
hear it I love to hear the histories I

983
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:04,250
think I was just D jazzing my banger

984
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:05,869
from a mildly hot rip I took while you

985
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,599
were talking about your love of hashish

986
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:11,000
I was actually looking for a little

987
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,099
piece of hash that I had from Roshan

988
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,630
that you guys made together on the

989
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,160
Sunshine Coast I was gonna smoke some

990
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:21,318
Frenchy hash while you were talking

991
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:22,730
about your love for hashish but I wish I

992
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:25,788
would have gotten over and seen you guys

993
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,619
I felt kind of bad that I never that I

994
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:30,049
never made it over I was pretty hurt

995
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:34,640
what when you came over here I was quite

996
00:44:30,048 --> 00:44:37,309
injured so I wasn't really uh along to

997
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,739
me yeah I wasn't traveling you know it

998
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:42,259
was it was kind of the first time I got

999
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:44,959
so hurt that hashish just wasn't enough

1000
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:49,338
I needed to I needed I needed the time

1001
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,990
to heal so we cheat a little bit yeah I

1002
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:55,009
was eating it exactly I had some

1003
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:57,439
capsules made with some CBD and some no

1004
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:58,278
no but I mean that it instead of smoking

1005
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,490
yo OH

1006
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:03,230
chewing just right on the hash just

1007
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:07,669
nothing else you don't you don't do

1008
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:08,710
nothing but eat eat Acharya no idea how

1009
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,329
much

1010
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,820
thankfully I did a little bit of that in

1011
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:15,799
India with facade do the she vide side

1012
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,780
you would always make we make us eat a

1013
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,970
little piece of the Nepali cream that we

1014
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,040
had while we were drinking our chai tea

1015
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:25,069
out of the cups that were literally

1016
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:26,719
handmade that morning and then they they

1017
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:29,030
would smash the cups every time they

1018
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,519
finished drinking like a Mazel Tov boom

1019
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:33,410
big giant pile of clay cups pour a

1020
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,360
little water on it at night next morning

1021
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:38,179
the guys forming cups out of the clay

1022
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,550
again that [ __ ] blew my mind actually

1023
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:42,859
the simplicity and the beautifulness and

1024
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:45,830
the lack of waste in being able to just

1025
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:49,190
recycle your clay cups over and over and

1026
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:54,440
over again was was just too much for my

1027
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:56,900
young men India before it was open to

1028
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,780
the outside world when everything was

1029
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,210
made in India it was understand place

1030
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:05,780
like I'm afraid to go back to India

1031
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:08,690
because when I was in India at ski type

1032
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,540
of cows it's like every single amino

1033
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:15,320
coca-cola no nothing from the outside

1034
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:17,719
world it was like that little bubble of

1035
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,059
I'd of tiny place

1036
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:21,859
it was still like that when I went as

1037
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:23,599
well Sam and I were talking about it

1038
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,059
just the other day that India really is

1039
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,009
the new China that it's that it's very

1040
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:29,840
very different from the way it was I'm

1041
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,490
sure that those bubbles can still be

1042
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:36,289
located but they're probably a lot

1043
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:38,959
smaller than they were I'm writing story

1044
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:42,170
about when I was in the eighties in a

1045
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,780
mountain in India they were but asked me

1046
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:48,139
to tell the story of my life and it's

1047
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,510
odd but I can write it an adventure that

1048
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:52,789
I remember in the mountain or doing

1049
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:56,270
stuff left and like this is much easier

1050
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:58,940
and I've talked with people while they

1051
00:46:56,269 --> 00:47:03,170
are now and I see the hope that goes to

1052
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:07,760
Malin Aziz count is chaser when I was in

1053
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:11,300
nine eighties or when Mila was in Milan

1054
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,750
I know in the late 60s early 70s that

1055
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:17,600
was like under the world is where you

1056
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:19,559
were in the middle of nowhere it field

1057
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,509
of

1058
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,549
canidius it like if they were no

1059
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:28,780
connection you were like to us he days

1060
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:32,110
walk from the closer's hood then it

1061
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:34,690
takes a dimension where regimes of

1062
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:37,690
plants where you are the terroir where

1063
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:44,200
you stick it in your honey make it that

1064
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:48,369
value the collecting it's not you making

1065
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:49,689
it it's you getting Zaire doing it you

1066
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:51,519
know what I mean it's like what I'm

1067
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:55,720
trying to explain to the keyboardist

1068
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:57,429
that yeah people kind of appreciated

1069
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:59,919
that I'd made it myself

1070
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:02,619
but the question was when did you make

1071
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,480
that Chavez in India when did you go in

1072
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:07,989
my Hawker to make your art show in

1073
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,389
Pakistan or in Nepal that the value of

1074
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:13,869
the regime the value of the reason it's

1075
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:15,969
your genetic and your farmer and when

1076
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:18,639
it's in horns the knowledge that is put

1077
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:20,439
and the dedication behind that's the

1078
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:23,289
value of the listen I cannot make

1079
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,909
quality if I have not not given the

1080
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:31,090
quality or the picture of my own my ig

1081
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:35,019
that so credit to my father I'm good at

1082
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:39,370
what I do but I received that quality I

1083
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:41,650
don't make it I can and and sit in a

1084
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:45,159
certain way and thought storm it into

1085
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,210
ashes and age it and make something

1086
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:49,420
difference

1087
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:52,329
Thunder actually lose the regime that I

1088
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:56,530
collected but I need that quality of

1089
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:57,969
lose regime to get to what I can create

1090
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,750
waves you know what I mean like who

1091
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:03,909
might make her like no I agree 100% in

1092
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,889
fact what it reminds me of is a quote

1093
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:08,949
that I came up up with a long time ago

1094
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:10,839
which sort of boils down everything you

1095
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:15,039
just said which is we are the unveil

1096
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:17,380
errs of the flame we unveil the flame we

1097
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,269
can't unveil it if it's not flame we're

1098
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,890
just gonna unveil some other thing but

1099
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:23,619
we are the unveil errs of the flame the

1100
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:25,809
hash makers and that's what we do and I

1101
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:27,549
think it's very liked that you mentioned

1102
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:29,409
that we don't you know in so many words

1103
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:32,000
that it's not really a great idea to get

1104
00:49:29,409 --> 00:49:33,559
a big ego about you know

1105
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,690
being a hash maker it's great if you're

1106
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:37,880
great at what you do but really you're

1107
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,820
receiving something you're unveiling

1108
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:44,840
something it's not like you're making

1109
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:47,780
anything yeah we will Dwain make her

1110

1114
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:00,920

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,630
doobies in it throw it in your back

1136
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,640
pocket you don't got to worry about it

1137
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,650
you know what I mean but um other than

1138
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:49,489
that I just you know when I was 14 15

1139
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,039
years old

1140
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:53,659
one of my friends Dan we found a bottle

1141
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:56,389
of alcohol sitting at his house and

1142
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:57,739
there was a bunch of stems in it and you

1143
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:59,690
got a mind I'm from Florida

1144
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:01,699
so we didn't have access to the most

1145
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,579
chronic ganja that you can get on earth

1146
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:06,109
so we had to you know use alcohol and

1147
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:08,179
other methods like these extraction

1148
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,250
methods to get high you know what I mean

1149
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:12,230
the ganja was just so garbage that you

1150
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,780
had to do an alcohol wash on it to get

1151
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:16,460
high so this dude's dad pretty much

1152
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,769
taught us the way of doing alcohol

1153
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:22,099
washes and then after alcohol washes

1154
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:24,679
came to BHO that was about 17 18 years

1155
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:27,619
old and I've only been making ice water

1156
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:30,409
extracts since I'm like 26 so about four

1157
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:32,299
years now and um it's life changing man

1158
00:51:30,409 --> 00:51:33,529
honestly like back in the day I didn't

1159
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,269
really believe it you know I always

1160
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,970
thought it was like a gimmick all make

1161
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:39,469
ice water hash don't make that BHO like

1162
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,209
you always fridge did man like you

1163
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:42,589
always preach it like I remember back in

1164
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,360
the day you always appreciate you didn't

1165
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,960
even want to hear about [ __ ] BHO and

1166
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,430
we would still talk about be

1167
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,199
Joe you know but you didn't like that

1168
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:51,598
[ __ ] you didn't you didn't support it

1169
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,179
none of that so you know ventually I got

1170
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,280
a battle instead of your bags once I got

1171
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:58,710
your bags dude that was it I got your

1172
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,990
bags I got a [ __ ] machine a 20 gallon

1173
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,400
bubble now machine and we started

1174
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:04,379
running as much material as we could

1175
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,880
find here at humble you know and it

1176
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,980
literally changed my life man it made it

1177
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,869
so where like I realized you could get a

1178
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,210
bomb-ass product without even

1179
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:13,200
endangering your life at all at all you

1180
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,608
don't got to worry about a fire you

1181
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:16,559
gotta worry about exploding you're gonna

1182
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:18,420
worry about [ __ ] you just turn the

1183
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,619
[ __ ] dial of the Machine and [ __ ]

1184
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,380
you're safe you're good to go so

1185
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:24,539
thatthat to me was like life-changing so

1186
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,760
I mean I don't know like as far as the

1187
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:28,710
history goes it starts with just trying

1188
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,109
to get as high as I could because the

1189
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:33,000
Ganju is garbage moving on so you know

1190
00:52:31,108 --> 00:52:35,069
better ganja I grew up back in in

1191
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,039
Florida too so I had access to my own

1192
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:39,330
ganja that I could blast with butane but

1193
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:42,449
there was no way when I lived in Florida

1194
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:43,920
that I could ever wash it we just simply

1195
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:46,588
couldn't grow we couldn't produce enough

1196
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,139
to make it worth washing but now that

1197
00:52:46,588 --> 00:52:50,670
I'm in Humboldt County let's be real

1198
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:52,319
there's [ __ ] ganja everywhere there's

1199
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,280
like six thousand gardens around me you

1200
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,410
know it's [ __ ] everywhere it's like

1201
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,269
water here so you can have access to

1202
00:52:55,409 --> 00:53:00,809
anything clean material shitty material

1203
00:52:57,269 --> 00:53:03,119
trim nug Drive fresh frozen whatever so

1204
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:04,519
now it's like you know what else is

1205
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,740
there to do

1206
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:10,139
damn straight dude I loved all of that

1207
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:12,989
that was I love that your dad was into

1208
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:14,069
making paraphernalia and like and so

1209
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,659
when you were growing up were you kind

1210
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:18,750
of like looking up to him or kind of

1211
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:21,000
like whoa looking up to honor percent

1212
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:22,920
man like I'm doing it for him like he's

1213
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,869
not here anymore he passed away in 2011

1214
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,369
for Parkinson's

1215
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:28,108
he always told me get the county man you

1216
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,990
know do something with it so we're

1217
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:32,420
trying nice well mad respect to your old

1218
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:35,368
man for real

1219
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:38,550
inspiring you to get into all of this

1220
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:41,700
[ __ ] go to Cali and I love that Humboldt

1221
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:44,220
is like it's water everywhere I remember

1222
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:46,588
that that was BC in the 90s now sure I

1223
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:49,259
mean I could find it for a lot of places

1224
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:52,619
but there's definitely not 6000 gardens

1225
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,599
around me yeah literally is everywhere

1226
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:56,608
up here man but it's nice it's nice that

1227
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,530
access you play with a lot of different

1228
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,819
present you don't just get one you know

1229
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,740
you don't just get one girl

1230
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,660
where's perspective of resident you get

1231
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:05,039
greenhouse you get outdoor you get

1232
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:06,719
indoor you get all these different

1233
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,849
varieties of resin and you get to work

1234
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,949
with them so you get to learn dry resin

1235
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:13,349
grease you resin what's really better

1236
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:15,659
what's really better you know the greasy

1237
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:16,679
[ __ ] that turns into oil in your jar as

1238
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:18,929
soon as you step outside

1239
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:20,549
is it the drier stuff that stays more of

1240
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:22,589
a hash but when you touch it to the nail

1241
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:24,539
it still melts like six star you know

1242
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:26,010
you start to understand like what foods

1243
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:28,110
they're feeding the environments they're

1244
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:30,240
growing in its colder climate better is

1245
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:32,490
hotter climate better are salts better

1246
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:35,579
or are organics better you know you

1247
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:37,979
start to oh yeah prison to kind of get

1248
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:40,139
grasp on it you know you get an overview

1249
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:42,449
that almost no one else has and that's

1250
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:44,789
what another part of my lock was when I

1251
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:48,480
started running Renee back in the in the

1252
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:50,340
late 90s that that suddenly you know my

1253
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,900
buddy had a ten liner then he had a 30

1254
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,640
lighter then he had a hundred lighter

1255
00:54:51,900 --> 00:55:04,260
than he had two hundred lighters and he

1256
00:54:53,639 --> 00:55:07,440
was just as nice a resin and as

1257
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:09,300
high-yield as he giving his bud and that

1258
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,349
was the beginning of you know then all

1259
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,180
of a sudden I just started selling

1260
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,980
everyone bags and before I sold the bags

1261
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:17,129
I'd make hash with their material so I

1262
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:19,829
also got to make people's hash with with

1263
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:21,539
so many different growers so many

1264
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:22,980
different genetics every one of them

1265
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:25,500
thinking that they had the best [ __ ] on

1266
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,960
the planet but in reality just like you

1267
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,119
said they were all growing in in

1268
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,039
different enough ways that the resin

1269
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:35,519
itself was completely different and once

1270
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:38,670
you see like six to ten different resins

1271
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:40,500
then you realize whoa this is wait no

1272
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:43,230
wonder the numbers are the way they are

1273
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,090
for me the numbers were simple I wanted

1274
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:47,579
people to be inspired to use these bags

1275
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:49,829
to make great hash and the fact of the

1276
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:51,569
matter is most people ran schwag most

1277
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:54,840
people didn't get excited you can hear

1278
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:56,670
around 2012 and 2013 from just the

1279
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,370
stories on the panel there seemed to

1280
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:01,409
become a shift into making water hash

1281
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:04,049
again because you know the majority of

1282
00:56:01,409 --> 00:56:06,299
people that are involved in cannabis and

1283
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:08,519
this isn't a diss against oil because

1284
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,370
you've seen me have BHO makers and

1285
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,559
sellers and buyers here on hash Church I

1286
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:15,089
think if it's done at the highest level

1287
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,369
you know I certainly don't want to

1288
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:20,070
prohibit it just like you said I don't

1289
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:22,739
necessarily want to personally support

1290
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:24,930
it and do it so I prefer these methods

1291
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:27,299
I've been pushing it on people for so

1292
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:29,279
long but the numbers are that I would

1293
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,260
work all these different batches to find

1294
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,000
the really great ones and the majority

1295
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,760
of people out in the world didn't have

1296
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,440
that luxury they just had what they had

1297
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,370
and if it didn't hit that water hash

1298
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,679
lottery it wasn't gonna be nice yeah

1299
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:44,940
100% man I figure girl to get a lot more

1300
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,069
experience working with different

1301
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,349
growers materials if you just work with

1302
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,789
one growers material I mean you can be

1303
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:53,099
put on the spot one day where you got to

1304
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:55,079
watch someone stuff and you look like a

1305
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:56,279
noob you look like a dumbass cuz you

1306
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,569
have no idea what to do with this

1307
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,670
material because you've only watched

1308
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:02,039
like fresh frozen right out of the

1309
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:03,990
garden nugs and you've only got this

1310
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,420
result you don't know what it is to have

1311
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:09,119
this result like what is it to have 40%

1312
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:11,280
rosin from your house or 60% bras and

1313
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,469
instead of 75 80 % on everything you

1314
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,660
press and I don't believe whole plant

1315
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:17,849
fresh frozen it's honestly the best way

1316
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:19,769
like I don't believe that's the best way

1317
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:21,449
man like I've done enough washes now to

1318
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,460
where you can watch hopefully a fresh

1319
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:25,289
frozen and still not get 6 star and your

1320
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,869
yields are suffering like a [ __ ]

1321
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:30,239
so it's like if you really think about

1322
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:31,679
it if you watch the same material let's

1323
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,899
say you get the same grower you watched

1324
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:35,849
a 20 pound bag of this [ __ ] fresh frozen

1325
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,760
let me watch a 20 pound bag of meat [ __ ]

1326
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:40,889
dry if you can achieve the same melt

1327
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,710
from dry material how the [ __ ] is that

1328
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:45,809
not better when you yield almost 1/2

1329
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,340
path more let's just say you you look

1330
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:49,139
like half more of what you would have

1331
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,880
got had you stopped on the French froze

1332
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:52,379
and watches how is that not better dude

1333
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,300
like I don't understand that well this

1334
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,920
is because their perspective the

1335
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,300
majority of people are coming from a

1336
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,789
different perspective they're coming

1337
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:02,490
from the I just want my three and a half

1338
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:04,679
star to look like four star and I want

1339
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:07,439
to sheet that melt effect so I'm gonna

1340
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:10,409
microplane my hash and I'm also going to

1341
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,340
run it fresh frozen so I can save any

1342
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:15,389
sort of terpenes that might be lost plus

1343
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,010
potentially even get a little moisture

1344
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:19,710
in my hash so when people hold a flame

1345
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:22,050
to it it looks like it's bubbling but

1346
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,909
that's not really the right path to take

1347
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:25,769
that's not the passionate you're not

1348
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:27,779
being truthful to yourself

1349
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:30,750
you're you're allowing yourself to be

1350
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:33,240
you know it's crazy how profit margin

1351
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:35,550
always creates deception and how when

1352
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:37,769
you make it about almost like spiritual

1353
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:40,560
I won't say religion but spiritual or

1354
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:43,800
your passion your love that you want to

1355
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,420
do better than just make money you know

1356
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,610
and and we all know that you can make

1357
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,039
money blasting anything and turning it

1358
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:52,740
into distillate and adding fruit turps

1359
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:54,809
and throwing it into sheep pens that are

1360
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:58,500
probably in themselves not very healthy

1361
00:58:54,809 --> 00:59:00,360
to inhale through yeah sure I mean like

1362
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,980
I've seen finger press hash stuff that

1363
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,230
you can put on a paper finger press it

1364
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,519
out completely ready for that and as

1365
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:07,559
soon as you touch it to the nail it's

1366
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,110
just char all over the [ __ ] place

1367
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:11,969
like it's not six star but like people

1368
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:13,530
they don't understand it just because

1369
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:16,349
you can finger press it and it's greasy

1370
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:18,810
does not make it six star melt qualities

1371
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:20,759
like and taking a note ed dab that's not

1372
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:23,789
justified either you can't take four

1373
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,530
star at [ __ ] 250 degrees and go yo

1374
00:59:23,789 --> 00:59:27,539
look at the six star because as soon as

1375
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:29,040
I take a real dab of it I'm gonna see

1376
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:30,779
the real char and that's I don't I don't

1377
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,489
know man I figures a lot of gimmicks out

1378
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,100
there right now well we used to just

1379
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:38,179
call it full melt and when it was not

1380
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:42,809
full mouth it was foment and so that's

1381
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:45,389
yeah the foam mount that's good [ __ ]

1382
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:47,489
right there yeah all right well we're

1383
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:48,929
gonna move over to I just can't wait to

1384
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:50,789
get into an actual conversation with

1385
00:59:48,929 --> 00:59:52,889
everyone involved so let's get through

1386
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:57,659
the last three folks on the panel here

1387
00:59:52,889 --> 01:00:00,900
we got skunk man Sam howdy howdy howdy

1388
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:03,269
howdy howdy howdy you gonna tell us when

1389
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,970
you got into your love of cannabis and

1390
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:09,480
how well you should not when I first

1391
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:13,799
started smoking hashish was actually

1392
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:17,820
quite a while ago it was in 1965 I lived

1393
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:20,850
in Hollywood and I I was able to obtain

1394
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:24,030
some red Lebanese we what we normally

1395
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:26,400
saw there of course was Mexican which

1396
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:29,220
was quite inexpensive that was fifty

1397
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,320
dollars a kilo at the time whereas red

1398
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:34,819
Lebanese was like a hundred dollars an

1399
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:38,059
ounce I think it was $80 an ounce and

1400
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:39,720
that was a bit rich for my blood but I

1401
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:41,940
wanted to try

1402
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:45,000
and I did and the first time I tried it

1403
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:50,940
it is I just well Wow

1404
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:54,980
but trying to get it for my in poverty

1405
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:59,750
status it wasn't very easy to to keep it

1406
01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:03,900
but then in 1970 I traveled to Morocco

1407
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:08,190
specifically to check out hashish and at

1408
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:11,490
the time in 1970 hashish was maybe $20

1409
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:16,108
to $100 a kilo for the very super-super

1410
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:19,049
in Morocco and depending on the quality

1411
01:01:16,108 --> 01:01:22,980
and quality 20 to 100 bucks akela

1412
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:25,740
doesn't seem expensive today it really

1413
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:29,579
started my journey how they made it in

1414
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:33,229
Morocco and within a year I had

1415
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:37,230
continued my travels and over the hippy

1416
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:39,420
hashish trail had made it through Turkey

1417
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:44,010
Afghanistan Pakistan India and Nepal

1418
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:48,750
where hashish was made in like Manali

1419
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:54,080
Kulu Kashmir also up in Kathmandu and

1420
01:01:48,750 --> 01:02:01,739
their surrounding areas in Nepal later

1421
01:01:54,079 --> 01:02:04,650
in nineteen the mid 1980s we were

1422
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:07,469
growing cannabis here in Amsterdam

1423
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:12,000
and we noticed or I noticed actually

1424
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:15,989
that resin was falling off a little bit

1425
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:21,570
of the really really good buds so dried

1426
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:25,679
buds so I went out and bought a silk

1427
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:28,039
screen and did all the manicuring on top

1428
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:32,329
of it just to see what would happen and

1429
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:35,239
I was able to collect dry set that was

1430
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:37,230
good enough to melt and bubble I

1431
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:39,509
couldn't even believe that the first

1432
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:42,929
time I smoked it in a melting bubbles

1433
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:45,900
but once I had collected resin that was

1434
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:51,230
really really clean like that and I saw

1435
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:53,820
it melting bubble it really changed

1436
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:56,429
what I started smoking because I had

1437
01:02:53,820 --> 01:03:00,440
been smoking the herb in massive amounts

1438
01:02:56,429 --> 01:03:04,649
and after that I really switched over to

1439
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:06,960
my own resin and it also helped my lungs

1440
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:09,869
quite a bit because I had a tendency

1441
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,420
just to spit when I woke up in the

1442
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:14,819
morning and sort of dark discolored [ __ ]

1443
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:17,070
would come out and after I started

1444
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:23,850
smoking resin only that cleared up

1445
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:25,110
really really good the other thing I

1446
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:28,309
wanted to mention

1447
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:32,070
besides how I got into it was why

1448
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:34,670
different kinds of hashish traditional

1449
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:39,480
production is fundamentally different

1450
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:43,260
for example in Afghanistan they make dry

1451
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:47,519
cept as in Lebanon Morocco and Turkey

1452
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:52,410
and several other countries and whereas

1453
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:57,440
in Nepal they make hand rub from more

1454
01:03:52,409 --> 01:04:01,259
ganja plants than hashish plants and

1455
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:05,639
what why is it that ganja like Thai weed

1456
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:09,900
and other countries like in Colombia and

1457
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:13,559
other countries is mostly just THC well

1458
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:16,860
whereas Afghan often has significant

1459
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:20,219
amounts of ever to have Knights the

1460
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:23,610
basic reason is that ganja farmers can

1461
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:26,309
smoke each plant or the best looking

1462
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:29,160
plants they grow and save the seeds for

1463
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:31,170
the next year of the best most resinous

1464
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:34,230
plants that have the effects in potency

1465
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:36,750
they prefer and over years and years and

1466
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:40,710
years of the farmers doing this the

1467
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:43,309
plants eventually are really just THC

1468
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:48,119
and the terpenes that they prefer

1469
01:04:43,309 --> 01:04:51,049
whereas hashish farmers for imported

1470
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:53,670
rice hashish farmers like in Afghanistan

1471
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:56,789
they don't really smoke individual

1472
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:59,690
plants they never do they smoke resin

1473
01:04:56,789 --> 01:05:02,369
made from a whole field of plants and

1474
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:04,119
what they do is they save the seeds from

1475
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:07,929
the plants with the most

1476
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:12,369
but that resin can be THC or it can be a

1477
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:15,759
THC CBD mix or it can even be just CBD

1478
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:19,390
they have no way to judge what the resin

1479
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:22,030
of a single plant is so they save the

1480
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:24,460
seeds from all the plants that have lots

1481
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:28,810
of resin regardless of what that resin

1482
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:32,079
is and over the years of doing this with

1483
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:35,679
the farmers end up with this 25% of the

1484
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:38,619
plants are high in THC 25% of Myr high

1485
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:45,098
in CBD and 50% of them are high in THC

1486
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:48,970
CBD so it makes the dry scent in

1487
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:51,700
Afghanistan quite different from the

1488
01:05:48,969 --> 01:05:56,019
Himalayan hand rub ganja plants which

1489
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:59,309
are predominantly THC oh it's funny

1490
01:05:56,019 --> 01:06:05,050
though some some smokers actually prefer

1491
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:07,119
Afghan with CBD and I guarantee you if

1492
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:11,500
you smoke Afghan resin you get high as a

1493
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:13,240
kite but it's a bit different and some

1494
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,460
of the old traditional smokers used to

1495
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:20,529
say that they preferred Himalayan hand

1496
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:23,889
rub because it was higher and more Airy

1497
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:27,579
and Afghan was more physical and more

1498
01:06:23,889 --> 01:06:31,469
stoned even though the Afghan was a bit

1499
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:34,410
cleaner resin the hand rub was a

1500
01:06:31,469 --> 01:06:37,318
different cannabinoid makeup so it was

1501
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:41,710
different

1502
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:45,068
also all traditional dry said - was made

1503
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:48,699
from seeded plants not unseated cincy

1504
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:50,769
and seeding plants will reduce the

1505
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:54,219
cannabinoids interpreting percentages in

1506
01:06:50,769 --> 01:06:57,309
the case of terpenes by even slightly

1507
01:06:54,219 --> 01:07:02,919
more than half so it fundamentally

1508
01:06:57,309 --> 01:07:05,469
changes the nature of the resin well I

1509
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,588
will say thank you Sam because I enjoyed

1510
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:09,909
all of that thoroughly from the

1511
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:11,980
ridiculous amount of hashish producing

1512
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:15,309
countries that you visited early on in

1513
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:16,719
your hash smoking career right into the

1514
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:17,170
knowledge that he dropped right at the

1515
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:18,399
end

1516
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:20,858
that I'm sure a lot of people haven't

1517
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,710
really considered choosing from a field

1518
01:07:20,858 --> 01:07:26,409
to grow seed from versus single plants

1519
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:29,019
over many many generations a very cool

1520
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:31,618
topic to to consider maybe we'll get

1521
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:33,730
more into that when we talk about

1522
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:35,798
hashish making here in the near future

1523
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:40,000
after we go through the last two

1524
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:43,869
panelists and we are at Johnny B welcome

1525
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,530
Johnny B welcome you guys how is

1526
01:07:43,869 --> 01:07:46,530
everybody today

1527
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:52,568
I'm surrounded by hash I got half stuck

1528
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,930
to two knees from like Afghan old house

1529
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:57,849
I got big balls a hash I got dry sift

1530
01:07:55,929 --> 01:08:00,250
that's some of the first hash we ever

1531
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:02,829
made together in 2012 but it came back

1532
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:06,670
from Amsterdam and I met you but that

1533
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:08,829
means my straight house [ __ ] started

1534
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:10,630
smoking probably in the early 80s and

1535
01:08:08,829 --> 01:08:11,680
that was that Lebanese blonde hash that

1536
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:13,930
he picked up the SkyTrain

1537
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:15,219
or you got some box score P and black

1538
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:18,789
cash and with a cold snap on it

1539
01:08:15,219 --> 01:08:21,369
sometimes it was like wow and you know

1540
01:08:18,789 --> 01:08:23,528
what he's smokin hash for a long time

1541
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:25,179
and what really came down to it and was

1542
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:27,219
everyone's people don't know I think I

1543
01:08:25,179 --> 01:08:29,020
fell about injured really bad I started

1544
01:08:27,219 --> 01:08:33,069
using different concentrates from my

1545
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:36,400
pain control and I was using a lot of a

1546
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:38,080
lot of ganja for that then in 2012 when

1547
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,778
I met you on the plane we were chatting

1548
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:43,630
I came back and I wanted to bring you

1549
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:46,509
some of that cyst that I just made you

1550
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:48,850
show me here to clean it yeah we carted

1551
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:52,270
that we carted that [ __ ] for an hour in

1552
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:55,088
oh my god and you know what we put that

1553
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:57,850
on that screen and that stuff bubbled

1554
01:08:55,088 --> 01:08:59,979
like I've never seen before

1555
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,960
and it was just like it was a life

1556
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:04,000
changer at the same time what it did for

1557
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,520
me you saw how it changed smells like

1558
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,798
that one man did everything you know

1559
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,989
then I mean I've been growing my own

1560
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:13,088
because of what happened and I've always

1561
01:09:10,988 --> 01:09:15,338
been doing my concentrates but I never

1562
01:09:13,088 --> 01:09:18,130
made any pho with any of my products

1563
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:20,140
east always me was all about this first

1564
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:22,630
balance which I talked about I would

1565
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:24,279
trim my plants above my screens it hit

1566
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:26,170
the screen that would clean that up and

1567
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:29,370
then when I met you I had different

1568
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:30,930
screens then I started getting different

1569
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:34,260
things and then I started washing my

1570
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:36,480
house differently and you know what it

1571
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:38,640
changed my life it totally changed my

1572
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:41,219
life on how it would be able to affect

1573
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,720
me on a daily level for my pain and

1574
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,280
stuff like that so I realized how much

1575
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,390
that concentrates we're working better

1576
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:47,460
than the flowers

1577
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:50,090
how much cleaner it was than using the

1578
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:53,430
be a chose or anything like that

1579
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:56,600
today it's uh it's a boat like I ran out

1580
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:59,220
to the garage half an hour before church

1581
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,200
grab some sip from a trim been through

1582
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:03,090
it on the screens I did the static

1583
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:06,869
little sip that we're talking about with

1584
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:10,850
the DVD cleaned up some beautiful blonde

1585
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:13,739
foam elm hash they do work with you guys

1586
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:15,450
talk about hash because it's just like I

1587
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:19,819
don't know it's been around my life for

1588
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:23,399
thirty years and I've been growing for

1589
01:10:19,819 --> 01:10:25,229
since late 80s and I've always had

1590
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:27,599
different ways of being able to have

1591
01:10:25,229 --> 01:10:29,429
that try clone and really learning and

1592
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,260
seeing the difference over the years and

1593
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:32,760
how it came and being on the panel here

1594
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,199
and talking to you guys about what is

1595
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,210
where they were talking about here today

1596
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:38,929
is this plant and how we're able to

1597
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:41,850
extract it and get some fun medicine

1598
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:42,659
yeah awesome awesome Johnny be awesome

1599
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:44,310
give thanks

1600
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:45,630
well we'll finish it off well actually

1601
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:48,630
we won't finish it off because I'm

1602
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:51,239
pretty sure soil groans Sal and Cuban

1603
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:54,210
grower are waiting in the ranks for you

1604
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:55,949
know in the next maybe thirty or so

1605
01:10:54,210 --> 01:11:00,390
minutes we'll get them in but right now

1606
01:10:55,949 --> 01:11:02,819
we've got the dank Duchess who's who

1607
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:03,300
wasn't finding the link but we made it

1608
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:05,549
work

1609
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,739
okay don't you see what I lost the link

1610
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:10,500
somewhere it just lost in the ether but

1611
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:13,079
hello good morning everybody my name is

1612
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:17,640
ink that is so the way I got into

1613
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:19,109
hashish was okay oh wait one sec one sec

1614
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,180
sorry I think you might need to play

1615
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:22,799
with your mic it's it's am I the only

1616
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:25,020
one that's hearing that the way it's

1617
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,800
coming through did other people hear

1618
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:31,140
that as well it's a little choppy for me

1619
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,720
yeah choppy exactly so it might just be

1620
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,980
the unplug and plug your mic into the

1621
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,980
computer sometimes that helps

1622
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:45,550
how's that I don't know hello it's still

1623
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:47,380
a little bit choppy it's not too bad I

1624
01:11:45,550 --> 01:12:00,190
can deal with it if everyone else can

1625
01:11:47,380 --> 01:12:01,510
deal with it look at that the lat Villa

1626
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:03,099
we get to the last one and it's like

1627
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:08,260
technical difficulties we'll figure it

1628
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:10,390
out is it like working out not working

1629
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:14,460
it seems to have a little bit of a

1630
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:16,619
feedback towards the end of your speech

1631
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,119
I'm sure that's not just my cadence

1632
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:39,039
could I think it's your mic take your

1633
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:40,599
mic away from your mouth oh you push

1634
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,760
your mouse into the center of the screen

1635
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,990
so those icons at the top appear and

1636
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,360
then you go to the one that looks like a

1637
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:48,340
Wi-Fi one yeah when you put the mouse

1638
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:52,269
over it'll say a just bandwidth about

1639
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:59,079
medium how's me yeah I don't know if

1640
01:12:52,270 --> 01:13:01,660
it's a I think it's this is super

1641
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:03,939
unfortunate I know I'm super bummed

1642
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:05,710
maybe you can restart your computer and

1643
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:08,099
go seriously

1644
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:10,359
well I don't know I don't know any other

1645
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,910
troubleshooting other than unplugging a

1646
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:15,009
few times a few times it's happened in

1647
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:22,510
the past people have unplugged their mic

1648
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:27,489
plug it in and it's been better yeah I

1649
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:29,110
got a mute sorry it's so loud and bad I

1650
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:30,840
don't know I guess we're gonna have to I

1651
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:33,009
think it's gonna have to be a unbootable

1652
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,170
thing that's what I'm reading about in

1653
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:37,000
the chat or try other headphones it's

1654
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:40,690
really bad without headphones for sure

1655
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:44,529
but Rakesh just go to the next speaker

1656
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:47,109
and come to her next all right well the

1657
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:49,539
next speaker was her she was the last in

1658
01:13:47,109 --> 01:13:50,829
the whole group but we could we could

1659
01:13:49,539 --> 01:13:52,840
talk about how she

1660
01:13:50,829 --> 01:13:57,279
so she gets you know she's welcome to

1661
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:59,710
join in anytime she can just text into

1662
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:02,109
the chat room say hey let's try this

1663
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:04,329
again and we will break up what we're

1664
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:08,109
saying and get right back to her cuz

1665
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:10,420
it's definitely can we talk sorry

1666
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:13,509
can we talk about raising a bit fills in

1667
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:18,449
the difference between the Indu cushions

1668
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:20,890
in the feet of the Himalaya yeah it goes

1669
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:23,769
it's like you know the French we are

1670
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:26,829
talking about the tale of the Lord bring

1671
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:30,010
your lunch to the plot the plot in the

1672
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:33,430
mountain in India it's all green there

1673
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:36,400
is a lot of insect life the plant have

1674
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:42,789
to add a lot of protection the reason is

1675
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:46,210
very sticky with it when you go when you

1676
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:48,909
go into the window coos well it's very

1677
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:52,029
windy days little vegetation and a lot

1678
01:14:48,909 --> 01:14:54,699
of dust the reason cannot be sticky

1679
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:58,989
because otherwise it would it would have

1680
01:14:54,699 --> 01:15:04,510
a lot of dust on it and I was a function

1681
01:14:58,989 --> 01:15:07,269
of it so that the plant not only became

1682
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:10,630
the short brown because it's windy with

1683
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:13,240
big fan live because it's further from

1684
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:17,560
the Sun they need more surface to absorb

1685
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:21,969
the Sun but the reason itself turns and

1686
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:28,450
you can literally make the difference

1687
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:32,860
between large leaf type genetic of a

1688
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:35,800
single type genetic by zone by the

1689
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:40,689
stickiness of it for you here Nichols

1690
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:44,800
degrees and ambit Sam but it's literally

1691
01:15:40,689 --> 01:15:47,889
the genetic sewing who's the reason as

1692
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:50,320
much as you can recognize is generated

1693
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:53,789
by the flower you can recognize a

1694
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:53,789
genetic by the vision

1695
01:15:56,829 --> 01:16:00,670
awesome yeah I love the conversation I

1696
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,500
love where Sam was going with it with

1697
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:08,140
the difference between choosing from a

1698
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:12,039
field Oh turn that down

1699
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:15,369
soil groan what's up guys what's up dude

1700
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:17,890
welcome where someone must have left for

1701
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:19,380
you to get in yeah I guess I just

1702
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:21,570
clicked the button to hop down in I'm in

1703
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:25,329
I'm about ready to make some awesome

1704
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:26,799
control all right well do you think that

1705
01:16:25,329 --> 01:16:28,840
just is trying to get her microphone

1706
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,340
working I guess in the meantime why

1707
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,050
don't you do a little introduction dude

1708
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:36,270
how'd you get into the jaw herbs and

1709
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:40,199
hash and of course so girls in the house

1710
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:45,100
is that for me that is for you okay um

1711
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:46,510
so let's see cannabis I've been uh been

1712
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,940
passionate about cannabis since about

1713
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:52,300
high school really got into it with one

1714
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:54,639
of my buddies in football and I'd say

1715
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:58,409
just throughout high school I was really

1716
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,410
in search of always finding the best and

1717
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:03,849
that was really it was just finding the

1718
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:07,239
best herbs and then about 2009 I went to

1719
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:08,890
Amsterdam and that's where I really was

1720
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:11,889
stoked about all the hash that was

1721
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:14,350
available so it's really all I got when

1722
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:18,670
I was in Amsterdam just hash hash hash

1723
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:21,120
and I actually brought some home with me

1724
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:23,980
that's how stuff that was about it so

1725
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:26,140
around that time I moved back or I moved

1726
01:17:23,979 --> 01:17:27,669
back to California and I didn't really

1727
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:29,260
know much of what to do so I started

1728
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:33,420
growing and start a little clone

1729
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,420
business selling clones and stuff and

1730
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,569
from there you know I made some

1731
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:39,130
connections got into the cannabis

1732
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:41,259
industry working for dispensaries and

1733
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:42,940
running through different strains and

1734
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:45,369
flowers and hash and what seemed to be

1735
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:47,889
popular at the time was a lot of BHO not

1736
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:50,069
too much water hash or sift so I

1737
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:53,050
actually got into the BHO extraction

1738
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:54,279
unfortunately but I mean it was a path I

1739
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:58,270
needed to take in order to get me to

1740
01:17:54,279 --> 01:18:01,599
where I am now we actually had some

1741
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:04,090
problems got a little hurt doing it and

1742
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,970
promised my family that I'd never do BHO

1743
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:10,360
extraction again and started studying

1744
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:13,810
like water extraction dry sipped

1745
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:15,399
and really fell in love with the water

1746
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:19,449
hash once I realized that I was able to

1747
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:24,179
produce an incredible product with just

1748
01:18:19,448 --> 01:18:29,229
water and ice just that was it for me

1749
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:31,929
and then yeah just from there we set up

1750
01:18:29,229 --> 01:18:36,698
a little cold room and hash lab and just

1751
01:18:31,929 --> 01:18:38,469
started doing a lot of washing and just

1752
01:18:36,698 --> 01:18:39,789
stuck with it you know haven't really

1753
01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:42,340
played with too much other things just

1754
01:18:39,789 --> 01:18:44,889
mostly water hash and then you know the

1755
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:47,010
rosin tech which came came from water

1756
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:48,850
hash it wasn't for me making water hash

1757
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:52,139
probably would have never stumbled upon

1758
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:54,550
rosin tech so pretty much that says

1759
01:18:52,139 --> 01:18:57,969
symbiotic relationship right there dude

1760
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:58,719
yeah did you fire through that fast I

1761
01:18:57,969 --> 01:19:00,939
was in peril

1762
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:02,590
I loved it all I loved people's stories

1763
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:05,019
cuz that's how they got where they're

1764
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:07,840
where they are and I agree 100% with you

1765
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:10,270
dude that the way you get to where you

1766
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,730
are is by doing exactly what you did not

1767
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:14,440
regretting the things you did it's you

1768
01:19:12,729 --> 01:19:18,579
do them to lead you to where you're

1769
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:20,678
headed and you know that's that's Noble

1770
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:22,469
100% put me on the path to where I am

1771
01:19:20,679 --> 01:19:25,239
now I can't complain about it you know

1772
01:19:22,469 --> 01:19:30,750
well I love that rosin and bubble bubble

1773
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:34,539
bubble hash are intimately linked yeah

1774
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:37,539
I'd agree with that that's very cool

1775
01:19:34,539 --> 01:19:38,170
yes no nobody said he invented rosin

1776
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:40,569
dabby

1777
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:42,279
DeVito or maybe they did in the room but

1778
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:45,340
what he actually did was he

1779
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:48,550
re-established and popularized the way

1780
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,409
that is used today because rosin

1781
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:52,539
originally was a double boiler with like

1782
01:19:50,408 --> 01:19:55,448
a silver or a glass bowl that you milked

1783
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:57,550
your hash with with a spoon and what

1784
01:19:55,448 --> 01:20:00,158
what's oil grown came up with was you

1785
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:02,860
know squishing first hash and then

1786
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:05,829
eventually a bud in his parchment paper

1787
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:07,149
and seeing oil come off of it imagine

1788
01:20:05,829 --> 01:20:08,679
how lucky you were to get the right

1789
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:11,259
temperature with the right bud at the

1790
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:13,899
right time to see that so that you could

1791
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:16,150
be like wait a minute oh oh I was not

1792
01:20:13,899 --> 01:20:17,859
lucky at first actually the the first

1793
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:20,529
way that I press rosin out was with the

1794
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:22,179
piece of hash on an email so actually

1795
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:24,159
put a piece of hash into a piece of

1796
01:20:22,179 --> 01:20:27,010
parchment and I pressed it with my

1797
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:28,779
come on to the email and I pulled it off

1798
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:31,270
and that's when I seen a small amount of

1799
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:32,739
oil on the side of the paper and that's

1800
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:35,530
where my idea that I had

1801
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:37,179
it proved to me that it could work so I

1802
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:38,710
did it I did it I did it and I was able

1803
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:41,829
to give my father-in-law the first stab

1804
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:43,569
of rosin within our garage and we were

1805
01:20:41,829 --> 01:20:46,420
just in awe flipping out couldn't

1806
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:48,429
believe it happened I don't I say for

1807
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:50,590
about two weeks I was giving friends

1808
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:54,430
dabs and stuff just pressing hash on the

1809
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:58,360
email burning my thumb and that's when

1810
01:20:54,430 --> 01:21:00,880
one of my bodies he told me about a

1811
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:04,359
t-shirt press well actually no actually

1812
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:06,430
I had a hair curler so I was using the

1813
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,960
hair curler after that and it wasn't

1814
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:10,240
working out too well and the hash would

1815
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,770
pop out sometimes it would work and my

1816
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:13,420
wife had come into the garage and she

1817
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:15,730
flipped out because I was using her

1818
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:18,000
expensive hair curler I guess she

1819
01:21:15,729 --> 01:21:20,529
brought me some broken up there's like a

1820
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,270
rundown hair straightener but that

1821
01:21:20,529 --> 01:21:24,969
worked perfect so once I use that to

1822
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:26,800
flat plate to hot flat plates worked way

1823
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:30,039
better than a round hair curler dude

1824
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,989
it's always the wife because I'm telling

1825
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:35,109
you bubble bags wouldn't exist if it

1826
01:21:31,989 --> 01:21:37,149
weren't for my wife she sold all the

1827
01:21:35,109 --> 01:21:39,189
first ones that was like I couldn't find

1828
01:21:37,149 --> 01:21:42,339
anyone to sew them they all wanted like

1829
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:45,669
15 or 20 dollars per bag I was like oh

1830
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:47,770
man I gotta figure this out right it was

1831
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:49,539
it was my wife who was like also the

1832
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:51,010
first bags and it was your wife who

1833
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:55,019
brought you the rundown hair

1834
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:58,930
straightener yep yep dude to the wives

1835
01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:02,650
to the wives all right I'm gonna try

1836
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:06,010
that Mike again dank Dutchess I don't

1837
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:12,759
know that's not so bad

1838
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:16,300
better okay I think it's what I think

1839
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:18,489
it's good that's her thing cuz I wasn't

1840
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:22,390
good sad and I do the onion cries in any

1841
01:22:18,489 --> 01:22:25,510
case the way that I got into weed I was

1842
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:27,460
just say no Nancy Reagan had taught me

1843
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:29,920
so very well I was very very anti

1844
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:32,560
cannabis all the way into into my

1845
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:35,199
twenties and it was a happenstance

1846
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,390
beautiful piece of glass that made me

1847
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,510
feel like to try the weed and as soon as

1848
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:40,539
I

1849
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:42,369
tried to read and I did calculus I was a

1850
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:43,960
math major in college I did some

1851
01:22:42,369 --> 01:22:46,599
calculus and I realized that they live

1852
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:49,659
after that I was just a big pot head and

1853
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:51,160
like Thomas I was in Florida so who

1854
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:53,859
knows what kind of crap you were getting

1855
01:22:51,159 --> 01:22:55,720
and my husband would get like some weed

1856
01:22:53,859 --> 01:22:57,699
and I got this that we could be better

1857
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:02,680
so he started growing in the closet

1858
01:22:57,699 --> 01:23:05,019
maybe in 2004 I think in 2004 we've got

1859
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:07,030
in the closet super kind like for ten

1860
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,740
years because I live next door to a cop

1861
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:10,840
and the police station so every single

1862
01:23:08,739 --> 01:23:12,969
time the cops would come back to their

1863
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,529
station I knew this is the time that

1864
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:16,750
they were going to get me this is the

1865
01:23:14,529 --> 01:23:18,639
time I was gonna get arrested today

1866
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,920
today today and in fact the day that

1867
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,810
before we left for California and the

1868
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,670
other guy it's a huge fight and I said

1869
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:28,300
this is the universe saying get the [ __ ]

1870
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:30,970
out of Florida so in 2014 he moved

1871
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:33,279
across the coast to California and on

1872
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:36,880
happened since I met Frenchy I knew

1873
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:39,519
about dabbing but I went to a high times

1874
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,850
and Frenchy had all this hash in front

1875
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,590
of him and I thought it was chocolate

1876
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:46,270
but I asked it to be dads and he said

1877
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:49,000
with a course and then I dabbed it and

1878
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:51,820
that was awesome a month later I saw him

1879
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,590
at another event and I was lamenting

1880
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:56,409
about how I couldn't find like a

1881
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:58,930
[ __ ] budtender job I would come over

1882
01:23:56,409 --> 01:24:00,760
there just to do media I'm a writer and

1883
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:03,130
I wanted to do video and all kinds of

1884
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,720
things like that and Frenchy at least

1885
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:07,359
have lunch with me I may have coffee

1886
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:10,900
with me and in doing a max he asked me

1887
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:13,659
to write for read well magazine so I got

1888
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:15,099
it to hash because he wanted me to write

1889
01:24:13,659 --> 01:24:17,409
for we world magazine but I didn't know

1890
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,329
anything about hash and frankly I didn't

1891
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:22,510
even want to learn how to make hash but

1892
01:24:19,329 --> 01:24:23,890
I did because the man said absolutely

1893
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:25,270
you know I need still I didn't know he

1894
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:27,880
was any big deal or anything like that

1895
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:29,320
so I learned how to make cash and just

1896
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,390
so I could write about it and explain

1897
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:34,509
other people's process and stuff like

1898
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:36,430
that but then I continued later - behind

1899
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:38,470
his back didn't let him know started

1900
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:40,570
posting on Instagram eating it on

1901
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:43,409
Instagram - a couple months later and

1902
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:45,880
you know from then I've just been

1903
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:48,340
accumulating information from various

1904
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:50,409
people and interestingly on this panel

1905
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:52,690
right here I written about you

1906
01:24:50,409 --> 01:24:55,000
markets for hash Church I've written

1907
01:24:52,689 --> 01:24:57,399
about Frenchy I've written about Thomas

1908
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,829
I'm writing about Drew's hash right now

1909
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:01,750
and that's what I specialize in really

1910
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:04,539
bringing light to other people's hash

1911
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:05,170
because I get to smoke a whole lot of

1912
01:25:04,539 --> 01:25:07,329
hash

1913
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:09,730
so my experience with class is a little

1914
01:25:07,329 --> 01:25:12,069
bit different because I came in late but

1915
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:14,469
I smoked a lot a lot of hash just for

1916
01:25:12,069 --> 01:25:16,449
the whole purpose of making stories and

1917
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:18,579
of course I don't make as you see you

1918
01:25:16,449 --> 01:25:22,630
see what I was like so that's right and

1919
01:25:18,579 --> 01:25:24,369
I'm obviously awesome well that's

1920
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:26,350
wonderful that's very cool everyone has

1921
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:28,659
such unique different stories it's so

1922
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:33,610
awesome I definitely hear a lot around

1923
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:35,289
the 2012 2013 timeline of people getting

1924
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:39,159
reintroduced to water hash it's

1925
01:25:35,289 --> 01:25:41,590
definitely taken on another sort of a

1926
01:25:39,159 --> 01:25:44,019
full revolution in the sense it's come

1927
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:46,510
full around to where people are getting

1928
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:50,080
inspired to you know what at least one

1929
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:52,690
way dry sifting is another great way I'm

1930
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:54,309
not particular I love both of them at

1931
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:56,679
their highest levels it's just which one

1932
01:25:54,310 --> 01:26:00,670
is the most accessible and the easiest

1933
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:03,700
at the time to make is usually the path

1934
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:06,460
that I travel so I guess we've pretty

1935
01:26:03,699 --> 01:26:11,039
much linked with everyone I know Cuban

1936
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:16,170
is waiting to get in let's see if maybe

1937
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:18,519
I could drop out if you guys want I

1938
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:20,380
don't want a chance with you you got

1939
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,980
some great knowledge on hash and all

1940
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:25,960
that stuff you got going on over there

1941
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:27,639
I'm just you know I'll throw that out

1942
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:30,010
there except he wants to come in and

1943
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:33,130
whatnot he's gonna come in soon I just

1944
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:34,989
sent a message I say we get into a

1945
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:37,239
little bit of a hashish discussion I

1946
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:39,340
definitely like the idea here in the

1947
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:42,039
presence of hashish at least the

1948
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:43,659
presence in North America and I wouldn't

1949
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:46,329
say most of Europe because they still

1950
01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:48,579
have a decent import market there we

1951
01:26:46,329 --> 01:26:50,769
definitely are on the path of making you

1952
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:53,949
know hash from from plants that are

1953
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:56,140
specifically you know bred over time to

1954
01:26:53,949 --> 01:26:58,689
be hash makers to be resin to be

1955
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:01,490
extracted and so that does definitely

1956
01:26:58,689 --> 01:27:03,500
make a very very different hash

1957
01:27:01,489 --> 01:27:05,689
then if you were to make it from like a

1958
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:08,239
field you know somewhere near the

1959
01:27:05,689 --> 01:27:10,399
equator like Sam was talking about the

1960
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:12,559
different profiles you don't cut out all

1961
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:16,099
the other cannabinoids and it is

1962
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:18,470
interesting how you know prohibition and

1963
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:20,750
I guess the love of smoking and the love

1964
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:23,630
of THC really led us down this path that

1965
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:26,060
a lot of these you know genetics have

1966
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:27,859
they don't really exist in the higher

1967
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:30,020
numbers that they did back in the day

1968
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:31,639
not saying that they don't exist at all

1969
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:34,010
not saying that they can't be bred back

1970
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:36,260
into existence if they don't but it

1971
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:38,030
definitely would seem that the

1972
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:40,670
cannabinoid profiles that we're making

1973
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:43,519
hash with these days are mostly in the

1974
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:49,000
high THC realm not necessarily with the

1975
01:27:43,520 --> 01:28:01,400
majority of other you know cannabinoid

1976
01:27:49,000 --> 01:28:02,750
rich options anyone all right well I'll

1977
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:03,349
just keep topping that thank you

1978
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,600
everyone

1979
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:08,150
well I was I wanted to mention one thing

1980
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:11,120
I wanted to go into maybe a little bit

1981
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:14,809
about fresh frozen and kind of the

1982
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:17,119
difference between that and dry run be

1983
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:22,700
everyone's opinion on max I know you

1984
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:25,309
know you know I've had weed in the

1985
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:27,170
freezer for a year and a half it was

1986
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:29,090
fresh and frozen and I've done a lot of

1987
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:31,500
fresh frozen and me and mark we've

1988
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:34,090
talked about it quite a bit

1989
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:39,350
[Music]

1990
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:44,949
certain people Frenchy please for me

1991
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:48,500
series to peak of quality in a region

1992
01:28:44,949 --> 01:28:52,720
when you are when you collect it live on

1993
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:57,109
a ground me each of us the first ever

1994
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:59,150
concentrate was on sister touching a

1995
01:28:57,109 --> 01:29:03,259
bird for the first time to get some

1996
01:28:59,149 --> 01:29:07,159
seeds that way since token on his hand

1997
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:09,770
was the first concentrate ever and it is

1998
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:13,630
a very good shot at that dude exact in

1999
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:15,240
his mouth to experience what it was

2000
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:19,079
because

2001
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:24,979
open sister to invent agriculture went

2002
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:29,189
to 200,000 plants just one that make

2003
01:29:24,979 --> 01:29:31,729
seeds and foot comes to these 200,000

2004
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:34,759
there is maybe a thousand Eddie Bauer

2005
01:29:31,729 --> 01:29:39,389
hundred that you can domesticate and

2006
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:43,550
I've dozen that fit the world the people

2007
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:46,940
who invented agriculture passed down

2008
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:51,570
generation after generation Oh Holly

2009
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:54,599
over 200,000 plant and empty potential

2010
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:57,779
everyone of zoos not had they had

2011
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:01,890
knowledge of the plant killer that was

2012
01:29:57,779 --> 01:30:05,579
pretty amazing that means that that the

2013
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:08,460
first time one of the ancestor touch

2014
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:13,769
that plantain and address in amis and

2015
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:16,199
can go back so far in town it's it's

2016
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:18,510
like he can be as far as two million

2017
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:21,599
years ago when humanity moved from

2018
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:25,400
Africa on the Eurasian continent two

2019
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:29,550
million years ago you had news from

2020
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:33,569
Papua New Guinea to Europe at that time

2021
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:37,170
we may already have discovered and move

2022
01:30:33,569 --> 01:30:39,179
around the blood it can be that far the

2023
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:42,720
relation we have with that Conger is no

2024
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:46,590
plant like that that I've been so it is

2025
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:49,289
that I've been neglecting with humanity

2026
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:54,420
so far back in time that we cannot

2027
01:30:49,289 --> 01:30:57,029
pinpoint the best place it definitely

2028
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:58,050
goes back very very far in time there's

2029
01:30:57,029 --> 01:31:01,889
no doubt about it

2030
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:04,680
I suspect much budget listen how come

2031
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:08,820
it's always the flower but there is

2032
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:13,980
nothing about raising pigs it is a huge

2033
01:31:08,819 --> 01:31:15,929
mystery about sucking in history of

2034
01:31:13,979 --> 01:31:21,209
humanity because it must have been a

2035
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:23,100
huge part of it somewhere somebody did

2036
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:25,500
you cozy that what was happening in

2037
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:27,130
China where they breathe in that plant

2038
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:30,010
to make out

2039
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:33,880
to make fiber and see that blood was

2040
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:36,159
born bus on user side because when you

2041
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:38,890
bleed for something you know that the

2042
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:43,479
potential of the plant somebody was

2043
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:47,890
bleeding that plant fell way default a

2044
01:31:43,479 --> 01:31:51,959
thousand years ago somewhere in the

2045
01:31:47,890 --> 01:31:55,360
mountains of the Hindu Kush so

2046
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:58,300
traditionally Malaya but this is a huge

2047
01:31:55,359 --> 01:32:02,920
block that we are not know naturally at

2048
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:05,650
all interesting can't keep this plant

2049
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:08,020
down we always maintain some some form

2050
01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:11,409
of connection with it like you said what

2051
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:13,800
other plant has companioned humans for

2052
01:32:11,409 --> 01:32:16,389
that far back it's a pretty incredible

2053
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:19,270
relationship if you haven't read Michael

2054
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:21,039
Poland's the botany of desire he gets

2055
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:23,530
into it a little bit it's a really great

2056
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,680
book for anyone watching that wants to

2057
01:32:23,529 --> 01:32:28,719
read a great book from today's lecture

2058
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,409
today's talk it's it's one that's worth

2059
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,610
checking out

2060
01:32:29,409 --> 01:32:35,109
go ahead Sam did you have something you

2061
01:32:30,609 --> 01:32:38,139
wanted to say I was just could have

2062
01:32:35,109 --> 01:32:40,659
mentioned that cannabis evolution in

2063
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:43,180
ethnobotany by Robert Clark is also a

2064
01:32:40,659 --> 01:32:46,180
brilliant tube and hashish by Robert

2065
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:49,630
Clark absolutely we put an invitation

2066
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:52,119
out to rob for today's episode but he

2067
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:53,440
was in a very very different time zone

2068
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:55,989
and it was just gonna be too difficult

2069
01:32:53,439 --> 01:33:00,179
for him so we definitely will blow smoke

2070
01:32:55,989 --> 01:33:04,960
towards the Vatican for you sir Rob and

2071
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:07,539
those are great books absolutely alright

2072
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,369
I think Cuban said he was gonna pop in

2073
01:33:07,539 --> 01:33:11,050
in a bit and he can do his introduction

2074
01:33:09,369 --> 01:33:13,539
in the meantime we can just get into

2075
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:16,300
talking about still the presence of

2076
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:22,750
hashish where we are with hashish right

2077
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:23,560
now today fine Guruji we do first to

2078
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:26,920
everyone

2079
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:30,300
are we expecting Oh are we seeing

2080
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:34,119
because I have really huge

2081
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:36,130
well we're for sure sieving okay thank

2082
01:33:34,119 --> 01:33:36,939
you very much I mean there's no doubt

2083
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:39,609
about that

2084
01:33:36,939 --> 01:33:41,919
maybe the extracting part could be

2085
01:33:39,609 --> 01:33:44,618
argued depending on the definition of

2086
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:47,079
what you think extracting means or

2087
01:33:44,618 --> 01:33:48,639
isolating or whatever you want to call

2088
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:50,050
it but there's definitely it's a two

2089
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:51,819
part we're breaking those heads off and

2090
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:54,369
then we're letting them see and sink

2091
01:33:51,819 --> 01:33:56,529
through the sieve from my perspective

2092
01:33:54,368 --> 01:34:01,118
anyway it's kind of one of the things

2093
01:33:56,529 --> 01:34:04,259
that makes hash hash for me to dig deep

2094
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:07,658
because for me it's the only to

2095
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:10,980
evolution in the game that is thousand

2096
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:16,179
and thousand and thousand years old

2097
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:19,118
doctor the tool of add an evolution but

2098
01:34:16,179 --> 01:34:23,609
being a change in methodology of

2099
01:34:19,118 --> 01:34:26,769
cannabis resin see be water change

2100
01:34:23,609 --> 01:34:30,368
everything it brings a lot on the table

2101
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:32,830
and I don't believe that you lose any

2102
01:34:30,368 --> 01:34:37,359
syllable happened because it happened I

2103
01:34:32,829 --> 01:34:39,850
found inside that mum rang as long as

2104
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:43,420
the mum line is not broken you cannot

2105
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:46,480
reduce what's inside well you use it's

2106
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:49,420
at that breaking point of the reason and

2107
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:51,819
breaking from from the stock and that's

2108
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:53,739
why this that's what we're doing we're

2109
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:56,198
breaking those heads and that's because

2110
01:34:53,738 --> 01:34:59,109
there's no denying that there's terpenes

2111
01:34:56,198 --> 01:35:01,839
left in the water after a good wash the

2112
01:34:59,109 --> 01:35:03,849
water's anything that is not a penny in

2113
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,119
the air of the drying room when you see

2114
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:08,190
it

2115
01:35:04,118 --> 01:35:13,179
of course yeah we have never done

2116
01:35:08,189 --> 01:35:15,969
default theme i sieve ice water and we

2117
01:35:13,179 --> 01:35:20,289
really really need to do that oh I've

2118
01:35:15,969 --> 01:35:24,069
done it know what I mean yeah didn't

2119
01:35:20,289 --> 01:35:28,840
love oh yeah well I tested it in my bio

2120
01:35:24,069 --> 01:35:32,198
acid I did it with no many fine the

2121
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:36,219
different independent he different

2122
01:35:32,198 --> 01:35:39,039
between dry Steven iced water to define

2123
01:35:36,219 --> 01:35:41,739
the best methodology to retain the most

2124
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:43,689
steps my things again I think depending

2125
01:35:41,738 --> 01:35:44,718
on the cultivar you use what I saw

2126
01:35:43,689 --> 01:35:46,788
through my own by

2127
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:51,639
which is a pretty fine-tuned machine I

2128
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:55,639
will have you know is that I found a

2129
01:35:51,639 --> 01:35:58,400
great deal of closeness when it was a

2130
01:35:55,639 --> 01:36:00,920
cultivar like Rene that didn't wash its

2131
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:03,558
terpenes into the water the water had a

2132
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:06,050
mild smell and taste and color but at

2133
01:36:03,559 --> 01:36:09,019
the end the hash still stunk like the

2134
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:10,788
herb and that can't that can be said for

2135
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:13,550
some cultivars but it can't be said for

2136
01:36:10,788 --> 01:36:16,099
all some cultivars just don't have a lot

2137
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:19,729
of flavor at the end of the of the hash

2138
01:36:16,099 --> 01:36:22,038
making process and some hold like almost

2139
01:36:19,729 --> 01:36:24,559
all of it and so I always as a water

2140
01:36:22,038 --> 01:36:29,029
hash maker looked for cultivars that

2141
01:36:24,559 --> 01:36:31,219
would preserve water soluble or water

2142
01:36:29,029 --> 01:36:33,050
soluble terpenes to try our alcohol

2143
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:34,578
soluble terpenes to try and find ones

2144
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:37,219
that weren't being washed into the water

2145
01:36:34,578 --> 01:36:39,109
and if you know the lab one day says

2146
01:36:37,219 --> 01:36:41,149
something differently then i'll change

2147
01:36:39,109 --> 01:36:43,639
the way I think but for now it's just

2148
01:36:41,149 --> 01:36:45,828
it's the X flavor and taste I can taste

2149
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:47,960
it when I drink the water I can smell it

2150
01:36:45,828 --> 01:36:49,849
when I smell the water I know that

2151
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:53,059
they're the terpenes because I recognize

2152
01:36:49,849 --> 01:36:55,940
their smell from the plant I absolutely

2153
01:36:53,059 --> 01:37:00,099
agree with you Marcus that terpenes do

2154
01:36:55,939 --> 01:37:04,578
wash away with some varieties in water

2155
01:37:00,099 --> 01:37:07,519
note absolutely no doubt not all no and

2156
01:37:04,578 --> 01:37:10,788
if you're not all terpenes not all

2157
01:37:07,519 --> 01:37:14,150
varieties but it can happen that's all I

2158
01:37:10,788 --> 01:37:14,448
mean yeah so I have a question for you

2159
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:20,509
guys

2160
01:37:14,448 --> 01:37:24,469
if commences a stock its peak yourself

2161
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:27,979
Stefan that I think the tiger cub then

2162
01:37:24,469 --> 01:37:33,380
the take yourself Stefan is told is that

2163
01:37:27,979 --> 01:37:37,729
was it not under the baby of the tyke on

2164
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:41,498
the vaca then then it come inside the

2165
01:37:37,729 --> 01:37:46,909
[ __ ] on where do you how can you use

2166
01:37:41,498 --> 01:37:51,050
defend that that inside the Chi kana i I

2167
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:56,089
can explain it to you okay you you use

2168
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:57,940
water to sit plants and you've collected

2169
01:37:56,090 --> 01:38:01,869
the resin

2170
01:37:57,939 --> 01:38:03,969
now a wet resin even though it's covered

2171
01:38:01,869 --> 01:38:07,239
with the natural wax cover each of those

2172
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:10,750
little resin heads the resin is now wet

2173
01:38:07,239 --> 01:38:13,420
the water got into it and if the water

2174
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:17,739
can get in the terpenes can get out it's

2175
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:20,409
that simple yeah it definitely some of

2176
01:38:17,739 --> 01:38:22,300
its hydrophilic and some of its

2177
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:24,220
hydrophobic some of it just seems to

2178
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:26,140
pull water in we've seen it with the

2179
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:29,110
buttering cultivars I'm sure it's the

2180
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:33,490
same with rosin quit so preaching about

2181
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:38,559
becoming to play hmm just seek native of

2182
01:38:33,489 --> 01:38:40,869
genomic a and then you write hey welcome

2183
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,870
my Cuban grower in the house what's

2184
01:38:40,869 --> 01:38:45,430
going on Holmes what up hey sounded like

2185
01:38:43,869 --> 01:38:48,159
everybody stopped talking what I got in

2186
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:49,390
no well it was just a natural end of a

2187
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:51,729
conversation that was a good

2188
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:53,230
conversation that Frenchy brought up in

2189
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:56,559
regards to or someone brought up about

2190
01:38:53,229 --> 01:38:58,389
fresh frozen yeah man I forgot how good

2191
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:59,770
I looked on camera yeah you're home

2192
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:03,160
you're looking good with that camera

2193
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:04,750
it's like clean and clear I'm gonna I'm

2194
01:39:03,159 --> 01:39:06,069
gonna handsome guy but I'm within a

2195
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:09,189
group of handsome people here it looks

2196
01:39:06,069 --> 01:39:09,489
like much I hash guys hash women what's

2197
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:11,169
up

2198
01:39:09,489 --> 01:39:14,170
thank God cheese this is going soil

2199
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:16,090
grown Frenchy you shinato's in the house

2200
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:17,800
man so yeah we've all kind of done our

2201
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:20,890
little introduction on who we are and

2202
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:22,390
how we got into JA herbs and hash and

2203
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:25,930
whatnot so maybe we'll have you go

2204
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:29,320
through it where you want to start where

2205
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:30,850
I got into the ash game or yeah well you

2206
01:39:29,319 --> 01:39:33,279
know start with how you got into herb

2207
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:36,010
and how that led you into hash whether

2208
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:37,960
it was the game or just the love so to

2209
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:39,640
me I mean it was the love I started

2210
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:42,010
smoking weed when I was 11

2211
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:44,650
it's part of our culture in Florida

2212
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:47,560
we're a bunch of big smokers out there

2213
01:39:44,649 --> 01:39:50,469
especially what we call the creepy which

2214
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:55,270
is since Amida so from a young age you

2215
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:58,690
know we definitely weed snobs but that

2216
01:39:55,270 --> 01:40:00,820
carried on to a fascination and growing

2217
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:04,059
it because I got tired of when I moved

2218
01:40:00,819 --> 01:40:06,569
in crappy quality so I started going

2219
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:08,670
from smoking no seeds to smoking seeds

2220
01:40:06,569 --> 01:40:11,349
germinating the seeds

2221
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:12,050
figuring out how to select a female and

2222
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:15,170
a male

2223
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:18,949
I do uh two females in a closet and I

2224
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:21,770
went from probably 150 bucks overhead to

2225
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:23,359
selling $300 ounces like a good stack

2226
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:25,610
out for that I was like man this is a

2227
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:28,699
good business got to smoke make money

2228
01:40:25,609 --> 01:40:32,059
not bad so when I went back to South

2229
01:40:28,699 --> 01:40:35,269
Florida and I brought my little my

2230
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:37,310
little 400 water and stuff like that you

2231
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:38,720
know and I was moving it I felt cool

2232
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:41,380
with that light but what I didn't know

2233
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:45,050
is that my cousin that was helping me

2234
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:45,619
had grow operations all across Dade

2235
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:47,329
County

2236
01:40:45,619 --> 01:40:50,059
so he's there like looking at me like

2237
01:40:47,329 --> 01:40:51,229
what do you know about this bulb well

2238
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:53,690
like now what do you know about this

2239
01:40:51,229 --> 01:40:55,969
bulb is a bro I'll show you what I know

2240
01:40:53,689 --> 01:40:57,889
about these bulbs and from dad that

2241
01:40:55,970 --> 01:41:01,720
changed my life now my cousin put me

2242
01:40:57,890 --> 01:41:04,070
under his wing taught me everything that

2243
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:08,360
started the foundation for me in

2244
01:41:04,069 --> 01:41:10,819
commercial growing and we did that for a

2245
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:14,509
couple years but like anything in the

2246
01:41:10,819 --> 01:41:16,279
Prohibition era especially a city and

2247
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:18,230
state like Florida doesn't last very

2248
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:21,439
long you know so we started seeing our

2249
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:23,869
partners catching charges losing houses

2250
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:27,949
and money going from going up to

2251
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:29,750
starting to crash during that time I had

2252
01:41:27,949 --> 01:41:32,179
got divorced and my cousin was real

2253
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:33,829
strict about it you know he told me that

2254
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:37,220
if I got the worst I had to get out of

2255
01:41:33,829 --> 01:41:40,670
the game as I knew it then and I did I

2256
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:43,070
got out got with the Cuban hash queen

2257
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:45,170
and we started our life from there spent

2258
01:41:43,069 --> 01:41:47,899
a couple years in Florida I'm not

2259
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:49,609
growing fixing cell phones and stuff

2260
01:41:47,899 --> 01:41:51,829
like that it just wasn't happy in my

2261
01:41:49,609 --> 01:41:54,500
life I was like man I remember the days

2262
01:41:51,829 --> 01:41:57,039
well he used to grow and my wife

2263
01:41:54,500 --> 01:42:01,220
encouraged me we sold everything we had

2264
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:03,050
my cars our TVs I mean everything we

2265
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:05,350
took that money it wasn't much how much

2266
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:08,630
how much was it like $8,000

2267
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:10,190
$7,000 they took Whitney when like Cade

2268
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:13,190
and my wife and I feel the Washington

2269
01:42:10,189 --> 01:42:16,239
not knowing anybody because I knew that

2270
01:42:13,189 --> 01:42:21,199
I had it in me to make it happen and

2271
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:24,050
yeah we went in there fixing phones my

2272
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:25,698
wife was working a job and I was trying

2273
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:27,440
to get trim jobs and there

2274
01:42:25,698 --> 01:42:30,198
how to make extracts into I met the

2275
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:33,078
right guy that decided to listen to my

2276
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:35,299
story about what I didn't date and

2277
01:42:33,078 --> 01:42:37,578
believed in what I could do and he

2278
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:40,998
invested in me and he really blew me up

2279
01:42:37,578 --> 01:42:42,618
I was able to start growing and that

2280
01:42:40,998 --> 01:42:44,389
that's all before I even started my

2281
01:42:42,618 --> 01:42:48,728
Cuban grower Accountants around that

2282
01:42:44,389 --> 01:42:52,489
point so I used to smoke a lot of hash

2283
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:54,170
would spend my weed money on hash but I

2284
01:42:52,488 --> 01:42:56,029
wasn't happy with the quality that I was

2285
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:58,760
buying you see when you're spending

2286
01:42:56,029 --> 01:43:02,029
thousands of dollars to smoke anything

2287
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:06,498
at home it isn't like what it is on the

2288
01:43:02,029 --> 01:43:08,149
youtubes and stuff you kind of you kind

2289
01:43:06,498 --> 01:43:11,689
of I don't know get motivated and make

2290
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:15,589
your own so I bought myself a full Amana

2291
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:18,228
washer set a bubbleman bags and my first

2292
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:20,208
wash was better than anything I had

2293
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:25,610
bought and smoked that year I was

2294
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:27,078
convinced you were one of the lucky ones

2295
01:43:25,609 --> 01:43:28,998
dude you were you weren't you were the

2296
01:43:27,078 --> 01:43:30,708
ones that I wished everyone was the

2297
01:43:28,998 --> 01:43:32,538
people that already had dank but just

2298
01:43:30,708 --> 01:43:33,498
needed to unveil it in a way that they'd

2299
01:43:32,538 --> 01:43:36,018
never seen

2300
01:43:33,498 --> 01:43:38,658
yeah well that [ __ ] my life up raw be

2301
01:43:36,019 --> 01:43:41,030
honest because I had like seven

2302
01:43:38,658 --> 01:43:42,529
different strings six of them didn't

2303
01:43:41,029 --> 01:43:44,719
know bro I thought I was the worst hash

2304
01:43:42,529 --> 01:43:46,880
maker ever I'm like why is my house

2305
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:49,219
coming up around why is it half mil I

2306
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,150
almost want to quit I'm like man this

2307
01:43:49,219 --> 01:43:51,920
isn't for me

2308
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:54,708
but when I will go back to that one

2309
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:56,748
string which was my haze it would treat

2310
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:58,458
me right and dump it would melt and I

2311
01:43:56,748 --> 01:44:00,708
started figuring out okay maybe I'm not

2312
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:02,868
growing the right cultivars

2313
01:44:00,708 --> 01:44:04,819
so I started switching stuff up if he

2314
01:44:02,868 --> 01:44:07,009
didn't melt it was gone still the whole

2315
01:44:04,819 --> 01:44:10,488
room of haze until stuff started to fill

2316
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:12,139
its place and now it made me realize

2317
01:44:10,488 --> 01:44:16,759
that the material really is what

2318
01:44:12,139 --> 01:44:18,469
dictates the final product absolutely

2319
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:21,050
dude we have all been giving mad

2320
01:44:18,469 --> 01:44:22,880
blessings to the prod the producers and

2321
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:24,409

2329
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:45,759

01:44:49,869 --> 01:44:53,649
I have a long one but it's just a single

2334
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:56,949
one but it's long enough I can make the

2335
01:44:53,649 --> 01:45:00,429
boxes small and still get mine yeah so

2336
01:44:56,949 --> 01:45:02,399
dry 16 I got into it it was a it was

2337
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:05,320
crazy so I was washing first right and

2338
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:08,799
it was the summer in Washington but we

2339
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:10,779
had a farm right he had a property on

2340
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:13,930
the parcel where we grew and then we had

2341
01:45:10,779 --> 01:45:15,849
our residence in Washington most houses

2342
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:17,590
don't have air conditioning so in the

2343
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:20,560
summer there's like two weeks that are

2344
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:23,800
hot as balls right and my tremors

2345
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:26,650
they didn't want to sweat one and two I

2346
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:29,230
didn't want my weekend trimmed in 100

2347
01:45:26,649 --> 01:45:31,449
degree weather any loss under hassle I

2348
01:45:29,229 --> 01:45:33,099
converted my washroom into a true moon

2349
01:45:31,449 --> 01:45:35,500
so I couldn't make hash and I was kind

2350
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:38,230
of running out but I had so much Keith

2351
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:40,810
and I decided to see what I could do

2352
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:42,549
with it because I got motivated by Sam

2353
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:44,380
the skunk man and I got motivated by you

2354
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:48,279
and pictures so I was like no no I want

2355
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:51,850
to see if I can make this stuff and yeah

2356
01:45:48,279 --> 01:45:53,590
ended up learning and it's I was happy I

2357
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:55,510
didn't have a washer it has so much

2358
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:56,460
Keith so much material to make it to

2359
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:58,869
sift

2360
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:01,000
so much in fact that I was selling jars

2361
01:45:58,869 --> 01:46:02,710
for $35 a gram to my friends because

2362
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,350
they liked it but then I was getting

2363
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:07,779
hustled at the time but uh they were

2364
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:14,230
definitely happy to gets it from me for

2365
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:16,779
sure we're gonna be talking about hash

2366
01:46:14,229 --> 01:46:18,759
making here I guess now that we've gone

2367
01:46:16,779 --> 01:46:23,500
through the entire panel everyone's

2368
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:27,030
excited I suppose I did invite a TM but

2369
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:29,829
he was super busy with the whole new rec

2370
01:46:27,029 --> 01:46:31,989
laws that have passed in Cali so his

2371
01:46:29,829 --> 01:46:35,529
dispensary I guess it was Chris Conrad

2372
01:46:31,989 --> 01:46:40,090
and his wife Mickey who who were the

2373
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:42,399
first customers of BPG the other day for

2374
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:43,810
Rex oh we won't be talking about that

2375
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:46,389
too much today because we're gonna be

2376
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:48,490
talking about hash making so you know

2377
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:49,450
what you lose that when you got when you

2378
01:46:48,489 --> 01:46:52,630
started what's

2379
01:46:49,449 --> 01:46:53,590
year was that summer off Cuban so the

2380
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:55,389
first time the

2381
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:56,949
first year I started making Dreyse it

2382
01:46:55,389 --> 01:47:01,659
was the first year that I won an award

2383
01:46:56,948 --> 01:47:06,279
which was what 2014 said yes I started

2384
01:47:01,658 --> 01:47:08,469
dry sifting around March or April of

2385
01:47:06,279 --> 01:47:11,559
2014 and I entered my first Cup in

2386
01:47:08,469 --> 01:47:14,260
September with that haze dry suit

2387
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:16,869
yeah the haze was just powerful dude

2388
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:18,880
it's my son's middle name hey it's a

2389
01:47:16,868 --> 01:47:21,519
cool one so I had two strings at the

2390
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:24,310
time I had an OG that's that melted so

2391
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:25,659
good so this is I'm always conflicted if

2392
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:27,639
I make the right decision but you know

2393
01:47:25,658 --> 01:47:30,899
what I got a third so I'm happy with it

2394
01:47:27,639 --> 01:47:33,340
but I had an OG those super white chirpy

2395
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:35,799
melty was really multi-force it's

2396
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:37,449
awesome and then a hat but the thing is

2397
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:39,969
that you can smoke that [ __ ] all day and

2398
01:47:37,448 --> 01:47:41,618
not you know if you wouldn't get tired

2399
01:47:39,969 --> 01:47:44,500
and you wouldn't get too high Oh what

2400
01:47:41,618 --> 01:47:45,639
would happened with the haze is like

2401
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:47,439
have you ever looked out the window

2402
01:47:45,639 --> 01:47:49,510
looking for the cops and stuff after

2403
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:51,189
smoking or like been like hammered on

2404
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:53,409
the couch just thinking and daydreaming

2405
01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:54,939
[ __ ] that's what happens to me so I was

2406
01:47:53,408 --> 01:47:56,348
like man I want to get these judges

2407
01:47:54,939 --> 01:47:58,238
I want they're hard to feel like it's

2408
01:47:56,349 --> 01:47:59,319
about to rip out of your chest when they

2409
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:01,209
take a bath with this stuff

2410
01:47:59,319 --> 01:48:04,329
because they're gonna be smoking so much

2411
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:06,520
and we've got your boy in there third

2412
01:48:04,329 --> 01:48:08,710
place yeah the haze is no joke I'm

2413
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:11,530
surprised that if they had any like real

2414
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:12,730
like posh aficionado missing them they

2415
01:48:11,529 --> 01:48:14,380
would be like holy [ __ ]

2416
01:48:12,729 --> 01:48:16,718
this is the first place right here

2417
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:18,730
because I love the racing heart I love

2418
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:21,039
the intense like I've definitely as you

2419
01:48:18,729 --> 01:48:23,259
said as you told that story I pictured

2420
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:25,539
my friend Myles flushing all his [ __ ]

2421
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:27,520
down the toilet because cops pulled

2422
01:48:25,539 --> 01:48:29,579
someone over in a Safeway parking lot

2423
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:33,119
across the street from where he lived

2424
01:48:29,579 --> 01:48:35,760
after puffing the haze he was just um

2425
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:38,618
don't finish it down the toilet

2426
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:44,500
Hawkins Street Portland for those that

2427
01:48:38,618 --> 01:48:47,439
no no that's wild yo so at first I

2428
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:49,539
wasn't getting third because it just

2429
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:51,368
looked like some regular hash you know I

2430
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:54,939
was the only dry six entry out of like

2431
01:48:51,368 --> 01:48:56,618
30 entries and there was a recreational

2432
01:48:54,939 --> 01:48:57,939
one and a medical one but nobody knew

2433
01:48:56,618 --> 01:49:00,158
what it was it just thought it was like

2434
01:48:57,939 --> 01:49:02,049
some hash but it took the connoisseur to

2435
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:04,420
be like guys I don't think this is water

2436
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:06,610
- this might be dry see

2437
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:07,369
so they started considering it as dry

2438
01:49:06,609 --> 01:49:09,380
safe than a

2439
01:49:07,369 --> 01:49:11,210
and the raita double points just cool I

2440
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:15,350
notice there's a big appreciation for

2441
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:17,060
dry sift you even though I had not been

2442
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:18,920
introduced into the US market in a

2443
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:21,770
competitive sense like that they were

2444
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:24,949
excited to see it yeah for sure

2445
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:27,610
it had definitely been in winning the

2446
01:49:24,949 --> 01:49:28,939
legends of hash every year since like

2447
01:49:27,609 --> 01:49:36,670
2003

2448
01:49:28,939 --> 01:49:41,389
wouldn't you say Sam I think one year

2449
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:48,289
water hash one bye-bye

2450
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:50,180
what was it it was the clone from it was

2451
01:49:48,289 --> 01:49:54,619
one of my old clones but it was grown

2452
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:56,829
like this gummy stack yeah no it was a

2453
01:49:54,619 --> 01:50:01,550
skunk Hindukush

2454
01:49:56,829 --> 01:50:03,500
yes the skunk Hindu Kush yeah every

2455
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:06,820
other year was dry sift that took first

2456
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:15,260
place for rice it is the gold standard

2457
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:18,739
for most varieties of plants or clones

2458
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:21,530
you can make the very best water hash

2459
01:50:18,739 --> 01:50:24,649
from it and the best dry sip but also

2460
01:50:21,529 --> 01:50:27,949
it's hard for most people to make dry

2461
01:50:24,649 --> 01:50:30,949
cept that as pure as clean as they can

2462
01:50:27,949 --> 01:50:32,720
water - yeah it's harder for most people

2463
01:50:30,949 --> 01:50:36,590
for sure well all I know is Sam's been

2464
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:42,619
puffin on it for maybe 30 years which is

2465
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:45,920
insane yeah I made my first dry sip

2466
01:50:42,619 --> 01:50:50,300
maybe in 86 and that year or the next

2467
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:53,359
year I figured out how to make it 99.9%

2468
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:57,430
resin heads and that's what really

2469
01:50:53,359 --> 01:51:00,259
changed it because once you've had resin

2470
01:50:57,430 --> 01:51:03,170
melt and bubble in front of you the

2471
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:09,829
first time it's just like that's hashish

2472
01:51:03,170 --> 01:51:11,989
I'll never forget it ever it's it's a

2473
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:14,059
hard to forget experience especially

2474
01:51:11,989 --> 01:51:15,920
even in this day and age still to this

2475
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:18,130
day because you know most people they

2476
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:21,649
have to figure out a way for it to be

2477
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:24,470
either to make sense for their brand

2478
01:51:21,649 --> 01:51:26,359
to profit for their company like

2479
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:29,539
either-or it's hard to do and just the

2480
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:32,949
loss you know you have it's it's not

2481
01:51:29,539 --> 01:51:36,229
hard to understand why this is because

2482
01:51:32,949 --> 01:51:42,050
if you test most hashish in the coffee

2483
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:45,859
shops it's it's got less THC then good

2484
01:51:42,050 --> 01:51:49,510
bud can 20% it's got less than that

2485
01:51:45,859 --> 01:51:54,529
which means most of it is something else

2486
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:57,230
whereas you can make it 99.9% pure resin

2487
01:51:54,529 --> 01:52:01,840
heads and then it's in the low 80s of

2488
01:51:57,229 --> 01:52:04,939
THC and it's chirping rich naturally

2489
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:07,100
yeah no I agree 100% I remember the

2490
01:52:04,939 --> 01:52:09,559
first time I bought dry sipped from the

2491
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:18,950
gray area and I cleaned it up and it was

2492
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:20,810
like 13% heads what can I say I don't

2493
01:52:18,949 --> 01:52:22,399
know man you live in Amsterdam what the

2494
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:24,970
hell this is on you

2495
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:28,009
yeah but I don't ever go to coffee shops

2496
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:29,510
no it's true I can honestly say I don't

2497
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:35,900
think I've ever been in a coffee shop

2498
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:38,659
with you yes I just want to say that it

2499
01:52:35,899 --> 01:52:40,759
may have been 13% heads but right here

2500
01:52:38,659 --> 01:52:47,210
Kuban I don't love you too remember when

2501
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:49,070
he gave this to me back in 2015 this is

2502
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:53,000
Miami haters I think this is like the

2503
01:52:49,069 --> 01:52:54,019
first day that I met you better have a

2504
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,100
rip of that right now

2505
01:52:54,020 --> 01:53:00,770
oh yeah that's tight I saw blue ice had

2506
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:04,130
sent me a picture tag we can I saw on

2507
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:09,080
that only I think one little medal on it

2508
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:12,289
huh yeah this is a third-place 2014

2509
01:53:09,079 --> 01:53:15,309
Seattle HC high chronic scary stuff so

2510
01:53:12,289 --> 01:53:18,890
yeah I've been saving it all this time I

2511
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:23,210
save a lot of highs Siri to smoke with

2512
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:25,400
us girl or ticket down okay I think that

2513
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:27,470
what I like about sick is that

2514
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:29,899
so some drugs it's hard to see the

2515
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:31,610
quality of it visually right there's a

2516
01:53:29,899 --> 01:53:33,139
lot of mystery stuff like weed is one

2517
01:53:31,609 --> 01:53:33,829
that you can really tell it's good or

2518
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:36,000
not

2519
01:53:33,829 --> 01:53:36,840
visually and you smile in his ways to

2520
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,029
tell his quality

2521
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:41,880
I feel like sift is one of those two by

2522
01:53:39,029 --> 01:53:44,279
the way shines by the sudden refraction

2523
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:46,680
of the size of the heads the smell I

2524
01:53:44,279 --> 01:53:48,119
mean there's a lot of ways but in answer

2525
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:49,050
them they're not even really down with

2526
01:53:48,119 --> 01:53:51,720
dry see if they're done with that

2527
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:54,270
pollinator spinning it for like 24 hours

2528
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:59,039
before they take the material out hi

2529
01:53:54,270 --> 01:54:02,930
farmer grain sift I throw that type of

2530
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:05,489
stuff away farmer great it's step one

2531
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:08,210
yeah there's nothing wrong with it you

2532
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:13,019
got to remember Cuban that when I make

2533
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:17,640
what I want resin and I end up with 99.9

2534
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:20,100
I start with whole dried plants that are

2535
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:23,100
completely completely unmanned occurred

2536
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:28,640
and I grind them up with a machine to

2537
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:30,900
get the resin free word iives in my

2538
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,760
experience I realized that I can get the

2539
01:54:30,899 --> 01:54:35,869
majority of the trichome heads off of

2540
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,640
the strings that I'm working with

2541
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:40,710
typically by hand is best over the

2542
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:44,310
screens but I can break down a pound

2543
01:54:40,710 --> 01:54:45,869
within like 15 minutes and and from a

2544
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:47,730
pound if it's a good strain you know we

2545
01:54:45,869 --> 01:54:51,899
could pull like 60 grams of sift out of

2546
01:54:47,729 --> 01:54:55,679
it majority of them are like 30 to 40

2547
01:54:51,899 --> 01:54:59,129
but I've noticed that over agitation it

2548
01:54:55,680 --> 01:55:01,170
takes me longer to finish my work I got

2549
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:05,640
more and more green and things that I

2550
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:11,369
have to work out what I've seen is that

2551
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:14,190
when I measure the THC level before I

2552
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:18,119
start with the plants the plants are

2553
01:55:14,189 --> 01:55:24,989
about 15 percent THC after I'm done

2554
01:55:18,119 --> 01:55:28,019
working with them at least five or so

2555
01:55:24,989 --> 01:55:30,689
percent of the THC is still left in the

2556
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:35,070
ground up material so no matter what I

2557
01:55:30,689 --> 01:55:38,689
do I can't get it all but once I I do

2558
01:55:35,069 --> 01:55:41,309
grind it up and I do get I can get about

2559
01:55:38,689 --> 01:55:44,669
from a kilo I can get it by the hundred

2560
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:47,340
grams farmers ash but then I can clean

2561
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:52,020
that up to ninety-nine point nine pair

2562
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:54,900
Lisl II yeah and you're also you're

2563
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:59,070
making like four or five thousand grams

2564
01:55:54,899 --> 01:56:02,159
of farmers great sift in a shot that's

2565
01:55:59,069 --> 01:56:04,259
correct it takes me like you've seen it

2566
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:08,699
what maybe a half an hour to make a kilo

2567
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:13,260
oh all I saw was about seven to eight

2568
01:56:08,699 --> 01:56:15,059
minutes to cover the floor maybe maybe

2569
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:18,239
it was seven or eight minutes tequila or

2570
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:23,880
four thousand plus grams in a shot and I

2571
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:27,149
was like well you just have to train

2572
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:29,789
your resin to when you whistle that it

2573
01:56:27,149 --> 01:56:33,000
immediately falls off and rolls up in

2574
01:56:29,789 --> 01:56:35,039
little ball at your beat yeah well all I

2575
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,939
know is that was one of my most prideful

2576
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:42,210
moments of getting to play around with

2577
01:56:38,939 --> 01:56:44,429
you and resin at that point in time in

2578
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:49,289
my life and to just just to be there

2579
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:53,190
with the rake and being a part of it was

2580
01:56:49,289 --> 01:56:55,260
awesome yes over a thousand viewers

2581
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:56,969
right now look at that that's that had

2582
01:56:55,260 --> 01:57:00,600
not happened for a long time at the end

2583
01:56:56,970 --> 01:57:02,850
of hashtag 1.0 I will say that we almost

2584
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:04,380
drove that train right off the tracks

2585
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:06,360
but it was good to take a little break

2586
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:08,159
and you will be seeing all of the rest

2587
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:10,229
of the panelists that you've come to

2588
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,849
love over the years I just want to do

2589
01:57:10,229 --> 01:57:14,789
specific shows where I invite specific

2590
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:16,650
people who are really knowledgeable in

2591
01:57:14,789 --> 01:57:18,600
the in the one topic that we're gonna be

2592
01:57:16,649 --> 01:57:21,029
talking about which today is hashish

2593
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:22,530
I still think we're in the presence of

2594
01:57:21,029 --> 01:57:24,210
hashish it seems like a lot of

2595
01:57:22,529 --> 01:57:26,460
conversation really I mean there's

2596
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:28,109
there's water hash and there's dry sift

2597
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:29,880
but really as friend she said there's

2598
01:57:28,109 --> 01:57:32,009
sieving and they're both sieving

2599
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:34,859
regardless of whether you use water to

2600
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:37,110
aid you in your isolating procedure

2601
01:57:34,859 --> 01:57:40,170
which it really does quite a job in a

2602
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:41,429
quick way it's that there's something to

2603
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,640
be said for that if there was a way to

2604
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:47,039
do that with sifting that fast and easy

2605
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:48,690
like water hash does to get that much of

2606
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:51,720
a percentage back a yield

2607
01:57:48,689 --> 01:57:52,439
I'm sure that it would it would exist

2608
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:55,889
right now

2609
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:59,668
it's it sure would would be nice

2610
01:57:55,889 --> 01:58:03,628
another question for you guys lightness

2611
01:57:59,668 --> 01:58:07,498
we all under melt the melt is how much

2612
01:58:03,628 --> 01:58:11,878
resin is formed inside the reason and

2613
01:58:07,498 --> 01:58:15,139
when you are burst if you libel is in or

2614
01:58:11,878 --> 01:58:19,498
killed resin it doesn't change the

2615
01:58:15,139 --> 01:58:21,929
quality of the melt yes much fun in the

2616
01:58:19,498 --> 01:58:25,078
resin I did say what you lose when you

2617
01:58:21,929 --> 01:58:26,729
cure you lose their pain but you

2618
01:58:25,078 --> 01:58:29,668
transformed them into something

2619
01:58:26,729 --> 01:58:33,539
different to at the same time so you

2620
01:58:29,668 --> 01:58:36,569
have used to pick but have you ever

2621
01:58:33,538 --> 01:58:39,328
experienced clones that have been

2622
01:58:36,569 --> 01:58:43,378
invested too early you have a lot of

2623
01:58:39,328 --> 01:58:46,288
resin there is a motive Canobie know it

2624
01:58:43,378 --> 01:58:50,069
inside but there is no way there is no

2625
01:58:46,288 --> 01:58:53,728
reason from inside and the further you

2626
01:58:50,069 --> 01:58:56,518
go from the kick the least reason that

2627
01:58:53,729 --> 01:59:01,469
is inside that resin and even if the

2628
01:58:56,519 --> 01:59:04,639
flowers show like 2026 and tha have you

2629
01:59:01,469 --> 01:59:04,639
ever experienced that

2630
01:59:05,208 --> 01:59:13,229
do you mean like a really like a really

2631
01:59:08,368 --> 01:59:16,348
low yield from a flower a talking about

2632
01:59:13,229 --> 01:59:20,489
yield I'm talking about the yield that

2633
01:59:16,349 --> 01:59:24,479
has no weight compared to because it's

2634
01:59:20,488 --> 01:59:26,759
been arrested normally compared to the

2635
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:29,489
blonde that is arrested at the peak of

2636
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:32,878
the time when releasing is suitably when

2637
01:59:29,488 --> 01:59:37,108
the resin head is full of regime there

2638
01:59:32,878 --> 01:59:39,599
is a wage to be so friendly do you mean

2639
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:46,139
that the resin is a different size or

2640
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:48,269
just like how heavy it feels when you

2641
01:59:46,139 --> 01:59:50,909
take the the hash out of the freeze

2642
01:59:48,269 --> 01:59:53,668
dryer when it's early you can feel that

2643
01:59:50,908 --> 01:59:55,799
like the resin looks pretty but it

2644
01:59:53,668 --> 01:59:58,198
doesn't have actual substantive weight

2645
01:59:55,800 --> 02:00:00,059
it's not about the size of the head it's

2646
01:59:58,198 --> 02:00:02,248
about the fact that like the resin

2647
02:00:00,059 --> 02:00:04,859
hasn't been fully formed within men

2648
02:00:02,248 --> 02:00:06,529
that's inside so I have experience with

2649
02:00:04,859 --> 02:00:08,999
that first time because I've been

2650
02:00:06,529 --> 02:00:09,268
cropping at different periods in washing

2651
02:00:08,998 --> 02:00:13,349
my

2652
02:00:09,269 --> 02:00:17,010
tire harvest 80-plus lights you know -

2653
02:00:13,349 --> 02:00:20,788
I've done it a day 77 I've done it at a

2654
02:00:17,010 --> 02:00:24,529
70 I've washed stuff before at day 45

2655
02:00:20,788 --> 02:00:27,599
and then let the entire crop go to day

2656
02:00:24,529 --> 02:00:30,869
63 and actually saw a degradation of

2657
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:33,809
quality as opposed to wait I saw better

2658
02:00:30,868 --> 02:00:36,958
yields on there earlier pulled on my

2659
02:00:33,809 --> 02:00:41,788
strings bigger one 20s and 90s

2660
02:00:36,958 --> 02:00:45,418
melty or 70s less residue on on the nail

2661
02:00:41,788 --> 02:00:48,498
and cleaner separations almost tartar

2662
02:00:45,418 --> 02:00:53,429
turps and just still a strong high

2663
02:00:48,498 --> 02:00:57,599
weight-wise I mean you never know CBG

2664
02:00:53,429 --> 02:01:00,569
tight I'm not exactly sure if it has CBG

2665
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:03,179
but it definitely has a nicer opacity to

2666
02:01:00,569 --> 02:01:05,429
the to the resin head when it's washed I

2667
02:01:03,179 --> 02:01:08,069
feel like for washing it's almost as if

2668
02:01:05,429 --> 02:01:09,899
the resin hits a peak maturity before

2669
02:01:08,069 --> 02:01:12,179
the flower does that the heads are all a

2670
02:01:09,899 --> 02:01:14,699
big size they have a thinner cuticle

2671
02:01:12,179 --> 02:01:17,429
around and a higher content of oil and

2672
02:01:14,698 --> 02:01:19,738
then I still the plant reaches its its

2673
02:01:17,429 --> 02:01:22,168
term for flower a lot of those heads

2674
02:01:19,738 --> 02:01:24,148
down once big they become they fall down

2675
02:01:22,168 --> 02:01:29,868
to the 70 micron they become a writer

2676
02:01:24,149 --> 02:01:33,449
shade less melt but that for now for

2677
02:01:29,868 --> 02:01:35,878
washing I've been pulling a day 45 to 50

2678
02:01:33,448 --> 02:01:38,698
because I just see way better ease also

2679
02:01:35,878 --> 02:01:40,378
II and I came from growing 1314 we cases

2680
02:01:38,698 --> 02:01:44,058
so it's hard for me to even make that

2681
02:01:40,378 --> 02:01:48,118
adjustment by see a superior product and

2682
02:01:44,059 --> 02:01:50,399
with dry city I've always seen

2683
02:01:48,118 --> 02:01:54,208
I like the plants to be pretty much

2684
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:58,349
maximum mature and that gives me what I

2685
02:01:54,208 --> 02:02:03,179
consider the most resin and then I make

2686
02:01:58,349 --> 02:02:04,859
it as clean as I can yeah the first time

2687
02:02:03,179 --> 02:02:07,489
I photographed your resin it was very

2688
02:02:04,859 --> 02:02:10,619
red you can see the color of Sam's resin

2689
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:11,818
versus the color of Cubans just these

2690
02:02:10,618 --> 02:02:13,618
are two different batches they've

2691
02:02:11,819 --> 02:02:15,419
obviously made more hash than just that

2692
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:17,098
but this was very red and what I was

2693
02:02:15,418 --> 02:02:19,019
most surprised that when I first smoked

2694
02:02:17,099 --> 02:02:20,819
Sam's hash and I've smoked both of them

2695
02:02:19,019 --> 02:02:22,710
they're awesome melts liquefied

2696
02:02:20,819 --> 02:02:26,010
beautiful flavor everything

2697
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:27,810
samms hash the first time I smoked it it

2698
02:02:26,010 --> 02:02:30,989
was like what Cuban said like I almost

2699
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:33,030
had an anxiety attack it was so intense

2700
02:02:30,989 --> 02:02:36,929
like I just couldn't believe how high I

2701
02:02:33,029 --> 02:02:38,759
got and how fast I got that high and I'd

2702
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:41,310
never experienced that in my life before

2703
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:43,320
that [ __ ] was like an anxiety attack and

2704
02:02:41,310 --> 02:02:45,660
then it was like another anxiety attack

2705
02:02:43,319 --> 02:02:47,549
and then ten more anxiety attacks which

2706
02:02:45,659 --> 02:02:49,680
was great once you're stacking anxiety

2707
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:51,750
attacks and you love being on the brink

2708
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:56,159
of highness then you're right where you

2709
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:58,050
want to be you know I'm honored to have

2710
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:59,819
a picture of my house on your wall bro

2711
02:02:58,050 --> 02:03:01,590
that's cool dude your hash is one of the

2712
02:02:59,819 --> 02:03:04,710
most beautiful pictures I ever took are

2713
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:06,750
you kidding me it is it is your hush

2714
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:10,380
well that's my wife sis did that that

2715
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:11,789
was actually the Kimbell and it was at

2716
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:13,949
the Kimball that you took a photograph

2717
02:03:11,789 --> 02:03:16,380
of I was from Jamaica yeah I believe

2718
02:03:13,949 --> 02:03:19,079
that was Kim oh there was two two

2719
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:20,819
batches yeah sometimes I take credit but

2720
02:03:19,079 --> 02:03:23,340
you know what the real sift master here

2721
02:03:20,819 --> 02:03:25,799
and our family is my wife for sure it's

2722
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:27,360
always the wife dude both soil grown and

2723
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:29,670
myself have already propped out our

2724
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:33,179
wives today so you may as well as well

2725
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:36,989
it's it's always the lives I can

2726
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:40,380
honestly say my wife will doesn't make

2727
02:03:36,989 --> 02:03:42,359
cash for me and I wish she did but she

2728
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:46,230
doesn't she tried it one time she was

2729
02:03:42,359 --> 02:03:48,199
okay at it but she said I know what I

2730
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:51,509
like and I can do it

2731
02:03:48,199 --> 02:03:53,579
nice that's okay my wife doesn't make

2732
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:55,980
cash for me there although she has in

2733
02:03:53,579 --> 02:03:58,229
the past as has my mother which is

2734
02:03:55,979 --> 02:03:59,699
always great to get your mom whipping up

2735
02:03:58,229 --> 02:04:03,569
a batch of that full mount

2736
02:03:59,699 --> 02:04:05,880
I enjoyed it that's for sure where we're

2737
02:04:03,569 --> 02:04:08,789
putting in an entry into spannabis some

2738
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:10,500
dry sifted water - nice I think you'll

2739
02:04:08,789 --> 02:04:12,329
be pleasantly surprised because every

2740
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:14,699
time we went to Spain last year remember

2741
02:04:12,329 --> 02:04:19,109
that dry sip that la colada or two years

2742
02:04:14,699 --> 02:04:24,179
ago Sam oh no Spain has made enormous

2743
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:26,009
strides towards a resin and not just and

2744
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:28,470
not just bubble but like I usually see

2745
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:30,989
half a dozen to a dozen full melt dry

2746
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:34,860
sips while I'm in Spain which is

2747
02:04:30,989 --> 02:04:36,059
surprising and and like 30 to 40 plus

2748
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:39,239
water hash like

2749
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:42,180
Oh God you got to remember Europe comes

2750
02:04:39,239 --> 02:04:45,929
from hashish tradition not a ganja

2751
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:48,810
tradition I know the west coast it's

2752
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:50,850
it's a ganja tradition spannabis isn't

2753
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:53,820
old like it's been happening a long time

2754
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:58,289
I think I first went in like 2003 or

2755
02:04:53,819 --> 02:05:01,019
four and and now it's like it'll even

2756
02:04:58,289 --> 02:05:03,149
Sola said it to me he said in 2012 was

2757
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:06,390
the first time I started seeing hash

2758
02:05:03,149 --> 02:05:07,799
he stopped bringing his own in 2013 that

2759
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:09,360
was the first year he was like I don't

2760
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:11,640
have to bring my own resin to Barcelona

2761
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:14,369
because there is great resin in

2762
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:16,619
Barcelona I can name off like at least

2763
02:05:14,369 --> 02:05:19,369
half a dozen dudes that just make fire

2764
02:05:16,619 --> 02:05:22,649
every time like it's beautiful outdoor

2765
02:05:19,369 --> 02:05:25,079
Catalonian sun-grown you know reddish

2766
02:05:22,649 --> 02:05:29,159
dark resin that still has a really nice

2767
02:05:25,079 --> 02:05:31,140
like awake sort of energy to it not that

2768
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:34,500
narcotic thing that you might think that

2769
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:36,560
red or orange resin means when thinking

2770
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:44,000
about from a North American perspective

2771
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:44,000
that's another game oh sorry excuse me

2772
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:52,500
okay what I was gonna say was how you

2773
02:05:50,279 --> 02:05:56,519
can really see the progression of hash

2774
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:59,850
making is at Legends I mean the first

2775
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:03,150
year what we really did was we smoked my

2776
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:05,300
dry set yeah you know different kinds

2777
02:06:03,149 --> 02:06:08,429
but that's pretty much what we smoked

2778
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:10,340
within a few years of having legends we

2779
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:14,460
had twelve of them in a row in

2780
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:16,890
Afghanistan in in Amsterdam timed with

2781
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:20,430
the High Times Cannabis Cup but not

2782
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:23,130
connected to it and what we found was

2783
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:25,230
after a few years we started having to

2784
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:27,420
get together and everybody started

2785
02:06:25,229 --> 02:06:29,789
bringing their best and then we

2786
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:33,359
eventually made an informal contest out

2787
02:06:29,789 --> 02:06:34,079
of it where every year the resin got

2788
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:36,389
better

2789
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:39,809
I mean entries just got better and

2790
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:43,170
better and better till finally but last

2791
02:06:39,810 --> 02:06:45,630
year we had it there was 27 entries and

2792
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:48,989
we could barely even finish them all I

2793
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:49,920
mean it was just like a it was an

2794
02:06:48,989 --> 02:06:52,139
unbelievable

2795
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:55,289
job but I decided we needed three days

2796
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:57,300
if we're ever gonna do this again well

2797
02:06:55,289 --> 02:07:00,210
then we better plan it soon for

2798
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:03,060
Barcelona 2018 in March for spannabis

2799
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:06,899
because we need to do another Legends we

2800
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:10,050
need a three-day screening period before

2801
02:07:06,899 --> 02:07:11,279
the night's announcement of the judging

2802
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:13,289
right don't you think so

2803
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:15,210
so then we need a legends house that

2804
02:07:13,289 --> 02:07:19,429
everyone can come to it whenever they

2805
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:19,429
need not an apartment but a house I

2806
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:25,049
think it's a great idea I'm down I'm

2807
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,870
announcing it right now we're gonna do

2808
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:29,760
the legends of hash in Barcelona this

2809
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:34,170
was the legends of hash in Barcelona in

2810
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:37,199
2016 and we're gonna do it again we got

2811
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:40,429
to do it I can honestly say that the

2812
02:07:37,198 --> 02:07:43,678
entries at the legends of hash in

2813
02:07:40,429 --> 02:07:49,399
Barcelona were consistently as good or

2814
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:52,619
better than the legends in Amsterdam

2815
02:07:49,399 --> 02:07:55,439
yeah I would agree as well it got really

2816
02:07:52,619 --> 02:07:57,809
good so I think that that's a great idea

2817
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:59,460
just you know for me it's not about that

2818
02:07:57,810 --> 02:08:02,039
I mean it from the hash maker's

2819
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:03,659
perspective like Chinquapin and the

2820
02:08:02,039 --> 02:08:05,279
other guys Matt the great gardener and

2821
02:08:03,659 --> 02:08:07,769
all these guys that love to enter these

2822
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:09,988
things it's awesome to have a legends

2823
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:11,449
under your belt for me I just want to be

2824
02:08:09,988 --> 02:08:13,678
there with all the people and

2825
02:08:11,448 --> 02:08:16,019
potentially even like figure out a way

2826
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:17,940
to get Sid down there with the hubbly

2827
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:20,000
bubbly because Legends is it's hard to

2828
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:23,039
be legends without the hundred year olds

2829
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:27,210
hubbly bubbly Afghani pipe that we just

2830
02:08:23,039 --> 02:08:29,519
crush you know grams and grams and grams

2831
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:31,380
of full health dry sift out of when Sam

2832
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:33,630
said the first year we were smoking his

2833
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:35,880
dry sift what he didn't say was he was

2834
02:08:33,630 --> 02:08:40,079
dumping it in one and two grams at a

2835
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:42,929
time onto a huge bowl of Afghani hash

2836
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:47,579
that was our screen this big giant

2837
02:08:42,929 --> 02:08:49,020
hundred-year-old Afghani Bowl that he

2838
02:08:47,579 --> 02:08:50,369
was putting two grams at a time I'm

2839
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:52,320
telling you you could take a rip out of

2840
02:08:50,369 --> 02:08:56,179
this thing and then your lungs would

2841
02:08:52,319 --> 02:09:00,599
seize right up like you'd be like I

2842
02:08:56,179 --> 02:09:03,929
would put in a two gram hit dry set and

2843
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:06,090
then somebody would take it on the

2844
02:09:03,929 --> 02:09:08,190
then I put in another two grams and

2845
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:11,429
somebody else would take duh it was

2846
02:09:08,189 --> 02:09:14,460
insane in the flames I mean a high flame

2847
02:09:11,429 --> 02:09:17,609
can jump a meter tall yeah for doing it

2848
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:19,939
in our friends restaurant then it had a

2849
02:09:17,609 --> 02:09:21,689
low ceiling

2850
02:09:19,939 --> 02:09:25,339
it's kind of funny

2851
02:09:21,689 --> 02:09:30,538
props to uh Simone we're hooking it up

2852
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:34,860
salt I'm hot about the dry suit the the

2853
02:09:30,538 --> 02:09:37,198
distinct difference I guess in between

2854
02:09:34,859 --> 02:09:39,359
dry suit and water harshness this to be

2855
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:41,308
any abrasive and the fact that even

2856
02:09:39,359 --> 02:09:44,368
though it could be taken long it still

2857
02:09:41,309 --> 02:09:47,639
has a really nice light look because of

2858
02:09:44,368 --> 02:09:50,729
the way that the light reflects off of a

2859
02:09:47,639 --> 02:09:52,469
resonator when it reaches is when you

2860
02:09:50,729 --> 02:09:53,638
start seeing the darker colors and I

2861
02:09:52,469 --> 02:09:57,569
know friend she doesn't like that word

2862
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:59,760
grease collar moment so when it greases

2863
02:09:57,569 --> 02:10:01,799
it will show the essential oil layer

2864
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:06,659
there'll be darker

2865
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:09,809
amber etc with in the California senior

2866
02:10:06,658 --> 02:10:11,969
exigency in the North American have seen

2867
02:10:09,809 --> 02:10:15,119
it has been erased to the lightest

2868
02:10:11,969 --> 02:10:16,649
colors so Waterhouse has been not with

2869
02:10:15,118 --> 02:10:18,538
freeze dryers not only been able to

2870
02:10:16,649 --> 02:10:20,578
achieve the look of dry sift when it's

2871
02:10:18,538 --> 02:10:23,429
called Curie but when you have a resin

2872
02:10:20,578 --> 02:10:26,698
that was 45 days it's essential oil is

2873
02:10:23,429 --> 02:10:30,380
light yellow almost you know colorless

2874
02:10:26,698 --> 02:10:34,348
color it's more attractive grant program

2875
02:10:30,380 --> 02:10:38,069
which is why I've also been going

2876
02:10:34,349 --> 02:10:40,550
towards your polls on the material

2877
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:43,049
because it's what the people want

2878
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:45,779
yeah I definitely see people wanting a

2879
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:47,489
lighter color nowadays which is for me I

2880
02:10:45,779 --> 02:10:49,529
just want great hash if it's great

2881
02:10:47,488 --> 02:10:51,328
lighter hash then great if it's great

2882
02:10:49,529 --> 02:10:54,569
darker house then great but I really

2883
02:10:51,328 --> 02:10:56,549
don't have a big preference as you can

2884
02:10:54,569 --> 02:10:59,099
even see from the past that's behind me

2885
02:10:56,550 --> 02:11:03,269
the majority of it has like nice amber

2886
02:10:59,099 --> 02:11:06,569
color to it knowledge lovely I need to

2887
02:11:03,269 --> 02:11:08,670
say this you know I also have working in

2888
02:11:06,569 --> 02:11:10,920
a cold environment we are always

2889
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:12,630
stressing to keep it as light as

2890
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:15,510
possible because like you said that is

2891
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:17,099
what the that's what a lot of the

2892
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:19,380
customers wants what I

2893
02:11:17,099 --> 02:11:20,849
is important to stress though because we

2894
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:22,889
have a lot of things going through the

2895
02:11:20,849 --> 02:11:25,828
realtor with regard to us and that's

2896
02:11:22,889 --> 02:11:28,440
just really not true that darker hashed

2897
02:11:25,828 --> 02:11:30,689
if you choose to pull lighter I mean

2898
02:11:28,439 --> 02:11:33,118
later if you choose to press I'm there

2899
02:11:30,689 --> 02:11:34,529
for this not even that even if you just

2900
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:36,839
choose to pay later

2901
02:11:34,529 --> 02:11:39,769
this is an idea that somehow the hash is

2902
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:43,139
not as good so there's this prejudice

2903
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:45,929
toward lighter hash and I like all types

2904
02:11:43,139 --> 02:11:47,849
of I have very light - I've had darker

2905
02:11:45,929 --> 02:11:50,730
hash but this is prejudice and you know

2906
02:11:47,849 --> 02:11:53,010
information spreads really quickly so

2907
02:11:50,729 --> 02:11:56,368
can you put something about you know say

2908
02:11:53,010 --> 02:11:58,469
something toward that well I agree I

2909
02:11:56,368 --> 02:12:00,479
hear that you know I see it all the time

2910
02:11:58,469 --> 02:12:02,578
that people just get lost people almost

2911
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:06,000
always want to be told what they like

2912
02:12:02,578 --> 02:12:08,729
and thus thus grows the hype train and

2913
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,078
so the hype train sometimes has accurate

2914
02:12:08,729 --> 02:12:12,779
things on it and sometimes it has

2915
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:15,420
inaccurate things on it for me I have

2916
02:12:12,779 --> 02:12:17,550
smoked incredible light colored resin

2917
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:19,710
I've smoked just as incredible dark

2918
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:22,199
colored resin so I personally and I'm

2919
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:24,480
not trying to produce you know if if I'm

2920
02:12:22,198 --> 02:12:26,879
in a business and my marketplace is that

2921
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:28,649
we want darker or we want lighter the

2922
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:30,480
market that always speaks to what they

2923
02:12:28,649 --> 02:12:32,129
want and then the people produce what

2924
02:12:30,479 --> 02:12:33,868
they want it was kind of it's always

2925
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:35,130
been like that what people want is what

2926
02:12:33,868 --> 02:12:37,078
people will produce because it just

2927
02:12:35,130 --> 02:12:39,690
makes sense the hustle is already hard

2928
02:12:37,078 --> 02:12:41,429
enough to have to hinder yourself by

2929
02:12:39,689 --> 02:12:44,189
being like [ __ ] what they want I'll just

2930
02:12:41,429 --> 02:12:46,349
I'll tell them what they want which is

2931
02:12:44,189 --> 02:12:48,328
sometimes not really as efficient as

2932
02:12:46,349 --> 02:12:50,789
just producing you know if you're in a

2933
02:12:48,328 --> 02:12:53,158
business for a market that wants a

2934
02:12:50,789 --> 02:12:56,819
particular thing so I see both sides

2935
02:12:53,158 --> 02:12:59,399
really especially now in the

2936
02:12:56,819 --> 02:13:01,618
recreational market where your product

2937
02:12:59,399 --> 02:13:04,559
is gonna be on a shelf and you can't

2938
02:13:01,618 --> 02:13:07,139
necessarily try to market it and sell it

2939
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:10,020
it's gonna be a lot of people walking in

2940
02:13:07,139 --> 02:13:12,569
and seeing something visually and at

2941
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:15,300
least in California but the lighted

2942
02:13:12,569 --> 02:13:16,889
resin is what they pull towards so when

2943
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:21,360
I consult with guardians that I'll be

2944
02:13:16,889 --> 02:13:23,849
working with you know I'm gonna try to

2945
02:13:21,359 --> 02:13:25,920
pull towards that 45 15 now do I have

2946
02:13:23,849 --> 02:13:27,569
appreciation for dark resin of course

2947
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:29,788
that's what I started making for the

2948
02:13:27,569 --> 02:13:32,069
first like four years in my house

2949
02:13:29,788 --> 02:13:36,149
like I said I've just been experimenting

2950
02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:39,118
with different pools and I wouldn't sift

2951
02:13:36,149 --> 02:13:42,000
anything that has been floured to full

2952
02:13:39,118 --> 02:13:44,819
maturity that's for sure but water hatch

2953
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:46,920
is just it's easier to make a different

2954
02:13:44,819 --> 02:13:56,488
product unless you do things that are

2955
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:59,760
impossible to be as diverse as a plant I

2956
02:13:56,488 --> 02:14:03,029
have seen blown that offer

2957
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:08,099
miracle is in at three weeks well he

2958
02:14:03,029 --> 02:14:11,698
liberated and never did amber so it's

2959
02:14:08,099 --> 02:14:16,440
like you cannot judge 3d lightness of

2960
02:14:11,698 --> 02:14:20,339
the his in AD by the color but you since

2961
02:14:16,439 --> 02:14:28,948
Liz in Eddie's made like a foot there is

2962
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:31,429
it fun at maturity series you can the

2963
02:14:28,948 --> 02:14:35,339
it's made like a food to fall at

2964
02:14:31,429 --> 02:14:40,109
maturity when so high first of the

2965
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:44,420
Hyper's just fall by itself like Sam was

2966
02:14:40,109 --> 02:14:48,448
saying when you collect Mike just for

2967
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:52,590
exclusive the drying and then the after

2968
02:14:48,448 --> 02:14:54,928
you shake the lube oils and maturity of

2969
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:58,230
the raising the lower lightness the high

2970
02:14:54,929 --> 02:15:01,500
post which would fall as soon as you

2971
02:14:58,229 --> 02:15:03,750
shake a little bit and then you shake a

2972
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:08,658
little bit stronger you have that's the

2973
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:12,618
single available on and so on because of

2974
02:15:08,658 --> 02:15:15,929
the weights kuchela teammates literati

2975
02:15:12,618 --> 02:15:18,198
this is how Reinhardt's original machine

2976
02:15:15,929 --> 02:15:21,840
was designed the triple extract

2977
02:15:18,198 --> 02:15:23,729
extractor ice-cold extractor he came up

2978
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:26,460
with this thing I think in 98 he showed

2979
02:15:23,729 --> 02:15:28,259
up at the cop and first or maybe 97 sore

2980
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:30,960
it was 97 he showed up at the Cannabis

2981
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:33,449
Cup and made a little deal with Miele

2982
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:35,429
about the ice-cold extractor and this

2983
02:15:33,448 --> 02:15:37,529
was a machine that really was like a

2984
02:15:35,429 --> 02:15:40,019
brewer a 5-gallon brewer with the

2985
02:15:37,529 --> 02:15:42,300
triangular base and it came with a glass

2986
02:15:40,019 --> 02:15:43,289
collector and so his design was really

2987
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:45,510
to sin

2988
02:15:43,289 --> 02:15:48,390
terrifically spin with a linear actuator

2989
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:50,190
and get the resin only the most mature

2990
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:52,980
resins to fall and then collect them in

2991
02:15:50,189 --> 02:15:55,460
a single screen rather than to separate

2992
02:15:52,979 --> 02:16:00,209
them out like isolator bags and bags

2993
02:15:55,460 --> 02:16:05,130
meet I've seen action action even ideas

2994
02:16:00,210 --> 02:16:08,989
here in candy yeah but we know today at

2995
02:16:05,130 --> 02:16:12,539
ice-water see the noise factor and it's

2996
02:16:08,989 --> 02:16:16,469
it's pretty amazing to see the that

2997
02:16:12,539 --> 02:16:18,300
ancestor of it yeah how do I do it is

2998
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:21,720
truly the ancestor of it as well because

2999
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:24,060
it was it was a friend of ours Eldon who

3000
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:27,210
was sitting on Milla's couch when she

3001
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:29,250
when he saw that machine he came up with

3002
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:31,619
the isolator bags right then and there

3003
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:34,739
he said two five-gallon buckets with a

3004
02:16:31,619 --> 02:16:37,739
fight with a five gallon screen bag with

3005
02:16:34,739 --> 02:16:39,539
this screen bottom you've got the same

3006
02:16:37,739 --> 02:16:41,579
concept and he literally and he was

3007
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:44,130
marty was next to mark rose my current

3008
02:16:41,579 --> 02:16:46,440
manufacturer and Mark Rose came up with

3009
02:16:44,129 --> 02:16:49,259
the name and so between Eldon and Mark

3010
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:51,690
and Miele the isolator company was born

3011
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:54,510
and it was only a few months later that

3012
02:16:51,690 --> 02:16:57,059
I would start bubble bags based on the

3013
02:16:54,510 --> 02:17:01,079
isolator bags that I had seen so it was

3014
02:16:57,058 --> 02:17:03,929
definitely the true ancestor they sue

3015
02:17:01,079 --> 02:17:07,920
deeper than that mess that machine

3016
02:17:03,929 --> 02:17:12,000
didn't push the new legend receiving to

3017
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:14,429
these steps well the use of you sieving

3018
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,489
and could simple hey joko system

3019
02:17:14,429 --> 02:17:19,860
agitation and sieving in a bag and

3020
02:17:17,489 --> 02:17:22,530
that's the beauty of it we that depth

3021
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:24,389
elite yeah and the travel ease of it

3022
02:17:22,530 --> 02:17:25,800
like to throw those in your backpack or

3023
02:17:24,388 --> 02:17:27,539
your pocket for that matter and just

3024
02:17:25,799 --> 02:17:30,569
like heading off into the mountains to

3025
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:35,929
go make some hash it's nice and portable

3026
02:17:30,569 --> 02:17:38,039
oh yeah

3027
02:17:35,929 --> 02:17:40,020
so what else should we be talking about

3028
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:41,760
here the future while the future of hash

3029
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:43,319
I wanted to hear what everyone thinks

3030
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:44,639
will be the heat future of hash but we

3031
02:17:43,319 --> 02:17:46,349
can wait a little bit for that I'd say

3032
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:48,989
we got a good 40 more minutes to still

3033
02:17:46,349 --> 02:17:51,420
talk about you know what you're learning

3034
02:17:48,989 --> 02:17:53,129
from doing the the methods that you're

3035
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:55,110
doing whether its water hash or dry

3036
02:17:53,129 --> 02:17:56,369
sifting you know if you've got little

3037
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:57,960
tips that you've learned along

3038
02:17:56,370 --> 02:18:00,719
the way or little things that you feel

3039
02:17:57,959 --> 02:18:02,609
are important I definitely have half a

3040
02:18:00,718 --> 02:18:05,759
few I share them all the time try to

3041
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:07,440
anyway one big one for water hash is

3042
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:11,729
that when you're seething water hash

3043
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:13,770
it's gonna be it's the the the talent in

3044
02:18:11,729 --> 02:18:16,770
that moment is knowing how much moisture

3045
02:18:13,770 --> 02:18:18,569
to leave in the small pock before going

3046
02:18:16,770 --> 02:18:21,210
right to a sieve if you don't want to be

3047
02:18:18,569 --> 02:18:23,309
forced into itself pressing itself and

3048
02:18:21,209 --> 02:18:25,289
having to micro plane which rips open

3049
02:18:23,309 --> 02:18:26,879
the heads and for some of us we don't

3050
02:18:25,290 --> 02:18:28,650
like that I'm not judging those that

3051
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:30,779
like it by all means do it it's one more

3052
02:18:28,649 --> 02:18:32,940
option that you can do and that's the

3053
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:35,400
beauty of cannabis I like to sieve and

3054
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:37,290
so learning how much water to leave

3055
02:18:35,399 --> 02:18:39,209
present and and what I mean by that is

3056
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:42,300
low quality bubble anything under four

3057
02:18:39,209 --> 02:18:44,579
star you can almost like squeeze water

3058
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:46,888
out of that thing and it you'll still

3059
02:18:44,579 --> 02:18:49,260
see beautifully but for high-grade resin

3060
02:18:46,888 --> 02:18:51,089
you can't touch the paddy it can only

3061
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:53,010
really be whipped from the bottom and if

3062
02:18:51,090 --> 02:18:54,870
you wick too much water out of a really

3063
02:18:53,010 --> 02:18:57,389
high-grade resin and you're in an

3064
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:59,070
environment that say not very cold but

3065
02:18:57,388 --> 02:19:01,559
much warmer than it should be

3066
02:18:59,069 --> 02:19:04,679
maybe over seventy degrees Fahrenheit or

3067
02:19:01,559 --> 02:19:06,869
80 yeah 70 degrees Fahrenheit the resin

3068
02:19:04,679 --> 02:19:08,819
can start self pressing and then it just

3069
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:11,370
won't seem nicely it won't break up like

3070
02:19:08,819 --> 02:19:14,610
sand and fall nice and evenly on

3071
02:19:11,370 --> 02:19:16,650
whatever surface you choose to drop it

3072
02:19:14,610 --> 02:19:18,090
on so that's that's kind of a little tip

3073
02:19:16,649 --> 02:19:20,718
that I would share if anyone else has

3074
02:19:18,090 --> 02:19:25,670
one they want to share by all means

3075
02:19:20,718 --> 02:19:29,729
step up yeah that that's funny because

3076
02:19:25,670 --> 02:19:33,329
sieving sieving of patty's is almost

3077
02:19:29,729 --> 02:19:35,309
like a art yes a and every resin is

3078
02:19:33,329 --> 02:19:38,100
different some resin is a dream

3079
02:19:35,309 --> 02:19:41,309
you can see a thousand grams after

3080
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:44,659
wicking that paddy and it will be like a

3081
02:19:41,309 --> 02:19:47,850
15 minute 20 minute process other resin

3082
02:19:44,659 --> 02:19:50,610
well the dryer gets it becomes like

3083
02:19:47,850 --> 02:19:53,940
almost harder where you really have to

3084
02:19:50,610 --> 02:19:57,180
work the spoon and sometimes with the

3085
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:59,870
the greasiest tur piest

3086
02:19:57,180 --> 02:20:02,851
of resin if you don't have the coldest

3087
02:19:59,870 --> 02:20:05,160
area to wake on and you're forced to

3088
02:20:02,851 --> 02:20:07,319
take out the microplane and I don't like

3089
02:20:05,159 --> 02:20:09,719
using the microplane very much but

3090
02:20:07,319 --> 02:20:12,029
sometimes it it has to happen

3091
02:20:09,719 --> 02:20:13,858
thank Duchess wanted for me to talk

3092
02:20:12,029 --> 02:20:17,220
about drying yeah she asked me if I

3093
02:20:13,859 --> 02:20:22,380
freeze dry so I don't freeze dry I use a

3094
02:20:17,219 --> 02:20:24,898
a I oven with cold trap in line and a

3095
02:20:22,379 --> 02:20:28,559
vacuum pump and a room that is cold so

3096
02:20:24,898 --> 02:20:31,920
these guys aren't even plugged in I wake

3097
02:20:28,559 --> 02:20:34,590
my patties on the drying pads with a lot

3098
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:37,889
of paper towels and I use a Munda is

3099
02:20:34,590 --> 02:20:40,109
about 40 degrees my cold surface is

3100
02:20:37,889 --> 02:20:42,478
above freezing so my patties don't get

3101
02:20:40,109 --> 02:20:44,550
frozen if they freeze it's almost as bad

3102
02:20:42,478 --> 02:20:46,858
as then greasing so you have to always

3103
02:20:44,549 --> 02:20:49,879
keep them just cold and stable so you

3104
02:20:46,859 --> 02:20:53,250
can hate them with the strainer

3105
02:20:49,879 --> 02:20:55,799
I'll make layers on these AI oven trees

3106
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:57,359
with paper towel and parchment and I'll

3107
02:20:55,799 --> 02:20:59,759
sieve the hash onto there and it doesn't

3108
02:20:57,359 --> 02:21:04,500
have to be thin you can see it pretty

3109
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:07,620
thick and I'll pull the back now what

3110
02:21:04,500 --> 02:21:11,850
happens is at a cold temperature about

3111
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:14,819
45 degrees the moisture escapes the hash

3112
02:21:11,850 --> 02:21:19,318
as a vapor or gas and it'll run through

3113
02:21:14,818 --> 02:21:21,959
the cold trap a cold trap is a device

3114
02:21:19,318 --> 02:21:24,629
that has it's like a bucket on a bucket

3115
02:21:21,959 --> 02:21:27,809
type of thing the inside one has a dry

3116
02:21:24,629 --> 02:21:30,688
ice and and alcohol slurry and when this

3117
02:21:27,809 --> 02:21:34,079
water hits that cold trap it'll freeze

3118
02:21:30,689 --> 02:21:36,449
the ice of the water house over and it

3119
02:21:34,079 --> 02:21:38,279
won't hit the pump so I can visually see

3120
02:21:36,449 --> 02:21:43,590
as the hash is drying you when it's done

3121
02:21:38,279 --> 02:21:46,199
drying and I also discovered that it

3122
02:21:43,590 --> 02:21:48,840
seems like I'm capturing these water

3123
02:21:46,199 --> 02:21:51,180
soluble terpenes that maybe would escape

3124
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:53,398
when hash gets AirDroid I don't know cuz

3125
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:56,250
I have never aired right hatch but my

3126
02:21:53,398 --> 02:21:57,778
heart still comes off soon paternity but

3127
02:21:56,250 --> 02:22:00,299
it gives me an indicator of when it's

3128
02:21:57,779 --> 02:22:01,260
dry now it doesn't come out like rice if

3129
02:22:00,299 --> 02:22:03,539
like the freeze dried a

3130
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:05,670
so whatever sublimation is going on

3131
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:07,800
between freezing it and the way I'm

3132
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:10,250
doing it is different it ends up looking

3133
02:22:07,799 --> 02:22:13,349
a lot like an air dry but perfectly dry

3134
02:22:10,250 --> 02:22:16,350
so one day I sat down with nicotine he

3135
02:22:13,350 --> 02:22:18,059
had told me that he was micro clean and

3136
02:22:16,350 --> 02:22:20,609
this is like one of the guys that

3137
02:22:18,059 --> 02:22:22,648
inspired me to see my hash and asked him

3138
02:22:20,609 --> 02:22:23,040
why and he told me that some of the

3139
02:22:22,648 --> 02:22:25,319
stuff they

3140
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:28,021
Colorado was so greasy that it would

3141
02:22:25,319 --> 02:22:31,680
take him like two weeks to dry on a rack

3142
02:22:28,021 --> 02:22:34,380
and he had to break it down even easier

3143
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,750
when I told him that uh he's seen my

3144
02:22:34,379 --> 02:22:39,239
house before that I was drying my seat

3145
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:43,290
Bosch in eighteen hours about 300 grams

3146
02:22:39,239 --> 02:22:46,709
of ninety micron he was pretty surprised

3147
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:48,630
so I stuck with that method it's not an

3148
02:22:46,709 --> 02:22:52,259
easy method to teach it really takes

3149
02:22:48,629 --> 02:22:54,299
some knowledge of like you were speaking

3150
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:57,149
waking and all that's like an advanced

3151
02:22:54,299 --> 02:22:58,829
drying method it's a lot easier too now

3152
02:22:57,149 --> 02:23:00,000
that we're going into the recreational

3153
02:22:58,829 --> 02:23:01,739
cannabis and this is what I've been

3154
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,149
dealing with for the last couple months

3155
02:23:01,739 --> 02:23:08,369
is scaling my hashish production right

3156
02:23:06,149 --> 02:23:11,279
so I've chosen that I'm gonna try to

3157
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:14,400
focus my scaling on water hash and I'm

3158
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:19,590
trying to train people and some of these

3159
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:21,869
people don't even have much knowledge to

3160
02:23:19,590 --> 02:23:24,450
do so some of the people I'm training

3161
02:23:21,870 --> 02:23:27,600
don't have a lot of knowledge on hash

3162
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:29,130
and it's hard to explain to them what

3163
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:31,170
the process is when things are waking

3164
02:23:29,129 --> 02:23:34,049
and etc so I'm gonna make a transition

3165
02:23:31,170 --> 02:23:36,090
over to freeze dryers and I haven't yet

3166
02:23:34,049 --> 02:23:38,579
but I think it's an easier method to

3167
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:41,940
teach how to dry hash to a technician

3168
02:23:38,579 --> 02:23:43,559
than the way I'm doing I don't know what

3169
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:45,720
are your guys thoughts on scanning

3170
02:23:43,559 --> 02:23:48,449
hashish production I think it'll be

3171
02:23:45,719 --> 02:23:51,329
easier for you yes to teach but I think

3172
02:23:48,450 --> 02:23:53,790
that you will like for me I always the

3173
02:23:51,329 --> 02:23:57,000
freeze-dried hash just seems almost like

3174
02:23:53,790 --> 02:24:00,930
an artifact of its former self like it's

3175
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:03,090
it's so dry it's so like almost fluffy

3176
02:24:00,930 --> 02:24:05,040
instead of dense and and I've seen good

3177
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:08,819
freeze-dried hash another thing I just

3178
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:12,120
prefer I prefer the look and the and the

3179
02:24:08,819 --> 02:24:14,639
the feel and the smoke of a naturally

3180
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:17,790
you know the way I've always old-school

3181
02:24:14,639 --> 02:24:20,149
cured I still will do both under my

3182
02:24:17,790 --> 02:24:22,260
brand because people they you know I

3183
02:24:20,149 --> 02:24:25,139
understand that people like more than

3184
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:27,960
what just I like but what my preferences

3185
02:24:25,139 --> 02:24:30,180
are is non freeze-dried and I suspect

3186
02:24:27,959 --> 02:24:33,599
that with the vac of and you're probably

3187
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:35,190
able to produce a dry hash without

3188
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:35,690
affecting it the same way that the

3189
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:41,890
freezer

3190
02:24:35,690 --> 02:24:44,120
seems to do with that extreme cold so

3191
02:24:41,890 --> 02:24:46,850
buddy of mine that I thought I brought

3192
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:48,681
him from Florida he goes online as LD

3193
02:24:46,851 --> 02:24:50,091
Aggie I taught him how to make hash when

3194
02:24:48,681 --> 02:24:53,870
we made hash together for a couple years

3195
02:24:50,091 --> 02:24:56,841
so he marries my technique and he was

3196
02:24:53,870 --> 02:24:58,971
curious about the freeze dryer and he's

3197
02:24:56,841 --> 02:25:00,771
stopped using it because he thinks that

3198
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:03,560
the process is inefficient in the sense

3199
02:25:00,771 --> 02:25:06,230
that it will freeze a patty and then

3200
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:13,459
thought I'll it takes about 24 hours or

3201
02:25:06,229 --> 02:25:15,439
more to - to drive versus the the vacuum

3202
02:25:13,459 --> 02:25:17,569
oven being almost like an accelerated

3203
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:20,360
air drag and I can control the the

3204
02:25:17,569 --> 02:25:22,579
moisture but I try to get it as dry as

3205
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:25,551
possible but I like the look of the of

3206
02:25:22,579 --> 02:25:27,620
like a fish egg looking sieve when you

3207
02:25:25,550 --> 02:25:31,010
have that resin that especially when the

3208
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:32,811
resin has a nice translucency I think

3209
02:25:31,011 --> 02:25:34,159
that's beautiful and it's hard to

3210
02:25:32,810 --> 02:25:34,909
achieve something like that with a

3211
02:25:34,159 --> 02:25:36,591
freeze dryer

3212
02:25:34,909 --> 02:25:40,431
I think freeze drivers make hash that

3213
02:25:36,591 --> 02:25:42,979
look like like Fugazi dresses and then

3214
02:25:40,431 --> 02:25:44,480
when it grease is over it all doesn't

3215
02:25:42,979 --> 02:25:46,939
know how to grease over and it looks

3216
02:25:44,479 --> 02:25:49,011
like a weird brown compared to a sieve

3217
02:25:46,940 --> 02:25:51,290
grab or even a microplane grab looks

3218
02:25:49,011 --> 02:25:54,079
pretty nice too compared to the way a

3219
02:25:51,290 --> 02:25:55,671
freeze dryer vents yeah well keep a

3220
02:25:54,079 --> 02:25:57,890
letter to say something so you know I

3221
02:25:55,671 --> 02:26:00,530
can't fake more than something like

3222
02:25:57,890 --> 02:26:03,440
grease up because I'll press my house so

3223
02:26:00,530 --> 02:26:04,610
and I use the freeze dryer and yeah I

3224
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:07,551
know what you're talking about that

3225
02:26:04,610 --> 02:26:11,150
fluffy look and that fluffy look is not

3226
02:26:07,550 --> 02:26:14,720
great but its conception here we do not

3227
02:26:11,149 --> 02:26:16,909
at all go from cells into trying to foil

3228
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:18,949
it out in fact that's what makes that

3229
02:26:16,909 --> 02:26:20,539
fluffy look because that's a mistake

3230
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:22,700
what you're trying to do is sublimation

3231
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:25,070
we're going from it being totally frozen

3232
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:27,409
and staying under a particular pressure

3233
02:26:25,069 --> 02:26:29,779
which is four point five eight four to

3234
02:26:27,409 --> 02:26:32,511
go into the completely in today position

3235
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:34,881
if you make it into that liquid phase

3236
02:26:32,511 --> 02:26:38,511
then your hash is [ __ ] just flat out

3237
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:40,579
it's fun it has to say from frozen the

3238
02:26:38,511 --> 02:26:44,511
entire way so one of the things I talk

3239
02:26:40,579 --> 02:26:47,750
to other hash makers about is putting it

3240
02:26:44,511 --> 02:26:49,261
in the deep freezer overnight that's

3241
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:51,181
that way you know

3242
02:26:49,261 --> 02:26:53,640
and what that is frozen frozen frozen

3243
02:26:51,181 --> 02:26:56,131
all the way through but if at any point

3244
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:58,350
you get to the liquid phase that whole

3245
02:26:56,130 --> 02:27:02,279
freeze drying process is completely

3246
02:26:58,351 --> 02:27:03,900
though not good freeze-dried hash

3247
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:06,421
because like I said I have an entire

3248
02:27:03,899 --> 02:27:10,921
counter and once come to my house knows

3249
02:27:06,421 --> 02:27:13,319
that I have a counter of a huge counter

3250
02:27:10,921 --> 02:27:15,060
patch I just leave everything out I have

3251
02:27:13,319 --> 02:27:17,220
things in the refrigerator and things on

3252
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:20,431
the counter basically to see how things

3253
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:22,649
are going to react and freeze-dried hash

3254
02:27:20,431 --> 02:27:23,521
just washes wet in general no matter how

3255
02:27:22,649 --> 02:27:26,039
good it looks

3256
02:27:23,521 --> 02:27:28,230
you will know that it is not all the way

3257
02:27:26,040 --> 02:27:30,211
dry it probably had a mistake in the

3258
02:27:28,229 --> 02:27:34,409
process which people have not dialed

3259
02:27:30,210 --> 02:27:39,750
that in quite as well oh it is super

3260
02:27:34,409 --> 02:27:41,460
better oh gosh that's what happens when

3261
02:27:39,750 --> 02:27:45,210
you get that fluffy it almost looks like

3262
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:47,729
um almost it's a shade snow and it feels

3263
02:27:45,210 --> 02:27:49,680
very ungentlemanly

3264
02:27:47,729 --> 02:27:51,569
because when you freeze dry it is still

3265
02:27:49,681 --> 02:27:54,271
supposed to make that same spring clean

3266
02:27:51,569 --> 02:27:56,640
oiz not with the greasiest stuff but you

3267
02:27:54,271 --> 02:27:58,500
know drop value dry hash air drive it

3268
02:27:56,640 --> 02:28:00,600
couple years ago when they made that

3269
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:02,220
clinking noise over the parchment your

3270
02:28:00,601 --> 02:28:04,261
freeze-dried hash is supposed to make

3271
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:06,421
that same type of noise and have that

3272
02:28:04,261 --> 02:28:08,190
same type of fear if any way it feels

3273
02:28:06,421 --> 02:28:10,500
kind of moist like you're pushing a

3274
02:28:08,190 --> 02:28:13,681
little bit into play your hash is not

3275
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:17,431
dry no matter how nice the exam believe

3276
02:28:13,681 --> 02:28:20,190
me it's not dry hey welcome at ya and

3277
02:28:17,431 --> 02:28:24,989
that was well said Duchess I also feel

3278
02:28:20,190 --> 02:28:27,239
that you know there the freeze dryer is

3279
02:28:24,989 --> 02:28:28,800
easy in a sense to teach people basics

3280
02:28:27,239 --> 02:28:30,869
but if you want to get like what you've

3281
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:33,180
got with your vac oven that you're doing

3282
02:28:30,870 --> 02:28:35,190
like more tuned in then it just becomes

3283
02:28:33,181 --> 02:28:37,261
more like just once again it's know how

3284
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:38,790
it's simple know-how that is not easily

3285
02:28:37,261 --> 02:28:40,649
transferred to people that you're

3286
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:42,211
teaching things to they're like oh yeah

3287
02:28:40,649 --> 02:28:44,250
I know how to do it it's like do you

3288
02:28:42,210 --> 02:28:46,619
know how to do it because if you do it a

3289
02:28:44,250 --> 02:28:48,210
lip I think the freeze dryer I think

3290
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:50,551
we'll see new tools specifically

3291
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:53,220
designed for the freeze dryer in 2018

3292
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:55,890
and those tools will make exactly what

3293
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:59,000
Duchess was just mentioning a lot easier

3294
02:28:55,890 --> 02:29:01,889
to happen than having you know this wet

3295
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:05,789
sopping resin sitting in a

3296
02:29:01,889 --> 02:29:09,958
in a metal pan like there's what's going

3297
02:29:05,789 --> 02:29:15,840
on that Chan hey everybody um happy hash

3298
02:29:09,959 --> 02:29:18,270
Church 2.0 I'm on I'm at work it's a new

3299
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:20,248
legal world here in California so I'm

3300
02:29:18,270 --> 02:29:22,619
sitting here stickering and packaging

3301
02:29:20,248 --> 02:29:24,449
trying to keep up with the fun demand of

3302
02:29:22,619 --> 02:29:26,069
all the things that are out there so I

3303
02:29:24,449 --> 02:29:28,289
didn't have a chance to pop on earlier

3304
02:29:26,068 --> 02:29:30,208
so I just wanted to pop in and wish

3305
02:29:28,289 --> 02:29:31,998
everybody the best and I'll try to be

3306
02:29:30,209 --> 02:29:35,029
back more regular next week it's just

3307
02:29:31,998 --> 02:29:37,199
kind of crazy here right now everybody

3308
02:29:35,029 --> 02:29:39,629
realizes what all these patients have

3309
02:29:37,199 --> 02:29:41,729
been saying for these 18 plus years at

3310
02:29:39,629 --> 02:29:43,470
my dispensary and now they all want to

3311
02:29:41,728 --> 02:29:44,878
come in and have the experience and

3312
02:29:43,469 --> 02:29:48,228
we're welcoming it and we have everybody

3313
02:29:44,879 --> 02:29:50,640
ready for it it's just a lot of people I

3314
02:29:48,228 --> 02:29:52,799
can only imagine well hopefully those

3315
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:54,389
people are purchasing hashish today

3316
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:57,148
because that's what today's episodes

3317
02:29:54,389 --> 02:29:59,788
about hash hash and more hash in fact

3318
02:29:57,148 --> 02:30:03,208
that kind of leads us into the future of

3319
02:29:59,789 --> 02:30:05,129
hash right then and there you know you

3320
02:30:03,209 --> 02:30:06,890
you're kind of in the future of hash

3321
02:30:05,129 --> 02:30:09,600
right now as well as the future of

3322
02:30:06,889 --> 02:30:11,278
recreational cannabis sales yeah it's

3323
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:13,350
it's fascinating it's it's been

3324
02:30:11,279 --> 02:30:15,810
interesting to watch California learn

3325
02:30:13,350 --> 02:30:18,539
from Colorado and Washington and Oregon

3326
02:30:15,809 --> 02:30:20,128
and Alaska's experiments and figure out

3327
02:30:18,539 --> 02:30:22,649
what works best for us here in

3328
02:30:20,129 --> 02:30:25,169
California and fortunately you know

3329
02:30:22,648 --> 02:30:26,908
people are still grow so you know it's

3330
02:30:25,168 --> 02:30:29,488
making sure that we have plants

3331
02:30:26,908 --> 02:30:30,748
available making sure there's seat and

3332
02:30:29,488 --> 02:30:32,038
of course rights it's what I'm doing

3333
02:30:30,748 --> 02:30:33,689
right now is I'm actually snickering

3334
02:30:32,039 --> 02:30:36,090
hashish because it's very popular right

3335
02:30:33,689 --> 02:30:38,699
now and it's one of those things that's

3336
02:30:36,090 --> 02:30:41,430
needed on the floor so I've yesterday I

3337
02:30:38,699 --> 02:30:44,760
packaged bubble hash and cartridges are

3338
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:46,889
also popular people are very interested

3339
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:49,379
in all the new things that are out there

3340
02:30:46,889 --> 02:30:52,078
so they're not there they're not aware

3341
02:30:49,379 --> 02:30:54,419
of bubble hash they're not aware of just

3342
02:30:52,078 --> 02:30:56,340
what hashish is even for the most part

3343
02:30:54,418 --> 02:30:58,859
they've heard rumor of it they've not

3344
02:30:56,340 --> 02:31:01,318
necessarily seen it so then you come in

3345
02:30:58,859 --> 02:31:05,459
and here's 40 types of hash before you

3346
02:31:01,318 --> 02:31:06,958
it a a learning curve so it's you know

3347
02:31:05,459 --> 02:31:09,239
to explain the different types because

3348
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:11,850
you know we have carry the co2 we carry

3349
02:31:09,238 --> 02:31:13,619
the BHO and we care of course lots of

3350
02:31:11,850 --> 02:31:16,200
different types of bubble

3351
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:19,021
and names of variety and of course we've

3352
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:21,990
had the Duchess's wonderful products in

3353
02:31:19,021 --> 02:31:24,750
here in the past and thank you very much

3356
02:31:26,729 --> 02:31:30,000
through would love to someday see your

3357
02:31:28,351 --> 02:31:33,120
stuff down here Cuban but I know you're

3358
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:35,819
a busy busy man so it's just the reality

3359
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:39,360
of you know now trying to figure out

3360
02:31:35,819 --> 02:31:41,159
what the demand is make people aware of

3361
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:42,840
the different types of hash so it's

3362
02:31:41,159 --> 02:31:44,670
literally it's starting at the beginning

3363
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:46,500
of course starting from you know all the

3364
02:31:44,670 --> 02:31:49,079
way back thanks to Sam and everybody

3365
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:50,610
else who perfected the flours and help

3366
02:31:49,079 --> 02:31:52,319
made those available and of course

3367
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:53,851
thanks to you bubble man for a bubble

3368
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:55,860
hash as I was sitting there I was

3369
02:31:53,851 --> 02:31:58,409
giggling all days I was packaging

3370
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:59,851
yesterday going hehehe Thank You bubble

3371
02:31:58,409 --> 02:32:01,771
man for making this product even

3372
02:31:59,851 --> 02:32:02,970
possible so that people have it know it

3373
02:32:01,771 --> 02:32:05,870
know that it's out there and it's

3374
02:32:02,969 --> 02:32:09,119
available because you know before then

3375
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:10,980
you know it was a few and far between to

3376
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:12,570
find good hashish as you know back in

3377
02:32:10,979 --> 02:32:14,789
the day was finding something that was

3378
02:32:12,569 --> 02:32:17,219
black or stamped not many of us had

3379
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:20,070
French cheese knowledge or experience of

3380
02:32:17,219 --> 02:32:21,869
going around rubbing etc etc so the

3381
02:32:20,069 --> 02:32:24,360
majority of us found out you know when

3382
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:25,590
we go to Amsterdam right yeah you go to

3383
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:27,210
Amsterdam for hash you don't go there

3384
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:29,940
for grass you come to California for

3385
02:32:27,209 --> 02:32:31,529
grass but you go to Amsterdam definitely

3386
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:33,210
for the plethora those dog nee of the

3387
02:32:31,530 --> 02:32:35,400
day you can get a full trip around the

3388
02:32:33,209 --> 02:32:38,129
world an Amsterdam from Nepalese temple

3389
02:32:35,399 --> 02:32:39,719
balls to double zero to all the

3390
02:32:38,129 --> 02:32:43,799
different types of issues that are out

3391
02:32:39,719 --> 02:32:45,239
there that you can find in conglomerated

3392
02:32:43,799 --> 02:32:48,179
areas that you would never thought were

3393
02:32:45,239 --> 02:32:50,101
even possible or have only read about or

3394
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:52,500
heard legend of there you could actually

3395
02:32:50,101 --> 02:32:56,310
go into all these coffee shops and you

3396
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:58,739
know find it and smoke it and so we took

3397
02:32:56,310 --> 02:33:00,479
a lot of that idea and over the years of

3398
02:32:58,739 --> 02:33:02,851
you know perpetuated that here in

3399
02:33:00,479 --> 02:33:06,479
California with our medical industry

3400
02:33:02,851 --> 02:33:09,659
which of course needless to say is 20

3401
02:33:06,479 --> 02:33:12,000
plus years now and now that we're at

3402
02:33:09,659 --> 02:33:15,180
this new recreational world we

3403
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:18,000
fortunately have the Bureau of cannabis

3404
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:20,940
control which is allowing for BHO and

3405
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:24,690
Pho and other types of extractions and

3406
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:26,489
water hash which is key for the consumer

3407
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:27,480
so that they can experience as many

3408
02:33:26,489 --> 02:33:30,750
different variety

3409
02:33:27,479 --> 02:33:32,909
of preparations of cannabis as possible

3410
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:35,671
that we what we have currently and I

3411
02:33:32,909 --> 02:33:37,409
thank everybody on the panel of and for

3412
02:33:35,671 --> 02:33:39,810
many years of their hard work and

3413
02:33:37,409 --> 02:33:42,421
dedication to make that a reality for

3414
02:33:39,810 --> 02:33:46,050
this this new public that's now touching

3415
02:33:42,421 --> 02:33:48,780
base yeah I also in your thanks of me I

3416
02:33:46,050 --> 02:33:50,489
always have to give thanks to the people

3417
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:53,040
that helped and inspired me along the

3418
02:33:50,489 --> 02:33:55,351
way which would be skunk man Sam

3419
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:57,570
initially with Saudi Sam's water

3420
02:33:55,351 --> 02:33:59,341
extraction and if it don't bubble it

3421
02:33:57,569 --> 02:34:01,409
ain't worth the trouble and really the

3422
02:33:59,341 --> 02:34:05,069
inspiration behind wanting to isolate

3423
02:34:01,409 --> 02:34:07,050
gland heads to 99.9% and then a thanks

3424
02:34:05,069 --> 02:34:09,421
to Reinhardt Delp who came up with the

3425
02:34:07,050 --> 02:34:12,239
Machine years later like literally ten

3426
02:34:09,421 --> 02:34:13,800
years later from Sam doing the Saudi

3427
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:15,360
Sam's water extraction

3428
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:17,909
ten years later Reinhardt would come up

3429
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:20,610
with the ice-cold extractor it would be

3430
02:34:17,909 --> 02:34:22,739
shown to Miele and Mark rose and Eldon

3431
02:34:20,610 --> 02:34:25,739
and the three of them would on the spot

3432
02:34:22,739 --> 02:34:29,341
come up with name and sell the product

3433
02:34:25,739 --> 02:34:31,530
as we know the isolator bags and that

3434
02:34:29,341 --> 02:34:33,720
was the birth of the bubble bags just

3435
02:34:31,530 --> 02:34:36,271
four or five months after that so that

3436
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:38,970
was in 1999 when bubble bags were

3437
02:34:36,271 --> 02:34:41,489
birthed and I think the real difference

3438
02:34:38,970 --> 02:34:43,529
in the importance of why when someone's

3439
02:34:41,489 --> 02:34:45,271
doing a product that other people should

3440
02:34:43,530 --> 02:34:48,030
be allowed to innovate and create that

3441
02:34:45,271 --> 02:34:50,431
better product is because you know it's

3442
02:34:48,030 --> 02:34:53,341
it's it's all about hitting it with a

3443
02:34:50,431 --> 02:34:55,051
full house of cards and I got lucky in

3444
02:34:53,341 --> 02:34:56,989
the sense that not only did I have the

3445
02:34:55,050 --> 02:35:00,300
love and the passion and the olfactory

3446
02:34:56,989 --> 02:35:02,819
tune to cannabis but I also had the

3447
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:05,671
willingness to share in a highly illegal

3448
02:35:02,819 --> 02:35:08,431
market in us in a not really very legal

3449
02:35:05,671 --> 02:35:10,560
place online debt you know information

3450
02:35:08,431 --> 02:35:12,870
pictures of hash and process and

3451
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:15,810
basically making hash okay in the late

3452
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:17,671
90s and putting it on the internet that

3453
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:20,250
was really the beginning of an overgrown

3454
02:35:17,671 --> 02:35:21,961
cannabis culture cannabis world all of

3455
02:35:20,250 --> 02:35:24,390
those web sites really made it possible

3456
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:26,159
for us to share we were all kind of

3457
02:35:24,390 --> 02:35:28,109
outlaws but there we were sharing our

3458
02:35:26,159 --> 02:35:29,640
information kind of hoping that it

3459
02:35:28,110 --> 02:35:31,079
couldn't be traced back to us even

3460
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:34,109
though most people were probably not

3461
02:35:31,079 --> 02:35:36,300
masking their IPS we still did it and it

3462
02:35:34,110 --> 02:35:38,671
was it was really a part of the civil

3463
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:40,689
disobedience you know that fear of

3464
02:35:38,671 --> 02:35:42,700
making us all split up and not

3465
02:35:40,690 --> 02:35:45,430
in communication with one another that

3466
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:48,130
was the real damage that was done and so

3467
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:49,899
now as we are able to network again back

3468
02:35:48,129 --> 02:35:52,629
then especially through those websites

3469
02:35:49,899 --> 02:35:55,779
and now today through social media like

3470
02:35:52,629 --> 02:35:58,089
Instagram and YouTube and Facebook and

3471
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:59,950
Twitter these are just new ways for us

3472
02:35:58,090 --> 02:36:01,960
to stay connected with one another share

3473
02:35:59,950 --> 02:36:04,900
our information and realize that we're

3474
02:36:01,959 --> 02:36:07,319
much stronger allied together as we are

3475
02:36:04,899 --> 02:36:09,969
broken and separated apart

3476
02:36:07,319 --> 02:36:12,699
speaking of Instagram kik Berkeley

3477
02:36:09,969 --> 02:36:14,500
patients groups they kicked out our

3478
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:16,510
Instagram so we have a new Instagram so

3479
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:17,950
people if you could do me a favor at

3480
02:36:16,510 --> 02:36:19,690
some point if you happen to go through

3481
02:36:17,950 --> 02:36:21,790
Instagram go to Berkeley patients group

3482
02:36:19,690 --> 02:36:23,649
and hit a like we would love to get our

3483
02:36:21,790 --> 02:36:25,420
patients back we don't know why they

3484
02:36:23,649 --> 02:36:27,819
kicked it off it was just random and we

3485
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:29,680
were kicked so again you know the

3486
02:36:27,819 --> 02:36:32,379
prohibition and the fun that goes with

3487
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:33,940
the allottee still continues so but it

3488
02:36:32,379 --> 02:36:35,859
doesn't stop any we single one of those

3489
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:37,540
I see everybody here looks to be working

3490
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:40,750
and driving on and making the future

3491
02:36:37,540 --> 02:36:42,940
continue so we drive on yeah exactly

3492
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:44,709
well said at 10:00 thank you for coming

3493
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:48,101
in and sharing that and yeah

3494
02:36:44,709 --> 02:36:50,049
everyone in the room has instagrams as

3495
02:36:48,101 --> 02:36:51,489
well so at one point maybe towards the

3496
02:36:50,049 --> 02:36:54,429
end we'll try to go through the whole

3497
02:36:51,489 --> 02:36:56,500
well everyone but Sam as an Instagram

3498
02:36:54,430 --> 02:37:00,040
although I have seen a skunk man Sam but

3499
02:36:56,500 --> 02:37:05,310
it's not you it's not an obscene several

3500
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:05,311
struct man Sam's and know them for me

3501
02:37:05,370 --> 02:37:13,900
but have you ever seen your own skunk

3502
02:37:07,659 --> 02:37:16,360
man Sam and thought him I know no no

3503
02:37:13,899 --> 02:37:20,440
problem he still denies him to in the

3504
02:37:16,360 --> 02:37:25,659
mirror exactly the future of Kent of

3505
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:31,510
hashish to me a lot of it is dependent

3506
02:37:25,659 --> 02:37:34,329
on the cost of the raw materials in

3507
02:37:31,510 --> 02:37:38,200
other words when plants cost seven

3508
02:37:34,329 --> 02:37:39,159
thousand dollars a pound for manicured

3509
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:42,370
dry buds

3510
02:37:39,159 --> 02:37:45,101
it doesn't make economical sense to make

3511
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:49,320
resin for commercial production when

3512
02:37:45,101 --> 02:37:52,659
plants cost a hundred kilos I mean

3513
02:37:49,319 --> 02:37:53,879
excuse me a hundred dollars a kilo for a

3514
02:37:52,659 --> 02:37:59,610
dried plant and

3515
02:37:53,879 --> 02:38:02,369
Richard then it the commercial hashish

3516
02:37:59,610 --> 02:38:04,620
market would take off both water set dry

3517
02:38:02,370 --> 02:38:07,380
cept in all kinds of other ways because

3518
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:09,899
the raw materials are fundamentally

3519
02:38:07,379 --> 02:38:11,759
cheap then and you want to make

3520
02:38:09,898 --> 02:38:14,728
value-added products out of them and

3521
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:17,670
people will afford and want the very

3522
02:38:14,728 --> 02:38:19,590
best mm-hmm I think it's why you have a

3523
02:38:17,670 --> 02:38:21,719
passion to drive down the price of

3524
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:24,600
manicured flowers to teach people that

3525
02:38:21,719 --> 02:38:27,719
they can grow field grown cannabis with

3526
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:33,300
the Sun and still produce six star

3527
02:38:27,719 --> 02:38:35,789
resins well we are absolutely true we

3528
02:38:33,299 --> 02:38:37,739
also saw you know as Sam said 20 years

3529
02:38:35,790 --> 02:38:40,110
ago 20 plus years ago that's was the

3530
02:38:37,739 --> 02:38:42,209
price of cannabis here in California but

3531
02:38:40,110 --> 02:38:44,520
over time that is now dropped two words

3532
02:38:42,209 --> 02:38:47,009
it swelled to five to six hundred of

3533
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:49,079
pounds therefore it makes hashish much

3534
02:38:47,010 --> 02:38:51,120
more readily available to actually be

3535
02:38:49,079 --> 02:38:54,000
made as opposed to in the past it was

3536
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:56,130
economically unsound as I said and that

3537
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:58,680
was the reality situation but one did

3538
02:38:56,129 --> 02:39:00,599
take $7,000 Tom weed and then turn it

3539
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:02,850
into hash you know only unless you were

3540
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:07,200
an exceptional head everybody else it

3541
02:39:02,850 --> 02:39:09,479
was just Tuesday right true novel soil

3542
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:11,210
girls got a split on us hopefully he's

3543
02:39:09,478 --> 02:39:14,639
got one more little thing to share about

3544
02:39:11,209 --> 02:39:16,648
his inspirations his loves his passion

3545
02:39:14,639 --> 02:39:19,019
of cannabis I love the stories dude I

3546
02:39:16,648 --> 02:39:22,260
wish you got to talk more what do you

3547
02:39:19,020 --> 02:39:24,270
say yeah I mean I'm looking forward to

3548
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:26,159
the next hash Church I mean I think we

3549
02:39:24,270 --> 02:39:33,569
should really dig into a lot more of

3550
02:39:26,159 --> 02:39:37,049
these topics and yeah I mean keep

3551
02:39:33,569 --> 02:39:38,309
washing perfect Dave very cool well

3552
02:39:37,049 --> 02:39:39,779
thanks for coming out dude we are

3553
02:39:38,309 --> 02:39:45,329
definitely going to dig into more of

3554
02:39:39,780 --> 02:39:47,070
these topics someone asked what the if I

3555
02:39:45,329 --> 02:39:49,680
could sort of tell them a little bit

3556
02:39:47,069 --> 02:39:53,010
about what I plan on doing with hash

3557
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:54,300
Church 2.0 and really he wants to know

3558
02:39:53,010 --> 02:39:55,620
the direction that I'm going with the

3559
02:39:54,299 --> 02:39:57,239
hash search in the future and the rules

3560
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:59,430
different panelists will have and

3561
02:39:57,239 --> 02:40:01,020
basically it's pretty simple I want to

3562
02:39:59,430 --> 02:40:03,420
do specific talks where I invite

3563
02:40:01,020 --> 02:40:05,909
specific people not get too complacent

3564
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:06,810
and inviting the whole panel in over and

3565
02:40:05,909 --> 02:40:09,329
over and over again

3566
02:40:06,810 --> 02:40:11,159
which was great for hash trips 1.0 but I

3567
02:40:09,329 --> 02:40:13,620
think it's a little bit of what kind of

3568
02:40:11,159 --> 02:40:15,390
killed our vibe with was that it was the

3569
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:17,101
same people talking every week that we

3570
02:40:15,390 --> 02:40:18,810
were just having a hard time even coming

3571
02:40:17,101 --> 02:40:21,000
up with new conversation obviously

3572
02:40:18,810 --> 02:40:23,399
inviting new blood in people that are

3573
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:25,560
passionate about the discussion is gonna

3574
02:40:23,399 --> 02:40:27,959
be important and I look forward to all

3575
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:29,579
the panelists that are on the show today

3576
02:40:27,959 --> 02:40:31,560
and all the panelists that have been on

3577
02:40:29,579 --> 02:40:33,690
the show if you have any great ideas for

3578
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:35,101
shows like definitely get to me and we

3579
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:37,261
can produce it together over the course

3580
02:40:35,101 --> 02:40:39,329
of the week that's before the show I

3581
02:40:37,261 --> 02:40:41,700
don't even mind starting a month before

3582
02:40:39,329 --> 02:40:43,409
and getting some shows locked up and

3583
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:45,870
I've been doing it a little differently

3584
02:40:43,409 --> 02:40:48,750
in the sense of creating an agenda and

3585
02:40:45,870 --> 02:40:50,700
creating a contact sheet with emails and

3586
02:40:48,750 --> 02:40:52,681
and making it just a little bit easier I

3587
02:40:50,700 --> 02:40:55,561
never did any of this for hash Church

3588
02:40:52,681 --> 02:40:57,931
1.0 that [ __ ] was like by the seat of my

3589
02:40:55,560 --> 02:41:00,511
pants and I just think that it was such

3590
02:40:57,931 --> 02:41:02,610
a great concept and it blew up for a

3591
02:41:00,511 --> 02:41:05,431
little while so great that I would love

3592
02:41:02,610 --> 02:41:08,579
to see hash Church 2.0 do even do even

3593
02:41:05,431 --> 02:41:10,829
bigger things and of course it's not

3594
02:41:08,579 --> 02:41:13,021
anything without all of you showing up

3595
02:41:10,829 --> 02:41:14,670
on the panel and sharing sharing all

3596
02:41:13,021 --> 02:41:16,050
your great stories and your perspectives

3597
02:41:14,670 --> 02:41:17,879
and and you know what every once in

3598
02:41:16,049 --> 02:41:21,329
awhile if we don't see eye to eye and we

3599
02:41:17,879 --> 02:41:25,020
argue that's okay too I think that it's

3600
02:41:21,329 --> 02:41:26,909
something that we want to maintain and

3601
02:41:25,021 --> 02:41:28,561
hash Church is not always agreeing with

3602
02:41:26,909 --> 02:41:29,761
everyone but at least respecting

3603
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:32,520
everyone and listening to what they have

3604
02:41:29,761 --> 02:41:34,079
to say I'm stoked that the conversation

3605
02:41:32,521 --> 02:41:36,000
today I'm ready to go for a little while

3606
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:37,799
longer if you guys want to talk hashish

3607
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:41,190
maybe we should smoke some hashish I

3608
02:41:37,799 --> 02:41:45,090
mean my goodness I think what we need to

3609
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:48,870
do is organize that everybody promises

3610
02:41:45,090 --> 02:41:51,960
to grow 1,000 plants grind it up make a

3611
02:41:48,870 --> 02:41:55,740
sheesh out of it so that hashish will be

3612
02:41:51,959 --> 02:41:58,409
everywhere with everybody I'm telling

3613
02:41:55,739 --> 02:42:00,060
you you have the most unique perspective

3614
02:41:58,409 --> 02:42:02,340
Sam because you've grown the fields

3615
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:05,069
you've grown the huge greenhouses you

3616
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:07,590
know you've had material on a level that

3617
02:42:05,069 --> 02:42:10,170
most have not had access to like you

3618
02:42:07,590 --> 02:42:12,960
said the whole plants ground up and just

3619
02:42:10,170 --> 02:42:16,049
sitting waiting for you to to bounce

3620
02:42:12,959 --> 02:42:17,729
over screens or to to do whatever you

3621
02:42:16,049 --> 02:42:19,799
need to get done to get that resin off

3622
02:42:17,729 --> 02:42:21,988
of it's it's incredible man definitely

3623
02:42:19,799 --> 02:42:24,969
hats off

3624
02:42:21,988 --> 02:42:26,799
you have had a passion and a love for

3625
02:42:24,969 --> 02:42:28,118
this that really kind of kid I think

3626
02:42:26,799 --> 02:42:30,368
that you were one of the few people

3627
02:42:28,119 --> 02:42:32,588
holding the flame for a long time

3628
02:42:30,369 --> 02:42:34,449
especially in regards to hash dry

3629
02:42:32,588 --> 02:42:36,668
sifting knowledge and taking it to the

3630
02:42:34,449 --> 02:42:39,279
next level there was really you know

3631
02:42:36,668 --> 02:42:40,628
every year at the Cannabis Cup for I

3632
02:42:39,279 --> 02:42:42,100
can't remember what year I asked this

3633
02:42:40,629 --> 02:42:44,439
but I asked the audience like how many

3634
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:46,088
people have full melt dry sift how many

3635
02:42:44,439 --> 02:42:48,550
people have full melt water hash how

3636
02:42:46,088 --> 02:42:50,588
many people have oil oil was always the

3637
02:42:48,549 --> 02:42:53,078
majority of the crowds full melt water

3638
02:42:50,588 --> 02:42:55,898
hash in the early days was less but grew

3639
02:42:53,078 --> 02:43:00,809
as time went on and dry sift was always

3640
02:42:55,898 --> 02:43:06,189
Sam just the one hand in the audience

3641
02:43:00,809 --> 02:43:08,469
it's awesome I've been so grown has

3642
02:43:06,189 --> 02:43:10,869
split so say goodbye to him lots of

3643
02:43:08,469 --> 02:43:14,528
people produce very very high quality

3644
02:43:10,869 --> 02:43:17,199
dry set now it's no longer uncommon I

3645
02:43:14,529 --> 02:43:20,529
mean you don't see it in large amounts

3646
02:43:17,199 --> 02:43:24,609
and you don't see it everywhere but it

3647
02:43:20,529 --> 02:43:26,828
is there it's true it's absolutely there

3648
02:43:24,609 --> 02:43:29,199
you can put it in the hashtag on

3649
02:43:26,828 --> 02:43:31,389
Instagram and see it we've got there's

3650
02:43:29,199 --> 02:43:33,100
at least a few people producing very

3651
02:43:31,389 --> 02:43:34,898
nice resin and making it available

3652
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:37,300
there's no doubt that when we're in

3653
02:43:34,898 --> 02:43:38,498
Barcelona this year for spannabis and

3654
02:43:37,299 --> 02:43:40,628
I'll try to come up with some dates

3655
02:43:38,498 --> 02:43:44,828
maybe by next week for hash Church to

3656
02:43:40,629 --> 02:43:48,069
let people know it'll be probably a two

3657
02:43:44,828 --> 02:43:49,568
to three day event where we just you

3658
02:43:48,068 --> 02:43:51,578
know maybe we'll finish it off with the

3659
02:43:49,568 --> 02:43:53,109
dinner and the whole ticketed thing and

3660
02:43:51,578 --> 02:43:55,088
then the first couple of days can be us

3661
02:43:53,109 --> 02:43:57,369
meeting around Barcelona to just have

3662
02:43:55,088 --> 02:43:59,139
have a have a nice session maybe have a

3663
02:43:57,369 --> 02:44:01,418
house for one day where everyone comes

3664
02:43:59,139 --> 02:44:03,818
to I think it's a really good idea that

3665
02:44:01,418 --> 02:44:06,908
the samples have to be admitted three

3666
02:44:03,818 --> 02:44:08,559
days before the event yeah it's just

3667
02:44:06,908 --> 02:44:10,748
always been harder because I always

3668
02:44:08,559 --> 02:44:12,458
chose the people who are coming to the

3669
02:44:10,748 --> 02:44:15,010
event based on people that came to my

3670
02:44:12,459 --> 02:44:17,560
booth at spannabis and showed me

3671
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:19,418
beautiful hash that's right but it's

3672
02:44:17,559 --> 02:44:23,439
either got to be harder for the

3673
02:44:19,418 --> 02:44:25,059
organization of the event or harder I

3674
02:44:23,439 --> 02:44:27,908
less judged to the point of

3675
02:44:25,059 --> 02:44:29,708
impossibility right so let's make it

3676
02:44:27,908 --> 02:44:32,520
harder on the organization of the event

3677
02:44:29,709 --> 02:44:32,520
I agree

3678
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:39,970
I'm in IBO so anyone else got some takes

3679
02:44:38,530 --> 02:44:41,710
on whether they see the future of

3680
02:44:39,969 --> 02:44:43,409
hashish going maybe some of the people

3681
02:44:41,709 --> 02:44:47,049
we haven't heard from as much like

3682
02:44:43,409 --> 02:44:49,209
Andrew and Jessica or dr. ladybug or dab

3683
02:44:47,049 --> 02:44:51,670
logic I know that a lot of us are have

3684
02:44:49,209 --> 02:44:53,229
loud voices and we're very like non-stop

3685
02:44:51,670 --> 02:44:55,719
but I want to give you guys the

3686
02:44:53,229 --> 02:44:57,939
opportunity to say more as well people

3687
02:44:55,719 --> 02:45:01,500
want to hear from you I actually like to

3688
02:44:57,940 --> 02:45:05,260
ask you guys what about collecting the

3689
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:09,280
non-water the not water-soluble terpenes

3690
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:11,440
from hash water after washes because

3691
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:13,000
obviously most of us soon are doing

3692
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:16,750
production washes and we have so much

3693
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:18,129
water left over like what I cubed you

3694
02:45:16,750 --> 02:45:20,979
have a cold trap so I'm sure you're

3695
02:45:18,129 --> 02:45:22,989
collecting some of the Terps yeah I am

3696
02:45:20,979 --> 02:45:25,629
with a bulk amount of water that we have

3697
02:45:22,989 --> 02:45:31,360
what is there to do and what could we

3698
02:45:25,629 --> 02:45:32,319
possibly do with it so I have okay all

3699
02:45:31,360 --> 02:45:35,470
right sweet there we go

3700
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:37,119
so I have the Turk water from the drying

3701
02:45:35,469 --> 02:45:39,279
of the hash and I have a lot of it right

3702
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:42,600
I personally didn't know what to do with

3703
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:45,340
it because I put it in a separation

3704
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:47,620
funnel and I didn't separate like the

3705
02:45:45,340 --> 02:45:50,319
still Terps you know like two to an

3706
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:52,930
amount that would it be worth spending

3707
02:45:50,319 --> 02:45:55,239
time trying to extracted so when I saw

3708
02:45:52,930 --> 02:45:57,880
Tony at the emerald-cut I asked him

3709
02:45:55,239 --> 02:46:00,219
because he's a smart guy how you know

3710
02:45:57,879 --> 02:46:02,279
like yo what can I do with this he told

3711
02:46:00,219 --> 02:46:06,219
me that you can make woman's fragrance

3712
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:08,320
from the Turks from the hydrosols so I

3713
02:46:06,219 --> 02:46:09,609
think that's tight I'm gonna have

3714
02:46:08,319 --> 02:46:13,209
everybody sweating like Kimble and

3715
02:46:09,610 --> 02:46:15,159
cookies and cream oh geez so that's what

3716
02:46:13,209 --> 02:46:17,709
I'm hoping that I'm gonna do with my ice

3717
02:46:15,159 --> 02:46:19,379
water but I'm also curious because like

3718
02:46:17,709 --> 02:46:22,299
you I do have a lot

3719
02:46:19,379 --> 02:46:24,759
yeah dude Tony was that was that one of

3720
02:46:22,299 --> 02:46:27,670
his first ins to terpenes back in

3721
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:30,579
Colorado pre the conversation I had with

3722
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:33,579
K from trichome technologies who I guess

3723
02:46:30,579 --> 02:46:35,709
maybe a year into hash Church said to me

3724
02:46:33,579 --> 02:46:37,629
listen you should figure out how to get

3725
02:46:35,709 --> 02:46:39,250
the terpenes out of the water from

3726
02:46:37,629 --> 02:46:41,289
bubble water and that's gonna be your

3727
02:46:39,250 --> 02:46:42,639
future and I was kind of busy at the

3728
02:46:41,290 --> 02:46:44,440
time not really thinking that I was

3729
02:46:42,639 --> 02:46:46,750
going to focus on that but what I did do

3730
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:49,060
is I mentioned it to two people

3731
02:46:46,750 --> 02:46:51,280
I mentioned it to Tony who was in

3732
02:46:49,059 --> 02:46:53,409
Florida at the time at a very high-end

3733
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:55,210
lab and I think he was able to kind of

3734
02:46:53,409 --> 02:46:57,729
bounce things off of some pretty smart

3735
02:46:55,209 --> 02:46:59,709
people between him and them they he was

3736
02:46:57,729 --> 02:47:01,629
able to come up with I mean he had blue

3737
02:46:59,709 --> 02:47:05,319
river terpenes less than a month after

3738
02:47:01,629 --> 02:47:07,479
that conversation then Horatio was the

3739
02:47:05,319 --> 02:47:09,369
second person I mentioned it to and he

3740
02:47:07,479 --> 02:47:11,139
kind of just it went over his head he

3741
02:47:09,370 --> 02:47:13,210
wasn't interested but once Tony was

3742
02:47:11,139 --> 02:47:15,069
making terpenes and I called him out on

3743
02:47:13,209 --> 02:47:16,750
hash Church one time I said dude I told

3744
02:47:15,069 --> 02:47:19,059
you guys both on the same day about the

3745
02:47:16,750 --> 02:47:20,559
terpenes and Tony's had terpenes since

3746
02:47:19,059 --> 02:47:21,159
like two or three weeks later where's

3747
02:47:20,559 --> 02:47:25,269
yours

3748
02:47:21,159 --> 02:47:28,209
Horatio had them the next day so it's it

3749
02:47:25,270 --> 02:47:31,030
was definitely that trichome technology

3750
02:47:28,209 --> 02:47:33,039
k you know he's been doing terpenes for

3751
02:47:31,030 --> 02:47:34,930
a while now as well extracting them and

3752
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:37,270
he had Alexander Shulgin helping him and

3753
02:47:34,930 --> 02:47:39,180
whatnot so I'm sure we're gonna see more

3754
02:47:37,270 --> 02:47:41,110
from him in the near future

3755
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:43,239
unfortunately things went a little bit

3756
02:47:41,110 --> 02:47:45,220
south in regards to me telling those

3757
02:47:43,239 --> 02:47:48,340
guys about you know what they should do

3758
02:47:45,219 --> 02:47:50,049
just in conversation it's he was a

3759
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:52,090
little upset about them both having

3760
02:47:50,049 --> 02:47:54,340
terpenes on the market before he did so

3761
02:47:52,090 --> 02:47:56,079
apologies Takei definitely didn't mean

3762
02:47:54,340 --> 02:47:59,139
to step on anyone's toes but at the same

3763
02:47:56,079 --> 02:48:01,539
time you know sometimes it's not the

3764
02:47:59,139 --> 02:48:03,099
person that wants to come up with

3765
02:48:01,540 --> 02:48:05,200
something and release it but it's the

3766
02:48:03,100 --> 02:48:07,149
person who's actually gonna do it and I

3767
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:08,770
know that hurts the person who wants to

3768
02:48:07,149 --> 02:48:10,809
be the person to do it but it's like

3769
02:48:08,770 --> 02:48:11,979
guess what it just happens the way it

3770
02:48:10,809 --> 02:48:13,750
happens now and with things like

3771
02:48:11,979 --> 02:48:16,750
Instagram and it's like it can happen

3772
02:48:13,750 --> 02:48:19,239
fast with with just someone stepping

3773
02:48:16,750 --> 02:48:21,819
into the right timing they become the

3774
02:48:19,239 --> 02:48:24,190
person you know and it's people just

3775
02:48:21,819 --> 02:48:26,260
gotta respect that I just look at rosin

3776
02:48:24,190 --> 02:48:28,360
alone what you know a few years ago we

3777
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:32,170
did it the first rosin episode over at

3778
02:48:28,360 --> 02:48:33,670
the Ashe museum in Barcelona and now

3779
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:36,399
it's just at the Emerald cup and there's

3780
02:48:33,670 --> 02:48:38,950
a whole rosin section now so I mean is

3781
02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:42,159
the squishers there's every kind of

3782
02:48:38,950 --> 02:48:45,310
possible outlet now I mean it's it's

3783
02:48:42,159 --> 02:48:47,680
rather fascinating how things can gather

3784
02:48:45,309 --> 02:48:51,699
steam and roll forward rather quickly as

3785
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:54,040
you stay progress waits for no man right

3786
02:48:51,700 --> 02:48:55,840
well particularly why there's an open

3787
02:48:54,040 --> 02:48:57,790
dialogue about it particularly when

3788
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:59,560
there's an open dialogue happening and

3789
02:48:57,790 --> 02:49:01,181
information is being shared because when

3790
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:03,549
did that hash Church with soil grown I

3791
02:49:01,181 --> 02:49:04,931
think it was number 25 and he was

3792
02:49:03,549 --> 02:49:06,699
talking about it we were all like maybe

3793
02:49:04,931 --> 02:49:07,989
we could do machines wouldn't be cool if

3794
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:09,761
there were these big machines with

3795
02:49:07,989 --> 02:49:15,459
plates and it's like that's all a

3796
02:49:09,761 --> 02:49:18,280
reality now it's a no yeah I remember

3797
02:49:15,459 --> 02:49:20,680
when when I saw rosin for the first time

3798
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:22,061
it looked like witchcraft or wizardry

3799
02:49:20,681 --> 02:49:24,971
I couldn't believe that you could take

3800
02:49:22,060 --> 02:49:27,959
half note and make it something you

3801
02:49:24,970 --> 02:49:30,189
could smoke and I was like well I'm

3802
02:49:27,959 --> 02:49:31,390
making edibles with this stuff because I

3803
02:49:30,190 --> 02:49:34,329
have nothing to do with it

3804
02:49:31,390 --> 02:49:38,879
that should change my life so big up

3805
02:49:34,329 --> 02:49:42,879
soil grown we haven't seen yet is a

3806
02:49:38,879 --> 02:49:45,220
continuous operation rosin machine where

3807
02:49:42,879 --> 02:49:50,199
you just constantly feed it and it

3808
02:49:45,220 --> 02:49:53,619
constantly produces revs and 24/7 like a

3809
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:55,900
wish like a conveyor yeah maybe some

3810
02:49:53,620 --> 02:49:58,980
rollers let's get the conversation going

3811
02:49:55,899 --> 02:50:01,270
someone out there it's going to happen

3812
02:49:58,979 --> 02:50:02,859
I'm sure it's happening already I can

3813
02:50:01,271 --> 02:50:04,360
hear someone tapping away with a hammer

3814
02:50:02,860 --> 02:50:07,060
working in the background

3815
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:08,739
that [ __ ] was legit somebody just got

3816
02:50:07,060 --> 02:50:12,250
the idea and is patenting it right now

3817
02:50:08,739 --> 02:50:18,521
aren't you there Sam he's already

3818
02:50:12,250 --> 02:50:20,379
copyrighted it see he's on it well it's

3819
02:50:18,521 --> 02:50:22,811
interesting to see where the future of

3820
02:50:20,379 --> 02:50:25,239
hash will be whether you know dry sift

3821
02:50:22,810 --> 02:50:26,979
will pick up steam with new found

3822
02:50:25,239 --> 02:50:29,409
methods that allow for quicker

3823
02:50:26,979 --> 02:50:30,789
extraction if bubble hash is gonna have

3824
02:50:29,409 --> 02:50:33,280
a bigger comeback than it's already

3825
02:50:30,790 --> 02:50:38,740
having or if oil is just going to

3826
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:44,650
continue to you know kind of own the the

3827
02:50:38,739 --> 02:50:48,360
marketplace I'd like to speak on with

3828
02:50:44,649 --> 02:50:52,181
the prices going down in in California

3829
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:54,310
specifically like Sam was saying the

3830
02:50:52,181 --> 02:50:56,851
cost is is going to make a lot more

3831
02:50:54,310 --> 02:50:59,279
people jump on to making hash because

3832
02:50:56,851 --> 02:51:01,931
even if the yields are low the cost

3833
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:03,641
isn't there anymore so you can still

3834
02:51:01,931 --> 02:51:05,590
produce get a low yield and make your

3835
02:51:03,640 --> 02:51:08,140
money back so it's going to intrigue a

3836
02:51:05,590 --> 02:51:10,729
lot more farmers that were you know

3837
02:51:08,140 --> 02:51:13,279
normally sending their stuff off to be

3838
02:51:10,729 --> 02:51:16,550
Ram of butane to turn into ice water

3839
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:18,500
because a lot of a lot of the farmers I

3840
02:51:16,550 --> 02:51:21,829
work with would rather go solve unless

3841
02:51:18,500 --> 02:51:23,810
an organic method so if it cost if it's

3842
02:51:21,829 --> 02:51:25,851
cost-effective like it's happening in

3843
02:51:23,810 --> 02:51:28,579
California then we're gonna have I see a

3844
02:51:25,851 --> 02:51:30,829
lot more ash a lot love perhaps just

3845
02:51:28,579 --> 02:51:32,210
almost I would see to be competitive

3846
02:51:30,829 --> 02:51:35,479
with solvent extractions

3847
02:51:32,210 --> 02:51:38,029
yeah well or in some conjunction because

3848
02:51:35,479 --> 02:51:41,000
to make water extraction really work you

3849
02:51:38,030 --> 02:51:42,860
really should have a plan B for added

3850
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:44,630
value for the bulbous heads that aren't

3851
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:48,171
extracting through the sieving process

3852
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:50,539
they can make up sometimes 10% of the

3853
02:51:48,171 --> 02:51:51,921
yield and so that's a lot of heads to be

3854
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:54,051
leaving behind whether you're doing a

3855
02:51:51,921 --> 02:51:56,950
plant fat extract and producing products

3856
02:51:54,050 --> 02:51:59,359
like piranha whether you're doing a a

3857
02:51:56,950 --> 02:52:02,900
chemical extraction or a co2 extraction

3858
02:51:59,360 --> 02:52:05,271
producing distillate or whether you're

3859
02:52:02,899 --> 02:52:07,940
you know figuring out another method may

3860
02:52:05,271 --> 02:52:10,579
be a rosin method to produce oil for

3861
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:12,620
edibles either way getting that resin

3862
02:52:10,579 --> 02:52:15,591
off of the plant after you've washed it

3863
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:17,870
is definitely going to be sort of a key

3864
02:52:15,591 --> 02:52:21,470
thing if you want to have that added

3865
02:52:17,870 --> 02:52:23,271
value make up for you know the actual

3866
02:52:21,470 --> 02:52:25,819
potential loss that you'll see if you

3867
02:52:23,271 --> 02:52:30,171
just go from making oil to go to making

3868
02:52:25,819 --> 02:52:32,630
hash and the truth is water hash is much

3869
02:52:30,171 --> 02:52:36,200
more efficient at extracting all the

3870
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:48,710
resin than dry city dry city is not

3871
02:52:36,200 --> 02:52:53,181
particularly efficient yeah I hope to

3872
02:52:48,710 --> 02:52:58,039
see a greater demand for non solvent

3873
02:52:53,181 --> 02:53:00,021
concentrates but I still think that this

3874
02:52:58,040 --> 02:53:02,171
solvent abstracts mean to dominate the

3875
02:53:00,021 --> 02:53:04,040
market merely I mean just because

3876
02:53:02,171 --> 02:53:05,961
traditionally speaking we look at other

3877
02:53:04,040 --> 02:53:08,061
industries whatever is the most

3878
02:53:05,960 --> 02:53:10,489
efficient process he tends to dominate

3879
02:53:08,060 --> 02:53:13,819
and I mean you know let's face it like

3880
02:53:10,489 --> 02:53:15,949
you making it the beauty and guys are

3881
02:53:13,819 --> 02:53:18,500
putting out numbers that urges you know

3882
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:21,051
I mean incredible amounts of oil can be

3883
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:23,239
made from one person just you know in

3884
02:53:21,050 --> 02:53:24,409
the day and maybe they got like dual ten

3885
02:53:23,239 --> 02:53:26,750
pound

3886
02:53:24,409 --> 02:53:28,250
laughing columns like I mean you know we

3887
02:53:26,750 --> 02:53:30,500
have to we have to run a lot of material

3888
02:53:28,250 --> 02:53:33,890
to to make like those kind of numbers

3889
02:53:30,500 --> 02:53:36,709
but um yeah I mean you know with it's

3890
02:53:33,890 --> 02:53:38,569
all about economics and if the price

3891
02:53:36,709 --> 02:53:40,939
gets if the price drops and it's more

3892
02:53:38,569 --> 02:53:44,750
accessible for us then I think you know

3893
02:53:40,940 --> 02:53:45,980
so we'll be able to to have a place in

3894
02:53:44,750 --> 02:53:48,739
the market for sure

3895
02:53:45,979 --> 02:53:53,209
because you know a lot of people they do

3896
02:53:48,739 --> 02:53:55,219
want more like natural everything now

3897
02:53:53,209 --> 02:53:56,899
you know there's a big push for health

3898
02:53:55,219 --> 02:53:59,600
in general and you know I was reading

3899
02:53:56,899 --> 02:54:01,549
somewhere that the demand for vegan and

3900
02:53:59,601 --> 02:54:03,710
vegetarian food is increased a thousand

3901
02:54:01,549 --> 02:54:05,989
percent in the past 40 years you know so

3902
02:54:03,709 --> 02:54:08,060
I mean just not alone right there says

3903
02:54:05,989 --> 02:54:10,610
that there there should be a big market

3904
02:54:08,060 --> 02:54:12,129
for us you know moving forward but um

3905
02:54:10,610 --> 02:54:14,120
you know we'll see

3906
02:54:12,129 --> 02:54:18,109
yeah did you want to go ahead dank

3907
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:20,030
touches oh I actually want to say the

3908
02:54:18,110 --> 02:54:21,891
same thing that drew said what she was

3909
02:54:20,030 --> 02:54:23,329
like um I can't really speak to it being

3910
02:54:21,890 --> 02:54:25,909
a Chow I don't know so much about the

3911
02:54:23,329 --> 02:54:28,521
pho my kids but the push toward health

3912
02:54:25,909 --> 02:54:32,619
is something that is in a trend that's

3913
02:54:28,521 --> 02:54:35,780
not gonna reverse so like was the

3914
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:37,490
financial devs once we have once the

3915
02:54:35,780 --> 02:54:39,620
price comes down like I mean I'm a

3916
02:54:37,489 --> 02:54:42,440
grower so it doesn't affect me like that

3917
02:54:39,620 --> 02:54:44,271
because I'm not buying materials I run

3918
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:46,399
my own guitar and then I became a cash

3919
02:54:44,271 --> 02:54:49,489
in that but once the price comes down

3920
02:54:46,399 --> 02:54:51,170
and it is much easier to actually make

3921
02:54:49,489 --> 02:54:52,729
cash because a lot of people don't

3922
02:54:51,170 --> 02:54:55,340
understand that making house is not a

3923
02:54:52,729 --> 02:54:58,129
millionaires game no matter what you

3924
02:54:55,340 --> 02:55:00,680
think nobody I know who's making hash I

3925
02:54:58,129 --> 02:55:02,719
know a lot of hash tables a like rolling

3926
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:04,250
in the dough so when you're buying

3927
02:55:02,719 --> 02:55:06,170
material you're buying really really

3928
02:55:04,250 --> 02:55:07,579
quality material but the numbers just

3929
02:55:06,170 --> 02:55:09,010
don't add up so I could totally

3930
02:55:07,579 --> 02:55:11,271
understand why you would take that

3931
02:55:09,010 --> 02:55:13,010
superfly your in door and then make it

3932
02:55:11,271 --> 02:55:15,920
into the intro but if it's all about

3933
02:55:13,010 --> 02:55:17,569
money but if price comes down then this

3934
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:19,909
is something that's more feasible for

3935
02:55:17,569 --> 02:55:22,340
more of us and we can get to the market

3936
02:55:19,909 --> 02:55:24,530
more you know turkey or things that

3937
02:55:22,340 --> 02:55:26,210
taste murder and there are on that same

3938
02:55:24,530 --> 02:55:29,021
level that people who want that who have

3939
02:55:26,209 --> 02:55:32,629
that fine glass while their dad's to be

3940
02:55:29,021 --> 02:55:36,170
only I would only add to this in regards

3941
02:55:32,629 --> 02:55:36,938
to the difference of what dr. ladybug

3942
02:55:36,170 --> 02:55:39,488
was

3943
02:55:36,939 --> 02:55:41,648
in regards to the difference between the

3944
02:55:39,488 --> 02:55:43,689
oil yields and the bubble hash yields

3945
02:55:41,648 --> 02:55:45,458
the real real difference and I've told a

3946
02:55:43,689 --> 02:55:47,350
lot of my friends that are have

3947
02:55:45,459 --> 02:55:48,959
preference in oil that you know if you

3948
02:55:47,350 --> 02:55:51,670
if you have a preference in oil then

3949
02:55:48,959 --> 02:55:54,130
tricep bring it up separating the bland

3950
02:55:51,670 --> 02:55:56,648
heads out by micron size and seeing if

3951
02:55:54,129 --> 02:55:59,679
you can't make some oil with just 73 or

3952
02:55:56,648 --> 02:56:01,510
just 90 or just 120 and see what that

3953
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:04,529
oil is like compared to because I know

3954
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:07,568
as a hash maker if I took my 25 through

3955
02:56:04,529 --> 02:56:09,908
190 and put them all together and I've

3956
02:56:07,568 --> 02:56:12,458
ruined my 90 in 120 like if someone did

3957
02:56:09,908 --> 02:56:13,840
that I would smack their face so hard it

3958
02:56:12,459 --> 02:56:15,130
would be like I'm not a violent guy but

3959
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:16,689
I'm telling you you put all my ashes

3960
02:56:15,129 --> 02:56:18,849
together when a bunch of them are shady

3961
02:56:16,689 --> 02:56:21,158
and some of them are really great you're

3962
02:56:18,850 --> 02:56:23,828
definitely getting at least like a a

3963
02:56:21,158 --> 02:56:25,930
waft of my hand because it's it's it's

3964
02:56:23,828 --> 02:56:27,969
there it's special you can see it with

3965
02:56:25,930 --> 02:56:29,648
the naked eye where the magic lies

3966
02:56:27,969 --> 02:56:31,688
sometimes in these cultivars with

3967
02:56:29,648 --> 02:56:33,670
specific micron diameters and I'm not

3968
02:56:31,689 --> 02:56:36,130
against people mixing them up and doing

3969
02:56:33,670 --> 02:56:38,199
whatever they want but for me I really

3970
02:56:36,129 --> 02:56:39,698
love having them separate and I always

3971
02:56:38,199 --> 02:56:42,130
told my friends that had a preference

3972
02:56:39,699 --> 02:56:44,050
for oil I said man if you could see all

3973
02:56:42,129 --> 02:56:46,839
those shaggy bulbous heads that you're

3974
02:56:44,049 --> 02:56:50,559
melting off into you're 90 120 and 73

3975
02:56:46,840 --> 02:56:52,930
you would make hash first and make oil

3976
02:56:50,559 --> 02:56:54,760
with your with your hash and some did

3977
02:56:52,930 --> 02:56:57,609
some did it and they were just like holy

3978
02:56:54,760 --> 02:56:59,439
[ __ ] that made my oil like 5 times

3979
02:56:57,609 --> 02:57:00,998
stronger than it was and then it

3980
02:56:59,439 --> 02:57:03,068
separates and it creates a difference

3981
02:57:00,998 --> 02:57:05,020
out in the marketplace with the that the

3982
02:57:03,068 --> 02:57:06,609
normal everyday Joe who's buying this

3983
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:09,130
stuff can understand like this is

3984
02:57:06,609 --> 02:57:11,439
farmers grade oil in a sense it's the

3985
02:57:09,129 --> 02:57:13,688
full spectrum of all of the gland heads

3986
02:57:11,439 --> 02:57:16,658
from the bulbous which I personally as a

3987
02:57:13,689 --> 02:57:19,090
hash smoker don't want to smoke right up

3988
02:57:16,658 --> 02:57:21,248
to the the capitate stocks and sessile

3989
02:57:19,090 --> 02:57:23,469
stocked so that's a point I wanted to

3990
02:57:21,248 --> 02:57:25,629
make yeah that's a good point I get

3991
02:57:23,469 --> 02:57:27,698
asked a lot sometimes when I go on

3992
02:57:25,629 --> 02:57:30,129
livestream sometimes I'll do it to smoke

3993
02:57:27,699 --> 02:57:32,289
me join and get talk to the people and

3994
02:57:30,129 --> 02:57:34,778
they like to ask me Kuban would

3995
02:57:32,289 --> 02:57:38,170
especially know that that I've been

3996
02:57:34,779 --> 02:57:40,810
working and managing my homies garden

3997
02:57:38,170 --> 02:57:43,478
he's a hydrocarbon extractor he goes by

3998
02:57:40,809 --> 02:57:46,389
critical they like to ask me Cuban what

3999
02:57:43,478 --> 02:57:48,188
do you like oil or hash it's your

4000
02:57:46,389 --> 02:57:50,528
favorite and it's the same thing it's

4001
02:57:48,189 --> 02:57:52,600
like man I got a selection of heads

4002
02:57:50,529 --> 02:57:54,970
you make rasa with the 45 verses rasa

4003
02:57:52,600 --> 02:57:57,189
with a 90 then you already know what

4004
02:57:54,969 --> 02:57:59,318
what we're talking about there's a

4005
02:57:57,189 --> 02:58:01,029
totally different league there yeah well

4006
02:57:59,318 --> 02:58:03,578
that was that literally I don't know

4007
02:58:01,029 --> 02:58:05,668
when episode 25 on hash Church was but I

4008
02:58:03,578 --> 02:58:11,680
bet you it was very close to March

4009
02:58:05,668 --> 02:58:14,350
because we ended up ended up in Spain

4010
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:16,389
for Barcelona right after that episode

4011
02:58:14,350 --> 02:58:18,399
and we were showing people Jeff Church

4012
02:58:16,389 --> 02:58:20,469
and myself at my booth which was

4013
02:58:18,398 --> 02:58:22,478
actually Xavier from medical seeds booth

4014
02:58:20,469 --> 02:58:24,639
he was letting me work out of a corner

4015
02:58:22,478 --> 02:58:26,588
we had a little mini hair straightener

4016
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:28,838
and we were we were making rosin and

4017
02:58:26,588 --> 02:58:29,168
showing you know DNA I've never seen it

4018
02:58:28,838 --> 02:58:31,359
before

4019
02:58:29,168 --> 02:58:32,889
urban grower Remo had never seen it we

4020
02:58:31,359 --> 02:58:35,020
had all these incredible people in the

4021
02:58:32,889 --> 02:58:37,838
industry coming over and learning about

4022
02:58:35,020 --> 02:58:40,209
it and great gardener walked over and I

4023
02:58:37,838 --> 02:58:42,309
had cleaned a bunch of barbed dry sift

4024
02:58:40,209 --> 02:58:45,520
for him it was 6/3 dry sift it was

4025
02:58:42,309 --> 02:58:48,969
literally like 99.999 heads grown

4026
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:50,709
absolutely beautifully and cured

4027
02:58:48,969 --> 02:58:53,198
beautifully over the course of like

4028
02:58:50,709 --> 02:58:54,909
almost six months and he was like we'll

4029
02:58:53,199 --> 02:58:57,100
try some of this and that was the first

4030
02:58:54,908 --> 02:58:59,260
time and DNA was there and urban grower

4031
02:58:57,100 --> 02:59:01,238
was there and I think Cushman or some

4032
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:03,520
High Times guys were there and it was

4033
02:59:01,238 --> 02:59:06,639
just like squishing out that six-hour

4034
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:09,668
drive shaft was insane when we wrapped

4035
02:59:06,639 --> 02:59:11,798
it in the screen just with our hand and

4036
02:59:09,668 --> 02:59:14,859
it started dripping out of the screen

4037
02:59:11,799 --> 02:59:20,470
just with our hands like that [ __ ] was

4038
02:59:14,859 --> 02:59:23,020
insane yeah there's a hole in

4039
02:59:20,469 --> 02:59:25,688
California's where I see it mostly but

4040
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:28,658
now people are pressing the best hash

4041
02:59:25,689 --> 02:59:31,600
that they can get into rosin just

4042
02:59:28,658 --> 02:59:34,568
because they think it's that much better

4043
02:59:31,600 --> 02:59:36,729
and to me as a hash guy at first I think

4044
02:59:34,568 --> 02:59:38,889
it's crazy until you see the type of

4045
02:59:36,728 --> 02:59:41,769
rosin that these guys are making excites

4046
02:59:38,889 --> 02:59:45,430
me stupid fire and to be able to press a

4047
02:59:41,770 --> 02:59:48,640
six-star and in a production sense and

4048
02:59:45,430 --> 02:59:52,838
then Grandma what you're making and make

4049
02:59:48,639 --> 02:59:55,180
up any sort of profit is crazy as hell

4050
02:59:52,838 --> 02:59:58,389
so shout out to people like the rosin

4051
02:59:55,180 --> 03:00:03,180
Brothers yeah for real so they're doing

4052
02:59:58,389 --> 03:00:04,288
that and do you think that if you have

4053
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:07,020
99.9

4054
03:00:04,289 --> 03:00:08,939
percent resin heads and you squash it

4055
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:11,879
and you make Rossum do you think the

4056
03:00:08,939 --> 03:00:14,609
rosin is really significantly any better

4057
03:00:11,879 --> 03:00:19,020
at all and can it be preserved as good

4058
03:00:14,609 --> 03:00:20,459
as the dry cept well I don't think that

4059
03:00:19,020 --> 03:00:22,588
it would be any better if you're asking

4060
03:00:20,459 --> 03:00:25,709
me because I love smoking hash in its

4061
03:00:22,588 --> 03:00:28,888
raw form so I'm happy with it but there

4062
03:00:25,709 --> 03:00:32,099
are people that believe that just a waxy

4063
03:00:28,888 --> 03:00:34,978
layer of the head enough being able to

4064
03:00:32,099 --> 03:00:37,709
separate that from the essential oil and

4065
03:00:34,978 --> 03:00:40,108
purify it that much further they'll take

4066
03:00:37,709 --> 03:00:41,579
that step because to them they do

4067
03:00:40,109 --> 03:00:43,498
believe that it is a better quality

4068
03:00:41,578 --> 03:00:46,259
smoke if you do it at the right

4069
03:00:43,498 --> 03:00:49,020
temperatures it's almost as if per gram

4070
03:00:46,259 --> 03:00:53,099
and / way you're concentrating the THC

4071
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:57,029
and the turps and everything but I would

4072
03:00:53,099 --> 03:00:59,248
just slope the dry season I like dry sip

4073
03:00:57,029 --> 03:01:01,469
better I've never had anything I like

4074
03:00:59,248 --> 03:01:04,859
better but if somebody thinks they can

4075
03:01:01,468 --> 03:01:07,068
take my best dry set and make it into

4076
03:01:04,859 --> 03:01:17,969
rosin that's better I want to try it

4077
03:01:07,068 --> 03:01:20,638
let's do it I'm jumping on a plane yeah

4078
03:01:17,968 --> 03:01:23,098
so on another note of going back a

4079
03:01:20,638 --> 03:01:26,598
little bit on production costs there

4080
03:01:23,099 --> 03:01:31,498
already are farms that are producing

4081
03:01:26,599 --> 03:01:34,679
fresh frozen at about a $50 per unit

4082
03:01:31,498 --> 03:01:39,298
cost for twenty two hundred grams frozen

4083
03:01:34,679 --> 03:01:41,578
like that and then at that price now I

4084
03:01:39,299 --> 03:01:44,459
might not be the best material to wash

4085
03:01:41,578 --> 03:01:47,248
and make six star but for a hydrocarbon

4086
03:01:44,459 --> 03:01:49,289
extractor they're able to buy that

4087
03:01:47,248 --> 03:01:52,398
material and bring down their wholesale

4088
03:01:49,289 --> 03:01:54,389
price and hit the market with a decent

4089
03:01:52,398 --> 03:01:57,658
product you know what I mean

4090
03:01:54,388 --> 03:02:00,988
and it kind of not only this stabilizes

4091
03:01:57,658 --> 03:02:03,118
everything but it makes it makes it hard

4092
03:02:00,988 --> 03:02:05,099
to compete I think with hash because you

4093
03:02:03,119 --> 03:02:09,059
kind of do that with how should it be

4094
03:02:05,099 --> 03:02:11,328
hard I think I don't know well but one

4095
03:02:09,058 --> 03:02:14,519
of the futures of hashish will be

4096
03:02:11,328 --> 03:02:16,369
automated processing where you take

4097
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:18,560
dried plants you

4098
03:02:16,370 --> 03:02:22,280
put them in the machine it grinds them

4099
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:25,399
up and then has the ability to separate

4100
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:28,820
the resin to 99.9 with little or no loss

4101
03:02:25,399 --> 03:02:31,840
of any of the resin it it is possible it

4102
03:02:28,819 --> 03:02:37,039
will be will all be replaced by robots

4103
03:02:31,840 --> 03:02:39,771
bro it I I went to a facility on Friday

4104
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:42,620
and these guys they're bigger than life

4105
03:02:39,771 --> 03:02:44,180
like huge awesome indoor grows awesome

4106
03:02:42,620 --> 03:02:46,550
you know the way they scaled this

4107
03:02:44,180 --> 03:02:48,229
quality was mind-boggling to me as a

4108
03:02:46,549 --> 03:02:50,209
grower Ellison alright prop so I'm

4109
03:02:48,229 --> 03:02:52,279
locking their stuff and they have like

4110
03:02:50,209 --> 03:02:53,989
this area with like 70 trimmers it

4111
03:02:52,280 --> 03:02:55,790
almost looks like the classroom people

4112
03:02:53,989 --> 03:02:57,771
with their heads down put on the trim

4113
03:02:55,790 --> 03:02:59,601
bins and then I walked to another room

4114
03:02:57,771 --> 03:03:03,290
and they just have shelves of trimming

4115
03:02:59,601 --> 03:03:04,640
teeth I'm like holy [ __ ] if there is a

4116
03:03:03,290 --> 03:03:06,980
machine that you could just dump that

4117
03:03:04,639 --> 03:03:09,379
raw Keef into it and it could make you

4118
03:03:06,979 --> 03:03:13,369
hash the guy that made that machine

4119
03:03:09,379 --> 03:03:15,109
would be rich as hell for sure is that

4120
03:03:13,370 --> 03:03:16,521
that has to be a solution for everybody

4121
03:03:15,110 --> 03:03:19,220
I wonder how much Keith is sitting on

4122
03:03:16,521 --> 03:03:21,710
shows from big trimming operations to be

4123
03:03:19,219 --> 03:03:23,750
a lot and I'll tell you back in the day

4124
03:03:21,709 --> 03:03:28,909
they just used to like not even make it

4125
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:30,860
but throw it away with the trim back in

4126
03:03:28,909 --> 03:03:32,840
Florida we'd throw away all our trim and

4127
03:03:30,860 --> 03:03:36,590
so I figured out I could get like a

4128
03:03:32,840 --> 03:03:38,510
pantyhose and do some sort of keeping it

4129
03:03:36,590 --> 03:03:41,750
was a little ghetto but it worked but

4130
03:03:38,510 --> 03:03:43,610
anyways men I gotta get going like he's

4131
03:03:41,750 --> 03:03:45,950
getting a little rambunctious probably

4132
03:03:43,610 --> 03:03:49,130
gonna go out to breakfast I appreciate

4133
03:03:45,950 --> 03:03:52,900
you guys inviting thanks for coming out

4134
03:03:49,129 --> 03:03:54,560
we appreciate having you it was awesome

4135
03:03:52,899 --> 03:03:57,049
yeah yeah thank you

4136
03:03:54,560 --> 03:03:58,459
and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of

4137
03:03:57,049 --> 03:04:00,949

03:03:58,459 --> 03:04:05,560
happy 2018 oh no it's January Sarah

4139
03:04:00,950 --> 03:04:05,561
happy Sunday too man thank you and bye

4140
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:12,200
peace out man thanks thank you thank

4141
03:04:09,409 --> 03:04:14,619
your wife thank your son don't have fun

4142
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:17,120
it's always good to focus on children

4143
03:04:14,620 --> 03:04:19,280
but not here in hashed Church cuz we're

4144
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:21,230
focused on hash and so we're gonna stick

4145
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:23,900
with it we're gonna stay on it did you

4146
03:04:21,229 --> 03:04:26,090
hear that pun stick with it good hash

4147
03:04:23,899 --> 03:04:27,859
can put up posters that was what I

4148
03:04:26,090 --> 03:04:29,409
always thought back when I first saw

4149
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:31,480
melty hash I thought man I could

4150
03:04:29,409 --> 03:04:33,159
poster up with this and then I find that

4151
03:04:31,479 --> 03:04:35,829
I got real Mountie hash and I was like

4152
03:04:33,159 --> 03:04:38,920
damn I could put like anything up with

4153
03:04:35,829 --> 03:04:40,959
this like a framed wooden picture maybe

4154
03:04:38,920 --> 03:04:43,229
my friend after he falls asleep at night

4155
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:45,909
I could plug a hole in a boat with it

4156
03:04:43,229 --> 03:04:47,939
plug a hole in a boat with it in fact I

4157
03:04:45,909 --> 03:04:50,021
did one time get locked in a bathroom

4158
03:04:47,940 --> 03:04:51,640
cheering I think it was one of Bob

4159
03:04:50,021 --> 03:04:53,590
Marley's birthday I think it might have

4160
03:04:51,640 --> 03:04:55,959
been the one I was with you skunk man

4161
03:04:53,590 --> 03:04:58,271
Sam and your lovely wife in Negril

4162
03:04:55,959 --> 03:05:00,839
Jamaica and we're at Bob's birthday

4163
03:04:58,271 --> 03:05:03,880
concert and I got locked in the bathroom

4164
03:05:00,840 --> 03:05:06,219
the little thing that I went to open

4165
03:05:03,879 --> 03:05:08,049
broke off of the little sliding piece of

4166
03:05:06,219 --> 03:05:10,659
metal that keeps the door locked it

4167
03:05:08,049 --> 03:05:12,279
broke right off so and I had a match at

4168
03:05:10,659 --> 03:05:14,110
the time I was at the school of Sam

4169
03:05:12,280 --> 03:05:16,630
puffing all my Bulls with matches on

4170
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:18,250
fresh greens and so I used a match and I

4171
03:05:16,629 --> 03:05:20,259
used some full melt hash that we had

4172
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:21,940
made in Jamaica and I stuck it up

4173
03:05:20,260 --> 03:05:24,190
against the little pin and it just

4174
03:05:21,940 --> 03:05:26,079
opened up no problem and I was like damn

4175
03:05:24,190 --> 03:05:28,149
I'm like hashed MacGyver right now and

4176
03:05:26,079 --> 03:05:30,250
there's like nobody even like it was

4177
03:05:28,149 --> 03:05:32,229
before social media you that before you

4178
03:05:30,250 --> 03:05:35,079
shared all the stupid [ __ ] in your life

4179
03:05:32,229 --> 03:05:38,049
that happened it was like when when when

4180
03:05:35,079 --> 03:05:40,440
moments were just for you and not for

4181
03:05:38,049 --> 03:05:43,000
the whole world not for likes

4182
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:45,909
although chronic says we do it for the

4183
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:50,979
love not for the likes I agree

4184
03:05:45,909 --> 03:05:52,930
well played my friend well played well

4185
03:05:50,979 --> 03:06:01,539
that's something that you want to share

4186
03:05:52,930 --> 03:06:03,851
dab logic from the future I think you

4187
03:06:01,540 --> 03:06:07,210
know technology is gonna be a huge role

4188
03:06:03,851 --> 03:06:11,380
in that kind of upgrading our systems

4189
03:06:07,209 --> 03:06:13,689
and your production going that's gonna

4190
03:06:11,379 --> 03:06:17,920
be able to compete with BHO and things

4191
03:06:13,690 --> 03:06:21,540
like that I think as we you know mounted

4192
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:23,920
breeders begin to bring back that

4193
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:25,960
varieties and things like that we're

4194
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:28,719
gonna definitely see a lot more high

4195
03:06:25,959 --> 03:06:31,779
yielding hash strains you know like

4196
03:06:28,719 --> 03:06:33,609
everything we run here we lead with all

4197
03:06:31,780 --> 03:06:37,420
fresh frozen and we don't do anything

4198
03:06:33,610 --> 03:06:39,550
that does that gets us under 20% like

4199
03:06:37,420 --> 03:06:43,000
things like the chemi Jones typically do

4200
03:06:39,549 --> 03:06:45,459
like 30% makan millenia doing

4201
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:48,728
oil that's hash and then when we press

4202
03:06:45,459 --> 03:06:53,799
that down it's probably like 24% oil or

4203
03:06:48,728 --> 03:06:55,059
including the six star and uh you don't

4204
03:06:53,799 --> 03:06:59,049
press all your hash down though right

4205
03:06:55,059 --> 03:07:04,148
you guys sell hash as well so a lot of

4206
03:06:59,049 --> 03:07:10,648
hash mainly 5050 so well rosin but we

4207
03:07:04,148 --> 03:07:15,519
make 5050 so we have about every pound

4208
03:07:10,648 --> 03:07:18,728
60 grams of oil or of EDS and then

4209
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:20,950
another 60 grams or so of rosin grade or

4210
03:07:18,728 --> 03:07:24,159
whatever like that I'm a firm believer

4211
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:27,939
on separating the two and identifying

4212
03:07:24,159 --> 03:07:30,728
them as separate rosin pho pho sio2

4213
03:07:27,939 --> 03:07:33,939
those are oils and you know see

4214
03:07:30,728 --> 03:07:38,019
mechanical sieve water hash finger rub

4215
03:07:33,939 --> 03:07:40,420
those are hashes to me it's my

4216
03:07:38,020 --> 03:07:42,010
definition of them I think that there

4217
03:07:40,420 --> 03:07:46,329
seems to be quite a difference in the

4218
03:07:42,010 --> 03:07:49,689
two just from a perspective of smoking

4219
03:07:46,329 --> 03:07:54,250
go ahead a lot a lot of hash if it's--if

4220
03:07:49,689 --> 03:07:58,870
high-quality hash typically melts fairly

4221
03:07:54,250 --> 03:08:00,639
oily consistency it's not necessarily

4222
03:07:58,870 --> 03:08:06,760
like a runny oil or something like that

4223
03:08:00,639 --> 03:08:11,648
but it's it's definitely uh gooey greasy

4224
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:13,779
you know like to it and you listen you

4225
03:08:11,648 --> 03:08:15,250
named a cultivar can you name a few more

4226
03:08:13,779 --> 03:08:17,859
of what your favorites are for hash

4227
03:08:15,250 --> 03:08:20,850
making I know Gigi for was popular in

4228
03:08:17,859 --> 03:08:24,010
Colorado it always pumped up 20% plus

4229
03:08:20,850 --> 03:08:25,409
yeah Gigi you know the gorilla glue is

4230
03:08:24,010 --> 03:08:27,939
awesome

4231
03:08:25,409 --> 03:08:30,579
you know cookies varieties are great

4232
03:08:27,939 --> 03:08:32,889
Kemeny aged diesel lineage that's

4233
03:08:30,579 --> 03:08:36,909
typically what I find to be the best as

4234
03:08:32,889 --> 03:08:39,639
far as for fresh frozen on a skunk

4235
03:08:36,909 --> 03:08:43,680
lineage that that's around that is

4236
03:08:39,639 --> 03:08:47,469
actually very good hash making material

4237
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:51,389
is large heads and very nice color with

4238
03:08:47,469 --> 03:08:55,629
a very psychedelic type high to it I

4239
03:08:51,389 --> 03:08:57,489
mean there's there's there's a lot of

4240
03:08:55,629 --> 03:08:59,500
varieties that you can go to but you

4241
03:08:57,489 --> 03:09:03,459
could say that most of them fall into

4242
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:07,540
those lineage that at least are those 20

4243
03:09:03,459 --> 03:09:09,579
plus percent strains yeah and that's

4244
03:09:07,540 --> 03:09:11,350
another one of the most important

4245
03:09:09,579 --> 03:09:12,728
factors that you're gonna have access to

4246
03:09:11,350 --> 03:09:14,470
genetics if you're trying to get into

4247
03:09:12,728 --> 03:09:16,239
this in a commercial level and trying to

4248
03:09:14,469 --> 03:09:18,069
make it available and accessible for

4249
03:09:16,239 --> 03:09:20,500
people the reason that people have a

4250
03:09:18,069 --> 03:09:23,110
hard time doing it is a acquiring the

4251
03:09:20,500 --> 03:09:24,819
right cultivars and even be knowing what

4252
03:09:23,110 --> 03:09:27,100
the right cultivars are so I think now

4253
03:09:24,819 --> 03:09:28,569
would be a really great time for their

4254
03:09:27,100 --> 03:09:31,210
left for the few people that are still

4255
03:09:28,569 --> 03:09:33,969
left on the panel to share you know like

4256
03:09:31,209 --> 03:09:36,009
dab logic just did what their favorite

4257
03:09:33,969 --> 03:09:37,809
cultivars are that produce not

4258
03:09:36,010 --> 03:09:39,790
necessarily high yields but produce

4259
03:09:37,809 --> 03:09:42,279
unique cannabinoid profiles unique

4260
03:09:39,790 --> 03:09:44,740
terpene profiles or high yields whatever

4261
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:46,659
whatever your favorite is that I'm also

4262
03:09:44,739 --> 03:09:49,420
a fan of the skunk number one and the

4263
03:09:46,659 --> 03:09:52,719
Sleestak and the gorilla glues and the

4264
03:09:49,420 --> 03:09:56,139
oh geez and the where is my bike which

4265
03:09:52,719 --> 03:09:58,779
is you know probably a 23 to 25 percent

4266
03:09:56,139 --> 03:10:02,109
water hash and a 30 percent rosin

4267
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:04,090
yielder with very unique terpene content

4268
03:10:02,110 --> 03:10:06,899
higher high levels of terpene allene

4269
03:10:04,090 --> 03:10:10,450
which is that very exotic sort of haze

4270
03:10:06,898 --> 03:10:12,728
terpene that we all know and love about

4271
03:10:10,450 --> 03:10:19,149
you guys Jessica and Andrew what are you

4272
03:10:12,728 --> 03:10:22,000
what are some of your favorites we

4273
03:10:19,148 --> 03:10:25,239
worked with is very like cookie cherry

4274
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:26,829
pie kind of those kind of genetics we

4275
03:10:25,239 --> 03:10:29,770
get it you know hi it was a very high

4276
03:10:26,829 --> 03:10:32,049
quality I kind of got popular with the

4277
03:10:29,770 --> 03:10:35,560
pink champagne a couple years ago that

4278
03:10:32,049 --> 03:10:37,659
was a cherry pie and a GD P cross that

4279
03:10:35,559 --> 03:10:40,239
high-yield and just tasted like grape

4280
03:10:37,659 --> 03:10:42,610
and melted amazing but a lot of stuff

4281
03:10:40,239 --> 03:10:44,949
that we work with is like I feel like in

4282
03:10:42,610 --> 03:10:49,329
that cookie family whether it be like

4283
03:10:44,950 --> 03:10:52,220
the sherbert or any kind of cookie cross

4284
03:10:49,329 --> 03:10:55,789
and cherry pie that kind of stuff

4285
03:10:52,219 --> 03:10:59,179
well cool thank you for sharing what

4286
03:10:55,789 --> 03:11:01,130
about you doctor ladybug yeah we

4287
03:10:59,180 --> 03:11:04,398
actually all so lately we've been

4288
03:11:01,129 --> 03:11:08,538
running a lot of cookies I'm like cookie

4289
03:11:04,398 --> 03:11:11,809
crosses lately but we also run this

4290
03:11:08,539 --> 03:11:14,659
variety a 12 THC bomb things been around

4291
03:11:11,809 --> 03:11:18,228
for a while I really like that one it's

4292
03:11:14,658 --> 03:11:19,458
like a pig pen um the turn profile it's

4293
03:11:18,228 --> 03:11:23,118
kind of reminds me of those own

4294
03:11:19,459 --> 03:11:25,220
Flintstone Flintstone vitamins it kind

4295
03:11:23,119 --> 03:11:27,470
of has like a chalky through B but

4296
03:11:25,219 --> 03:11:29,269
there's like a funk and also I mean the

4297
03:11:27,469 --> 03:11:31,099
resin is really nice it doesn't even if

4298
03:11:29,270 --> 03:11:33,078
you let it go to full maturity it's it's

4299
03:11:31,100 --> 03:11:37,130
still dumped and it's very light color

4300
03:11:33,078 --> 03:11:38,930
and the the resin is very stable it's

4301
03:11:37,129 --> 03:11:40,759
really nice and like Gradius it but

4302
03:11:38,930 --> 03:11:42,770
it'll when in greece is it'll grease it

4303
03:11:40,760 --> 03:11:44,389
like an oil puddle but but I like that

4304
03:11:42,770 --> 03:11:49,090
resin that's that's really gritty and

4305
03:11:44,389 --> 03:11:53,059
stable probably though my favorite

4306
03:11:49,090 --> 03:11:58,130
terpene profile was came from this

4307
03:11:53,059 --> 03:12:01,939
variety called kc 36 it's white widow

4308
03:11:58,129 --> 03:12:05,148
across to casey 606 it's a it's like a

4309
03:12:01,939 --> 03:12:06,800
fruity funky it's like really hard to

4310
03:12:05,148 --> 03:12:07,908
describe I can't really like place it

4311
03:12:06,799 --> 03:12:09,858
it's kind of one of those you know that

4312
03:12:07,908 --> 03:12:10,760
kind of leaves you like it lingers in

4313
03:12:09,859 --> 03:12:12,229
your mouth and you kind of like

4314
03:12:10,760 --> 03:12:13,670
scratching your head like what is that

4315
03:12:12,228 --> 03:12:16,818
like it just like jumps all over the

4316
03:12:13,670 --> 03:12:19,459
place but um it's just also a a variety

4317
03:12:16,818 --> 03:12:22,600
called Lucy it's very similar we ran

4318
03:12:19,459 --> 03:12:26,390
that this year dad it was incredible

4319
03:12:22,600 --> 03:12:27,738
lost the cut didn't clone it it wasn't

4320
03:12:26,389 --> 03:12:32,328
sure really what it was just like threw

4321
03:12:27,738 --> 03:12:34,908
a couple outside last year and yeah and

4322
03:12:32,328 --> 03:12:36,318
then that unfortunately the nursery lost

4323
03:12:34,908 --> 03:12:39,439
the genetics during the Santa Rosa fire

4324
03:12:36,318 --> 03:12:41,328
so I'm not sure we're gonna get that one

4325
03:12:39,439 --> 03:12:43,459
back again look pretty sad well that's

4326
03:12:41,328 --> 03:12:45,288
two more stories in a row that reminds

4327
03:12:43,459 --> 03:12:47,149
me to tell everyone that sharing is

4328
03:12:45,289 --> 03:12:49,850
caring and giving away your genetics

4329
03:12:47,148 --> 03:12:51,408
won't probably hurt you I'm not talking

4330
03:12:49,850 --> 03:12:53,090
about Sam who spent millions of dollars

4331
03:12:51,408 --> 03:12:54,799
breeding and this that the other thing

4332
03:12:53,090 --> 03:12:56,510
but if you just acquired your genetics

4333
03:12:54,799 --> 03:12:58,908
through gift which I'm sure you probably

4334
03:12:56,510 --> 03:13:00,680
have sharing something that you made

4335
03:12:58,908 --> 03:13:02,180
from that gift is not going to be the

4336
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:03,648
end of the world it's good to get it out

4337
03:13:02,180 --> 03:13:05,069
there at least try to share it with a

4338
03:13:03,648 --> 03:13:07,500
few people I like to share

4339
03:13:05,069 --> 03:13:09,420
a lot and I'll tell you I never lose

4340
03:13:07,500 --> 03:13:12,959
cultivars because of it it's always the

4341
03:13:09,420 --> 03:13:13,920
same story oh [ __ ] that combo I had is

4342
03:13:12,959 --> 03:13:19,379
dying

4343
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:21,329
thank God I gave it to 47 people the

4344
03:13:19,379 --> 03:13:23,970
reason I have TGA seeds right now is

4345
03:13:21,329 --> 03:13:26,521
because that wonderful man spread his

4346
03:13:23,970 --> 03:13:28,920
genetics and love around and he lost

4347
03:13:26,521 --> 03:13:30,271
everything in the fire unfortunately

4348
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:31,560
people had it and gave back to him

4349
03:13:30,271 --> 03:13:33,540
otherwise I wouldn't have some of the

4350
03:13:31,560 --> 03:13:35,761
seeds I have on the floor right now it's

4351
03:13:33,540 --> 03:13:37,320
true he got a lot of seeds give him back

4352
03:13:35,761 --> 03:13:39,780
to him because he gave away so many

4353
03:13:37,319 --> 03:13:42,989
seeds it's like hello sharing is caring

4354
03:13:39,780 --> 03:13:44,489
the loaf comes back always I'm kind of

4355
03:13:42,989 --> 03:13:46,261
the anomaly though when you're going

4356
03:13:44,489 --> 03:13:49,619
back talking about the hash because ever

4357
03:13:46,261 --> 03:13:52,739
since I did bubble hash back in the late

4358
03:13:49,620 --> 03:13:54,870
90s it was actually my tattoo here's of

4359
03:13:52,739 --> 03:13:57,300
the flow is my favorite genetic and

4360
03:13:54,870 --> 03:13:59,910
horrible unfortunately that got lost

4361
03:13:57,300 --> 03:14:03,149
along the way but I literally brought it

4362
03:13:59,909 --> 03:14:05,159
in and laid it on you know the but on on

4363
03:14:03,149 --> 03:14:07,289
the thing my tattoo artist drew it on me

4364
03:14:05,159 --> 03:14:10,681
and it was just one of my favorites but

4365
03:14:07,290 --> 03:14:12,000
ever since then I'm a sinner to you

4366
03:14:10,681 --> 03:14:16,101
bubbleman because I've kind of always

4367
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:18,479
taken my bubble and I put it in a

4368
03:14:16,101 --> 03:14:20,610
grinder and I grind it all together and

4369
03:14:18,479 --> 03:14:22,709
I pressed it all together I love the

4370
03:14:20,610 --> 03:14:25,530
different flavors for me I go for

4371
03:14:22,709 --> 03:14:27,739
effects so for me for my medical

4372
03:14:25,530 --> 03:14:30,391
condition I like the full spectrum so

4373
03:14:27,739 --> 03:14:33,511
I've kind of always have been repressed

4374
03:14:30,390 --> 03:14:35,819
my water hash back into my own hash

4375
03:14:33,511 --> 03:14:37,890
which is of course net needless to say

4376
03:14:35,819 --> 03:14:41,011
is full milk but I get the full spectrum

4377
03:14:37,890 --> 03:14:43,649
of need that I enjoy I also do the same

4378
03:14:41,011 --> 03:14:45,420
thing with my BHO I take all my BA chose

4379
03:14:43,649 --> 03:14:47,399
that I get of course I get it here at 4

4380
03:14:45,420 --> 03:14:49,319
b PG and they're all tested so they're

4381
03:14:47,399 --> 03:14:50,970
clean and I put them in a little oven at

4382
03:14:49,319 --> 03:14:52,409
a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit

4383
03:14:50,970 --> 03:14:53,970
and I literally put them in a little

4384
03:14:52,409 --> 03:14:57,420
autoclave and I mix them all together

4385
03:14:53,970 --> 03:14:59,850
and so again I get the full spectrum I

4386
03:14:57,420 --> 03:15:01,970
get some funky flavors as they blend

4387
03:14:59,851 --> 03:15:04,829
together don't get me wrong but again

4388
03:15:01,970 --> 03:15:07,379
it's not so much for me for flavor as

4389
03:15:04,829 --> 03:15:09,629
much as it is for the effect for my

4390
03:15:07,379 --> 03:15:12,479
medical condition I have go for syndrome

4391
03:15:09,629 --> 03:15:14,459
I have I've nerve issues I've got

4392
03:15:12,479 --> 03:15:16,409
chronic pain and all kinds of things

4393
03:15:14,459 --> 03:15:18,478
that I deal with so I do love the

4394
03:15:16,409 --> 03:15:19,920
individual flavors you know

4395
03:15:18,478 --> 03:15:21,420
dank touches had some beautiful stuff

4396
03:15:19,920 --> 03:15:24,389
come through lately and it was

4397
03:15:21,420 --> 03:15:25,949
absolutely wonderful and I love again

4398
03:15:24,389 --> 03:15:29,129
the different flavors that for in the

4399
03:15:25,949 --> 03:15:32,189
end I still kind of mix it all together

4400
03:15:29,129 --> 03:15:34,589
you know because Jett just works for me

4401
03:15:32,189 --> 03:15:36,119
and I respect you and I won't when I'm

4402
03:15:34,590 --> 03:15:38,309
with you I make sure that it is

4403
03:15:36,119 --> 03:15:41,640
separated into the individuals so that I

4404
03:15:38,309 --> 03:15:45,689
don't share my mud with you but that I

4405
03:15:41,639 --> 03:15:47,760
pop your mud I puff your mud dude and

4406
03:15:45,689 --> 03:15:49,949
honestly you remind me of my old buddy

4407
03:15:47,760 --> 03:15:51,930
David Esau from like hockey when we were

4408
03:15:49,949 --> 03:15:54,630
11 years old showing me about the swamp

4409
03:15:51,930 --> 03:15:56,340
water you know I like all the individual

4410
03:15:54,629 --> 03:15:58,108
tastes but I'm really more about the

4411
03:15:56,340 --> 03:15:59,670
effect of bouncing off the walls from

4412
03:15:58,109 --> 03:16:03,328
all the different sugars that are in

4413
03:15:59,670 --> 03:16:06,658
this drink root beer ginger ale Coca

4414
03:16:03,328 --> 03:16:08,068
Cola Orange Crush yeah I was 11

4415
03:16:06,658 --> 03:16:10,109
yeah it probably wasn't good for my

4416
03:16:08,068 --> 03:16:13,049
teeth but you brought me back at ten I

4417
03:16:10,109 --> 03:16:14,729
appreciate that so and flow was the bomb

4418
03:16:13,049 --> 03:16:16,170
that was also breeder Steve's favorite

4419
03:16:14,728 --> 03:16:19,908
plant back in the day when he was

4420
03:16:16,170 --> 03:16:24,270
growing in Lugano Switzerland in 2003

4421
03:16:19,908 --> 03:16:26,520
2004 he he had some some incredible flow

4422
03:16:24,270 --> 03:16:28,578
genetics props to DJ short for making

4423
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:31,199
that one I heard it was a real mutant

4424
03:16:28,578 --> 03:16:32,728
and I I don't know that it exists

4425
03:16:31,199 --> 03:16:34,649
anymore but if it ever does I really

4426
03:16:32,728 --> 03:16:36,629
wanted again anyway I loved it so much

4427
03:16:34,648 --> 03:16:38,309
and the bud that I grew is the one

4428
03:16:36,629 --> 03:16:40,049
that's on my arm so I grew it and grew

4429
03:16:38,309 --> 03:16:42,269
wonderfully and it made beautiful water

4430
03:16:40,049 --> 03:16:44,278
hash because I had the original machine

4431
03:16:42,270 --> 03:16:47,600
before your bags I had one of the

4432
03:16:44,279 --> 03:16:51,390
original Isolators back in the day and

4433
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:52,979
that was challenging and you had to

4434
03:16:51,389 --> 03:16:55,439
always automatically clean it out

4435
03:16:52,978 --> 03:16:57,868
because as as people and who have dealt

4436
03:16:55,439 --> 03:17:00,809
with bubble no do not let your water sit

4437
03:16:57,869 --> 03:17:03,869
we all know the sin that happens if

4438
03:17:00,809 --> 03:17:06,118
somebody anybody accidentally let their

4439
03:17:03,869 --> 03:17:08,460
water sit was sometime in the stink

4440
03:17:06,119 --> 03:17:12,029
nastiness that you have to do with that

4441
03:17:08,459 --> 03:17:14,969
toxic what what would you call that that

4442
03:17:12,029 --> 03:17:16,619
transpires they I call it tent funk

4443
03:17:14,969 --> 03:17:18,898
it's like lending your tent to your

4444
03:17:16,619 --> 03:17:20,369
[ __ ] bro that never dried it out but

4445
03:17:18,898 --> 03:17:22,288
he just wrapped it up and put it in the

4446
03:17:20,369 --> 03:17:24,810
bag and then gave it back to you I call

4447
03:17:22,289 --> 03:17:27,569
it the tent funk not to be confused with

4448
03:17:24,809 --> 03:17:30,028
the funk from the west coast but the

4449
03:17:27,568 --> 03:17:31,139
tent funk it's no bueno and it happens

4450
03:17:30,029 --> 03:17:32,819
to bubble bags

4451
03:17:31,139 --> 03:17:35,369
it'll pass on to your hash each and

4452
03:17:32,818 --> 03:17:38,219
every batch you make and it's it's like

4453
03:17:35,370 --> 03:17:41,489
it's one of the like deadly sins against

4454
03:17:38,219 --> 03:17:44,670
the hash maker thou shalt not lend thy

4455
03:17:41,488 --> 03:17:45,779
bubble bags shalt not put my foot about

4456
03:17:44,670 --> 03:17:50,549
legs away wet

4457
03:17:45,779 --> 03:17:53,550
don't do it yeah - take that funk it's

4458
03:17:50,549 --> 03:17:57,329
it's just funk it's a lot like cherry

4459
03:17:53,549 --> 03:17:59,129
used condoms I think that is the most

4460
03:17:57,329 --> 03:18:00,809
disturbing thing that anyone said on

4461
03:17:59,129 --> 03:18:03,839
hash chairs and of course it has to be

4462
03:18:00,809 --> 03:18:06,109
Scott man Sam we accept you for all that

4463
03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:09,898
you are and that is definitely

4464
03:18:06,109 --> 03:18:14,609
definitely made my skin crawl okay Sam

4465
03:18:09,898 --> 03:18:17,670
when did that happen no I got to avoid

4466
03:18:14,609 --> 03:18:21,390
it yeah yeah okay all right but she

4467
03:18:17,670 --> 03:18:23,279
brought it up so we're just stuff oh my

4468
03:18:21,389 --> 03:18:25,469
gosh that was shocking

4469
03:18:23,279 --> 03:18:27,689
I think first it was shocking that I I

4470
03:18:25,469 --> 03:18:30,090
was looking right at the Duchess when I

4471
03:18:27,689 --> 03:18:32,579
saw her expression change and then I was

4472
03:18:30,090 --> 03:18:35,699
like oh no like I'm embarrassed for all

4473
03:18:32,579 --> 03:18:37,350
men everywhere we've done this before

4474
03:18:35,699 --> 03:18:42,720
then the last time I was here it was

4475
03:18:37,350 --> 03:18:44,760
just like size matters oh yeah we're not

4476
03:18:42,719 --> 03:18:47,068
gonna do that you know go into that but

4477
03:18:44,760 --> 03:18:48,750
you know I would rather have a bigger

4478
03:18:47,068 --> 03:18:51,028
piece of hash than a smaller is that

4479
03:18:48,750 --> 03:18:53,340
what you're saying that is exactly it

4480
03:18:51,029 --> 03:18:58,010
that's exactly what I was going here

4481
03:18:53,340 --> 03:19:01,978
well I know my hash never runs out and

4482
03:18:58,010 --> 03:19:03,840
I'm talking about hash 100% which I

4483
03:19:01,978 --> 03:19:06,599
probably should take a little rip of I

4484
03:19:03,840 --> 03:19:08,969
think I don't know I feel pretty good we

4485
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:10,380
did three hours and 20 minutes so far if

4486
03:19:08,969 --> 03:19:12,209
anyone has anything else they want to

4487
03:19:10,379 --> 03:19:13,969
really for sure mention and say by all

4488
03:19:12,209 --> 03:19:16,049
means now it would be a great time to

4489
03:19:13,969 --> 03:19:18,260
step up to the plate if you have a

4490
03:19:16,049 --> 03:19:22,049
conversation that we want brought up or

4491
03:19:18,260 --> 03:19:27,029
one thing I have to say is the future of

4492
03:19:22,049 --> 03:19:29,429
hash we are the future of hash we will

4493
03:19:27,029 --> 03:19:33,510
make the future of ash all of us

4494
03:19:29,430 --> 03:19:36,779
together all of our ideas and it's going

4495
03:19:33,510 --> 03:19:39,180
to happen and it's gonna get better well

4496
03:19:36,779 --> 03:19:41,488
that is very well said Sam I was gonna

4497
03:19:39,180 --> 03:19:43,260
say the youth myself but you know what

4498
03:19:41,488 --> 03:19:45,011
who are the youth if they can't stand on

4499
03:19:43,260 --> 03:19:47,560
the shoulders of giants

4500
03:19:45,011 --> 03:19:49,420
which we've been lucky enough to do and

4501
03:19:47,560 --> 03:19:51,970
some of us have been lucky enough to

4502
03:19:49,420 --> 03:19:54,879
offer to be the shoulders to stand on

4503
03:19:51,970 --> 03:19:56,529
like Sam and other great hashish

4504
03:19:54,879 --> 03:19:59,020
aficionados over the years and that's

4505
03:19:56,530 --> 03:20:02,230
what we celebrate at legends of hash we

4506
03:19:59,021 --> 03:20:03,579
celebrate legends of past and so you

4507
03:20:02,229 --> 03:20:06,159
know we were never celebrating ourselves

4508
03:20:03,579 --> 03:20:09,011
at legends of hash that was never an

4509
03:20:06,159 --> 03:20:10,750
option unless one of us dies off but it

4510
03:20:09,011 --> 03:20:13,120
was always celebrating the true legends

4511
03:20:10,750 --> 03:20:15,069
of hash and I don't know maybe

4512
03:20:13,120 --> 03:20:17,110
wouldn't it be a cool thing to read one

4513
03:20:15,069 --> 03:20:26,261
of those cards if we had access to it

4514
03:20:17,110 --> 03:20:28,301
Sam I've got I've got the gardens of

4515
03:20:26,261 --> 03:20:30,159
Koffler so maybe I'll read that real

4516
03:20:28,300 --> 03:20:31,899
quick and that's how well we'll finish

4517
03:20:30,159 --> 03:20:36,369
off hash Church today this was from

4518
03:20:31,899 --> 03:20:38,590
legends of hash Roman numeral 10 not to

4519
03:20:36,370 --> 03:20:40,391
be confused with the iPhone but it's the

4520
03:20:38,590 --> 03:20:44,050
legends of hash 10 this was the 10 year

4521
03:20:40,390 --> 03:20:46,060
anniversary and it was the the Garden of

4522
03:20:44,050 --> 03:20:48,029
khufu or the garden or the green plant

4523
03:20:46,060 --> 03:20:50,409
which grows in the gardens of Khufu

4524
03:20:48,030 --> 03:20:53,891
replaces in our hearts the effects of

4525
03:20:50,409 --> 03:20:56,110
old and noble wine in the 12th century

4526
03:20:53,890 --> 03:20:58,181
Cairo the favorite meeting place for the

4527
03:20:56,110 --> 03:21:01,569
hashish connoisseurs was the legendary

4528
03:20:58,181 --> 03:21:03,819
gardens of Khufu islamic law forbade the

4529
03:21:01,569 --> 03:21:06,011
drinking of wine but mez many Muslims

4530
03:21:03,819 --> 03:21:08,379
especially Sufis were great proponents

4531
03:21:06,011 --> 03:21:10,960
of hashish eating and its legality was

4532
03:21:08,379 --> 03:21:13,510
hotly debated by Islamic courts by the

4533
03:21:10,959 --> 03:21:15,489
14th century conservative mother Muslim

4534
03:21:13,511 --> 03:21:18,040
leaders won out and came down hard by

4535
03:21:15,489 --> 03:21:20,021
destroying kafirs gardens burning

4536
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:22,601
surrounding hashish field and starving

4537
03:21:20,021 --> 03:21:24,190
out the farmers shops and cafes selling

4538
03:21:22,601 --> 03:21:26,530
hashish were closed and the owners

4539
03:21:24,190 --> 03:21:30,489
hunted down and killed but hashish use

4540
03:21:26,530 --> 03:21:32,141
still continued in 1378 the frustrated

4541

Cairo government forced all known how

4542

sheesh users into the main square where

4543
03:21:33,970 --> 03:21:38,079
soldiers wrenched out their teeth

a decade later how she's eating still

4545
03:21:38,079 --> 03:21:42,579
thrived in Egypt as it had become too

4546
03:21:40,090 --> 03:21:45,190
much a part of the Arab way of life to

4547
03:21:42,579 --> 03:21:47,170
be forsaken may the gardens of Khufu

4548
03:21:45,190 --> 03:21:49,989
serve as an ancient reminder that

4549
03:21:47,170 --> 03:21:52,479
cannabis prohibition will never succeed

4550
03:21:49,989 --> 03:21:54,970
