53
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,680
been doing this a while and we put our

54
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,550
money where our mouth is literally take

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,340
you know decades ago well it's

56
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,709
definitely one of the first sort of you

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,159
know I guess I met I guess I met Debbie

58
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:53,939
at least 20 years ago maybe even like 21

59
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,329
or 22 years ago right um right before it

60
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,300
that all sort of started rolling but

61
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:02,340
amazing how fast things go as you just

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,320
get get older times just passing right

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,170
we're just like in the early days it

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,239
just seemed to take very long periods of

65
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:12,179
time to pass these years and now it's

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,150
just I seem like I blink and a fiver has

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,370
gone by well we've told a lot of wrote

68
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,469
in these last 20 years as well you know

69
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,750
20 years ago they said it never happened

70
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:24,209
in our lifetimes right and you know

71
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,009
being neck deep in it and doing

72
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,989
everything that we've done we've picked

73
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,539
up people like Johnny B and others along

74
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,670
the way that have joined the cause and

75
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:37,530
now we're just an unstoppable momentum

76
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:39,719
hi Johnny be like we said like years ago

77
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,310
you know and that trees falling in the

78
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,689
force and it's calling it's like that's

79
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,699
what happen with cannabis not true is

80
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,400
following it eventually it was gonna hit

81
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,129
the ground and that was gonna it's we

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,840
are today Wow let's get him close for

83
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,659
like 31 days away from the legalization

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,189
here in Canada we're at the grassroots

85
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,489
conference yesterday and talking about

86
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:02,430
it you know what it's everybody's

87
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:04,950
looking at a huge change it's good today

88
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,920
across the board I mean it's exciting

89
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:10,018
and it's scary too absolutely

90
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,729
well it's not perfect and everybody

91
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,400
expected perfection right out the gate

92
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:17,370
from you know your laws and our laws and

93
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,228
of course they're not perfect so people

94
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,970
think that since we won we get to give

95
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:22,469
up and you know have a great time and

96
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,860
it's like no this is where we need to

97
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,150
actually be in and involved and the old

98
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,979
saying goes if you're

99
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,888
part of the discussion if you're not at

100
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:34,349
the table then you're on the menu so the

101
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,780
best thing is to always be involved so

102
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,340
that you are always you know talking

103
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:39,929
about you may not always be on the menu

104
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,569
but at the same time you can at least

105
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,579
help and contribute because we all have

106
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:46,500
fostered knowledge from what we've

107
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,569
gained from doing what we've done you

108
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,759
know some have gone into consultants

109
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:54,000
others just you know double down and we

110
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,860
do what we do so proud of everybody here

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,019
for what y'all have done up in Canada

112
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,819
and hopefully someday we'll have some

113
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,129
reflection and what's going on in the

114
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,990
United States and I apologize for our

115
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,089
stupid government really [ __ ] with

116
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,460
y'all and your people up there in Canada

117
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:09,810
regarding you know coming to the United

118
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,329
States they're threatening to boycott

119
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,250
people for life from coming into the

120
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,719
United States I'm reading this morning

121
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,149
that you know the United States is

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,919
trying to talk to Canada but our

123
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:21,870
president in charge is just being an

124
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,629
asset regarding everything including

125
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,668
Canada and you guys are our friends you

126
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:30,029
guys have taken care of us over the

127
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:32,069
years in times of need and I just think

128
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,079
it's shameful what's how the United

129
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,629
States is treated you know you fellow

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,288
Canadians as spell especially cannabis

131
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,769
Canadians

132
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:42,029
it's absolutely beyond shameful it's a

133
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:44,370
bummer there's no doubt about that

134
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:47,189
welcome Johnny be to the old hashed

135
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,470
Church room we got 362 viewers here at

136
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:52,918
9:06 a.m. so there's some people waiting

137
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,380
to hear what we have to say it's uh it

138
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,079
is unfortunate that this is going on

139
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,788
this is a major thing for Canadians this

140
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,918
is what a chance talking about is not

141
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:04,620
just people that are smoking and growing

142
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,549
cannabis but even having any type of

143
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,579
investments in stock in companies sort

144
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,460
of in any way connected to the cannabis

145
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,750
industry or cannabis as a whole they've

146
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,969
been threatening and they've actually

147
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,470
been doing it to a certain degree I

148
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,500
don't want to blow it out of proportions

149
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:26,099
but they have been blocking and banning

150
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,689
people for life now that really doesn't

151
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:29,728
mean you're never allowed to go to the

152
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,490
US again but what that does is it denies

153
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:35,939
you for a solid six months while you

154
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,439
apply for a waiver to get down and it

155
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,028
can be even more than six months and

156
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,740
then it's of course up to the discretion

157
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:43,500
of homeland security

158
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,019
whether they let you in at all and I

159
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,540
have heard people getting banned for a

160
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,909
cannabis offense and then getting let

161
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,460
back in after you know a six to eight

162
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,310
months sort of jumping through the hoops

163
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,189
but that's nothing really people want to

164
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,839
be be having to do especially people

165
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:03,120
this really mostly affects Canadians

166
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,698
only affects Canadians in the sense that

167
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,259
if they have a company in the US and

168
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,419
they have a company in Canada and they

169
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,120
have to go back and forth if they get

170
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,649
banned for life you know those people if

171
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,228
they're pertinent to that company if

172
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:19,439
they need to be down there in that

173
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:22,199
company doing particular work it really

174
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,719
throws the whole company off in a way

175
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,879
that you know could be potentially

176
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,590
detrimental for for a company depending

177
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,240
on how they position themselves so it's

178
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:34,288
definitely changing the way people look

179
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,069
at things and welcome to my quest are

180
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:41,098
you doing buddy couple of peace symbols

181
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:43,409
it's good morning good morning can you

182
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,939
guys hear me okay we can hear you okay

183
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,930
you kind of sound like you're in a

184
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:50,459
tunnel with one of those mega mega horns

185
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,439
but you can't we can hear you I think

186
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,198
that the only time it really skips out

187
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,029
is when you're you're you become you far

188
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,860
away from the microphone and then it'll

189
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,989
do a little skipping but I heard you

190
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,889
perfect just there cursed at the beard

191
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,949
McMahon true for the beard yes the beard

193
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,169
trying to know that I guess I have a

194
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:14,579
tiny bit of stubble at ten and well it's

195
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:17,668
a little bit under your beard there

196

units I keep a chin strap he keeps the

197
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:26,069
chin strap okay not to be full alopecia

198
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:28,168
it's like no no I have scars from some

199
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:30,329
shrapnel I took sorry oh I kind of wear

200
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:32,870
this to kind of cover up the scars wow

201
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,870
that's heavy

202
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,070
Vancouver that's probably gonna sum up

203
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,000
on Monday that in regards that's

204
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,528
basically fighting for all the

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,690
compassionate clubs that it be serving

206
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:45,419
medical patients in Canada that are been

207
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,430
going to be forced to shut down in a

208
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:49,979
sense on October 17th because there's no

209
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:51,750
access and is it's we were talking about

210
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,129
it yesterday and a lot of people I'm

211
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,778
talking with a lot of patients are quite

212
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,789
scared

213
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:57,409
with legalization because they won't be

214
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:59,419
able to have an interaction they've had

215
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:01,519
for the last 20 years with other members

216
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:03,769
and other patients with the bud tenders

217
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,679
and stuff like that and it's on the

218
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,139
medical and it's it's it's really scary

219
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,578
for a lot of patients because a place of

220
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,149
access they've been going to for quite

221
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:14,349
some time

222
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:17,480
I think the B CCS are about places so is

223
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,329
basically it's not going anywhere though

224
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,220
there's no way after October 17th the BC

225
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:25,549
compassion plugs going at it but all

226
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:29,300
these places are now being threatened

227
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:33,859
with this new bar there was a news

228
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:36,469
article that said only one the CC said

229
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:41,539
they only expected one light to be

230
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:44,240
issued so I would just say this these

231
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,919
places have been under threat by law for

232
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,499
all twenty years that they've existed

233
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,719
yes so we have to understand that they

234
00:09:48,499 --> 00:10:05,389
are you know the BC compassion Club is

235
00:09:50,720 --> 00:10:07,399
the epitome wipe the board clean of this

236
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:10,308
and the argument is very very simple

237
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,679
it's the civil disobedience that created

238
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:15,438
the entire medical program that we have

239
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,659
today and so we're still going to

240
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:20,568
require you know civil disobedience

241
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,219
until like a 10 says until it becomes

242
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:25,610
perfect you have to have a seat at the

243
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,250
table and Hillary definitely has a seat

244
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,699
at all the tables across Canada whether

245
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,879
it's you know the fully regulated

246
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:36,438
federal the creator of regulations on

247
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,050
that side I know she sits at the table

248
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:41,419
or if it's even from the you know more

249
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:43,789
the street side black market civil

250
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:45,860
disobedience gray market she's got her

251
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:48,438
foot in that world as well and I just I

252
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,539
have faith in people like Hillary to

253
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:52,129
take it to the next level for sure well

254
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:55,299
it's part of the eternal vigilance that

255
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:57,829
we've always talked about you know if

256
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:59,359
part of the reality is that you know

257
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:00,888
we've risked our freedoms and now that

258
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,928
we've seen the change in the laws we

259
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:05,209
think we can get complacent like here in

260
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:07,470
California with the passes 64 we were

261
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:09,959
blocked from giving away free cannabis

262
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,779
so we've had to spend the last few

263
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,900
months down in Sacramento lobbying

264
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:18,000
Sacramento for a law as because they

265
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,340
were gonna outlaw compassion programs at

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,809
a certain point so we have passed it

267
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,190
we've gotten it through and now we're

268
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:26,489
just waiting on the governor's signature

269
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,950
so that's part of the reality of the

270
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,990
long haul and where you have to plug in

271
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,940
yourself you have to physically go put

272
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,919
on suits physically go down to your

273
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,720
representatives your assembly people and

274
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,759
you talk to them you have meetings with

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,980
them it's not that hard people it sounds

276
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,259
so frightening and so intimidating but

277
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,600
it is so absolutely [ __ ] simple all

278
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,389
you need is just to dress nice go down

279
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,580
look professional and talk to people

280
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:52,830
it's not that difficult it's us for some

281
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,350
reason people have always thought it was

282
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,910
some sort of a crazy reality to allow us

283
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,310
to get here but it's your direct

284
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:00,990
plugging in and if our people in khalad

285
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:02,699
rias network and others hadn't have

286
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,710
actually plugged in directly to

287
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,509
California we would be [ __ ] out of luck

288
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,280
still now I know that's a totally

289
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:09,569
different thing dealing with the state

290
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,089
and you're dealing with the federal

291
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,010
government so but it still takes your

292
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,830
you know your interactions you're

293
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,809
talking to your lobbying as well you can

294
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,360
still affect that change to an extent

295
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:22,889
there's an extent you can't I can't now

296
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,800
but there's an extent that you still

297
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:27,269
can't correct yeah you know we've kind

298
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,449
of been pushed in a way with this

299
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:32,490
cannabis community to the point where we

300
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,350
were disconnected from all that was

301
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,759
available to us in the same way what

302
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,920
you're saying at Tsang which is the

303
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,840
simplicity of joining into that system

304
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,479
and playing the game that they play and

305
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,460
getting at that table it's it's kind of

306
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,920
the same metaphor for you know the

307
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,320
hashish production the processing the

308
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,789
growing you know cannabis growers are

309
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,080
doing it in the basement they're doing

310
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:54,089
it with these lights that they've you

311
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,460
know originally taken off of a hockey

312
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,200
arena or something and you you sort of

313
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,840
climbed through the history of it and

314
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,270
you see that as we start incorporating

315
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,580
things from the agricultural community

316
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,379
it suddenly is like oh it's so much

317
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,270
easier if we have tables that move on

318
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,039
rollers and it's so it's like yeah if

319
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,779
you actually plug in the system that's

320
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,179
been designed to do this work already

321
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:18,509
with non cannabis plants you can

322
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:20,639
actually accelerate yourself to a level

323
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,208
that is beyond and above anything that

324
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,578
you saw

325
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:25,528
we're doing in a basement with with this

326
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:27,178
you know the the stolen lights or

327
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:29,730
whatnot and I feel it's sort of a

328
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:32,159
metaphor for you know the same sort of

329
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,808
the bureaucracies we've just always been

330
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,969
apart from these systems we've always

331
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:38,009
just had to build our own Borough rooms

332
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,079
on spec and jerry-rigged everything and

333
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:42,539
MacGyver this MacGyver that and now it's

334
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,068
kind of to the point where we've gotten

335
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,528
you know we've gotten to a seat at the

336
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:47,938
table cannabis is so mainstream I can't

337
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:51,058
even tell you I got off a flight the

338
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:52,730
other day and I get on the bus that's

339
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:55,828
taking me to long-term parking and you

340
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,170
know the guy across from me I think he's

341
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:01,649
like works for Air Canada but in fact

342
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:03,688
he's actually a broker of cannabis deals

343
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,938
that I've sat at at a boardroom in the

344
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:07,740
last two weeks when I was in Nanaimo and

345
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:10,230
he's like hey didn't I just sit with you

346
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,669
at a boardroom and I'm like oh my god

347
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,649
yeah we started talking a little bit

348
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:15,838
he's like oh I was just I was just out

349
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,269
you know doing talking with Mackay

350
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,980
investments in Toronto to get the deal

351
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:21,389
done and he's talking about all this

352
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,550
different things well he ends up getting

353
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:26,039
off the bus and the guy next to me who's

354
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:27,808
just this old dude he's like oh are you

355
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:29,629
in the marijuana business and I'm like

356
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:31,828
yes I am and he's like well I do

357
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:34,649
certification for all the big machinery

358
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:36,298
all the co2 units and all that and I'm

359
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,428
just sitting there going like this is

360
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:40,409
just [ __ ] crazy at this point in time

361
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:42,659
there was like four people on the bus

362
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:45,240
and three of them were all in the

363
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:47,969
cannabis industry off of just a random

364
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,278
flight so it's it's a lot easier to open

365
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,079
this discussion nowadays everyone seems

366
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,789
to have it on their lips you know you

367
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,919
want to open up a discussion with

368
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,539
someone that even seems to be maybe from

369
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,110
back in the day they might be an anti

370
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:03,659
cannabis person you just crack that CBD

371
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,399
just that word that term and all of a

372
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,828
sudden it's like ohm or are you talking

373
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,589
about the CBDs well I are I'm interested

374
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:12,568
in the CBDs it just makes me laugh even

375
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:14,639
the whole turn of the CBDs it used to

376
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:17,278
make me cringe I have to admit now it

377
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,589
makes me laugh I think it's oh no no I

378
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,078
didn't see it printed in place and it's

379
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,910
just it makes my head it's like come on

380
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,088
people there's only one but as you were

381
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:28,350
saying though you know this this change

382
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,629
that we're talking about people it takes

383
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,548
time it's not gonna happen overnight you

384
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,110
know it's taken us 20 years to get here

385
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,980
but how many of us have plugged in over

386
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,680
these 20-plus

387
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,690
years you know it took somebody like you

388
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,849
know skunk man Sam over there you know

389
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:48,060
50-plus years he's been doing this to

390
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:49,528
arrive at this point I skunk man mad

391
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:55,679
Sam's in the house I didn't even see him

392
00:15:49,528 --> 00:16:05,129
sneak in what's going on Sam silence it

393
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:08,879
seems and prayers if you will positive

394
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:12,299
thoughts to Forrest and Silas apparently

395
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:15,088
Silas has been having some some non-stop

396
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:17,338
seizures for about ten weeks now some

397
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:20,190
sense send our positivity up to Silas

398
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,740
and Forrest and howdy howdy Sam were

399
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:25,949
just sending positivity positivity to

400
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,720
forest and to Silas his son who's

401
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:29,099
they've he hasn't been able to make it

402
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,680
on hash search the last few weeks

403
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,759
because he's been in it deep with forest

404
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:39,509
so with Silas or area so we're thinking

405
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,610
about you guys and welcome to dr. mark

406
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:44,730
who also have snuck in there while I was

407
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,100
yammering away with that yeah hey how's

408
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,589
everyone doing

409
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:58,050
you know what pretty good we got 471

410
00:16:49,589 --> 00:17:01,050
viewers in the room he might join us

411
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:03,659
later here in the actual video chat and

412
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:05,279
in the meantime yeah

413
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:06,389
just talking about cannabis all these

414
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,910
different things that are going on

415
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,220
Johnny B was mentioning here in Canada

416
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,220
we've got about one month till October

417
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,548
17th I doubt the Liberal government push

418
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,000
it back further what's that right well

419
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:24,000
it's the 16th so legalization stopped

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,009
over 17 so that's 31 days and you know

421
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,349
what I we know one thing I don't think

422
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:31,650
it'll be one cannabis pot shop open

423
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:34,529
legally across Canada does it sounds

424
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,360
like any provinces or any municipalities

425
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,619
are ready to even pull the trigger and I

426
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,678
don't think there's any government that

427
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:42,729
even has a supply chain ready for these

428
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,440
stores to be honest

429
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:52,200
so I think there's a I think there's

430
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:57,460
only 30 days in September is that yeah

431
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:04,480
30 31 days 30 30 30 days 30 that's kind

432
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:06,460
of what I thought smoke some it's Sunday

433
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,779
morning that's that's better than the 1

434
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:13,029
minute warning for 4/20 but 30 days a

435
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:15,849
means yeah I mean with these roadside

436
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:17,170
screening devices that now come back is

437
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:19,750
completely set we're not going to get

438
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:24,279
because even temperature term that

439
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,660
affects these things but I mean lot of

440
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,180
people scared to drive

441
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,160
I saw you post that one about the RCMP

442
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,990
we're gonna be taking semen samples you

443
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,250
realize that was a fake news story right

444
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:38,559
I don't think I posted that one that was

445
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:47,170
a bitmap Jenner posted it maintainer

446
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:49,960
Canada fake news it's funny it was a

447
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,550
funny story but it was people were like

448
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,610
what the heck and then women were like

449
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:56,829
what are they gonna do with us it's

450
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:58,829
gonna be interesting what's gonna happen

451
00:18:56,829 --> 00:19:02,589
on that end and stuff like that I mean

452
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:04,119
hopefully on officers will taking you

453
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:05,769
know instead of using a machine we'll go

454
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,659
back to the standard roadside screening

455
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,069
I mean you know you can tell us someone

456
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,440
from toxicated and not behind the wheel

457
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:13,419
it's not that hard on people who are

458
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,039
medically using or just using it just so

459
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,240
they can actually have a better quality

460
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,470
of life he could tell they're not

461
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,089
intoxicated so I have to admit I'm not

462
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,480
the reason I'm not worried about it is

463
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:27,579
because it seems as though we're heading

464
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,160
in the right direction and you know all

465
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:32,319
of these like these the worries of like

466
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,720
oh the laws that are coming into our so

467
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,960
bad it's like who the hell is ever going

468
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,930
to get a 14 year sentence for for

469
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,789
something like having an ounce of weed

470
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,350
or you know passing a joint to someone

471
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:46,450
that was like a year younger than them

472
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,279
and under the age of 18 or something it

473
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,680
just it just seems like their fear and

474
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:55,000
scars to be laws that I can't imagine

475
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,710
that lawyers like John Conroy and Kurtz

476
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,419
who saw and all these other kin

477
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,640
lawyers Jack Lloyd and Rob w/e lorry

478
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:06,190
there they're just gonna crush these

479
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,799
clear breaches of the Charter like

480
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,899
they've crushed all the other clear

481
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,849
breaches of the Charter the unique thing

482
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:16,389
about Canada is when we take these guys

483
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:18,579
to court we win which is a seemingly

484
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,730
impossible task but I swear to god it's

485
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:23,710
not that that hard because if you were

486
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,990
to hear them and and John can attest

487
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,490
because he was there as well if you hear

488
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,778
some of the things that come out of

489
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,579
these people's mouths that are

490
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:33,819
testifying against cannabis at these

491
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:36,099
hearings they just sound so stupid that

492
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:38,139
there's not really a judge on the planet

493
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:40,240
that can't see through it completely

494
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,610
it's beyond ridiculous some of the

495
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,710
things that they say and they end up you

496
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:46,509
know borderline purging themselves

497
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,399
perjuring themselves to the point where

498
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:50,019
it's just you can't even take anything

499
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:52,808
they say seriously and they end up

500
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:54,788
really building the case for us more

501
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:57,908
than we build the case when we testify

502
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:59,589
on our side it's a it's pretty early

503
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:02,520
that's what happened last week with the

504
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:07,569
dispensary case he spent all week with

505
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,859
Missy their fight against us and John

506
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:11,950
figures you can wrap it up on Monday

507
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:14,349
because just a lot of stuff being sent

508
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:19,808
people walk out stuff like that canvas

509
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:21,759
isn't medical this Ock you see it's but

510
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:24,308
again this goes back to plugging in and

511
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,960
doing it guys I know it's a you say it

512
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:27,460
sounds simple but if you guys had in a

513
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,319
sued and actually have done that then

514
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,950
nothing would have happened so it just

515
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,960
shows you the case you know it is such

516
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,600
an integral part of the change that is

517
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,038
needed so you know more of talking to

518
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,139
the audience here then you know you

519
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,028
awesome folks who are doing it you know

520
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,799
but it's more of just to make them aware

521
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:47,440
how they can still plug in and how

522
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,240
important it is to plug in you know of

523
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,919
course going to court isn't cheap it is

524
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,829
easy but it isn't cheap you have to have

525
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,299
lawyers you have to have you know

526
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:57,819
precedents you know things simple things

527
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:59,740
like that but you know you can as you

528
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,119
say you know move the discussion you're

529
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,370
actually moving the line in the sand

530
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,500
you're out there holding these people

531
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,178
accountable this knowledge that we've

532
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,440
learned is cannabis you have to go out

533
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,060
there you have to talk to these people

534
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,880
directly who are

535
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:14,799
buying and counteracting their arguments

536
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,710
directly because if not if you don't do

537
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,869
it who else will biggest thing right now

538
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,700
is where patients can be able to access

539
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:24,009
their medicine once they can where they

540
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,259
mentally medicate with it if they're in

541
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,730
and and in low-income housing or

542
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:30,069
anything like that are there no smoke

543
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,349
free zones there's no place for patients

544
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:34,089
to now go where they able to it all

545
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:36,309
these clubs that have existed now for

546
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:37,599
years so there's another fight along the

547
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:39,369
way and that's gonna be able to be able

548
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,959
to consume cannabis in a safe

549
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:42,219
environment other than your home that a

550
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,069
lot of people aren't gonna be able to

551
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:50,289
safely consume

552
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:52,960
I predict we will win oh we did and

553
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:55,000
we'll win and like miles high it's gonna

554
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,740
be like it's it's human rights yeah this

555
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,180
you cannot tell someone they cannot

556
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,370
medicate because of their condition

557
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,049
because they're in a wrong place of a

558
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:04,839
living or they're they're walking you

559
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,430
know give me a break it's let's see what

560
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,619
happens with Court but I mean we're

561
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,180
faced with right we're facing the same

562
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:12,909
problems the United States you know

563
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:16,680
people don't have access so now we have

564
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:20,140
to have safe access zones or safe access

565
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,970
access areas such as just a dabbing

566
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,250
lounge or someplace where people can go

567
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,779
there's very few of them I think they

568
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,910
said there's only a seven in the United

569
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:30,639
States currently and there's currently

570
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,840
millions of users and you know many

571
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,400
legal states that just want access so in

572
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,980
Colorado they had to win it at the local

573
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,290
level in Denver and in Las Vegas they're

574
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,900
looking at doing that but it's a fight

575
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:45,549
that is the next step past just gaining

576
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,610
access to the planet now we have to have

577
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:52,240
safe access and a harbor that we can be

578
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:53,019
able to go to that we can you know be

579
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,329
social

580
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,769
you know that's it's so key it's such an

581
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:59,799
integral part of this plant that is

582
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:02,049
completely lost unfortunately well on

583
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:03,849
that on that term I want her on that

584
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:06,269
point I would like to shout out the

585
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:09,699
gentlemen in Malaysia who's currently

586
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:12,400
facing being hung for producing and

587
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,819
supplying cannabis oil to some hundreds

588
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,360
of patients that he managed CBD oil CBD

589
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:21,399
all right yeah CBD oil so he's he's you

590
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,449
know like we've come such a far away

591
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,070
that you know on one

592
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,959
sort of side of things there are people

593
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:29,868
like this gentleman who's facing death

594
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:31,909
which is you know we worry about access

595
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,348
but we don't have worries like that you

596
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,629
know people can still practice civil

597
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:38,088
disobedience and not end up being

598
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:39,949
murdered for it so you got a shout this

599
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:42,469
guy out big time I really hope that

600
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,259
something gets done in regards to humans

601
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:47,239
human rights and that they don't end up

602
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:49,009
hanging this guy for supplying cannabis

603
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:51,409
oil because it will be a nightmare story

604
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:54,528
as it often is when they hang people in

605
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:56,299
Malaysia for being homosexual or you

606
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,159
know getting caught with drugs or all

607
00:24:56,298 --> 00:25:01,038
these other just absolutely ridiculous

608
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,450
zero-tolerance policies and that leads

609
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:08,118
me into also shouting out Sarah Blythe

610
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,999
from Vancouver who recently had her

611
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:13,368
cannabis taken from the Vancouver PD

612
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:16,219
that she was supplying to opiate addicts

613
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:18,528
so it was a it was for opiate addicts on

614
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:20,570
the street who could use something as an

615
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:22,788
alternative so they go down there and

616
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:25,098
they you know sell or give cannabis away

617
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:27,888
at cost they don't make any profits

618
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:29,148
whatsoever or and the PD and all of

619
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:30,978
their brilliance thought the other day

620
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:34,428
it would be a good idea to go and steal

621
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:36,200
that for storm troopers deep come in and

622
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,169
take the medicine off the table and walk

623
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,700
away with it strapped with guns and it

624
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,469
just seemed like you know I haven't

625
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,179
really seen the Vancouver PD do

626
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:46,759
something that's stupid in a long time

627
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:48,559
generally they're they're not too too

628
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,209
bad when it comes to cannabis and the

629
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,528
cannabis laws they usually just sort of

630
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:54,078
turn their head the other way but they

631
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:56,269
they went right in there and took away

632
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:57,798
that cannabis off the table generally

633
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:59,479
while people standing in the very

634
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:01,489
vicinity were selling fentanyl

635
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:03,440
guaranteed that's where you know

636
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,808
wherever the the addicts are that's

637
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,009
where the opioid and fentanyl dealers

638
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:12,828
are as well and that was just a real you

639
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:15,319
know Dana Larson posted about it it got

640
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:17,509
shared hundreds of times the small video

641
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,368
that Sarah made and I just you know

642
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,019
shout out to her and the work that those

643
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:22,878
guys are all doing on the streets of

644
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:25,848
Vancouver that's the frontlines right

645
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:29,478
there that is millions on the war on

646
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:31,608
drugs for sure today to given away to

647
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:33,528
give it away packages to patients or

648
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:36,168
anybody who's suffering from opioid

649
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:39,200
addiction so the Downey said again today

650
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:40,960
we did topple with that kind of culture

651
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,700
news live data talked about that and

652
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,108
yeah they just walked in and grabbed it

653
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,669
and walked away and they came back and

654
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:49,939
asked her well who's on the fence and I

655
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:52,220
wanna know that like really never seen

656
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,320
before in Vancouver especially with all

657
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,940
the projects we've been doing and the

658
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,028
east side of harm reduction over the

659
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,889
years we'd be giving away cannabis for

660
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:02,569
years and years to patients around there

661
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:06,219
and people suffering and they just

662
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:10,788
walked in and walked away with it it was

663
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,058
servicing and we didn't wash it over and

664
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:14,148
over

665
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:16,398
Wow in the United States this week a

666
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:18,258
guy's mother was killed he was being

667
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:20,238
served a warrant for a marijuana arrest

668
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:22,819
and mom tried to block and she was

669
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,139
killed by the police shot and killed so

670
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:27,200
it's still happening unfortunately

671
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:29,719
people are still dying for marijuana in

672
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,700
North America the stupidity is still

673
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,169
ongoing so I have to give a shout out to

674
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,200
Michael Kravitz in them who were doing

675
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:38,600
work directly at the UN level they have

676
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,019
actually been working with the UN minor

677
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:44,480
councils to arrive at education for them

678
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:47,298
regarding cannabis and within the next

679
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,230
year we may see a major change at the

680
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:53,749
1961 convention treaty which has been an

681
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,519
upholding of these heinous laws that

682
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:57,739
have caused Malaysia to continue to

683
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:02,388
execute people for something like

684
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:05,989
cannabis or CBD so at the unexplained

685
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:07,459
the 1961 tree and and how it's because

686
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:10,850
this is a big thing that's happening

687
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,980
next Oh at the UN level well it

688
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:14,358
basically if you receive any money from

689
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,099
the United States government you have to

690
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:18,378
have a cannabis eradication program

691
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:21,469
going on and so the United States gives

692
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:24,288
money to practically every country and

693
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,389
so by doing so part of that law passed

694
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:28,608
by Gabriel moss and them is to make sure

695
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:30,618
that there is a cannabis eradication

696
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:33,079
program going on and so that has been

697
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:35,298
the main stakeholder at the UN level

698
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,058
that people have been utilizing to

699
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:39,679
manipulate their country situations such

700
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:42,648
as the gentleman being hung in Malaysia

701
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,489
and hopefully if that is changed and

702
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:48,979
removed at the UN level of which they

703
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:49,960
are talking and it looks like it could

704
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,509
be moving that direct

705
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,269
it would strike that and that would be a

706
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:57,490
huge change because they are dealing

707
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,319
with the medicalization of cannabis in

708
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,970
our end discussions regarding it because

709
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,408
it's not only happened in the United

710
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,538
States and Canada it's happened in

711
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:07,450
multiple countries to the point where

712
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:10,569
the UN had to take notice so there are

713
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,250
brave people down there that are going

714
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:14,619
down all the time and are really

715
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,778
challenging people at the UN level what

716
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,788
effect that will have we hope that is

717
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:20,349
positive but again is this something

718
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:21,730
they've been working on for years and

719
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,980
this is part of that plugging in and

720
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,798
being active thing that is will affect

721
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:31,000
change but it's slow and at the UN level

722
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:33,759
it's very very slow but the change is

723
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,278
happening people are there they are

724
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,019
challenging the system but yeah and I

725
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:40,450
think there's there's a couple of

726
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:42,220
approaches there there's a couple couple

727
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,048
groups that are working on essentially a

728
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,589
medical exemption because there are

729
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:49,480
there's a numerous numerous country UN

730
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:53,730
countries have medical marijuana laws

731
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,740
you know Canada Uruguay have federal

732
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,288
recreational laws in the words so it

733
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,740
makes sense if you look at the slow

734
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:05,440
transition along usually any state or

735
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,720
federal support UN is going to pass

736
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,750
medical before they pass over the

737
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,298
counter and you're seeing countries like

738
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,460
France also starting to change their

739
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:16,990
liability right and and you have to

740
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,970
understand that you know France is

741
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,890
basically the header for the EU so what

742
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,690
they decide a lot of people will go same

743
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,090
with Germany in Germany now has medical

744
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,740
cannabis and so you know France is going

745
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:29,199
in that direction you've got of course

746
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,870
in Netherlands which was really one of

747
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,960
the first so this momentum is building

748
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:38,349
at not only a local at a country it's

749
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,269
now at a UN level that this is very

750
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,918
important because it affects all the

751
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:46,538
small countries as well as the big

752
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:51,990
countries and a medical marijuana always

753
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:51,990
has been it was it was restricted

754
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,089
correct

755
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:00,109
yeah it

756
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:02,359
we're leaving go ahead Mike yeah so

757
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:04,669
we'll we'll get back in Owenton so the

758
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:07,459
UN is always allowed medical marijuana

759
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:11,779
to be produced and researched under the

760
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:14,420
under specific federal guidelines if

761
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:17,359
every government is allowed to develop

762
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,820
their own program the u.s. decided to go

763
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,869
with a program where they license the

764
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:25,629
University of Mississippi to produce and

765
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:29,779
the issue with the u.s. is that you know

766
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:34,220
combination of DEA NIDA have to approve

767
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:40,670
the investigative new drug program that

768
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:44,269
made it incredibly difficult but other

769
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:47,950
countries there is some researching in

770
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:51,529
both cannabinoids and artificial paths

771
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:56,120
for better or worse but ultimately the

772
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:58,970
UN has the ability to it change the

773
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:02,659
scheduling of cannabis on us on a

774
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:05,839
international level to treat it as a

775
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:10,310
medical product or as a non dangerous

776
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:13,009
drug ultimately I think a lot of a lot

777
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:16,369
of dates are looking at it treating it

778
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:21,500
like alcohol but in the long term it's

779
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:24,369
probably a safer drug than tobacco so we

780
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:27,380
as humans need to treat drugs and

781
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:30,619
differently different schedules based on

782
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,480
their potential harm to society and then

783
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,259
in all likelihood you're going to see

784
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,900
that general trend towards legalization

785
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:41,150
but it's a slow and steady progress and

786
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:46,100
unfortunately especially if the UN it

787
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:48,620
only has these sessions once every

788
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:49,909
couple of years I believe and it's going

789
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:53,569
to be the first time that they actually

790
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:56,480
have the ability to amend the singles

791
00:32:53,569 --> 00:33:00,349
treaty Concannon yeah the first time

792
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,480
since 1961 so that's significant that

793
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:04,159
shows you the generations of change but

794
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,970
also the generations of oppression that

795
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,710
we've lived under you know which is

796
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,180
beyond unfortunate

797
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,819
yeah and if they don't get anything

798
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,860
changed at this session next years then

799
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:18,139
it could be some time before it could be

800
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:23,119
a changed on a national international

801
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:25,580
level that window is narrow as well so

802
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:29,319
all the viewers need to contact their

803
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:31,309
politicians get them I mean essentially

804
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:34,099
understanding what's going on there

805
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:37,639
because that's that's something that you

806
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:39,319
know in order for the u.s. to release

807
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,480
some of this depression on the research

808
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:43,099
of Canada we need to be able to accept

809
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,750
cannabis as medical products so that

810
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:47,659
they can be researched here in the

811
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:50,089
States as well as international it and

812
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,220
so we can also share that research in it

813
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:54,889
we can also cross borders and do that

814
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,539
research we can combine you know one of

815
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,730
the things we need to start doing is we

816
00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:01,629
need a germ plasm Institute here in the

817
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:04,490
north and Americas you know we we have

818
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:06,530
things that are acclimated over and in

819
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,989
Europe etc and we have of course seed

820
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:10,840
companies but we have no Institute's

821
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:13,369
that are actually saving the germ plasm

822
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,100
testing it making sure the terpene files

823
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:20,809
are proper for what this genetic is et

824
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:23,059
cetera you know it has a monopoly on

825
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:25,820
genetics and that's that's unfair to the

826
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:27,769
medical patients there you sue Sisley

827
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,480
put out a paper that showed that you

828
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:33,050
miss is not even capable of producing

829
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:36,260
flowers that meet state regulations for

830
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,900
recreational grade cannabis or matter or

831
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,480
medical because it fails molds and

832
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:45,559
mildews yeah so and it's something that

833
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:49,070
that the you know did the federal

834
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:51,710
government DEA and probably jeff

835
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:55,490
sessions needed you start issuing the

836
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:58,400
two two two five five licenses that are

837
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,869
going to open up the having multiple

838
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,420
cultivators for medical research

839
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:05,960
products that's been allow state

840
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:09,050
licensed cultivators across the u.s. to

841
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,960
start supplying research that university

842
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:14,420
level and then we're gonna need

843
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,309
university researchers and students at

844
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,400
those universities to drive that

845
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:21,259
research forward there's no way Jeff

846
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,090
Sessions is going to do anything sorry

847
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:27,710
as much as I would love

848
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:28,880
- no no I don't its train DeLaet the

849
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,420
building and easy

850
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,510
he's either left left behind or you're

851
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,820
gonna have to just get out of the way oh

852
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,310
he'll get out of the way it's just he's

853
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,539
he's gonna get run over by it that's

854
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:50,289
what's gonna happen to a lot of these

855
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:53,630
you know what momentum is too big or

856
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:55,730
recreation they do not work that's not

857
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:59,000
what they're contracted to do by being

858
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,780
an RDA they do what they're contracted

859
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,780
to do and the ni da has never set these

860
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,760
standards for them and so of course are

861
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:11,600
not meeting them because they haven't

862
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,810
been asked to and I'm not saying that

863
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,389
Mississippi State and doctor'll totally

864
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:19,880
who runs it are the richest people in

865
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:22,400
the world but be honest I like doctor

866
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,960
also live and he is in favor of medical

867
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,880
cannabis absolutely oh yeah no I mono

868
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,740
for that research and I'm glad that

869
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,090
they've actually increased increased

870
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:34,849
their canopy and increased their

871
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:38,240
biodiversity of genetics but ultimately

872
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:41,509
the news when you when you're cultivated

873
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:45,439
in one region in Mississippi

874
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:48,940
you know you're out either indoor or

875
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,849
outdoor but outdoors where they do

876
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:55,130
significant production field you're

877
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:56,750
limited on the terpenoids

878
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,340
and cannabinoids that are produced just

879
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,070
based on the environmental conditions

880
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:04,519
did you have to select code versus you

881
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:08,300
can survive in that moist and warm

882
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:09,829
climate and then you know being a more

883
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,010
southern latitude it's going to be

884
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:15,469
harder to produce higher levels of the

885
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:19,460
rare cannabinoids that they generally

886
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:22,489
prefer the rather spectrums yeah I know

887
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,320
when there's been some papers put out

888
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:26,239
there that show that you know CBD

889
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,900
strains groans grown at higher latitudes

890
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,579
produce higher CBD ratios so it's

891
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,230
something that I think that being able

892
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,119
to have gardens for multiple different

893
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,920
terroirs is going to be able to produce

894
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,440
a wider

895
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,289
range of cannabinoid profiles that you

896
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,309
can end up researching more medical

897
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:49,940
conditions it Mississippi also

898
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:55,820
discovered many of the cannabinoids with

899
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:58,490
their research and yeah I feel conflict

900
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:01,220
with Mississippi but the truth of it is

901
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:04,959
is it dr. old slowly would have got much

902
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:08,899
further he has a patent on GP

903
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,809
suppository I mean he believes in it

904
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,369
no yeah nothing against what they're

905
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:16,070
doing at Mississippi I've got a ton of

906
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:18,710
respect for real solely but you missus

907
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:21,710
you you miss shouldn't have a monopoly

908
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,309
on the research and they're suing for

909
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,960
that right now

910
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:25,309
and it's working its way through the

911
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,289
system there are people trying to

912
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:29,480
challenge that in the United States so

913
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:31,130
it's just you know it takes years to

914
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,809
work its way through the system you know

915
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,630
it took me five years to sue the

916
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:37,400
government and deal with them so a you

917
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,950
know change doesn't happen quickly and

918
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,369
then when you enter the the rubbin

919
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:47,469
courts it's unpredictable longer and

920
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:47,469
more expensive than you all ever realize

921
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,460
there is research that's being done

922
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:55,250
someone's taking a bog wreck that's

923
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,559
being legally purchased in legal states

924
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:02,449
and being brought back to the laboratory

925
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:04,279
and being and being researched so you

926
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:07,099
may not hear about it in the scientific

927
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,530
literature but there is research being

928
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:11,529
done on commercial cannabis not grown

929
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,190
congratulations doctor on your cannabis

930
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:18,259
patent this week thank you yeah

931
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:21,500
congratulate thank you

932
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:25,070
Oh congratulations as well and I want to

933

935
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,719

00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,199
I don't know if he's still here if he's

938
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:40,509
frozen up but I definitely wanted to

939
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:43,789
welcome both those fellows into the room

940
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:46,910
let's get a bog rip in get that out of

941
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:49,539
the way bong rip mother lovers let's do

942
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:52,829
it bong rip mother lovers you

943

950
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:26,739
pulled up in this just [ __ ] savage

951
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:29,349
motorcycle chopper Grim Reaper all over

952
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:31,209
it you know big muscular dude just look

953
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:32,469
like a dude that would like you know

954
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,240
looked like a dude back in the day that

955
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:35,919
I just wouldn't have approached and been

956
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,619
like hey how's it going man what's going

957
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,139
on but I did anyway I approached them at

958
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:43,239
first I was like dude what's going on

959
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:45,579
man your bike is awesome like holy [ __ ]

960
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:47,529
he's like oh thanks brother thanks and I

961
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:49,960
just sort of walked away went inside the

962
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:57,010
motorcycle shop and finished doing what

963
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:58,710
I was doing he said hey brother would

964
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,910
tell me about your bike tell me about

965
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,320
yourself so I I started telling him a

966
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:04,659
little bit about my bike and how it was

967
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,300
my dad's and he ended up passing away on

968
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:09,309
it and I restored it he was like that's

969
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,560
unbelievable what a great way to visit

970
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:13,299
you know I visit with with some people

971
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:16,630
that way as well and my bike then he

972
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:20,440
tells me that he runs a camp called camp

973
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:24,099
my way and it's for soldiers and first

974
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,050
responders who suffer with PTSD and he

975
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:27,309
takes these guys out into the forest and

976
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,769
he takes them canoeing and

977
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:32,019
paddleboarding and fishing and just

978
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:34,570
basically camping to unplug and get away

979
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:36,670

green vial you know it this is yes yes

1112
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:23,599

1113
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:26,000
glass pipe and its artist and it breaks

1114
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,190
down it's not every great artist but

1115
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,590

1116
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:32,720
some of the most fun I just saw the ease

1117

1118
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:38,059
that was blown for our gallery show in

1119
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:41,150
2003 the degenerate art show that

1120
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:45,920

glass honey oh that goes back well

1122
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:55,300
probably the earliest glass makers I

1123
00:47:47,960 --> 00:48:00,050
would assume you know in the seventies I

1124
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:03,140
was in Afghanistan in 71 and they broke

1125
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:05,240
a coca-cola bottle off Amanda the

1126
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:08,480
general amount of it but I'm sure that

1127
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:10,729
was ratified before that well I've given

1128
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,880
up two Snodgrass for sure at least in

1129
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:16,579
our culture in our community the the the

1130
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,980
touring Grateful Dead fish type culture

1131
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:21,559
Snodgrass seemed to be one of the first

1132
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:24,170
promoting and popularizing color blown

1133
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,570
glass glass that changes colors and

1134
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,340
shows to their patterns as you as you

1135
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,350
get it darker and whatnot and will have

1136
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:33,230

well he was really he was just art I

1140
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:43,309
mean you would basically say Bob

1141
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,040
Snodgrass is the start of the

1142
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:48,679
American in the North American glass

1143
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,269
scene he is his pipes that were going

1144

out and around you know they were very

1145
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:56,869
stuck spoke about in hushed tones back

1146
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:59,000
in the early late eighties early 90s and

1147
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:00,619
I was seeing these pipes and they were

1148
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,389
thousands of dollars back then I'm like

1149
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:04,460
oh Jesus Christ that's a lot of you know

1150

America available in practically every

1173
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:11,659
city USA now as well as in Canada

1174
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:13,550
listen it's full circle go ahead mark I

1175
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:15,980
was just gonna say I I remember going

1176
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,530
back to the 70s the famous steam roller

1177
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,570
which was nothing more than a glass tube

1178
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,800
it was a pipe where I didn't have a bowl

1179
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,960
on the side of it

1180
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,940
so I think if I remember correctly that

1181
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,579
was the first time I ever smoked out of

1182
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,610
anything that was just all glass of the

1183
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:35,059
all glass steam roller which I remember

1184
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:37,910
being quite popular and that to me

1185
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:40,219
laughs look like to like the one it has

1186
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:42,199
one hit but I think for designer pipes

1187
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:47,889
you're absolutely right bob was I

1188
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:50,419
remember those mark yeah do you roll

1189
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:52,969
totally paper roll to do the same thing

1190
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,460
because I like to be out of the firm way

1191
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:57,018
afterwards I will say this much about

1192
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,329
the steam roller not

1193
00:50:57,018 --> 00:51:01,758
being created more dead smoke in a pipe

1194
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:04,159
than the I mean then the steamroller

1195
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,438
that was some like lick you so hard you

1196
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,119
fill that thing up and then take a break

1197
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:12,678
and then go to hit it again it was just

1198
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:14,929
like razor blades like dirty also

1199
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:18,108
reasoning that it would be so cool that

1200
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:20,048
you and so oxygenated yeah isopropyl

1201
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:23,058
alcohol just to clean it out completely

1202
00:51:20,048 --> 00:51:26,268
have a completely clean piece of glass

1203
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:28,099
again so yeah oh my god yeah I'm glad

1204
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:33,018
things have changed for the better for

1205
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:35,719
everybody needless to say oh hey Sam yes

1206
00:51:33,018 --> 00:51:40,208
can we tell the story about the pipes

1207
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:40,208
that you used to clean your your pipe in

1208
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:52,909
your sink your stink that you have dude

1209
00:51:50,268 --> 00:52:06,678
I'll tell you listen this what I did was

1210
00:51:52,909 --> 00:52:11,088
I would go ahead tell it I cleaned my

1211
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:15,469
glass farms with boiling hot water from

1212
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:19,548
a saucepan that I boil and dr. barbers

1213
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:22,630
and then I flush it down the sink I have

1214
00:52:19,548 --> 00:52:25,099
a sink to my bedroom because this

1215
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:28,039
apartment I have actually was a hotel

1216
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:30,229
and they had Saints in each Devon so the

1217
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:35,569
either you could piss in them or wash

1218
00:52:30,228 --> 00:52:38,178
your face or something and so I was

1219
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:41,119
doing this for years and after about

1220
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:43,608
five or ten and years the things that

1221
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,068
wouldn't Brennan is already born I tried

1222
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:48,949
sticking up ruler Reuter down there I

1223
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:51,889
tried two different wide compounds that

1224
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:53,809
even the way by that I just gave up it

1225
00:52:51,889 --> 00:52:56,749
didn't use it for about a year and then

1226
00:52:53,809 --> 00:53:01,609
I called the plumber and he came and he

1227
00:52:56,748 --> 00:53:05,928
showed them a snake down there and he

1228
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:07,219
says what is all this black [ __ ] because

1229
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:11,030
it was dry

1230
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:15,199
and sort of almost like hard and glassy

1231
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:17,599
but was chipping alcohols and didn't

1232
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,909
react and what was really funny was

1233
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:24,260
about another five or ten years later

1234
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:27,259
you had to do it again dude like the

1235
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:30,050
whole pipe was just almost solid of

1236
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:38,240
rocks I'm surprised you didn't save it

1237
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:40,400
and test it and smoke it I bet you it

1238
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:44,979
was the highest-quality craphole of the

1239
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:48,400
world has are seen CBN love for days

1240
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,139
just like pure cannabinoid like

1241
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,750
destruction like whatever like Sam's

1242
00:53:51,139 --> 00:53:55,819
hash to this day no one's ever put

1243
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,829
anything in my pipe that's that's like

1244
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,830
it I'm telling you it's like the first

1245
00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:02,900
time you smoke it you're literally like

1246
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:05,119
this must be from Mars this is from

1247
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:08,960
another [ __ ] planet this is not of

1248
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,220
this earth how can it be so strong it's

1249
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,599
like right away you're like is there

1250
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:18,559
like like something else easier to do

1251
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:20,838
that you know a decade or more ago when

1252
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,219
there wasn't so much competition out

1253
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:28,338
there now lots of people are making

1254
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:30,618
incredibly potent materials the secret

1255
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:35,420
of mine was it was ricin and it was

1256
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:36,740
really Turkey rich naturally I think the

1257
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,539
fact that you lived in all the hash

1258
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:40,669
producing countries collected the seeds

1259
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:43,279
grew the mountain bred them grew those

1260
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,430
and made hash I think there's a longer

1261
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,200
story to why it's so ridiculous yeah if

1262
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:50,419
I have to say that without a doubt some

1263
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:52,429
of the strongest cannabis that's got

1264
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,588
that I've ever smoked was with Sam and

1265
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:57,259
the reason why I started blending and

1266
00:54:54,588 --> 00:55:00,679
creating my blends was because there was

1267
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:04,010
nothing I could find as strong hands

1268
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:06,230
down that really for one hit or two hits

1269
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:08,690
that really put you really where you

1270
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:11,079
needed to be my favorite started with

1271
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:17,420
sometime I imagined it's one gram

1272
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:19,858
inspect it in a glass they call them oil

1273
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,259
pipes because

1274
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:24,538
the oil in them and then you heat the

1275
00:55:22,259 --> 00:55:28,019
glass from underneath and then you can

1276
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:30,660
take a doggone well I I did the same

1277
00:55:28,018 --> 00:55:31,709
thing but it - there's my tricep gave it

1278
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:34,440
to Rob Clark

1279
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:37,230
he took him an enormous [ __ ] hit like

1280
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:41,460
the carburetor hit and then looked at me

1281
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:43,980
and when he couldn't breathe he couldn't

1282
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:49,380
talk saying I'm taking [ __ ]

1283
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:53,130
I killed Rob Park with marijuana after

1284
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:56,099
about more than a minute a weason bar he

1285
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:59,068
was able to take breath he said when it

1286
00:55:56,099 --> 00:56:02,068
happened is he taking so much vapor that

1287
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:04,588
all of his little long hairs got coated

1288
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:08,518
and they were all stuck together and he

1289
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:10,440
couldn't get any [ __ ] oxygen oh my

1290
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:12,479
god yeah you guys told me that story and

1291
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,489
him telling the story of being on all

1292
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,880
fours while he was doing it made it even

1293
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:21,358
funnier yeah unfortunately because I'm

1294
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:25,140

single birthday party that I attended

1337
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:35,519
with party those out that there would be

1338
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:40,319
people laying in the grass and they

1339
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:42,449
weren't getting up yeah that's I've

1340
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,700
always said it kind of as a joke but I

1341
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:46,379
maybe think that it's not a joke but you

1342
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:48,689
could possibly give someone a high

1343
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:55,380
enough dose of edibles and then like

1344
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:59,369
operate on them no doubt that [ __ ] puts

1345
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:02,760
you I've seen people be out for like 30

1346
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:05,180
plus hours like like using a mirror to

1347
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,369
check to see if they're still breathing

1348
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:13,529
like barely like the heartbeat slows

1349
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:14,390
down so much everything is so slow it's

1350

00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:25,799
don't know exactly how much weed I was

1355
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,660

it's kind of been a long time as far as

1373
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:15,700
being in an industry I've been at this

1374
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:18,969
since like 2010 started off with native

1375
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:21,849
roots had a hash company that's the

1376
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:23,259
bubble for a couple years and you know

1377
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:25,809
did the solvent list thing really

1378
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,700
grinding out trying to put put that on

1379
01:00:25,809 --> 01:00:30,329
the map educate people on good

1380
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:33,549
conscience clean cannabis you know so

1381
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:35,440
that's kind of where I've been the last

1382
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:37,120
couple years have been like ups and

1383
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,070
downs as we've seen like the industry

1384
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,900
changing here in Colorado as far as

1385
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:43,120
going from you know from that

1386
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:46,300
mom-and-pop shop to more of the Walmart

1387
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,839
mentality a lot of companies coming and

1388
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:52,090
go and the solvent this world and and

1389
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,860
just a lot of changes going on and I'm

1390
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:56,019
happy to still be in it and still have a

1391
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,610
voice so that's kind of primarily why I

1392
01:00:56,019 --> 01:01:00,250
wanted to get on here and like you know

1393
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:02,170
spread my story and and show some love

1394
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,989
to everybody you know I think more love

1395
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:07,269
is needed in this cannabis community

1396
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:10,299
it's a it's a pretty vast community once

1397
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:13,360
you start thinking about it and how far

1398
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:15,510
it reaches so you know we all play we

1399
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,410
all play a role I guess thanks

1400
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:19,420
absolutely man well I always thought of

1401
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:22,119
you also as a bubble ambassador you were

1402
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:25,930
always making the fire bubble oh yeah

1403
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:28,900
yeah you know that's when I got when I

1404
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:31,769
got put on you know with native roots

1405
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:34,539
the owner of that shop at the time had

1406
01:01:31,769 --> 01:01:36,849
you know when I guess when the cannabis

1407
01:01:34,539 --> 01:01:38,199
industry started here in Colorado there

1408
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:39,339
was a lot of people that knew each other

1409
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:41,259
and they're all coming from the same

1410
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:43,300
backgrounds primarily of being you know

1411
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,280
trust fund kids they're having a lot of

1412
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,289
extra money or being able to get

1413
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,730
involved and be able to afford to get

1414
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:50,739
involved in the industry so everybody

1415
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:54,099
really knew each other and so with that

1416
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:55,989
I was able to network enough to start

1417
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:58,599
you know brushing up on the solvent list

1418
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:59,709
aspect of it I was actually looking to

1419
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:01,659
get out of the industry

1420
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:03,519
at the time when I was working with

1421
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:05,049
native roots and the owner came to me

1422
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,789
and he goes hey man you're not going

1423
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:08,589
anywhere he goes you're way too valuable

1424
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:10,000
you're way too much of a people person

1425
01:02:08,588 --> 01:02:12,009
we're gonna start a company he's all

1426
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,170

1427
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:16,000

1428
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:18,130

1429
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,619
down for about two years and really

1430
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:22,680
tried to grind away at it and my first

1431
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:26,440
one of my first eleven followers was you

1432
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:28,059

friend yeah fire girl for sure yeah you

1474
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:19,599
know I feel the same way I think here in

1475
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:21,699
Colorado we're seeing that Rhian solvent

1476
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,860
lifts we always go through our ups and

1477
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:26,019
downs you know with what's latest and

1478
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:30,280
greatest and what's trending you know

1479
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:32,860
from rising to disel it and now you know

1480
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,660
the vape the vape world seems to being

1481
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:37,420
taken over as far as the vague presence

1482
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:39,250
and trying to incorporate rosin and

1483
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:42,789
solvent listen to that world is kind of

1484
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,590
the new new wave of things but here in

1485
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:46,630
the last couple weeks I've been hearing

1486
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:48,460
a lot of people speak about bring him

1487
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:50,559
back you know that good old solvent less

1488
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:53,710
passion and using it as a staple in

1489
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:58,420
their shops I'm just that but this this

1490
01:04:53,710 --> 01:05:01,510
idea of more organic and more clean

1491
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:02,980
medicine has taken hold because we

1492
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,870
talked about it years ago that

1493
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,880
eventually the bottom is going to fall

1494
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:08,679
out as we get to this Walmart mentality

1495
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,869
that the mom-and-pop shops that are

1496
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:12,730
doing the real quality work and doing

1497
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:15,069
real clean medicine are gonna have a

1498
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:17,199
foothold and be able to stand out as

1499
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:19,720
long as they put in the work to get

1500
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:23,799
there and I'm seeing I'm hearing more

1501
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:25,869
about it as of recent this idea and this

1502
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,570
you know so I kind of feel we're at the

1503
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:31,659
forefront of this change of more

1504
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:34,590
boutique shops you know the craft night

1505
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:34,589
verse microbe

1506
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:46,240

1507
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:47,799

01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,359
greenhouse or something well hopefully

1513
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:07,179
yeah I wanted to check in about

1514
01:06:04,349 --> 01:06:12,279
inspiration which was your suggestion on

1515
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:13,869
topic today I'm feeling really inspired

1516
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:18,820
this morning we had a big event

1517
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:20,589
yesterday here on the farm the

1518
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:24,070
International cannabis Farmers

1519
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:31,019
Association is a group of outdoor

1520
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:34,120
growers who are really focused on data

1521
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:38,289
and how it relates to regulation in the

1522
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:41,500
California marketplace and yeah we had

1523
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:45,130
about I don't know 40 people come to the

1524
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:50,920
farm and I just want to put it out there

1525
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:53,400
I see F a dot farm and then there's

1526
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:56,289
another thing going on Sun and Earth

1527
01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:01,690
certification this is suggested set of

1528
01:06:56,289 --> 01:07:07,989
guidelines for what appellations of

1529
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:10,450
origin and a certification process if

1530
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:12,939
you will that's all about regenerative

1531
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:16,000
practices I'm pretty thrilled to see

1532
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:19,530
what they've done and like I said that's

1533
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,699
up put it up on the the group chat thing

1534
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:23,680
would that be the thing to do Marcus

1535
01:07:21,699 --> 01:07:26,230
instead of trying to repeat it again

1536
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,000
yeah yeah you can put it into this chat

1537
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:30,159
you can put it into the other chat we

1538
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,530
can put it on the Facebook page we can

1539
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:37,359
get it out there okay and yeah there it

1540
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:38,920
doesn't cost anything to be a member

1541
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,769
what they're really looking for is

1542
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:43,930
feedback from small farmers about how

1543
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:46,769
the regulatory framework in California

1544
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:48,549
at least is working out but literally

1545
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:51,019
internationally we'd love to hear from

1546
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:54,530
people about

1547
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:56,929
if they think that the sun and earth

1548
01:07:54,530 --> 01:08:00,410
certification protocols for example

1549
01:07:56,929 --> 01:08:02,659
would work on commercial scale I'm

1550
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:04,789
pretty convinced they are it's basically

1551
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:08,599
a good description of dragonfly Earth

1552
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:11,389
medicines practices go ahead Sam I have

1553
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:13,789
a question for you Wade yeah people are

1554
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:16,819
doing Appalachians but I hear this all

1555
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:19,220
over Northern California especially but

1556
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:23,239
most of them are growing in man-made

1557
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:26,090
soils or digging big holes which they're

1558
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:28,219
filling with other soil so how can you

1559
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:31,430
get an appellation if you're not using

1560
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:34,909
the Nene burger I've often wondered this

1561
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:39,050
I couldn't agree more especially when

1562
01:08:34,909 --> 01:08:41,840
you work see Appalachians as the model

1563
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:45,159
that's being used in wine where do I saw

1564
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:49,130
everything to do with terroir the soil

1565
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:52,159
sun and earth certification does include

1566
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:54,920
a terroir component but it's also really

1567
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:58,099
focused on cultivars it's really focused

1568
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:02,960
on practices the approach that you use

1569
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:06,850
to generate your the amendments you need

1570
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:10,189
on your farm for years I've been doing

1571
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:14,900
ferments and composts and permaculture

1572
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:17,359
and harvesting mushrooms from spots on

1573
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:20,389
the property all about trying to create

1574
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:23,000
our own amendments here on the farm that

1575
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:27,890
way we know that cannabis because it's a

1576
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,859
bio accumulator doesn't accumulate any

1577
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:32,930
problematic materials from things you're

1578
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:34,699
bringing in from another supplier like

1579
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:37,369
you were saying Sam if you're buying

1580
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:40,489
dirt or soil how do you know what's

1581
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:42,649
actually in that soil you don't but if

1582
01:09:40,489 --> 01:09:46,250
you're making it yourself even more so

1583
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:50,479
it's not difficult terroir from that

1584
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:53,600
area well yes

1585
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:55,339
one of the factors that I think is going

1586
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,520
to be played up in cannabis is

1587
01:09:55,340 --> 01:10:00,170
environmental conditions how in very

1588
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:03,539
different environmental conditions

1589
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:05,849
affect different versions of cannabis

1590
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:09,238
certain cultivars flourish in some

1591
01:10:05,849 --> 01:10:11,400
environments and other cultivars do not

1592
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:15,479
you've spoken about that before just

1593
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:19,109
look at fungus resistance for example so

1594
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:21,328
part of Appalachians is like I say as

1595
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:25,920
you were saying that the native soils

1596
01:10:21,328 --> 01:10:27,840
part of it is practices and because if

1597
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,319
you like here in Nevada County there's

1598
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:34,769
quite a few people who work in pots

1599
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:37,738
large pots that are in the ground but

1600
01:10:34,769 --> 01:10:41,070
because the ground here a lot of the

1601
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:44,729
county is old mine tailings this is gold

1602
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:47,639
country all the rocks got dug up and

1603
01:10:44,729 --> 01:10:50,189
front three hundred years ago and there

1604
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:52,650
are large areas of the county where it's

1605
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:56,009
just vast rock fields you can literally

1606
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:57,210
see them in satellite views but there

1607
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:59,969
are other places where there's

1608
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:01,948
incredibly rich soil we happen to be

1609
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:07,139
fortunate enough to have found one of

1610
01:11:01,948 --> 01:11:09,928
them and by adding to the diversity in

1611
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:15,868
the soil and into the diversity of this

1612
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:20,519
the plants and wild insect native life

1613
01:11:15,868 --> 01:11:22,198
of that size scale if you will what I

1614
01:11:20,519 --> 01:11:25,800
found is once you find the right

1615
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:27,598
cultivars the plants flourish you know

1616
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,210
you know integrated pest management is a

1617
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:31,860
lot easier when you've got the plants

1618
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:33,840
that are right for the situation you're

1619
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:35,819
in so I think that's part of

1620
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,099
Appalachians another part of

1621
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:41,639
Appalachians is the historical culture

1622
01:11:38,099 --> 01:11:44,369
the actual history multi-generational

1623
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:48,690
history of cannabis work in Northern

1624
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:49,768
California so also whoever is really

1625
01:11:48,689 --> 01:11:54,029
really important

1626
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:56,219
yes exactly Sam so so that was that's

1627
01:11:54,029 --> 01:12:00,118
kind of inspiring to me I really feel

1628
01:11:56,219 --> 01:12:02,670
like it is one path forward that allows

1629
01:12:00,118 --> 01:12:04,348
small farmers to have a chance to

1630
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:06,658
actually survive in the coming in the

1631
01:12:04,349 --> 01:12:10,349
marketplace that already exists here in

1632
01:12:06,658 --> 01:12:11,788
California and so I want to change the

1633
01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:13,529
subject now because that's a very

1634
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:17,738
depressing subject the whole regulated

1635
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:20,889
market in California bubble bags

1636
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:25,868
I love the bubble bags Marcus thank you

1637
01:12:20,889 --> 01:12:28,809
it's it's a gift to all of us and for me

1638
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:31,268
in my life it's again if you're talking

1639
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:33,909
about small farmers if you educate

1640
01:12:31,269 --> 01:12:35,229
yourself on how to use the bags and what

1641
01:12:33,908 --> 01:12:37,388
you're actually doing in that process

1642
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:41,409
you can make extraordinarily high

1643
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:44,019
quality in material if you're beginning

1644
01:12:41,408 --> 01:12:46,149
source material is of quality and you

1645
01:12:44,019 --> 01:12:49,570
handle it properly every step of the way

1646
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:52,109
and that their beautiful design home

1647
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:55,618
scale high quality manufacturing

1648
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:58,630
technique and that's pretty far out

1649
01:12:55,618 --> 01:13:00,339
thank you yeah dude I made a batch the

1650
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:02,949
other day for the first time in a while

1651
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:04,900
actually I was doing an online course

1652
01:13:02,948 --> 01:13:08,138
that I'm doing over at ganja talks

1653
01:13:04,899 --> 01:13:10,779
University it was a Brazilian guy that

1654
01:13:08,139 --> 01:13:12,639
contacted me and said hey you know the

1655
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:14,408
people in Brazil could really use this

1656
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:17,199
information but they really kind of

1657
01:13:14,408 --> 01:13:19,509
require it in Portuguese so they did

1658
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:21,879
Portuguese subtitles for these videos

1659
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:23,440
and I did three of them so far on bubble

1660
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,900
hash and then yesterday was the live

1661
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:28,448
demo for that module of the course and

1662
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:30,638
the course gives you the three bubble

1663
01:13:28,448 --> 01:13:33,189
bag videos plus the live demo then it

1664
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:35,618
gives you three dry sift videos plus a

1665
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:38,078
live demo then it gives you three rosin

1666
01:13:35,618 --> 01:13:40,118
videos and a lot plus a live demo so

1667
01:13:38,078 --> 01:13:41,889
that'll be the full solvent list course

1668
01:13:40,118 --> 01:13:45,399
that I'm doing with ganja talks and

1669
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:48,849
yesterday or two days ago yeah was the

1670
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:50,948
first was the first live demo video so I

1671
01:13:48,849 --> 01:13:52,860
made some bubble hash flap gave me a

1672
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:55,569
half pound of some beautiful bud that

1673
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:59,339
turned out to be really nice melty stuff

1674
01:13:55,569 --> 01:14:03,849
pretty dark but really really nice

1675
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:06,489
probably gonna be before Marcus was

1676
01:14:03,849 --> 01:14:10,659
distributing bubble bags and a few of

1677
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:14,138
the boats the the truth of it was nobody

1678
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:17,828
had really really really clean hashish I

1679
01:14:14,139 --> 01:14:20,019
mean you could buy imported a sheet but

1680
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:24,670
to find it as clean as you can make at

1681
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:26,860
home Hey

1682

1693
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:59,529
Sam it was the truth that was the sort

1694
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,239
of amazing thing to be lucky enough to

1695
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:04,779
be in that position to release the

1696
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:08,079
bubble bags around 1999 isolator bags

1697
01:15:04,779 --> 01:15:09,939
had just come out in 1998 at the end of

1698
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,539
that year bubble bags came out at the

1699
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:15,339
start of 99 and it was just a unique

1700
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:17,979
thing to be able to teach people how to

1701
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:20,140
create hash that was just you know the

1702
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:22,479
ultimate bragging rights sort of speak

1703
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:25,180
to have this quality of hash that was

1704
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:26,859
just liquefying and melting and bubbling

1705
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:29,950
in a way that no one had really ever

1706
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:32,409
seen or money could make rush it that

1707
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:35,710
that time to but nobody was making it

1708
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:37,779
very clean I mean I was but very few

1709
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:43,239
people were making it where it would

1710
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:46,119
melt and bubble and well and it was

1711
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:49,689
indeed your dry sip that got me sort of

1712
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:56,979
before water hash was even a thing it

1713
01:15:49,689 --> 01:16:01,869
was in 1995 but my first cop that I was

1714
01:15:56,979 --> 01:16:03,549
there with owned I ended up smoked some

1715
01:16:01,869 --> 01:16:06,039
I didn't know at the time that it was

1716
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:07,840
your sift but Rob had it and I think it

1717
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:11,109
was at that old Thai food restaurant

1718
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,480
that we used to go to the small one that

1719
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:17,769
Rob would always take people to and I

1720
01:16:13,479 --> 01:16:19,269
remember hearing him on the stairs say

1721
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:21,640
if it don't bubble it ain't worth the

1722
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:23,620
trouble and just like watching this hash

1723
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,960
bubble and dripped through the screen

1724
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:28,539
and drip down the down stem of the of

1725
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:31,600
the Ruhr and I was just like what the

1726
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:33,100
[ __ ] and that sat with me for a couple

1727
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,800
of years kind of trying to figure out

1728
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:38,289
like what was that like how did they how

1729
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,239
did they have hash that melted into

1730
01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:42,069
liquid you know before it existed it was

1731
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:44,229
kind of an impossible thing to wrap your

1732
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:46,630
head around and it wasn't until seeing

1733
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:48,759
the isolator bags you know three and a

1734
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:53,800
half years later and then coming out

1735
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:57,310
with our own bags and starting to be

1736
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:59,470
murder we realized holy smokes like this

1737
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:00,820
is this real an enormous amount of

1738
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:06,699
friendships for me around the world

1739
01:17:00,819 --> 01:17:10,329
that's for sure how I met dee 420k i'm

1740
01:17:06,699 --> 01:17:17,889
sure actually yep

1741
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:21,250
oh yes watering it a little argument

1742
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:22,869
between me and someone else said come on

1743
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:27,119
down to the melting point if you're in

1744
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:31,559
Vancouver tough tough with me Dee 420k

1745

1746
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:38,789
like tried that volcano you put some

1747
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:41,649
real ugly leaf in there that was the old

1748
01:17:38,789 --> 01:17:43,960
gave me a big bag of that it was like

1749
01:17:41,649 --> 01:17:46,149
holy [ __ ] does this ever [ __ ] taste

1750
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,829
good and I was the first time I spent

1751
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:50,500
money like that on something that I

1752
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:52,750
smoked on I think it was like [ __ ] I

1753
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:55,899
think back then they're like 1,400 bucks

1754
01:17:52,750 --> 01:18:00,489
err I was at least a thousand Canadian

1755
01:17:55,899 --> 01:18:03,129
for sure maybe they looked I bought one

1756
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:05,019
what was that yeah you did pretty much

1757
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:06,699
everyone I blaze down especially with

1758
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:08,470
that little trick right cuz of course I

1759
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:10,989
had better but I just wanted to show

1760
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:12,760
people the sort of power of this little

1761
01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:14,769
tool where you could just put something

1762
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,869
in that was seemingly and didn't look

1763
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:19,420
that good and just vaporize the resin

1764
01:18:16,869 --> 01:18:21,460
off of it and get a super tasty tasty

1765
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,739
rip that was a long time ago that was 15

1766
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:28,000
years ago

1767
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:29,649

welcome back restaurant I did just mute

1773
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:51,479
you cuz you got the wind there were you

1774
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:54,930
in a greenhouse by the way yeah I'm

1775
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:57,949
actually a work yep greenhouse hybrid

1776
01:18:54,930 --> 01:19:01,950
model definitely supplemental lighting

1777
01:18:57,949 --> 01:19:03,739
nice yeah so like I was saying earlier

1778
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:04,920
it's really nice to get back to this

1779
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,050
remerged

1780
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,510
emergence of solvent lists at least the

1781
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:12,180
talks of it coming back and a real clean

1782
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:14,100
product for for the consumers and for

1783
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:16,770
the patients out there that's kind of

1784
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:18,420
what I based my whole energy off of when

1785
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:20,850
I started with native roots like I said

1786
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:23,279
the owner was like hey you're the Rasta

1787
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:25,470
it's bubble hash you know we're gonna

1788
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:26,699
start a company called Rasta bubble so I

1789
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:29,010
put my head down for like two years

1790
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:31,859
really focused on making that better

1791
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:33,210
making that a real thing and like I said

1792
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:37,380
like certain key things there was

1793
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:39,329
something that I caught YouTube I think

1794
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:42,779
it was a YouTube video of bubble man at

1795
01:19:39,329 --> 01:19:45,029
high times you know getting people

1796
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:46,529
getting getting people lifted off of his

1797
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:48,599
hash and like showing them the process

1798
01:19:46,529 --> 01:19:50,699
off of you know drying on the cardboard

1799
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,320
and there was a couple key things that

1800
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:55,079
you said and one of them being he was

1801
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:57,809
said if everybody's doing it it's

1802
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:59,909
probably wrong and that was key it stuck

1803
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:01,470
out stuck out for me as far as part of

1804
01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:04,289
my technique and it really changed

1805
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:07,740
changed my game as far as like my drying

1806
01:20:04,289 --> 01:20:09,810
technique and and the actual end product

1807
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:12,809
so you know hats off to you for the

1808
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:14,789
advice and you know that type of stuff

1809
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:18,120
is crucial I think the information that

1810
01:20:14,789 --> 01:20:21,300
we share like like be a hash search and

1811
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:24,779
just in general is key for any anybody

1812
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:27,150
in all people to like be consuming clean

1813
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:28,739
cannabis I think is the goal in the long

1814
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:30,719
term you know we don't we want to put

1815
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:34,800
good medicine out for people not just

1816
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:37,140
stuff that's going to sell that's could

1817
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,930
you tell us how you do your curing

1818
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:41,940
technique you're drunk technique yeah

1819
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:44,700
well it's kind of changed at least

1820
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:47,519
evolved over over sometime just within

1821
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:50,069
an introduction of the freeze dryer you

1822
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,190
know I did a seven-day cure process from

1823
01:20:50,069 --> 01:20:55,289
you know from actual washing to 24-hour

1824
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:57,869
like drying on racks part

1825
01:20:55,289 --> 01:21:00,390
paper then would go into a cold room for

1826
01:20:57,869 --> 01:21:02,670
good you know what [ __ ] freezer for

1827
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:04,860
good six seven days and then I'd be

1828
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:07,739
visited and then if you're talking

1829
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:11,609
commercially then I would go into graham

1830
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:13,739
jars glass graham jars and from the

1831
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:15,420
parchment if we were going into like a

1832
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:16,920
commercial aspect but if it's like for

1833
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:20,489
personal head stash or anything like

1834
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:26,640
that I go into mason jars just small you

1835
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:28,109
know deep dish low mason jars but like

1836
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,940
with the freeze dryer commercially

1837
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:33,149
that's kind of changed the game as far

1838
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:35,549
as you know rosin pressing and being

1839
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:37,769
able to keep up to speed from me myself

1840
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:40,020
I put up a lot of numbers here in

1841
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:41,970
Colorado as far as making hash by myself

1842
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,950
I've never really worked with a team I

1843
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:46,470
might have somebody that might grab my

1844
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:49,019
hash out for me or help me do like

1845
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:51,060
certain tasks but nothing as far as the

1846
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:53,190
process and production of it it's always

1847
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:55,020
been me and trying to put up high scale

1848
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:58,409
numbers and that's the thing with native

1849
01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:02,850
roots as we got to one from one store to

1850
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:04,289
eight stores quality became an issue you

1851
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:05,610
know because it's not just me dealing

1852
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:08,220
with the product but when it goes to the

1853
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:10,619
bud tenders and how they store it at the

1854
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:11,940
shop where it's being stored how it's

1855
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:14,699
being stored all those things come into

1856
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:17,099
a part and then also you know as we

1857
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:19,289
scale up it seems like quality becomes

1858
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:21,420
you know less of an importance and

1859
01:22:19,289 --> 01:22:23,069
quantity becomes more of the importance

1860
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,500
so that reflects and the concentrates

1861
01:22:23,069 --> 01:22:27,719
for sure and not something that I you

1862
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:31,770
know typically want to go buy for

1863
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:34,590
quality over over quantity all day so

1864
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:36,990
yeah you know and with that said in the

1865
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:39,449
last couple years the dynamics of the

1866
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:40,979
industry changing like I said solvent

1867
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:43,019
list is kind of you know taking a

1868
01:22:40,979 --> 01:22:45,299
backseat when it when it came to rosin

1869
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:48,060
and then resins taking a backseat when

1870
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:49,860
it came to the sauces and the diamonds

1871
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,920
and you know in the distillate so is

1872
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:54,809
it's nice like I said I've been hearing

1873
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,869
more talks here locally be amongst

1874
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:59,700
owners and shop owners and patients that

1875
01:22:57,869 --> 01:23:02,479
really want to see this reemergence of

1876
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:05,819
just good quality salt on this hash

1877
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:09,129
regardless if it's fresh frozen or if

1878
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:11,799
it's dry I mean I think the idea of like

1879
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:14,140
you know a pure form to concentrate is

1880
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:17,739
is what people are leaning towards you

1881
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:20,230
know less chemicals absolutely okay

1882
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:22,090
thank you very much man that's uh that's

1883
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:23,679
just some good information right there

1884
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:25,390
how about your dry sifting when you're

1885
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,280
doing any static tak with that with the

1886
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:28,840
paint rollers I've been seeing that and

1887
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:30,819
I kind of I haven't tried the paint

1888
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,409
roller technique with the static tech

1889
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:35,170
I've tried everything else with the

1890
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:37,420
static time every kind of material with

1891
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:39,970
the static tack but the paint roller and

1892
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:42,579
I've had quite a few messages saying hey

1893
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:43,630
try the paint roller make a video of it

1894
01:23:42,579 --> 01:23:45,970
all that kind of stuff have you been

1895
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:49,119
yeah no I haven't actually you know I

1896
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:51,610
did get a set of dry set screens which I

1897
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:54,550
was working with for probably a good six

1898
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:57,489
seven months and to me dry sifting is

1899
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:59,650
kind of like the Zen the Zen extract as

1900
01:23:57,489 --> 01:24:02,170
far as like you know I find myself I can

1901
01:23:59,649 --> 01:24:04,269
just get caught lost up in the process

1902
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,829
alone it's almost like doing a bonsai

1903
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:08,950
tree for me you know it's real

1904
01:24:05,829 --> 01:24:11,680
meditation and um and to fight you know

1905
01:24:08,949 --> 01:24:13,449
I'll repress through the screens like

1906
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,390
once I get to the lower screen Laure

1907
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:18,130
mesh screen repress through the screen

1908
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:19,960
but as far as static tech I never got an

1909
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:22,090
opportunity to really try it I'm no

1910
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:24,369
cuban cuban kind of hit me off with like

1911
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:26,949
his tack at least what you know the

1912
01:24:24,369 --> 01:24:28,930
steps of what to go by so when I got my

1913
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:30,639
screens I messed his Cuba Cuban hit me

1914
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:32,409
up he's like try this this and this and

1915
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,630
then he recommended the static as well

1916
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:39,130
but I just never got a chance to apply

1917
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:41,470
it oh do it man do it yeah it changed

1918
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:43,449
the game for me like like it changed the

1919
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:46,300
whole game for me 100%

1920
01:24:43,449 --> 01:24:48,159
nice yeah I definitely will probably get

1921
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:50,920
to it here pretty soon I'm kind of down

1922
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:52,180
harvest stuff I've relocated when I was

1923
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,590
with native roots I got a job

1924
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:55,480
opportunity it was kind of one I

1925
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:57,190
couldn't refuse they they wanted to pay

1926
01:24:55,479 --> 01:24:59,619
my rent for a year move me out to

1927
01:24:57,189 --> 01:25:03,219
Glenwood Springs I worked at Aspen for

1928
01:24:59,619 --> 01:25:05,439
about three years real culture shock for

1929
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:07,690
me and my family but a real great

1930
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:09,789
opportunity just the experience to be on

1931
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:12,339
that side of the state kind of a part of

1932
01:25:09,789 --> 01:25:15,039
Colorado I never seen before but with

1933
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:17,079
that said the pulse of the industry and

1934
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,479
what drives the industry and kind of the

1935
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:22,180
energy that I came from really wasn't

1936
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:22,959
out in that area or that sided side of

1937
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:25,150
the state

1938
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,270
so I kind of brought that energy with me

1939
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:30,399
out there it helped open several several

1940
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:31,780
nips and you know we're also working in

1941
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:35,589
another greenhouse that was doing

1942
01:25:31,779 --> 01:25:37,090
organics organic growing so I've learned

1943
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:39,369
a lot in the last three years which

1944
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:42,250
didn't so much resolve and revolve

1945
01:25:39,369 --> 01:25:45,069
around cannabis or solvent list but more

1946
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:46,510
on a whole level of cannabis and and how

1947
01:25:45,069 --> 01:25:48,549
to function and operate within this

1948
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:56,380
industry and and be successful at it and

1949
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:58,659
not compromise I wanted to welcome Eric

1950
01:25:56,380 --> 01:26:02,460
to the room I see he's come in under the

1951
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:02,460

winding down and it's starting to get

1956
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:20,199
rainy and I guess we'll get that for a

1957
01:26:17,738 --> 01:26:22,029
couple of months until until the snow

1958
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:24,119
starts falling and then it's Mountain

1959
01:26:22,029 --> 01:26:28,300
culture all winter long sledding

1960
01:26:24,119 --> 01:26:30,039
snowboarding skiing yeah I took I took

1961
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,380
our boat out of the water yesterday and

1962
01:26:30,039 --> 01:26:34,269
I was like oh it's so bittersweet to you

1963
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:36,730
know close the summer out pull the boat

1964
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:38,440
out and then oh my god it's time to tune

1965
01:26:36,729 --> 01:26:41,139
up the snowboards and get all that gear

1966
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:42,579
ready now so you know it's bittersweet

1967
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:46,150
to say goodbye to summer but when

1968
01:26:42,579 --> 01:26:48,430
there's always fun - but yeah I've been

1969
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:50,139
having an exciting time lately I've been

1970
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:52,510
traveling a lot going to lots of

1971
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:54,610
different greenhouses and I got to check

1972
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:57,130
out the loud packed greenhouse last week

1973
01:26:54,609 --> 01:27:00,069
and a bunch of others in the Monterey

1974
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:02,170
County area and and I actually finally

1975
01:27:00,069 --> 01:27:05,829
found some really clean grows I was

1976
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:07,630
surprised that Monterey area you can

1977
01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:11,680
find a lot of the cannabis plants are

1978
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:14,050
covered in dust and besides other things

1979
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,270
too but it's a real dusty area I've

1980
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:17,860
found and so I was able to actually loud

1981
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:20,290
packs one of them and there's another

1982
01:27:17,859 --> 01:27:23,009
farm over in Salinas that I was really

1983
01:27:20,289 --> 01:27:25,119
impressed like dust free really clean

1984
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:27,969
testing clean all these good things

1985
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:30,130
happening so it was kind of fun to

1986
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:33,460
finally see some progress I guess you

1987
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:35,170
could say out there damn testing clean

1988
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:37,059
and Salinas I've never heard those two

1989
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:39,920
things in like

1990
01:27:37,059 --> 01:27:41,538
yeah it's not I don't know how common

1991
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,639
that is but it's it's definitely

1992
01:27:41,538 --> 01:27:47,328
happening and it's far and few between

1993
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:49,460
but yeah it was a fun trip I saw a lot

1994
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:52,998
of glass greenhouses polycarbonate

1995
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:54,679

2022
01:29:05,868 --> 01:29:12,529
that I'm back okay cool let's talk later

2023
01:29:10,599 --> 01:29:16,730
one thing I was talking about earlier

2024
01:29:12,529 --> 01:29:18,649
also was about I was really given chops

2025
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:21,948
about bubble bags and what a difference

2026
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:24,529
they'd made and how accessible to small

2027
01:29:21,948 --> 01:29:26,388
farmers high quality concentrates are

2028
01:29:24,529 --> 01:29:28,130
now as a result and I mean it's been

2029
01:29:26,389 --> 01:29:30,949
that way for a long time but it was

2030
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:34,969
really one of the first ways that you

2031
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:41,598
could harvest trichomes and and get high

2032
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:44,658
purity so yeah yeah shout out to bubble

2033
01:29:41,599 --> 01:29:47,779
man on the bubble dad it's for sure I

2034
01:29:44,658 --> 01:29:50,779
feel like it's kind of the Burton

2035
01:29:47,779 --> 01:29:52,609
of hash bags you know it's accessible

2036
01:29:50,779 --> 01:29:55,279
for everyone and anyone it's gotten to

2037
01:29:52,609 --> 01:29:58,759
that point that you know we can all use

2038
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:01,699
it and hold I mean it's you know

2039
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:04,340
virtually you know the same processes

2040
01:30:01,699 --> 01:30:05,989
can be done for anyone and I think

2041
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:07,460
that's what's dope about it is that you

2042
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:09,800
know we should be all more supportive of

2043
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:11,810
each other you know especially with

2044
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:13,940
people doing good work and quality work

2045
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:16,010
not so much that competition mentality

2046
01:30:13,939 --> 01:30:18,199
but you know that it is what it is you

2047
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:20,750
know the strong will survive but you got

2048
01:30:18,199 --> 01:30:24,460
to be supportive of those that are doing

2049
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:24,460
good work as well you know I mean

2050
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:29,570
absolutely you got to it's the bubble

2051
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:32,750

have like like-minded people it's kind

2090
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:04,069
of like being at a Phish show without

2091
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:06,770
being at a fish show we're just like

2092
01:32:04,069 --> 01:32:09,829
random people can come right out of this

2093
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:11,540
huge crowd of people and be like hey hey

2094
01:32:09,829 --> 01:32:15,439
I like the phone mount you like the

2095
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:15,800
phone out absolutely love the phone

2096
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:17,329
mount

2097
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,860
maybe I'll have a puff of some foam out

2098
01:32:17,329 --> 01:32:20,960
right now we've blazed a few of those

2099
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:24,049
people down too right there and then

2100
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:26,210
pretty much yep yeah it's happened many

2101
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:28,670
times it happened on my Whistler video

2102
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:30,859
in the gondola at the end of the video

2103
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:32,480
paddy and I end up puffing a bunch of

2104
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:35,149
people down that we had never met before

2105
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,709
that were that we're excited to have a

2106
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:38,809
little puff it's kind of one of the joys

2107
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:41,720
of cannabis and it's really it shows the

2108
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:43,910
our of cannabis even under the umbrella

2109
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:45,829
of paranoia and the umbrella of

2110
01:32:43,909 --> 01:32:49,010
prohibition people were still willing to

2111
01:32:45,829 --> 01:32:51,199
sort of you know have trust and have

2112
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:52,489
faith and the thing what the DEA really

2113
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:55,609
always were attacked

2114
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:57,109
attacking were where it was trust you

2115
01:32:55,609 --> 01:32:59,630
know like back in the day when Howard

2116
01:32:57,109 --> 01:33:02,000
was doing his thing Howard Marks they

2117
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:04,340
you know doing things with with tons of

2118
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,659
material that was like on the cuff it

2119
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:08,300
was like oh yeah the semi is at this

2120
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:13,279
address just pull up you know way what

2121
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:14,630
you eat it like no the DEA started

2122
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:16,369
getting people to rat on one another and

2123
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:19,550
busting people they just sort of

2124
01:33:16,369 --> 01:33:20,960
disintegrated that trust and some people

2125
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:22,880
have always held on to it maybe not

2126
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,579
necessarily to do like a five time deal

2127
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,800
or whatnot but to just have trust at a

2128
01:33:25,579 --> 01:33:29,449
concert and share a joint with someone

2129
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,250
or smokeable with someone that you don't

2130
01:33:29,449 --> 01:33:33,289
know and I think it's gonna be one of

2131
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:36,380
the powers of cannabis when cannabis

2132
01:33:33,289 --> 01:33:37,609
becomes more legal and prohibition drops

2133
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:39,980
away that we're gonna see this

2134
01:33:37,609 --> 01:33:45,109
incredible power of just being able to

2135
01:33:39,979 --> 01:33:47,899
be like before you get to the concert I

2136
01:33:45,109 --> 01:33:51,349
can remember driving to a Jethro Tull

2137
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:54,949
concert in the sixties and or late

2138
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:57,170
sixties and it was a long beach if I

2139
01:33:54,949 --> 01:34:00,289
remember correct and we were driving

2140
01:33:57,170 --> 01:34:04,420
Hollywood we're on the freeway and I

2141
01:34:00,289 --> 01:34:07,970
noticed that the car next to us that was

2142
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:10,699
on the freeway there was three guys in

2143
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:16,760
their past and they're joining so I

2144
01:34:10,699 --> 01:34:18,649
waved at them cuz I'm a smoker one week

2145
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:21,380
the cars got really close to each other

2146
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:23,269
and we traded joints on the freeway I

2147
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:26,510
don't know who these people were never

2148
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:29,690
saw them again they were probably going

2149
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:36,949
to get through it all who knows that's

2150
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:41,029
pretty awesome bong rip passing doobies

2151
01:34:36,949 --> 01:34:42,710
out the window at 80 K an hour although

2152
01:34:41,029 --> 01:34:47,829
I guess you guys don't drive kilometers

2153
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:53,739
down there 50 miles an hour maybe

2154
01:34:47,829 --> 01:34:55,578
Bhangra you smile that

2155
01:34:53,739 --> 01:35:00,630
[Music]

2156
01:34:55,578 --> 01:35:03,238
just enjoying day I was just thinking

2157
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:04,859
about like a convertible and just a

2158
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:06,928
convertible would be great because you

2159
01:35:04,859 --> 01:35:10,319
could just kind of like toss it right

2160
01:35:06,929 --> 01:35:12,449
into the car as it's moving you know not

2161
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:15,000
have to worry about getting it through

2162
01:35:12,448 --> 01:35:18,598
the window because the entire top is

2163
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:21,238
down so I can only assume on those hot

2164
01:35:18,599 --> 01:35:24,449
summer days in California that there's a

2165
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:27,118
lot of convertibles driving around and

2166
01:35:24,448 --> 01:35:30,988
so convertible would just make a bigger

2167
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:33,988
target throw the joint into it not so

2168
01:35:30,988 --> 01:35:37,888
easy to joints in a convertible

2169
01:35:33,988 --> 01:35:41,069
they run it's just hard to light him

2170
01:35:37,889 --> 01:35:42,599
right Sam well it's yeah it's almost

2171
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:48,828
important but you can use a cigarette

2172
01:35:42,599 --> 01:35:48,828
lighter for that oh maybe a hot coil oh

2173
01:35:52,939 --> 01:35:59,848
boy

2174
01:35:55,578 --> 01:36:03,179
hey Mark did I read the chat earlier

2175
01:35:59,849 --> 01:36:03,810
that Andrew was trying to get in then

2176
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:07,170
who was

2177
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:09,179
Indra our friend Indra John Davis well

2178
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:13,020
he says he can't get into the actual

2179
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:15,719
YouTube chat room oh oh he can't get a

2180
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:20,520
chattering okay I didn't know if he was

2181
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:23,789
trying to get on is he still in the

2182
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:28,440
penalty box he's not in the penalty box

2183
01:36:23,789 --> 01:36:30,359
no I just I just listen I just want to

2184
01:36:28,439 --> 01:36:33,779
make sure that the conversation is not

2185
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:36,118
all about one person's product right and

2186
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:38,009
I just I hear you we all have things

2187
01:36:36,118 --> 01:36:39,210
going on there's all sorts of things and

2188
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:41,400
it's you know you guys were talking

2189
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:43,260
about bubble bags that's great and we're

2190
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:44,939
talking about the khalad race it's

2191
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:47,250
always good to mention these things I

2192
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:49,710
just like for me I would love for hashed

2193
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:51,899
church to be nonstop bubble hat bubble

2194
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:55,198
talk for for the two or three hours

2195
01:36:51,899 --> 01:36:56,609
every episode but people don't want that

2196
01:36:55,198 --> 01:36:59,158
they don't want to just hear about

2197
01:36:56,609 --> 01:37:01,769
bubble hash for two or three hours every

2198
01:36:59,158 --> 01:37:03,960
week so we mention it here and there I

2199
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:05,800
could probably count on like one or two

2200
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:11,079
hands how many times I've mentioned

2201
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:13,869
my own product on past church I got a

2202
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:15,850
question for Sam it's kind of going back

2203
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:18,130
to that green house hashed Church we had

2204
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:21,850
a while back when he was talking about

2205
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:27,250
sexing plants by putting him in the dark

2206
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:29,950
for one day I had people comment on that

2207
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:32,890
or asked me after Sam wanted to know

2208
01:37:29,949 --> 01:37:36,250
what size or what stage are the plants

2209
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:37,960
and when you actually do this sexing of

2210
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:41,409
the plants or when when's the best time

2211
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:44,800
new small big in the beginning they were

2212
01:37:41,409 --> 01:37:49,840
from seed but later on everybody grew

2213
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:52,239
with Colin so it was but clones you

2214
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:55,510
usually know what the sex is already so

2215
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:59,559
it's usually seeds that they're grown

2216
01:37:55,510 --> 01:38:03,190
and they have to be at least maybe a

2217
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:04,780
foot tall then I mean you can sexing if

2218
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:07,599
you're just going to sex of them

2219
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:10,059
strictly only sex them need to need to

2220
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,910
do it a bit earlier but if you're going

2221
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:14,950
to flower them then you want to have a

2222
01:38:12,909 --> 01:38:17,199
little size to the plant before you plow

2223
01:38:14,949 --> 01:38:20,109
it yeah because there's a lot of people

2224
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:22,149
popping beans or planting seeds nowadays

2225
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:24,519
compared to getting clowns just because

2226
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:28,149
the whole clone fiasco in California was

2227
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:31,660
so such a dirty business that you know

2228
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:33,969
the Philo's came out now and has sex

2229
01:38:31,659 --> 01:38:35,949
testing kits also to help people that

2230
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:38,710
they can go I guess as soon as the plant

2231
01:38:35,949 --> 01:38:42,279
I'm not sure which stage exactly it has

2232
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:47,140
to be and they can take yourself as soon

2233
01:38:42,279 --> 01:38:50,439
as you I think you can even use my

2234
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:52,360
pronunciations terrible terabyte title I

2235
01:38:50,439 --> 01:38:55,379
didn't or you know the little rowdy

2236
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:59,710
people before the sale urgently oh well

2237
01:38:55,380 --> 01:39:01,930
but the problem with those tests is they

2238
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:04,270
can tell you if the DNA is made of a

2239
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:07,030
female correct but they can't tell you

2240
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:10,720
if it's a female but to intersect so

2241
01:39:07,029 --> 01:39:12,399
he's still got to do your work dude well

2242
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,829
and that's the problem a lot of the test

2243
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:18,759
kits for most people are expensive and

2244
01:39:14,829 --> 01:39:19,600
so with the expense of the test kit the

2245
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:21,550
knowledge the

2246
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,410
dropped that day on hashed Church about

2247
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:27,480
being able to sex the plants and putting

2248
01:39:23,409 --> 01:39:30,430
him in the dark for one day was huge

2249
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:33,250
that'll work really good for early fast

2250
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:34,750
maturing varieties for later maturing

2251
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:40,449
varieties you might walk two or three

2252
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:41,890
days okay okay yeah cuz it got a lot of

2253
01:39:40,449 --> 01:39:43,809
people's attention after that one

2254
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:46,119
because like I said the sex test kid is

2255
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:48,670
kind of expensive for craft growers and

2256
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:50,859
a lot of people are popping seeds and so

2257
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:52,630
you know everybody wants to eat

2258
01:39:50,859 --> 01:39:56,829
everything and nothing figured it out uh

2259
01:39:52,630 --> 01:40:00,720
so we'll just show sex it will not

2260
01:39:56,829 --> 01:40:03,760
pitching the flower and it's easy breezy

2261
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:07,600
yeah that's amazing I didn't think one

2262
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:17,980
day was enough but it makes sense why

2263
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:23,800
you see this two weeks later it will

2264
01:40:17,979 --> 01:40:26,259
deflect our sex and just to clear sex at

2265
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:29,440
the crotches if you only do it one day

2266
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:31,449
like that so it'll draw a couple of

2267
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:36,189
either male or female flowers whatever

2268
01:40:31,449 --> 01:40:38,099
the plant is uh later [ __ ] I mean he

2269
01:40:36,189 --> 01:40:42,929
never really left then you've just

2270
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:42,930
powered a tiny tiny tiny bit

2271
01:40:47,229 --> 01:40:53,839
i'm peacing out got charged to do before

2272
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:55,300
my lights go off nice talking with all

2273
01:40:53,840 --> 01:41:00,529
of you

2274
01:40:55,300 --> 01:41:06,820
hey crazy everybody take it easy deep

2275
01:41:00,529 --> 01:41:10,729
and enjoy the day I know I'm going to

2276
01:41:06,819 --> 01:41:15,079
shower now I want a little in a thing at

2277
01:41:10,729 --> 01:41:19,759
least back when I was doing indoor

2278
01:41:15,079 --> 01:41:21,949
farming I found I don't know how I

2279
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,960
discovered it maybe it was part of

2280
01:41:21,949 --> 01:41:26,889
trying to understand photo period and

2281
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:29,359
how it affects cannabis but I found that

2282
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:32,780
most of the different cultivars I was

2283
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:35,000
working with if I gave them a 24 hour

2284
01:41:32,779 --> 01:41:37,519
period of darkness when I moved them

2285
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,699
from their growing phase to their

2286
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:43,790
flowering phase I would reduce as much

2287
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:45,829
as a week to 10 days off of the amount

2288
01:41:43,789 --> 01:41:48,649
of time that it took them to finish

2289
01:41:45,829 --> 01:41:51,640
flowering and I wonder if anyone else

2290
01:41:48,649 --> 01:41:59,149
would also late yeah it's also slightly

2291
01:41:51,640 --> 01:42:07,310
reduces yield ah well I was younger

2292
01:41:59,149 --> 01:42:08,819
flowery gives more yield in general it

2293
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:11,100
might be that I didn't

2294
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:12,719
that because the other practices I was

2295
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:14,600
working with this was when I was in my

2296
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:18,690
learning curve about how plants

2297
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:21,320
responded indoors but I remember

2298
01:42:18,689 --> 01:42:23,849
learning that one fairly early on and

2299
01:42:21,319 --> 01:42:27,289
maybe other things contributed to the

2300
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:32,280
increase in the yields that I saw but

2301
01:42:27,289 --> 01:42:33,600
yeah I I want a second what Eric brought

2302
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:37,109
up and what you've shared with us

2303
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:39,329
already that cannabis is incredibly

2304
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:41,939
sensitive to photo sent this photo

2305
01:42:39,329 --> 01:42:45,269
period how long a period of darkness it

2306
01:42:41,939 --> 01:42:48,269
has and you can do a lot with learning

2307
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:50,790
about your plants by taking cuttings of

2308
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:53,270
seedlings and putting them in dark and

2309
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:55,890
seeing what's going on with them yeah

2310
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:59,100
one of the first things we did was we

2311
01:42:55,890 --> 01:43:02,700
took the exact same phone and we have it

2312
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:05,910
be maintained under 18 or 24 hours from

2313
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:09,449
light or whatever it was and then we

2314
01:43:05,909 --> 01:43:12,750
took identical size pots identical

2315
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:19,429
science clone to the same quote and we

2316
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:19,430
flowered some of them under a hour

2317
01:43:19,488 --> 01:43:26,709
or that and lovely flower just

2318
01:43:30,199 --> 01:43:36,500
at me from 1820 to 12 whatever I wish

2319
01:43:33,229 --> 01:43:39,859
would easy for flour and other ones we

2320
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:43,159
brought it down gradual so notice we

2321
01:43:39,859 --> 01:43:47,989
knocked off uh two three four minutes a

2322
01:43:43,159 --> 01:43:49,670
day and it absolutely gives you

2323
01:43:47,989 --> 01:43:53,319
different form different yields

2324
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:53,319
different results

2325
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:02,930
another thing that I have run into Sam

2326
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:04,880
and I have a question about is that I

2327
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:07,430
run into a lot of people that are doing

2328
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:09,140
like deprivation you know early

2329
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:12,560
flowering in the summertime when it's

2330
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:14,930
really hot and a lot of people get great

2331
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,640
buds and great quality and it doesn't

2332
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:18,260
cool down much in the evening time but a

2333
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,160
lot of people try to say that they

2334
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:23,690
experience the plants being finished

2335
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:25,250
seven to ten days sooner than they

2336
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:27,500
normally would if they were like grown

2337
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:29,989
indoors let's say like a lot of people

2338
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:32,180
will say oh this plant flowers in you

2339
01:44:29,989 --> 01:44:33,949
know 60 70 or whatever days but in a

2340
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:35,840
greenhouse doing light deprivation in

2341
01:44:33,949 --> 01:44:38,329
the middle of the summer they actually

2342
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:40,310
feel like or seen that they harvest like

2343
01:44:38,329 --> 01:44:43,039
I sent seven to ten days earlier have

2344
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:46,130
you ever well there's a couple possible

2345
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:49,130
reasons number one is the loads you

2346
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:51,079
receive from the Sun in a greenhouse are

2347
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:54,199
way beyond anything you're given

2348
01:44:51,079 --> 01:44:56,960
artificially the flights so all of the

2349
01:44:54,199 --> 01:44:59,630
temperatures I've seen what you're

2350
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:02,329
saying too but I can't say concretely

2351
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:05,710
what why it was in their case but I

2352
01:45:02,329 --> 01:45:08,000
started to suspect to their just say

2353
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:09,680
yeah it's kind of a fun phenomenon I

2354
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,920
guess you could say or something that

2355
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:15,079
occurs or happens that I hear a lot but

2356
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,640
I don't know if it's through testing or

2357
01:45:15,079 --> 01:45:19,100
people just looking at it going yeah

2358
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:22,700
it's done and going through that method

2359
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:25,730
or whatever I know in general I I liked

2360
01:45:22,699 --> 01:45:28,729
cooler temperatures at night and I also

2361
01:45:25,729 --> 01:45:32,839
like not such extreme high temperatures

2362
01:45:28,729 --> 01:45:35,629
I find really high temperatures have a

2363
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:40,039
tendency to pull it off the terpenes

2364
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:41,600
faster or the living plant I mean I can

2365
01:45:40,039 --> 01:45:42,880
agree with you on that one of the things

2366
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:46,840
I found

2367
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:48,880
through our my practices was and I found

2368
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:51,159
this this summer at a farm actually and

2369
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:53,380
it was kind of ironic to see see it

2370
01:45:51,159 --> 01:45:55,210
happening there is that a lot a lot of

2371
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:58,539
times I would put my greenhouse where it

2372
01:45:55,210 --> 01:46:01,960
gets four o'clock shade by a tree in the

2373
01:45:58,539 --> 01:46:03,579
afternoon and if it gets full Sun all

2374
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:06,369
day long and then starts to go in the

2375
01:46:03,579 --> 01:46:09,279
shade about four you know 4:30

2376
01:46:06,369 --> 01:46:12,069
maybe even earlier at times we would see

2377
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:14,619
the plants start to cool down before we

2378
01:46:12,069 --> 01:46:16,059
pull the light depth cover and that

2379
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:17,829
would actually you know nowadays with

2380
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:19,570
the more advanced greenhouses you can

2381
01:46:17,829 --> 01:46:21,489
still run ventilation and do all these

2382
01:46:19,569 --> 01:46:24,429
things that we couldn't do before but

2383
01:46:21,489 --> 01:46:26,829
even for the do-it-yourselfer palm tarps

2384
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:28,659
doesn't have a lot of ventilation when

2385
01:46:26,829 --> 01:46:30,750
they do all that carbon so the minute

2386
01:46:28,659 --> 01:46:32,889
they pull the tarp we're seeing less

2387
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:34,510
condensation in the greenhouses because

2388
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:38,200
of the fact that plants have a chance to

2389
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:40,000
cool down and you know I see I think

2390
01:46:38,199 --> 01:46:41,679
help the quality of the Canada it's

2391
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,270
quite a bit because of that fact and it

2392
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:47,220
has that chance to cool down a little

2393
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:51,790
bit before we encase it in that bubble

2394
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:53,890
it makes sense to me I mean well when

2395
01:46:51,789 --> 01:46:56,380
the plants are really cooking in the

2396
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:59,590
greenhouse and it's really freaking hot

2397
01:46:56,380 --> 01:47:01,630
their stomata are completely open and

2398
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:09,789
that transpiring water vapor like you

2399
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:13,029
can't believe which is not good when he

2400
01:47:09,789 --> 01:47:14,560
closes it all up no cuz I went to a farm

2401
01:47:13,029 --> 01:47:16,119
that actually was asking me some

2402
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,400
questions and they had one that's at the

2403
01:47:16,119 --> 01:47:20,559
top of the hill in the middle of the Sun

2404
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:23,049
and then they had another greenhouse

2405
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,700
that's down below and got in the shade

2406
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:26,380
and the stuff in the shade in the early

2407
01:47:24,699 --> 01:47:28,300
afternoon had better quality and the

2408
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:30,340
stuff that was up in the full Sun and

2409
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:33,789
they pulled the tarps at the same time

2410
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:35,860
and did a lot of these things but to

2411
01:47:33,789 --> 01:47:37,539
stuff down load by cooler quicker and I

2412
01:47:35,859 --> 01:47:40,659
thought that was you know one of the

2413
01:47:37,539 --> 01:47:45,159
main reasons it was better 25 years ago

2414
01:47:40,659 --> 01:47:48,399
we still didn't until recently so every

2415
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:51,340
time we would spray our greenhouse with

2416
01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:53,920
white they call it called care it's like

2417
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:56,029
a white paint that's water-soluble and

2418
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,819
you spray the outside and agree

2419
01:47:56,029 --> 01:48:03,460
to reduce meat in the summertime on the

2420
01:47:58,819 --> 01:48:08,449
right levels in the heat and it it

2421
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:13,159
absolutely consistent their canvas with

2422
01:48:08,449 --> 01:48:26,809
no loss of yield then high temperatures

2423
01:48:13,159 --> 01:48:28,880
and way more life I'm just holding down

2424
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:30,440
the chat room that's the reason I'm not

2425
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,390
talking right now there's a whole thing

2426
01:48:30,439 --> 01:48:33,919
going on in the chat room right now that

2427
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:36,470
I'm just sort of trying to stay on top

2428
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,750
of I'm just kind of working away I got a

2429
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:40,970
cord running across the top of my laptop

2430
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:43,369
because it died I sure didn't while I'm

2431
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:48,770
sitting here I might as well um put some

2432
01:48:43,369 --> 01:48:50,809
clothes and some dirt with you guys

2433

not hearing you good I did kind of hear

2468
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:12,020

01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:14,240
sure all right doc Wireless yeah

2470
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:14,630
Wireless does suck a little bit doesn't

2471
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:18,409
it

2472
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:19,670
so CBD big big companies moving in a

2473
01:51:18,409 --> 01:51:21,409
town I guess we're gonna get a lot of

2474
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:23,859
CBD medicine on the market here for

2475
01:51:21,409 --> 01:51:27,309
legalization quite quickly I see yeah

2476
01:51:23,859 --> 01:51:29,420
yeah it's a big part of the lab that I'm

2477
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:31,880
involved with building they're gonna

2478
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:35,720
definitely do we're going to definitely

2479
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:39,109
do large-scale crude oil production and

2480
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:43,430
distillation and isolate for CBD and THC

2481
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:45,829
a we do not with fields or with the

2482
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:47,150
plant tourists or separations I know

2483
01:51:45,829 --> 01:52:01,279
there's a lot of stuff going on in my

2484
01:51:47,149 --> 01:52:06,579
home I think all of the above you do the

2485
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:09,559
row of 20 CBD I'm doing the rubber

2486
01:52:06,579 --> 01:52:11,090
you're doing the robot it's cuz you're

2487
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:14,030
not meeting your Mike maybe how do I

2488
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:16,699
sound now better much better

2489
01:52:14,029 --> 01:52:18,259
yeah it's cuz when when when we don't

2490
01:52:16,699 --> 01:52:20,840
need our mics it makes

2491
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:24,230
that robot thing even more sort of easy

2492
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:27,949
to happen so sorry about that Roboto

2493
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:28,609
bubbleman in the house but uh yeah what

2494
01:52:27,948 --> 01:52:30,710
was I saying

2495
01:52:28,609 --> 01:52:32,868
I guess I was talking about Oh that

2496
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:35,569
we're gonna go all the routes have green

2497
01:52:32,868 --> 01:52:38,658
house partners have filled growing hemp

2498
01:52:35,569 --> 01:52:41,929
have crude oil from you know countries

2499
01:52:38,658 --> 01:52:44,029
like Jamaica and Colombia be able to get

2500
01:52:41,929 --> 01:52:47,059
imported into Canada that we can produce

2501
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:52,359
isolate from I think having a variety of

2502
01:52:47,059 --> 01:52:52,360
sort of streams makes the most sense but

2503
01:52:54,519 --> 01:53:01,610
and it's the only exciting time to a

2504
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:03,408
legalization at least you know now I

2505
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:05,238
understand whenever you say that there's

2506
01:53:03,408 --> 01:53:08,750
always some sour sap in the audience

2507
01:53:05,238 --> 01:53:11,750
that's like this is it legalization this

2508
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:13,399
is prohibition 2.0 but I'm not sure

2509
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:15,349
those people remember having their doors

2510
01:53:13,399 --> 01:53:16,879
kicked in and being arrested and having

2511
01:53:15,349 --> 01:53:19,099
their kids taken away and all that or

2512
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,779
other fun stuff that happened in the

2513
01:53:19,099 --> 01:53:24,170
days of prohibition this is definitely

2514
01:53:20,779 --> 01:53:26,268
better it's not perfect just like when

2515
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:27,949
alcohol prohibition and if it didn't end

2516
01:53:26,269 --> 01:53:30,139
and then you could just buy alcohol on

2517
01:53:27,948 --> 01:53:32,029
every street corner it was like slow and

2518
01:53:30,139 --> 01:53:34,130
steady and you couldn't even put like

2519
01:53:32,029 --> 01:53:36,679
beer signs in your window right away or

2520
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:38,538
other you know alcohol sold here so I

2521
01:53:36,679 --> 01:53:40,399
think I'm hoping that it's not going to

2522
01:53:38,538 --> 01:53:44,238
take as long as it did with alcohol 20

2523
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:47,179
to 30 plus years but regardless if it

2524
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:50,948
does we've made some big strides in the

2525
01:53:47,179 --> 01:53:53,389
last 10 to 20 years in this in this

2526
01:53:50,948 --> 01:53:57,348
community industry whatever you however

2527
01:53:53,389 --> 01:53:58,969
you wanted last the last five years just

2528
01:53:57,349 --> 01:54:01,578
catastrophic that what the changes that

2529
01:53:58,969 --> 01:54:05,719
be just amazing I mean it just solves

2530
01:54:01,578 --> 01:54:07,549
2012 it just like something happened and

2531
01:54:05,719 --> 01:54:11,569
it just kind of just one like that and

2532
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:13,279
now we're seeing it I see well I think

2533
01:54:11,569 --> 01:54:20,238
it all started back in the 60s right

2534
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:22,639
right I think it's better that big

2535
01:54:20,238 --> 01:54:25,939
business and government is involved

2536
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:27,559
because they're not involved that big

2537
01:54:25,939 --> 01:54:30,888
business and government will hate

2538
01:54:27,559 --> 01:54:31,659
cavernous and it'll just be illegal

2539
01:54:30,889 --> 01:54:36,039
forever and

2540
01:54:31,659 --> 01:54:39,399
and that's not better that's definitely

2541
01:54:36,039 --> 01:54:40,720
not better agreed I have this sort of

2542
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:42,579
argument all the time because people

2543
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:44,619
like we don't need all these regulations

2544
01:54:42,579 --> 01:54:46,689
and I'm like I think we need some

2545
01:54:44,619 --> 01:54:49,210
regulations maybe we don't need all of

2546
01:54:46,689 --> 01:54:50,889
them but some it's like imagine going to

2547
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:53,199
a kitchen at a restaurant that doesn't

2548
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:55,750
have to follow food safety simple food

2549
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:57,789
safety regulations I mean those are put

2550
01:54:55,750 --> 01:55:00,579
in place for the for the end for the end

2551
01:54:57,789 --> 01:55:03,489
consumer safety so that you don't end up

2552
01:55:00,579 --> 01:55:06,130
with food poisoning or eating so I end

2553
01:55:03,489 --> 01:55:12,369
up with the kitchens but also breed rats

2554
01:55:06,130 --> 01:55:14,739
in the same room for selling rats I'm

2555
01:55:12,369 --> 01:55:16,720
telling you it's it's definitely a good

2556
01:55:14,739 --> 01:55:18,189
idea and I hear the argument all the

2557
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,650
time where people are like these legal

2558
01:55:18,189 --> 01:55:22,629
companies are just poisoning us they've

2559
01:55:20,649 --> 01:55:25,000
already had recalls and I'm like listen

2560
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:27,489
that means they got caught and they got

2561
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,619
and it's known the other side of the

2562
01:55:27,489 --> 01:55:31,569
coin is that nobody ever knows because

2563
01:55:29,619 --> 01:55:33,909
nobody ever gets caught because nobody's

2564
01:55:31,569 --> 01:55:36,639
testing and you just put it into the

2565
01:55:33,909 --> 01:55:38,889
black market and sell it that doesn't

2566
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:40,660
seem better either I don't understand

2567
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:43,060
the mentality and people thinking like

2568
01:55:40,659 --> 01:55:44,829
I'm gonna continue to buy from the black

2569
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:46,330
mark I mean I get this if you're in one

2570
01:55:44,829 --> 01:55:49,269
of those people that can grow your own

2571
01:55:46,329 --> 01:55:52,630
then amazing it's great to grow your own

2572
01:55:49,270 --> 01:55:54,490
but it's not realistic to think that the

2573
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:57,069
majority of people are going to grow

2574
01:55:54,489 --> 01:55:59,170
their own cannabis for their own

2575
01:55:57,069 --> 01:56:01,479
medicine we do it because we love it and

2576
01:55:59,170 --> 01:56:02,949
it's our passion but it is a substantial

2577
01:56:01,479 --> 01:56:06,849
amount of work when it all breaks down

2578
01:56:02,949 --> 01:56:10,019
and to think that it's as simple as most

2579
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:12,700
people grow their own tomatoes or is a

2580
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:16,090
tobacco or make their own beard wine

2581
01:56:12,699 --> 01:56:19,479
sure we all know people who do but not

2582
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:21,310
the majority not the majority and even

2583
01:56:19,479 --> 01:56:23,829
the people that do did they grow enough

2584
01:56:21,310 --> 01:56:25,539
tomatoes for their entire year or do

2585
01:56:23,829 --> 01:56:27,220
they eat their own Tomatoes for a month

2586
01:56:25,539 --> 01:56:29,350
or two and that was just kind of a nice

2587
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:32,710
little thing you know are they literally

2588
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:35,620
producing all their food all like 24

2589
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:37,390
hours a day 365 days a year it's it's

2590
01:56:35,619 --> 01:56:40,989
rare for sure are they making their own

2591
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:44,980
clothes and you know like cannabis has

2592
01:56:40,989 --> 01:56:45,729
got to be available to those that want

2593
01:56:44,979 --> 01:56:48,069
it and

2594
01:56:45,729 --> 01:56:50,679
it and not just those that can grow it

2595
01:56:48,069 --> 01:56:56,679
so I see it

2596
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:59,050
I love access it's fantastic it'll be

2597
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:02,530
great to see I hope your bubble hash in

2598
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:03,850
the store sent dry says Bob you gotta

2599
01:57:02,529 --> 01:57:05,590
start making it you know I'm working

2600
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:09,430
with Whistler technologies now and we're

2601
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:11,710
producing some large-scale reactors and

2602
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:13,750
linear actuators for washing large

2603
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:15,880
amounts of water hash at a time so

2604
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:18,369
that's a project I'm very excited about

2605
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:19,960
we got a nice 300 liter unit coming out

2606
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:22,619
you can check the check us out at

2607
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:27,039
Whistler tech Whistler technologies on

2608
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:30,130
Instagram they're got a three-count I'm

2609
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:32,170
greedy new cannabis variety for each of

2610
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:37,199
the resin heads will be the size of a

2611
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:39,880
large great feed builds all the

2612
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:41,800
sweetness out the window it's like you

2613
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:44,079
just like you don't even notice you

2614
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:46,750
could use the largest hold screen and

2615
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:48,130
it's gonna catch them but if that's wise

2616
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:51,220
you could pick them with a pair of

2617
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:52,000
tweezers I say you decide how these

2618
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:59,920
tweezers

2619
01:57:52,000 --> 01:58:01,988
you use more like a fishing net very

2620
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,720
nice partly depending on doing the hemp

2621
01:58:01,988 --> 01:58:06,809
extraction in Canada yeah you could get

2622
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:11,760
one of have you seen the machine that

2623
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:14,350
harvests cherries from cherry trees yes

2624
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,449
it's just like it goes under and it

2625
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:17,860
opens this big umbrella under the tree

2626
01:58:16,449 --> 01:58:20,800
and then it grabs the trunk and it

2627
01:58:17,859 --> 01:58:22,839
shakes the [ __ ] out of the tree and all

2628
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,420
the cherries fall into this piece and go

2629
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:28,569
down it's a we got to make those custom

2630
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:32,829
custom units for the new cultivar that

2631
01:58:28,569 --> 01:58:35,920
Sam's working on yes variety but when

2632
01:58:32,829 --> 01:58:39,340
you shake the tree maybe cannabis tree

2633
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:42,489
the chemical just breaks off immediately

2634
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:50,069
even in hot temperatures it falls down

2635
01:58:42,488 --> 01:58:53,069
into your net right be awesome I mean I

2636
01:58:50,069 --> 01:58:53,069
want

2637
01:58:56,050 --> 01:59:03,570
