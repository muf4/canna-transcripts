00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,080
Hey everybody, welcome back to the

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,278
Cannabis Journal Club. Yes, we took a

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,280
break for a little while, but we're

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,960
going to be coming back strong. Really

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,119
quick though, Dr. Allen is going to

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
share with us today one of the most

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:19,519
important discoveries in human history.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,320
Dr. Allen, go ahead.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,719
Thank you, Marcus.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,679
The discovery of the endocanabonoid

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,799
signaling system is the most important

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:34,280
discovery in human history and will save

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,200
more lives than the discovery in

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:42,280
application of sterile surgical

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,399
technique and the realization of germ

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,879
theory. And I'm a heart surgeon saying

17
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,359
that. And shout out to Ignaz Semlwise,

18
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,519
the Hungarian

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:56,000
physician who through the inc who

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,120
drastically cut the incident of perparal

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,320
fever by the use of hand disinfection in

22
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,158
obstitricle clinics, obstacle clinics.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,400
This is a big deal. If you listen to

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,200
what Dr. Allen just said, he's putting

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,478
it above

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,560
that. We're going to have more really

27
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,920
soon, so stay tuned for more Cannabis

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,799
Journal Club with Dr. David Allen and

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,799
me, the bubble man. Thanks for watching

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,799
everybody.
