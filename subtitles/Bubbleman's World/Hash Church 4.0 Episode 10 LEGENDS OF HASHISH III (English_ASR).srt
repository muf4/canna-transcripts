Legends of hash you actually were a

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,198
winner but there was another level of

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,558
winning which were the people who really

18
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,000
shined who brought the hashes that

19
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,000
really you know moved people whether it

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,600

right that's awesome um yeah so we're

52
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:29,958
from Oklahoma and uh we are skunk and

53
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,280
we're a legal hash maker here in in the

54
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,519
State on a licensed and uh been doing

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,000
this for since 2019 since it started and

56
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,480
uh yeah I mean I I guess we just I don't

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,439
know just been a crazy journey man I

58
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,959
don't know I learned a long time

59
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:50,079
ago

60
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,400
oh think did it did you say 2019 is when

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,280
you started uh that's when we started in

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,599
Oklahoma yeah as far because that's

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,400
pretty much when it uh right after it

64
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,598
went legal like the beginning of 2019 uh

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,080
at the time we were living in Colorado

66
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,199
and we we've lived here before and we

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,680
have family here and uh so as soon as

68
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,759
they legalized we wanted to be in the

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,640
legal market and so we made the jump and

70
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,120
started skunk

71
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:19,079
yeah started making hash in 20 was it

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,560
2019 2018 2018 the end of 2018 is when

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,280
we started making hash so what turned

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,479
you guys on to making hash like what

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,080
were you guys were just like we should

76
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,639
just start making

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,439
hash I mean I mean originally it was a

78
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,759
long time ago we learned to make bubble

79
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:35,000
has then it was like we did we're doing

80
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,719
the B we were dabbling in the BHO for a

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,360
while but the BHO I just uh it's it was

82
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,759
like a hard thing to be able to get into

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,120
like the legal market and then that's

84
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,878
when we found rosin watched a lot of

85
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,360
your episodes on actually how to make

86
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,878
you know the bubble has and all that

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,040
stuff and it's just been it's been crazy

88
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,158
ever since and I mean we used to pretty

89
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,400
much strictly just grow for like flower

90
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,199
but ever like we pretty much have only

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,200
switched over to rosin lately like all

92
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,759
of our everything that we do just

93
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,919
strictly goes to rosin right well I mean

94
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,239
listen it's

95
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,559
absolutely topnotch TPS

96
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,920
topnotch rosin I mean it's it's

97
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,680
absolutely beautiful and uh so you guys

98
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:20,519
took first and second in rosin and then

99
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,918
you also got a a a People's Choice Award

100
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,800

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,120
yeah that's awesome man no that's great

108
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,839
to see man I've uh I just it brought a

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,319
smile to my face to see that you guys

110
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,959
came so far and you know California

111
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,000
really whether people want to admit it

112
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,638
or not it's it's it's kind of like the

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,439
center of the Cannabis Universe you know

114
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,720
like everything if you want to be honest

115
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,399
with yourself and you want to see like

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,280
and you go back historically like

117
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,478
obviously I'm talking about our sort of

118
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:10,279
History you know going back to like the

119
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:13,360
1960s the 1970s and on obviously

120
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,679
cannabis and hashish has a much deeper

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,080
um history I mean even today I'm wearing

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,959
my classic shirt of these Lebanese women

123
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,120
doing dry sifting over a table this is

124
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,359
probably a lot longer ago than 1970 so

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,519
hashish has a deep and Rich history in

126
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,280
the world it goes back hundreds of years

127
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:34,879
if not a thousand plus years but for our

128
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,959
history you know for the California part

129
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,279
of things really since like the late 60s

130
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,079
early '70s they seem to be the first

131
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,159
ones to pull the males they seem to be

132
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,680
the first ones to cut the the flowering

133
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,800
period down they seem to be the first

134
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,959
ones to get into oil making and hash

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
making they beat they just they were the

136
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,399
first ones to really take this so

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,759
absolutely serious and have this

138
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,198
infectious love of the plant that I

139
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,240
think a lot of that spread out from Cali

140
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,720
I know it spread right up the Coast to

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,680
Vancouver uh we're not too different up

142
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,599
here in regards to our love of cannabis

143
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,000
and our passion of cannabis but you know

144
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,319
I'm sure too all those packs over the

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,279
years that got sent out of Cali across

146
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,000
the US that's the inspiration right like

147
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,839
you're literally inhaling California

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,319
into your lungs and we get affected by

149
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,839
it and so shout out to California um if

150
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,840
you guys want to hear something

151
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,359
absolutely [ __ ] batshit crazy I have

152
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,879
never been to

153
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,280
California what what I've never I've

154
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,159
never been to California man I I tried a

155
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,959
bunch of times in the 990s I bought a

156
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,120
bunch of Grateful Dead tickets on mail

157
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,799
order and you know tried to go across

158
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,240
the border and they would just deny me I

159
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,639
ended up giving these Grateful Dead

160
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,038
tickets away in the in the forest in

161
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,759
British Columbia because I just couldn't

162
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,038
get over the border and it happened time

163
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
and time again I remember when Jerry

164
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,878

around a little bit but I was just head

174
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,598
down trying to get through all the

175
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,918
entries to be real man yeah I don't know

176
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,000
everyone else felt but I tried to float

177
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,799
around a little bit but yo to be real it

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,160
was like first night I was like I gotta

179
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,918
focus on this and then someone told me

180
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,560
like you got to get in in at 8 a.m. I

181
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,519
was like yo I don't

182
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,280
know that's how we roll that's how we

183
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,839
look at hash look at hash church today

184
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,079
dude there's like four of us it's like

185
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,758
9:00 am people like what time is it at

186
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,318
I'm like dude I sent three emails it's

187
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,598
like 9:00 a.m. bro wake the [ __ ] up what

188
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,800
are you smoking over there and I I'm I'm

189
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:56,240
late so I apologize for that but uh but

190
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,960
no it was dope because I I ended up

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,800
leaving the event around like 10: on the

192
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,478
first night and then just going back to

193
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,280
my spot and just like focused on

194
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:06,639
everything and just like went through it

195
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,918
all to be honest and everyone was like

196
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,280
you're crazy why you going through

197
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,719
everything I'm like to be honest like I

198
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,918
have to I can't just smell because

199
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,639
things that smell great don't

200
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:17,839
necessarily taste great and things that

201
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,280
taste great don't necessarily smell

202
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:24,318
great etc etc and I think it's important

203
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,158
to give every single person that that

204
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,360
same moment that you would if it's your

205
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:32,399
own work um sure and it was it was cool

206
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,479
man it was good to go through it all it

207
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,799
was a lot of work but um it was

208
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,919
enjoyable it was cool it was good to be

209
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,158
in a focus setting for just my myself

210
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,439
because even having like just the open

211
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,480
air and then everyone else around me it

212
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,560
was tough to like really get into jars

213
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,000
and really appreciate it um the open air

214
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,199
so it was nice to be able to have both

215
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,839
um I definitely went back to jars that I

216
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
tried outside or or at the event and

217
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,160
then was like you know maybe I'll give

218
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,039
this a different score so um it was cool

219
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,719
man it was it was it's a unique thing

220
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,838
you know before Legends happened there

221
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,759
was no events like this there's so many

222
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,519
now I can't even count them all but

223
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,078
really when we first started Legends

224
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,039
over 20 years ago you know the idea of

225
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:19,120
hitting 20 to 30 high-end flavors in

226
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,559
like a two to four hour period was kind

227
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,000
of unheard of it didn't exist you know

228
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,399
and I'll tell you like uh people that I

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,799
know that are as hard of smokers as as

230
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,919
you could be were like finding their

231
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,759
levels of of limitations I mean everyone

232
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,679
but skunkman Sam because that guy has no

233
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,439
limitations whatsoever he's just a

234
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,519
Savage Maniac but uh for the rest of us

235
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,200
you know I be I find myself paling out

236
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,759
like out in front of the restaurant just

237
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,480
getting some air with some other Heavies

238
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,879
out out in front of the restaurant just

239
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,560
you know and kind of like looking like

240
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,838
really like are we pushing ourselves

241
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,719
that hard and keep in mind skunkman Sam

242
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,000
was dumping like two grams at a time

243
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,079
into an Afghan Hubbly Bubbly that we

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,799
were lighting with flames coming off of

245
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,078
this thing like a foot and a half each

246
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,120
time you lit it so you know you were

247
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,278
getting uh extremely extremely extremely

248
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,639
high had a good question from stinky

249
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,360
farms in the room for the uh for the Oki

250
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,039
group there that he wanted to know what

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,440
medium is your flower grown

252
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,480
in so we use a cocoa a highly amended

253
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Coco that's kind we kind of try to like

254
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,879
build a living soil almost out of a

255
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,800
cocoa and then throughout the life cycle

256
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,600
of the plant we continue to add natural

257
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,240
and organic inputs as well as microbes

258
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,839
um to try to keep since Coco doesn't

259
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,200
really hold on to very much of the

260
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,040
nutrients so we like to but we want to

261
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,440
create that rise of sphere and then

262
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,120
continue to add to that throughout the

263
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,360
life cycle dude I like where you're

264
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,639
coming from right now I really do that

265
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,120
micro rizosphere has an intelligence

266
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,039
that humans have not yet acquired this

267
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
[ __ ] thing knows exactly what the

268
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,319
plant needs when the plant needs it

269
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,440
where the plant needs it how the plant

270
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,480
needs it and we just have not I mean

271
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,279
don't get me wrong there are some

272
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,560
incredible folks out there that do some

273
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,559
incredible work in regards to their you

274
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,078
know feeding of the plant and and

275
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,199
getting the plant up to that level of

276
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,638
expression where it can be like a winner

277
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,560
of Legends of hash Papa burger it's uh

278
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,879
it's something special for sure I'm not

279
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:17,119
saying I haven't seen beautiful resin

280
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:19,639
grown in salts I just I've seen the

281
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,120
nicest resins I've ever seen have been

282
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,200
grown in uh living soil so I love the

283
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,399
idea of building that bridge and being

284
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,519
like well maybe we can't do the fully

285
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,679
fully I mean listen real fully living

286
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,759
soils generally isn't going to be in

287
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,879
pots it's going to be like out in a on a

288
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,919
field like where it's actually connected

289
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:41,159
to Nature and living but the more we can

290
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,159
bring that in to the scenario and you

291
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,559
know adding those microbes and and

292
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,679
creating that somewhat living soil maybe

293
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:51,359
we could call it somewhat living soil uh

294
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,199
it certainly shows in your results

295
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,320
because these flavors

296
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,680
are they're just man that's almost

297
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,959
like o almost like some some poooo Kaka

298
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,399

301
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,000
gonna wake and bake with some Papa

302
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:12,759

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,919

304
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,879
untouched man I don't know how you did

305

ex no I mean just not just being able to

307
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,120
not smoke it well it's because I'm a

308
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,519
macro photographer and what I really

309
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,519
wanted to do was I wanted to um I wanted

310

311
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,919
I managed to scope but I've just been

312
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,720
crushing them out and uh today I figured

313
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:40,120
is a great spot to uh to do some Crush

314
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,800
mode so I also want to say hi to Logan

00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,518
upon himself to take static sifting to

320
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,559
the next level working along with myself

321
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,000
with sble filtration and the uh the

322
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,198
static sifting machine Logan has some of

323
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,519
the most profound uh static sifting

324
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:05,639
photos of you know [ __ ] on it like

325

probably an hour away from you yeah oh

348
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,360
man you know back in the day and I don't

349
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,399
know how many of you know this when I

350
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,639
first moved here in like

351
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,559
96 I ended up going a couple years later

352
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,919
I was uh hitchhiking I wasn't

353
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,719
hitchhiking actually sorry I was driving

354
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,479
I hadn't this is the last time I've been

355
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,680
to America by the way 1998 I rented a

356
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,440
brand new car I cut my [ __ ] hair I

357
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,758
was like I'm just gonna I'm gonna look

358
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,399
I'm going to I'm going to get across the

359
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,320
border they had denied me at the border

360
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,320
so many times one time I bought every

361
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,278
single ticket to fish tour summer tour I

362
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,680
bought Miracle tickets to give away and

363
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,039
I got denied at the border it was 37

364
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,838
concert tickets just mine my buddy also

365
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,198
had 37 that all went to [ __ ] because we

366
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,720
bought them on my credit card and I

367
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,559
couldn't even give them away at the box

368
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,560
office to people because they needed my

369
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:52,359
credit card to pick them up so this was

370
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,758
my last attempt I'm like I'm going to go

371
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,600
see fish at the Gorge and I drive across

372
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,199
the border I make it mainly because fish

373
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,278
had just played in Vancouver and I was

374
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,799
in a [ __ ] circus of freaks who were

375
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,759
crossing the border and I probably

376
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,159
looked the least freaky at the time and

377
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,919
uh I ended up picking up a couple

378
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,879
hitchhikers and it was marble Slinger

379
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:14,078
and Jason Lee the glass blowers and uh

380
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,519
these guys ended up living in Bellingham

381
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,399
which was really close to Vancouver and

382
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,399
for many many years I had this

383
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,600
incredible connection to all these

384
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,240
amazing glass blowers that were right in

385
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,278
Bellingham and they would come up over

386
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
here and you know I saw Slinger the

387
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,278
other day I don't know if you guys know

388
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,680
marble Slinger the glass blower he was

389
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,519
writing on the High Times page shout out

390
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,120
to bubble man he gave me my first oil

391
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,318
dab he gave me my first full Mount

392
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,278
bubble hash dab turned me on to the

393
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:40,919
melts like it was just neat to see that

394
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,480
history and that was all because I

395
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,559
picked him up as a as a young scraggle

396
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,519
hitchhiker on his way to to fish tour

397
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,879
which was uh very close to probably

398
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,399
where you're at their cach what uh

399
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,399

400
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,399

401
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,078

entry um was with h papaya guava and

405
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,600
there was a little bit of a mixup on our

406
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,720
uh the brand name that had appeared so I

407
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,399
think like on the on the media that

408
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,879
Legend of hashish posted I think it said

409
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,958
dsar which is one of our teams and then

410
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,958
um but down in SoCal uh our team is C

411
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:35,159
and so that's kind of what the entu was

412
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:37,599
supposed to be under but

413
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,719

um well I'm loving the excitement that

443
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,839
Legends came off of I mean we had less

444
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,159
than a week of Legends being over before

445
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,359
Lorenzo from tpp's army shout out to

446
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,240
Lorenzo from turps army

447
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,479
uh hit us up and was like why don't we

448
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,240
do a Legends in Barcelona this year for

449
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,798
spannabis and we were like yeah why

450
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,200
don't we like [ __ ] I haven't done a

451
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,519
Legends of hash in Barcelona since

452
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,960
2018 so it sounds like we're going to be

453
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,000
doing a Legends of hash it won't be

454
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,519
obviously as intense as the one that

455
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,558
Addison did first of all I got to give

456
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,119
this guy an absolute massive shout out

457
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,839
um without Addison there would be no

458
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,599
Legends of hash in America uh it had

459
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,959
really only ever been in Vancouver

460
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,158
Amsterdam uh Jamaica

461
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,159
Barcelona I don't go to America so why

462
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,480
would it be in America right Addison hit

463
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,799
me up a couple years ago and was like

464
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,159
listen I want to bring Legends of hash

465
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,519
to America I think that it's time I

466
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,039
think that there's real value here and

467
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,960
the job that he did him and Meredith and

468
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,400
the whole

469
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,400
team building out all those Moroccan

470
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,798
style booths and just you know we lost

471
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,960
our venue 90 days before the event like

472
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,679
the guy was just like oh hey you know

473
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,679
how you put a $10,000 deposit down sorry

474
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,440
man like my landlords of evicting me and

475
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,360
so we were were like what do you like

476
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,798
what

477
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:07,439
like so we ended up like he had to find

478
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,359
that whole new venue he did so much that

479
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,200
I'll never be able to say enough uh

480
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,959
positive things about Addison and the

481
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,720
team down there um just a huge shout out

482
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
to him for everything that he did and it

483
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,079
looked and sounded like it was an

484
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,240
absolutely amazing time imagine the fomo

485
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,240
I had sitting up here in Canada not able

486
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
to go to Legends of hash now for the

487
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,919
third time I have applied for a Nexus

488
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,400
car so I sent Homeland Security all my

489
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,200
information exposed myself completely

490
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,960
which is fine cuz I don't uh break the

491
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,880
law or or do any shady [ __ ] and so I'm

492
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,120
hoping that I get this Nexus card by

493
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,760
next year and uh I will absolutely be in

494
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,599
Barcelona but I would also love to be in

495
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:51,879
Los Angeles next year uh well really

496
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,519
probably the year after because I think

497
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,880
we're doing it instead of December

498
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:59,359
around January but we'll see we'll see

499
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,360
where that all falls

500
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,959
yes I what about you Logan you want to

501
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,360
tell us a little bit about Logan's

502
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,360
journey and how you ended up now at

503
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:14,519
the Legends of hash for is this your

504
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:17,399
third year or second year second year

505
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,599
right Wolverine dabs you crushed it last

506
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,000
year too didn't

507
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:23,000
you yeah I mean I was the only

508
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,839
competitor so well that's what better

509
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,240
way to but here here's the thing so

510
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,558
here's the thing we can laugh about that

511
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,880
but think about that what you're really

512
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:35,038
saying was I was the only person with

513
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,760
full melt dry sift so that's that's

514
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,519
something different right when you say I

515
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,279
was the only competitor it kind of takes

516
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,599
away from me whenever I speak in a room

517
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:47,240
full of heads I always ask people who

518
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:49,959
here has flour and almost every hand

519
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:54,400
goes up then I'll ask who here has full

520
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,319
melt bubble and a few hands will go up

521
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,280
hopefully most people will have rosin

522
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:01,558
which is great that's amazing

523
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,678
but if you ask the room who here has

524
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:07,480
full melt dry sift it is [ __ ]

525
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,160
crickets and Tumble weeds you guys

526
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,079
probably know about up in Oklahoma

527
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:16,159
[Laughter]

528
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,480
there so so it's it's it's it's a real

529
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,480
thing to just have dry sift that can

530
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,679
melt into a liquid just to have it is

531
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,240
something to be said so I personally

532
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,679
thank you for showing up and being the

533
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,839
only person that showed up with it

534
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,440
because uh

535
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,199
otherwise no one would have had it and

536
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,038
that's uh that's that's never a good

537
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,000
thing so tell us a little bit about uh

538
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,798
your your journey into the static realm

539
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,599
and into producing uh producing the

540
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:47,278
fire well so essentially I started

541
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,158
making extracts when I was 17 so around

542
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:52,558
2013

543
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:55,440
2012 and I made I I started with like

544
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:59,278
hydrocarbon and then distillates I moved

545
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,759
on to doing isolates reformulating

546
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,558
reconstructing uh it's actually not

547
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,798
until

548
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,879
2021 that I started doing static um my

549
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:12,359
buddy Dylan had left me his screens when

550
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,400
he when he moved and he went to go work

551
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:16,119
for mock

552
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,759
Technologies and left me the screens and

553
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:21,079
he always told me like dry Si's like the

554
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,759
cream of the crop it's it's it's the

555
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:25,639
best of the best if you can get it it's

556
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,119
the best experience the best the best

557
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,200
high essentially right so I started

558
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,558
looking into videos on YouTube you know

559
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,080
and I I stumbled across your videos I

560
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,599
stumbled across several other videos so

561
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,839
the very first day I pulled the screens

562
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,319
out I cleaned them completely set up a

563
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:46,079
table I had YouTube going I had my

564
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:50,000
screens right there I had my material

565
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:52,639
and I stood there for 14 hours rubbing a

566
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,798
screen and listening to other people

567
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,799
talk about rubbing a screen and just

568
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,720
listening to the actual like screen

569
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,200
being rubbed so so that sound will

570
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,960
always kind of stick in my brain just i'

571
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,798
I've been around it for thousands of

572
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:11,159
hours now but it's it's absolutely

573
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:14,000
incredible um as soon as I started doing

574
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,000
dry sift and and I got it to the Purity

575
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,919
that I was able to achieve which I

576
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,480
consider to be around 98 99% Purity in

577
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:26,320
tricomb heads um as soon as I started

578
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,679
consuming that I I fell in love and I I

579
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,079
couldn't go back to anything else I

580
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,720
there's it it's it's absolutely perfect

581
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,918
in every way in my opinion simply

582
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,839
because the tpine content is right where

583
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,840
you want it it's sitting around four to

584
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,319
6% which is perfect for human

585
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:46,319
consumption tpin themselves are

586
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:49,000
hydrocarbons so anything above 6% can be

587
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,319
harmful for inhalation where did you

588
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,359
come up with that

589
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,119
number what the five to six% well just

590
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,079
that you're safe at four or five but

591
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,599
anything over cuz I'm interested in this

592
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:00,839
I've always like listen I've been been

593
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,918
smoking 8 to 10%

594
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:06,720
tpine uh for I I would say a good solid

595
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,840
10 years uh maybe more I still haven't

596
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,440
felt anything but I do believe and

597
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,079
especially after doing Blue River

598
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,080
extracts with Tony for all those years

599
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,079
that we absolutely reached the level

600
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:20,079
that was too much um we never smoked

601
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,158
that level for a long time I felt that

602
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,399
level personally and I I guess it's just

603
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,919
a subjective opinion I felt that was

604
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,120
above 10 you know around the 11 to 12 it

605
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,278
just stopped being enjoyable for me me

606
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:34,359
but like five six seven8 like even even

607
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,679
you know I think the hash we made

608
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,519
recently um no that's Pella oh this was

609
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,038
some rosin we made recently at my

610
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:46,119
facility in uh Canada here and it came

611
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:48,558
back 9 99.8% tpine

612
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:51,678
75.7%

613
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:55,519
thca um but it's it I I wonder where you

614
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,880
got that number very intelligent guy it

615
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,480
so it's pretty much just my opinion but

616
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,440
at the same time when you look at it

617
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,519
tpes are a hydrocarbon absolutely I've

618
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,720
said it a million times it's hard to

619
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,240
make solventless hash when it's loaded

620
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,519
up with hydrocarbons how about that

621
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,960
exactly it's pretty funny it's pretty

622
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:20,599
funny but I just I I find that my throat

623
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:24,120
personally reacts at anything above 6% I

624
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:27,119
just I start coughing and it's my throat

625
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,519
tightens up my chest tightens up I for

626
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:33,000
me it's the 6% Mark I don't like

627
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,200
consuming things above the 6% Mark so

628
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,200
here's a

629
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
question

630
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:43,278
um if you're using fresh frozen and

631
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,679
getting above 6% versus if you're using

632
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:49,240
dried and cured and getting above 6%

633
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,038
reducing the percentage of monot Turpin

634
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,759
that are present in the hash which

635
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,759
really for decades we always dried those

636
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,200
out we cured those out of flour because

637
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,398
they were harsh but now

638
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,480
I'll tell you life is so [ __ ] trippy

639
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,959
man here's a trip Colin so my buddy

640
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,079
sends he's like I want to send you some

641
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,399
patella so he sends me this beautiful

642
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,720
little piece of patella dude do you know

643
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:14,319
what this looks like to me Colin hash it

644
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,360
looks like bubble hash that didn't get

645
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,599
dried properly this was like back in the

646
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:22,278
original days we you'd get shamed for

647
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,879
this now it's the hottest thing I know

648
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:28,839
we are so [ __ ] as human beings like

649
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,320
what the [ __ ] that is I I guess it only

650
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,199
happens when you get older where you

651
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:36,158
start seeing these like 25 years Cycles

652
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,519
where you're like so like the thing that

653
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,480
everyone shamed everyone for and mocked

654
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,440
everyone I'll never forget someone

655
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,839
putting a piece of hash down like this

656
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,159
at Legends one year I think it was Nick

657
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,918
it just he he wasn't able to dry it on

658
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,120
time it was definitely nothing against

659
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,080
him and he put it in front of Rob and

660
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,959
Dave and they literally just like

661
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,038
grabbed it and like was like that one's

662
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,640
wet and like didn't even try it just

663
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,798
threw it to the side and I do understand

664
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,320
it because and and not not to say

665
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,759
patella smokes like it's wet it just

666
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,519
looks like it's wet and the reason I

667
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,599
would say that is because probably the

668
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,200
same thing that's happening with hash

669
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,278
that you leave water in which is that

670
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,880
water sort of makes its way out of the

671
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:22,240
hash eventually by foaming the hash up

672
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,159
patella because you're sealing it in a

673
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,839
in a turkey bag the tpin are doing the

674
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,399
same thing they have they're under

675
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:30,439
pressure and they're they're they're

676
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,678
traveling outward and as they travel

677
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,919
outward they foam up the hash and that's

678
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,000
what patella is guaranteed 100% for sure

679
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,600
but it totally looks like buttered wet

680
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,200
hash from the 90s and it did make me

681
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,158
chuckle it does yeah it's funny so I

682
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,960
because I said the same thing to myself

683
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,519
but then I moved on fast from that but

684
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,240
that thought but you know the one thing

685
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,880
I want to go back to what you brought up

686
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,519
about the dry cure versus the fresh

687
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,600
Frozen versus you know chemically what's

688
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,759
there I think it's a good call out

689
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,918
because it's it's also why some people

690
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:08,200
like you know certain types of herb over

691
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,840
others you know it's it's it has a lot

692
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,038
to do with the chemical profile and the

693
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:16,678
the you know the chemotype that that has

694
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,759
become over the life cycle of of its of

695
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,440
its time you know that the choices that

696
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,839
that particular grower that processor

697
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,360
made you know that's the relatable

698
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,720
aspect of the actual like the actual

699
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,359
medium you know so when I think about

700
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,679
that I think you're you're calling out a

701
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,879
really important aspect that I think is

702
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,919
yet to really come into Focus for us

703
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,080
like I think these are things I know you

704
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,159
and I and people like as well as Tony

705
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,398
and other a lot of us have had these

706
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,760
conversations together that hey yeah

707
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:47,079
like these are different products

708
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,480
because by by Design like chemically

709
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,119
like they're just different you know so

710
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,640
I think that's that's really important

711
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,319
it's why I think you know I've worked

712
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,000
with a toxicologist for the past three

713
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,558
years of my time you know doing what

714
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,599
I've been doing with formulation and

715
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,119
dude I've learned you know I'll just be

716
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,038
really candid with everyone I've learned

717
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:12,678
so much about you know how these CTIC

718
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:15,158
chemicals harm our bodies um and it's

719
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,919
you know literally cells dying you know

720
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,519
so from that point of view I think Mark

721
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,120
you're you're touching on something real

722
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,359
like the the upper echelon from fresh

723
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:27,038
frozen there's chemicals there that are

724
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:30,879
actually protecting our you know our

725
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,599
bodies versus ing them but there's also

726
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,880
not really a clear understanding of what

727
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,558
those are so um I think it's important

728
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,039
that dude I honestly feel like we're all

729
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:42,158
still in kindergarten it's like man

730
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:45,879
imagine imagine Sam he's been doing this

731
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,679
for like 40 to 50 years and he also

732
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,960
probably feels like he's in

733
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,759
kindergarten it's just an endless array

734
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,399
of like and then we discover something

735
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,440
like rosin how crazy is rosin or even

736
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,199
bubble hash like water has like how

737
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,080
crazy are those those two

738
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,000
things without those two things the face

739
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:08,158
of cannabis extracts would look so

740
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,319
different right now they uh they blow my

741
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,840
mind I was happy to be around for both

742
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,839
of them you know to be like right on the

743
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:17,398
ground floor for both of those things uh

744
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,000
I wasn't the first person to do it by

745
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,239
any means but I'll tell you like it

746
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,679
wasn't far after soil grown press that

747
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,120
bud on Instagram that he was on hash

748
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,919
Church episode 25 talk talking about

749
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,079
well you know we were we were making

750
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,240
flags with our full melt you know like

751
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:37,798
in the parchment and then you'd you know

752
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,558
zip it with your titanium Dabber and

753
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:42,759
then pull a flag and it would be a long

754
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,759
flag of hash he was like we were making

755
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,599
flags and I ranan out of hash and he's

756
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,720
like and I don't know why but I was just

757
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:50,319
like I just put a bud in the parchment

758
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,600
and I hit that with the hair

759
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,200
straightener instead of like doing this

760
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:57,038
to Hash to melt it he just randomly like

761
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,759
for no reason did it to a flower and

762
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,038
then he's like when I opened it up he

763
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,759
was like there was oil all around it and

764
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,038
it was like I think he was with his dad

765
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,558
or something but they were both tripping

766
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,278
out at the whole concept of this and I

767
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,678
mean my goodness thank thank thank

768
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:15,119
goodness that uh that it came to be

769
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,320
because

770
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:21,119
personally I I quite love Rosen I really

771
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:24,079
do enjoy it but what I like about it the

772
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:27,000
most is that kids of this generation now

773
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:29,240
when I say kids like you know 18 to 25

774
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,919
year old guys that are like just

775
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,359
experimenting for the first time they're

776
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:38,120
no longer blasting cans of butane like

777
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,759
in a very very dangerous environment

778
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:44,319
that literally could change their lives

779
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:47,359
forever forever like you have no idea

780
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,678
till you have kids what that means like

781
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:53,000
I just don't want my kids to tattoo

782
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,480
their face or or burn those are the two

783
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,960
things I'm like do whatever else you

784
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,639
want but just like keep your face your

785
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,319
face don't burn don't you know I grew up

786
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:03,798
with a father who was a fireman so we

787
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,359
took burning super serious I couldn't

788
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:08,240
believe how many people were willing to

789
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,759
risk their lives I'd see people posting

790
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,120
on Instagram like a girl in a bikini top

791
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:16,079
on a on a balcony blasting a can and in

792
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:19,319
the background you can see something

793
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,038
plugged into the wall outlet outside on

794
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:24,599
the deck with her and I'm just like oh

795
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,558
my God like that [ __ ] inside the wall is

796
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:28,959
just sparking like if you could shrink

797
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:32,678
down and go in the wall you'd see that

798
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,798
they spark continually and so and butane

799
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:40,080
is heavy so it sinks and it pools right

800
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,519
at the level of this oh my goodness you

801
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,480
know it's one thing to make a mistake

802
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,720
and hurt yourself but when you burn

803
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,639
yourself and now you're burnt for life

804
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,880
that's a real bummer so I love rosin for

805
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:53,638
that reason alone the fact that dudes

806
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,840
can just go grab a hair straightener and

807
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:59,158
like have a dab in the afternoon from a

808
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,199
flower that's

809
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,919
amazing big

810
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,159
supporter

811
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,880
100%

812
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,880
100 oh yeah I don't miss the open blast

813
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,000
days no exactly it should just be in a

814
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,879
lab with someone who's really good at it

815
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,200
and they understand all the Sops and

816
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,200
they have the C1 D1 room and like they

817
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,200
have degrees and chemistry like those

818
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,840
are good guys to like yeah yeah you guys

819
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,759
do that over there I'm not against the

820
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,398
thing about myself that I learned

821
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,359
especially after accidentally sort of

822
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:37,479
stumbling AC AC ac across water hash and

823
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:40,398
then really focusing and popularizing it

824
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,759
what really blew me away was just the

825
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,719
absolute and

826
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:48,798
complete different level of high that

827
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,360
you experienced compared to flow cuz I

828
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,599
had taken flour right to the ceiling I

829
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,479
was just on the ceiling just smoking so

830
00:33:53,599 --> 00:34:00,079
much flour that uh I'll be honest I was

831
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:04,639
coughing [ __ ] up I'd be like I haven't

832
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:07,359
coughed anything up in like 28 years and

833
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:07,359
I smoke a lot of

834
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:13,158
hash you don't cough you don't cough

835
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,519
stuff up when you just smoke

836
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:20,200
hash yeah I I think for me it's

837
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,239
like having the flavors around me are

838
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,279
more important I mean I do appreciate

839
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,918
the flower I mean I definitely get into

840
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,399
like when I'm feno hunting I definitely

841
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,480
try a lot of the different fos just so I

842
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,719
understand got to love the flow dude the

843
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,878
flow I haven't smoked flour in 28 years

844
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:42,918
but holy 20 good flower my man 20 crazy

845
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:46,039
no 24 years 24 years sorry um but I love

846
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,960
flour I just look at it as like it's my

847
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:51,279
little resin it's like the pizza box you

848
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,639
know it's brought me my pizza it's like

849
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,000
thank you oh pizza box but I don't eat

850
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,079
the pizza box I usually open it up and

851
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,639
take the pizza out so that's what I do I

852
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,079
just wash the resin or bounce the resin

853
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,838
or press the resin you know funny enough

854
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,280
my most watched video on my YouTube

855
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:12,599
channel is this me pressing a bunch of

856

859
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,680
pressed like a half pound it's just

860

884
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:27,920
don't really we don't really do stuff

885
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,318
like that out here it's more like I

886
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,680
don't know the vendor style popups so I

887
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:32,719
mean it's I don't know man it's just it

888
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,719
was all about the culture it was

889
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:39,118
beautiful I mean the way everything was

890
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:41,679
set up the um yeah man it was just best

891
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,280
event that we've ever been to personally

892
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,239
the way the judging was set up I like

893
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,960
that too yeah you know that everybody

894
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,559
just gotta kind of Judge everybody

895
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,880
else's stuff you couldn't necessarily

896
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,960
like buy judge kits or anything like

897
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,640
that you know what I mean it was just

898
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,079
Community you know what I mean was there

899
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,559
go up to the hash bar and grab some

900
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,800
flavors

901
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,440
yeah awesome that was awesome man the

902
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,920
food was awesome and the people could

903
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,599
experience also the you know the judge

904
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,159
kits but through the hash bar you know

905
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,800
and not so they could experience what we

906
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,960
were experiencing at the same time that

907
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,280
was that's awesome that that's not yeah

908
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,599
that's nothing I've experienced before

909
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,240
so that was really cool yeah you usually

910
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,200
can't try you know the entries that are

911
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,159
sitting there or whatever you you need

912
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,719
to

913
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,719
experience it's the beauty of California

914
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,720
man it's pretty cool was pretty cool it

915
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,838
was a it was definitely a gauntlet

916
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,399
though trying to get through all that

917
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:38,078
hash man that's for

918
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:40,400
sure it definitely uh it puts you it

919
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,839
shows you where your boundaries are and

920
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,240
it's an interesting um you know listen

921
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:46,159
this happened by accident when we

922
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:50,239
started Legends of hash it had nothing

923
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:52,199
to do with a competition it was like Sam

924
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,279
sort of was like wanted to turn it into

925
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,639
a competition because for me what I said

926
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,720
was I would sell tickets

927
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,920
to people who showed me a beautiful

928
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,239
piece of hash so I knew that they were

929
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,119
on a level of appreciation of hash that

930
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,679
they actually had one in their pocket I

931
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,119
didn't take any I didn't you know even

932
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,399
smoke any I just look at it feel it

933
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,119
smell it and be like yeah yeah you get

934
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,960
to come to Legends of hash you get to

935
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,318
buy a ticket to Legends of hash because

936
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,358
another thing about Legends was we never

937
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,239
it wasn't about ever comping tickets

938
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:27,960
everyone paid to be there and it was uh

939
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:29,679
the original one well

940
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,760
was very very different in the sense

941
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,960
that you couldn't promote your business

942
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,480
you couldn't promote yourself um you

943
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,920
weren't allowed to have a cell phone

944
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,480
present at the event there was no

945
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,559
cameras allowed uh there was really no

946
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,838
talking about it on social media or

947
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:45,920
anything like that because most of that

948
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,159
[ __ ] didn't exist but um yeah it was

949
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,200
different you know it was uh a lot of

950
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,199
old school hash Smugglers went to the

951
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:54,399
original ones and they just uh they were

952
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:58,078
serious dudes and they couldn't be they

953
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,599
they could not be a a photo Tak of them

954
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,160
so we made it very strict that you

955
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,280
couldn't bring cameras and in fact if

956
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,799
you had a cell phone even out in your

957
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,640
hand you you would be removed from the

958
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,640
premises so it was a fairly strict uh

959
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:17,279
cell phone dash camera rule at Legends

960
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:20,279
um and and no no promotions whatsoever

961
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,720
so then at that point Sam was like wow

962
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,880
like everyone in this room all 50 people

963
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:28,919
have nice hash he's like we should do

964
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,079
like a a little contest and then all of

965
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,400
a sudden you know like back then you

966
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,880
have to understand too like skunkman Sam

967
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,559
was like the snuff alpus like people

968
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,680
only really knew about him through

969
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,358
stories they didn't know that he was a

970
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:43,078
real person or until you know this was

971
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:47,078
way before hash Church obviously that

972
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,079
exposed a lot of people to him but um he

973
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,480
was low-key and people just didn't know

974
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:56,079
who he was and this was also after you

975
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,440
know a lot of them were after um 2008

976
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,119
which was when I posted the photo of his

977
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,358
dry sift for the first time which and I

978
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,079
don't know if you guys ever saw that

979
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,400
picture but it was uh it was a game

980
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,400
changer I labeled it

981
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:16,560
99.99999% pure heads skunkman Sam secret

982
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:18,118
Tech or whatever on IC M and uh yeah

983
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,239
it's just like pure heads just looks

984
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,680
like caviar it's uh

985
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:26,439
actually yeah there's one behind me but

986
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,358
you kind of can't see it it's like right

987
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:32,639
there it's just pure heads pure

988
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:35,559
beautiful heads and

989
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:38,000
uh everyone had wanted to smoke when I

990
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,239
first smoked his hash it was the

991
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,800
strongest experience I had ever

992
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,239
experienced in my entire life that [ __ ]

993
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,760
rocked me so

994
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,639
hard it brought all these stories to

995
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,599
life that Rob had been telling me in

996
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,679
previous years about how high he would

997
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,200
leave skunkman Sam's house and I'd be

998
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:58,239
like well how high could you really be

999
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,799
man and I just didn't know but [ __ ] I I

1000
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,239
figured it out at one point I left there

1001
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,519
so high I'm quite certain I was walking

1002
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,919
like a one-legged

1003
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:11,000
man like it was it was over the top I

1004
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,599
haven't been that high actually in in

1005
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,920
probably 20 years more than 20 years I

1006
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,599
think those are highs that just come

1007
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,440
around maybe a couple of times in a

1008
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,079
lifetime like when you're in grade eight

1009
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,400
and you first hit some

1010
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,000
dabs and then apparently when

1011
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,318
you're that's how leges was for me that

1012
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,559
night man holy I haven't been that high

1013
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:35,599
in so long in so long or ever I don't

1014
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,838
know about um I don't I don't know it

1015
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,720
was definitely like the first days maybe

1016
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,358
never yeah maybe never I mean we were

1017
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,399
that's all I'm saying it's a potential

1018
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:47,279
candidate that's enough oh yeah oh yeah

1019
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,240
for sure by far some the most out smoke

1020
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,760
that's for sure yeah lots of dabs lots

1021
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,759
of dab lots of good dabs though yeah

1022
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,680
like really good

1023
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,880
dabs like absolutely spectacular I think

1024
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,318
it's a part of the culture that I'd like

1025
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,480
to see grow I'd like to see more people

1026
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,599
have access I know that you know and the

1027
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,639
one thing about Legends it is very much

1028
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,039
professional what I'd also love to see

1029
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:15,118
legends become is to be able to bring

1030
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:17,679
other people to witness the culture

1031
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,039
without feeling alienated and being able

1032
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:23,480
to take like micro dabs you know get

1033
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:27,358
served like microscopic dabs without any

1034
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,679
shaming and weird ego I take bigger dabs

1035
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,039
this [ __ ] guy's dad you know like

1036
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,759
that whole vibe and it does exist like

1037
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,279
it exists

1038
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,079
100% um it would be nice to bring in

1039
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,480
other people to witness this part of the

1040
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:45,359
culture um and and just you

1041
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,039
know be a part of it but without being

1042
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:51,159
like like frighteningly high you know

1043
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,960
like you have to really it would be a

1044
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:56,039
fraction of a pin head just a a little

1045
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,559
bit of the flavor you know they're not

1046
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,400
even going to blow anything but they're

1047
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,000
going to feel a little flavor and they

1048
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,079
obviously have to smoke weed I usually

1049
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,358
can give a micro dab and make it feel

1050
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,960
like you've taken one puff on a joint

1051
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,799
you know that's a very small amount of

1052
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,400
resin but if they want to feel like they

1053
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,720
smoke the whole joint well that's a

1054
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,440
little bit more and if you want to feel

1055
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,118
like you smoked five joints well here

1056
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,639
you go

1057
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,358
bam but we got to learn how to do that I

1058
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,279
think it's an important part of dabbing

1059
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:27,920
culture I also think that D Nail's new

1060
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,160
unit yes is

1061
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,039
absolutely going to help change the way

1062
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:36,879
we look at dabbing because the torch is

1063
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,318
very sketchy and it's not indoor

1064
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,039
friendly uh and it's probably never

1065
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:43,838
going to happen dnails are better you

1066
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:47,119
know the coils and stuff and that new

1067
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:49,759
induction disorderly uh um conducts new

1068
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,240
little coil Banger heater but the D but

1069
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,960
the denail one that have you guys seen

1070
00:43:52,239 --> 00:44:00,439
that thing oh yeah oh my god dude it is

1071
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:02,679
so beads me too I love it the denail

1072
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,480
looks like even the next step above that

1073
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:09,679
tsv is so loud yeah I ordered the

1074
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,679
XL yeah as soon as I saw it as soon as I

1075
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,960
saw it I had to get it I was just like

1076
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,000
ah this will make everything I've got

1077
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,440
I've got a pre-order list if you guys if

1078
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,159
anyone isn't on one I can put you on my

1079
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,280
pre-order list because I'm going to be

1080
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,639
I'm going to be selling them Brian I've

1081
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,760
been working with him for years and uh

1082
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:30,440
he just does such great work he really

1083
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:33,559
Tak this [ __ ] seriously and uh I mean I

1084
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,800
love my TPU V I just had I didn't like

1085
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,200
the sound of it on all the time it's

1086
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,559
annoying and it's a very white noise I

1087
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:42,000
just thought you know and I was just

1088
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,000
talking to Brian one day from Dil about

1089
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,599
it and I guess he had been working on it

1090
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,440
I had no idea but I was like dude if you

1091
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,160
could just create a TPU veed style you

1092
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,159
know vaporizer and he'd already been

1093
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:55,480
working on it of course like as if I'm

1094
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,799
giving this guy advice and uh I swear to

1095
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,240
God he showed me this like three days

1096
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,119
later later after I mentioned it that's

1097
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,759
why I was like how could you how did you

1098
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,200
create that in three days he's like dude

1099
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,520
I've been working on it for months you

1100
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,558
just happened to say something three

1101
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:13,800
days ago I was like oh all right indu

1102
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,839
like nice job indux did a good job on

1103
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,720
theirs too the bird that's really oh

1104
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,159
yeah dude listen that that that's next

1105
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,838
level that's something completely

1106
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:27,558
different this is like you could do um

1107
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:30,000
real dab bars like a tool like this

1108
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,640
brings dab bars into the equation it's

1109
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,159
protected you're less likely to burn

1110
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:37,078
yourself even those outer coils with the

1111
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,960
cable are sketch as [ __ ] um this thing

1112
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,318
could hit the ground and not be burning

1113
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,280
anyone or hurting anyone this is the

1114
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:46,838
future of dab bars um where it's no

1115
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,920
sound it's Sleek you just got people

1116
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:50,960
raising and lowering them [ __ ] some will

1117
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,680
probably put these little things on a on

1118
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,280
a little air pre compressor with a

1119
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:58,919
little pedal on the floor so you can

1120
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,920
make them go up and down with your

1121
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:05,319
like I'm I'm a dreamer man I'm a dreamer

1122
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,280
I see vapor bars are coming and vapor

1123
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:08,759
bars are not going to have joints smoked

1124
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,359
in them they're not going to have

1125
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,319
anything burned in them they're going to

1126
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:17,838
be like gummies drinks and vaporization

1127
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:19,759
of flowers and extracts that's it yeah

1128
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,799
at least here in Canada I don't know

1129
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,359
what's going to happen in the in the US

1130
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,000
but definitely the future it'll be the

1131
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:29,440
same way in New York like as we turn

1132
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,358
stuff on there I'll tell you it'll

1133
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,480
really open up the door for cannabis

1134
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:36,759
people as the cigar culture is like

1135
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,880
dying cannabis people come in and buy

1136
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,760
those grandfathered cigar shops where

1137
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,559
you could invite people to smoke joints

1138
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,599
indoors and hang out with one another

1139
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,720
like that would also be very popular

1140
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:51,440
[ __ ] private like cannabis

1141
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,558
afficionados group where you just go and

1142
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,679
burn

1143
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,680
Gaggers on on leather furniture with the

1144
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,679
boys

1145
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,519
that's [ __ ] funny man I need to open

1146
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:03,879
one of

1147
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,519
those well you know what the license is

1148
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,119
hard to get because in most places now

1149
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,400
you can't smoke indoors even with the

1150
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,880
big HEPA system or whatever um but the

1151
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,079
grandfathered ones in most cities are

1152
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,680
the cigar shops there's there's still

1153
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:21,000
clubs where people go and literally

1154
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,679
smoke cigars just in the open air around

1155
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,358
each other I can't imagine how

1156
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:27,719
unenjoyable that is personally being in

1157
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:31,480
like a room with like 20 dudes all just

1158
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:33,199
chuffing away hard on cigars but I could

1159
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,440
I could hang out in the room getting

1160
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,358
joint smoked for a little while that

1161
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,639
hares my throat out too though I won't

1162
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,960
lie yeah that's a whole different kind

1163
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:43,078
of hot box were there a lot of joints

1164
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,079
smoked at

1165
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:50,440
Legends no I I had a big shout out to to

1166
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,880
Jay happy monkey crew I had Jay there he

Joint smokers you know there was a

1172
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,078
couple couple hash holes the in

1173
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,480
inventing room guy gave us a couple hash

1174
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,280
holes to try those were delicious oh

1175
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,318
yeah yeah Ron our buddy Ron had some

1176
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,640
hash holes with him from sensey

1177
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:22,159
mag oh yeah Ron okay yeah yeah oh Ron

1178
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:25,118
that's how we got uh turoa I guess Ron

1179
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:28,759
was the one that told him about us so oh

1180
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,760
I'm glad he did yeah

1181
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,480
man yeah dude yeah there there's a lot

1182
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,760
of good hash out here in Oklahoma I

1183
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,960
think you know I know we got our

1184
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,520
problems there's a lot of over

1185
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,800
production of low quality stuff out here

1186
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,159
but there's also a lot of good hash out

1187
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,800
here just because of the level of

1188
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:49,000
competition and how easy it was to get

1189
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,559
into it in the beginning uh it's just

1190
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,838
pushed us all to I mean makes have fire

1191
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,359
yeah we're really proud of what Oklahoma

1192
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,519
is yeah

1193
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,400
we're glad that we got to share that

1194
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,960
with people so thank you guys for that

1195
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,680
us

1196
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,720
too it's all about good hash man we're

1197
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:11,440
yeah that's it man that is absolutely it

1198
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:13,358
it's uh it's just a nice thing to see

1199
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,039
the culture of hash continuing and

1200
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:18,078
that's what Legends tries to do it tries

1201
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:20,039
to pay homage to the to the roots to the

1202
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,839
old school although I I really you know

1203
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:25,239
I had someone recently who's in

1204
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:27,679
California he's actually in New York too

1205
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,679
Colin he's in California he's partnered

1206
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:32,558
up with some pretty well-known people in

1207
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,118
the industry and he's doing like an uh

1208
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,559
like a traditional hash he's like

1209
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:38,119
there's people that just still love

1210
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:40,920
traditional hash you know the old school

1211
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:43,920
gold seal whatever you want to call it

1212
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,680
and um so he's he's talking about this

1213
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,880
hash and how he wants to kind of get it

1214
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,000
out to the world and promote it and he

1215
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,680
was like I was sorry to not see more of

1216
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,280
that at Legends cuz he was at Legends

1217
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,480
and I said well listen man like Legends

1218
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,040
isn't like what we make it it's what you

1219
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,079
make it so if you want more uh

1220
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,519
traditional hash of course we'd love cuz

1221
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,559
what he said was he said it was an

1222
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,920
amazing event but he said I felt like it

1223
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,119
was just one section that we were

1224
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,039
visiting of the event you know the

1225
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,960
dabbers that everyone was dabbing he

1226
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,519
said he was like it was a bit cracky

1227
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,199
there was a lot of blow torches he's

1228
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:20,199
just from a different culture right he's

1229
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:22,318
not he's not torching his so when you

1230
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:25,558
don't Tor blow torch your bangers like

1231
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,880
it is to see a whole like 150 people

1232
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:30,200
doing that like

1233
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,519
it's hardcore so he was like I'd like to

1234
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:35,960
see a traditional hash I'm like well

1235
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:38,519
then get your friends from different

1236
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,480
traditional hash companies to bring in

1237
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,358
traditional hash and show us so that we

1238
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,318
can of course we'd love to have a

1239
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:47,119
traditional hash section where you could

1240
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,519
come and see the hash of old and learn

1241
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,760
about how it was made and meet people

1242
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:55,400
from those cultures that are continuing

1243
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,280
those um you know those lineages on I I

1244
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,519
love the idea of Legends always paying

1245
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,720
homage to that but legends is also the

1246
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:07,280
curation of the of the present of what

1247
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:10,480
is at the upper echelons of hash and

1248
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,960
oils and all the equipment that goes

1249
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,599
behind it from the bangers to the dab

1250
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,000
rights to the cardas and the puff

1251
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,119
Co which is also I have to give both

1252
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,920
those companies a shout out ca and

1253
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:28,079
puffco um focus V for really normalizing

1254
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,880
dabbing you know their commercials are

1255
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,640
almost so generic in the sense of the

1256
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,798
way you just see like the straightest

1257
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,598
looking people you know they're painting

1258
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:39,318
this different narrative which will like

1259
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:41,798
for me I want that bridge I love our

1260
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:43,679
culture i and that's not going anywhere

1261
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:46,519
but I also love the idea of building a

1262
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:49,039
bridge so people can come and experience

1263
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,119
our culture and see what it is because

1264
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,519
it's a pretty cool culture especially if

1265
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,920
you love you know smoking hash and

1266
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,000
getting high you don't have to get

1267
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,880
annihilated you don't have to go to

1268
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,199
Legends and smoke you know 27 G but it's

1269
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,880
[ __ ] fun if you

1270
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,239
do yeah the second day I ran into a guy

1271
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,880
who I know is trying to do a traditional

1272
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,439
hash brand he said the exact same thing

1273
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,240
to me he's like what's up with like

1274
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,000
everyone just using blowtorches like I

1275
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:20,199
don't see any like

1276
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,519
traditional hash at all and you know I

1277
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:25,838
think that's to your point it's all in

1278
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:29,759
which we make it because you're you're

1279
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:33,039
just offering us a platform to submit

1280
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,160
things so if predominantly everyone

1281
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,880
starts submitting a traditional hash

1282
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:41,039
maybe that merits a traditional hash

1283
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,119
category I don't

1284
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:46,440
know maybe we're we're looking at maybe

1285
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,599
we're all trying to group things

1286
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,079
together in ways that perhaps it's not

1287
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,200
not the right way to look at it I don't

1288
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,798
know just asking the question you

1289
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:58,679
know because the things have you know

1290
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,880
honestly evolves so much you know like

1291
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:03,078
think about you know we were just talk

1292
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,920
touching on the whole fact that like if

1293
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,559
someone came with like a

1294
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,599
Sheen to the party with you know a brick

1295
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:13,079
Sheen like that we'd be like yeah that's

1296
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:16,880
wet like we're not going to even try

1297
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:20,640
that to now we look for CU visual cues

1298
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,160
like that to signify how good it is you

1299
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,039
know I know that's super tripped out

1300
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,679
dude and it's different though too right

1301
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:30,000
cuz like the thing about it was I guess

1302
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:32,598
what I learned to you know to connect to

1303
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,838
the wet hash was that foamy like

1304
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:36,920
expanded so I learned to hate that

1305
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:38,519
because when I'd smoke it when I dab it

1306
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,760
it would just be like it would [ __ ] up

1307
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:42,280
the hit so I was like [ __ ] this is not

1308
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,040
like being and that was my own fault

1309
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,119
like when I first made bubble I just

1310
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,000
like finger pressing wet bubble in my

1311
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:49,798
hand showing the whole world how to do

1312
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,400
it like that and then it literally took

1313
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:56,239
me like five to 10 years of being like

1314
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,200
listen I [ __ ] up stop doing this you

1315
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,759
know and people just kept doing it for

1316
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:02,759
years like just rolling up wet bubble

1317
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,040
and it it hurt my soul so badly I'm like

1318
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,160
wow like one [ __ ] mistake I make

1319
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,279
while sharing this information and I got

1320
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:11,440
to pay this karmic debt for the next

1321
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,240
five to 10 [ __ ] years and then people

1322
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,960
be like hey dude check out my hash crack

1323
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,358
this ball of hash under my nose and I'd

1324
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,599
just be like oh my God it's like totally

1325
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:22,920
gone bad it's like this [ __ ] guy

1326
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:26,400
rolled up wet hash it's just like it

1327
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:29,480
sells like a like a wet sock in a dirty

1328
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,880
to I'm like bro and it was my own like

1329
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,440
it was like the universe just like kept

1330
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,358
showing it to me and showing it to me

1331
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,039
and showing it to me and I was like wow

1332
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:41,119
like when you do educate people you

1333
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,440
should be careful that you educate

1334
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,519
yourself first I did start a little

1335
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,480
early probably should have just done the

1336
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,920
process for four or five years and then

1337
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,440
started teaching but instead I taught

1338
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,440
everyone my mistakes for four or five

1339
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,440
years and then I learned them myself

1340
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,760
well there he

1341
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,480
is but there was I think there was a

1342
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,720
time on the forums that you know things

1343
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,039
were traveling at at a really fast pace

1344
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,838
because I remember when we met on the

1345
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,838
forums we were weird just think like

1346
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,920
threads happened fast people were trying

1347
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:18,639
stuff I mean and we were mainly washing

1348
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:21,200
in smaller bag systems then um because

1349
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:23,879
our plant counts were so small I mean

1350
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:26,038
just was a totally different time you

1351
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,240
know like things moved at such a slow

1352
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:29,000
pace

1353
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:32,679
so like yeah your information that came

1354
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,440
out was like it just like happened until

1355
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:37,919
it didn't dude all I know is I was like

1356
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,400
the only [ __ ] with f out out of

1357
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,318
every single person I always met ever

1358
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,240
and then all the people I met after with

1359
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:48,159
full melt were all people that I turned

1360
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:49,759
on made hash with and got you know like

1361
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:52,078
turned them on to the information so it

1362
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,839
was what an incredible blessing to be

1363
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,599
allowed to be a part of that because I'm

1364
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,599
telling you I showed I personally for

1365
00:55:56,599 --> 00:56:00,480
sure showed hundreds if not over a

1366
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,599
thousand people in person and I'll never

1367
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,679
forget pulling that bag you know the

1368
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,240
gold bag would be the first bag that

1369
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:09,199
like a a chunk would come out and

1370
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:11,679
people's I called it the eyebrow raise I

1371
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,558
just see people like this and then they

1372
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:17,358
go their eyes would go up and it was

1373
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,480
like that's right [ __ ] that's

1374
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:22,159
right because before that when you're

1375
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,760
pouring the water in the icing into the

1376
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:27,719
bucket no one can wrap their head around

1377
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,680
that they're like you [ __ ] idiot like

1378
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:32,000
you're not supposed to do that that is

1379
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:35,639
the stupidest [ __ ] thing you could do

1380
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,559
to cured weat welcome Addison by the way

1381
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:40,598
I hope you're feeling better brother

1382
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:42,798
yeah a little better got a I guess I got

1383
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:44,440
like a it's from my diet it's from

1384
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,920
eating carnivore and all that stuff all

1385
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,639
the time and I guess um you can get like

1386
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,000
these pockets in your intestine because

1387
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:54,159
I don't like salad I don't like [ __ ]

1388
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,838
grain or any of that stuff so now I got

1389
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:58,719
those guys e you need some Fiber bro yes

1390
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:00,239
so now they're like the the doctor's

1391
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:03,519
just like look some people need to eat

1392
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:06,519
kale and you're one of them so listen I

1393
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:09,358
will say this kale can be delicious when

1394
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:11,519
when prepared properly and it's bitter

1395
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,318
when it's not prepared properly you need

1396
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:16,038
to get some like awesome like kale

1397
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:17,558
Caesar salad or something oh yeah no I

1398
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:19,440
got it all figured out it's it's like I

1399
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:21,359
know what it is and I kind of walk that

1400
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,798
fine line because I like that diet so

1401
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:26,199
much but this is the first time that I

1402
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:28,119
ever got like a this acute Di

1403
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:31,239
verticulitis which is you know you can

1404
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:33,480
get these like Pockets I guess in your

1405
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:36,439
intestine so but nothing major it's it's

1406
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,960
minor it's like a a liquid diet for a

1407
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,200
couple days and then so mostly like bone

1408
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,519
broth and electrolytes and stuff like

1409
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:45,480
that for like two or three days and then

1410
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,639
uh everything's good but yeah nothing

1411
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,559
major well we were giving you much

1412
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:51,279
praise earlier brother just talking

1413
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,839
about the Legends talking about we

1414
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,839
haven't heard from cashier yet he'll

1415
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:56,679
kind of probably tell us his story next

1416
00:57:54,838 --> 00:58:00,000
but we've been talking to to the

1417
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:03,199
Oklahoma guys and in great detail of

1418
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,400
their journey and how it was uh Rob I

1419
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:08,000
guess from sensey mag that turned you on

1420
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:12,760

1422
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,240
Ron's a good dude Ron was real helpful

1423
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:17,598
with uh when I reached out to him you

1424
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,159
know because we wanted to have makers

1425
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,960
from more places you know and especially

1426
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,118
in places where we feel like they've

1427
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,880
established you know they've done a good

1428
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,599
enough job in there you know you get in

1429
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,880
this little pocket and you're hunt and

1430
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:32,359
you've got the you know the the the the

1431
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,400
blessing of the state and you're doing

1432
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:35,719
all this stuff and you know if you're in

1433
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,440
your little pocket and you're away from

1434
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:38,679
everybody else there's stuff that just

1435
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,280
kind of builds over there and I think

1436
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:42,358
Oklahoma and especially the guys at

1437
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,480
skunk are just proof of that that you

1438
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:45,000
know guys are going to get a hold of

1439
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,920
genetics they're gonna get a hold of

1440
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,798
tech they're they're looking at all the

1441
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,960
same stuff and just because they're in a

1442
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:52,079
place you know that's not where you are

1443
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,960
which because they're in Oklahoma or

1444
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,400
they're somewhere else um doesn't mean

1445
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,318
they're not making fire and I think they

1446
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,599
proved that so that's uh you know same

1447
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:01,480
with Ace lure I think my my favorite

1448
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,640
entry of the entire event was number

1449
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,519
three from Ace lure which I think was

1450
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:08,440
like a galato or something um but yeah

1451
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:11,318
it's just you know and asur is from St

1452
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,240
Louis Missouri of all places so um yeah

1453
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:15,558
it was cool this year I learned that

1454
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:17,118
from the bags dude every because people

1455
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:19,280
be like where's the best hash and I'm

1456
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,599
like wherever I am dude because I carry

1457
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,599
these bags with me and I roll and I make

1458
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,359
cash wherever I am and of course people

1459
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,400
are growing dank weed everywhere you

1460
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,719
just have to find those people cuz what

1461
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,000
people do is they go somewhere and

1462
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:33,679
they're like yeah I went to so and so

1463
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,920
[ __ ] weed sucked and I'll be like

1464
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,480
correction your ability to find good

1465
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,838
weed sucked and therefore you found bad

1466
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:44,599
weed but um everywhere has great stuff

1467
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:47,038
and uh all you have to do is you know

1468
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:48,680
make the hash press the hash doesn't

1469
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,720
matter where you are if you're if you've

1470
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:53,118
got if you got a hold of those

1471
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,879
genetics which I mean you can buy them

1472
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,519
from seed banks it's not like you need

1473
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,160
some special clone or or something

1474
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:01,280
gifted down from the [ __ ] Gods can

1475
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:03,318
pull fenos right out of these bag bags

1476
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,839
of seed that you can buy it's it's a

1477
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:07,880
beautiful thing yeah I think you need

1478
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:09,519
knowledge you need the network and you

1479
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,240
just need the desire to do it and I

1480
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,679
think that's everyone we everyone we met

1481
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:14,959
and everyone we meet has all those

1482
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,440
things you know they're not people

1483
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,440
always think people always think

1484
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,880
knowledge comes from the mentor it's

1485
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:23,519
like no wisdom comes from the mentor

1486
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,119
knowledge comes from your

1487
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:27,759
mistakes yep

1488
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:29,039
[ __ ] it up like you were saying earlier

1489
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,240
it was so

1490
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,520
counterintuitive to take material and

1491
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:35,000
add it with ice and water it was so

1492
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,960
counterintuitive it was like what are

1493
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,880
you [ __ ] doing and then even the dry

1494
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,760
sift methods are kind of

1495
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,039
counterintuitive so I think it's you

1496
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,119
know when you walk people down that

1497
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,640
direction and they see it um it's crazy

1498
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,440
now because there just seems to be so

1499
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:49,480
much everywhere and then even for guys

1500
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,480
like us which you know we understand the

1501
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,559
microns we understand um you know what

1502
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,280
they're pulling and as the rosin and the

1503
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,039
hash world is getting more and more

1504
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,240
mature meaning that you know more

1505
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,960
consumers are having access to it you're

1506
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:06,759
watching we're watching consumers get

1507
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:10,280
duped in a way um you know because they

1508
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:13,920
are they are happy to and unknowingly

1509
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:16,240
gonna smoke on some 45u or some 25u or a

1510
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,159
mix of those other microns and they're

1511
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,719
going to be like hey this is hash and

1512
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:20,920
we're going to be like when we clean the

1513
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:22,879
Banger we're gonna be like what the

1514
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,280
hell's going on here so there's that

1515
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,559
little learning curve that's kind of

1516
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,000
there and I think we watched it here

1517
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,640
inali California over the last three

1518
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,239
years four years where people were like

1519
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:33,078
well I can get rosin for much cheaper

1520
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:35,399
and you're like oh cool get it for

1521
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:36,559
cheaper and then then they start to get

1522
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,720
it from where they're getting it and

1523
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,160
then they realize like oh this is this

1524
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:42,159
is like the bottom of the barrel stuff

1525
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:43,558
the stuff that I tried with them with

1526
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,239
those guys in that little sesh that

1527
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:48,319
shit's crazy how do I get that and it's

1528
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:51,358
like oh well that's

1529
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:53,679
this yeah you pay for it there's levels

1530
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,078
to it for sure there's levels to it for

1531
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,838
sure you know and that's the beautiful

1532
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:59,359
thing about ha it's uh it's Dynamic and

1533
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,838
there's people who still love their

1534
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,679
traditional hashes and pressing it

1535
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:06,000
feeling it and crumbling it up and

1536
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:08,118
smoking it in joints I I got to admit I

1537
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,079
don't smoke a lot of it but when I smell

1538
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:13,640
it in the air I'm like oh [ __ ] you're

1539
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:16,000
smoking some of that hash just reminds

1540
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:18,639
me of you know being younger and I did

1541
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,440
smoke a lot of hash back in those days

1542
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,719
well it's a journey and you see them on

1543
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,400
the path and you're like oh you're on

1544
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,038
the path [ __ ] cool and then you go

1545
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,680
back to your your house and you're like

1546
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:29,278
I got my timer I got my [ __ ] temp

1547
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,278
thing I got my dunk dank I got the

1548
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:33,719
slurpers I got this it's like get yeah

1549
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:36,079
but we're sociopaths dude that's we're

1550
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:38,199
trou we're definitely

1551
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,278
broken we the hey I want to hear from

1552
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:42,519
cash a so uh how what was Legends like

1553
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:46,400
for you

1554
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:50,798
brother you know uh half our team was

1555
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:54,119
coming straight from MJ biscon which was

1556
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:56,000
uh you know what an absolutely Dynamic

1557
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:58,519
like what so that's like you went to

1558
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,039
chadon and then you went to

1559
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:02,759
Legends

1560
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:04,520
yeah completely different experiences

1561
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:08,160
obviously I think you did it in the

1562
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:10,880
right order definitely um we ran through

1563
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,879
MJ biscon as fast as you possibly can

1564
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,599
and you know met the people that we've

1565
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,880
done business with and all that kind of

1566
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:20,359
stuff and um it's wild you know going

1567
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,240
through these events for five 10 15

1568
01:03:20,358 --> 01:03:23,519
years you run into the same people and

1569
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,038
they're like oh you're not with this

1570
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,838
company then you used to be with these

1571
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:30,278
guys so like you you know for us we end

1572
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,599
up just talking to people that we know

1573
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:34,159
um but it you know so that was cool um

1574
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:37,640
but it was a

1575
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:39,798
challenge uh you know kind of changing

1576
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:43,358
over to Legends of hashish and I think

1577
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:47,199
uh I uh I think we probably

1578
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:49,558
underestimated how uh how many you know

1579
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:51,960
entries we were going to have to uh go

1580
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:55,240
through um and I don't think we uh

1581
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,798
prepared adequately for that um yeah but

1582
01:03:55,239 --> 01:04:00,239
let me tell you there is no adequate

1583
01:03:57,798 --> 01:04:02,759
preparation for that actually it's

1584
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,479
psychotic and it just is what it is it's

1585
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,520
like having kids where people are like

1586
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,639
oh I wish I could have prepared more for

1587
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:10,559
having kids it's like you can't you just

1588
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,838
have them and and they're psychotic and

1589
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,640
then you just figure it out and and so

1590
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:18,480
is Legends of hash it's that makes no

1591
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:20,199
sense but you know I do want to say um

1592
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,079
you know I we've done a lot of events

1593
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:26,679
over the years and um this was a very

1594
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:30,119
very cool a very special kind of

1595
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:32,598
experience um and you know uh you know

1596
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:34,680
we feel super honored to be a part of it

1597
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:37,119
and um I just think there's a lot of

1598
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:39,759
like little details that were really

1599
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:42,480
really cool that you know you just don't

1600
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,400
really see at events like you know the

1601
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,519

him and like everyone else there I I

1624
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,160
thought that was really really cool and

1625
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,798
that was kind of like right in the

1626
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:45,639
middle um dude he's kind of like the

1627
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,599
skunkman Sam in a sense you know cuz Sam

1628
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:49,358
was always that very same thing at the

1629
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,559
early Legends people were just like oh

1630
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:54,440
my God that's him he's right there and

1631
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,640
he's just kind of a Crazy Character

1632
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,679
right he's just like oh [ __ ] there's

1633
01:05:55,639 --> 01:06:00,078
it's just you know and it's also Sam was

1634
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,919
like kept to himself he didn't go out a

1635
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,000
lot he was like always head down in the

1636
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,519
greenhouse kind of thing and so to just

1637
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
suddenly see him absolutely like a kid

1638
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:13,440
in a [ __ ] candy store just chuffing

1639
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,559
hash I suspect Scott was a similar way

1640
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,358
since I've seen both I have to admit

1641
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:20,680
that they are very alike in some ways

1642
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:22,639
where like Scott Scott's you know

1643
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:24,199
everyone is just giving him hash and

1644
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:25,920
talking to him so he's kind of like oh

1645
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:27,759
what do you got and oh what's over here

1646
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,000
so he's just having so much fun but he

1647
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,079
did tell me this year um he's like

1648
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,798
listen we need to spread out this

1649
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,599
judging because this was too much he's

1650
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,920
like this and I'm like if it's too much

1651
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:40,680
for you I'll definitely take your advice

1652
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,960
because I know he I've seen him run

1653
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:45,078
gauntlets on like 18 Rigs and just but

1654
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,760
you we did have the intention of doing

1655
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:49,640
that it just didn't work out and it

1656
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:52,880
wasn't anything on us it was uh it was

1657
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:55,000
difficult to get the entries on time to

1658
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,039
be able to offer them a week early to

1659
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,039
everyone and then and I'll explain the

1660
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,799
issue so what happened was when I built

1661
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,278
the

1662
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:04,400
timeline just like a goofball I didn't

1663
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:06,400
realize that when I was going to be

1664
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,278
making that point of contact with all of

1665
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,720
the makers it was during harvest season

1666
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:13,559
so what we're going to do now to adjust

1667
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:15,639
is um and I guess we could announce it

1668
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,720
here we're going to move Legends to

1669
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:21,358
January um for LA and then that way we

1670
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,759
kind of have our own space and when we

1671
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:25,318
timeline it back um everything we're

1672
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,480
going to need to do with those makers is

1673
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:29,038
going to going to be in December uh

1674
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,760
which is a lot better for us and then

1675
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,278
that way we'll be able to get the Ros

1676
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,559
and judging done at home um and all

1677
01:07:33,278 --> 01:07:36,400
those things that we planned on doing it

1678
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,880
was my it was my fault because I

1679
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,960
obviously was doing so much I didn't

1680
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,000
realize where it fell um but now we'll

1681
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,639
be able to do it in January which means

1682
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,199
that for Legends

1683
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:50,798
2024 there will not be a Los Angeles

1684
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:54,118
Legends 2024 it'll be in uh January of

1685
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:57,199
2025 so I just want to say one thing

1686
01:07:54,119 --> 01:08:00,278
instead of a swag bag I think Legends of

1687
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:03,759
hash gives away 90u bags that's what we

1688
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:06,480
should call our swag bag let's call the

1689
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,839
on the 90u bag people like is

1690
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,760
interesting those [ __ ] at

1691
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:13,639
Legends don't [ __ ] around and I thought

1692
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:18,079
there was gonna be a 90u from you there

1693
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:19,920
Marcus uh a nice 44 gallon for everyone

1694
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:23,079
dude I'm telling you I got a represent

1695
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:25,560
with bubble bags next year way more 100%

1696
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:27,439
I hope to be there well not next year

1697
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,000
but the year after you know what he said

1698
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:31,838
January close to next year the way that

1699
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,479
the gift bags work out and because I

1700
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:35,719
have this hair across my ass with gift

1701
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:37,278
bags I don't I go to these events and

1702
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:38,679
they give you this gift bag and you're L

1703
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,880
you literally most of the time you just

1704
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:43,560
want to hand it back um it's a it's a

1705
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,719
really low ball attempt at marketing

1706
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,719
it's it's kind of like a it's kind of

1707
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:49,480
just like a I I look at it as like a

1708
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:50,960
distraction it's like oh here's a weird

1709
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:52,238
bag that you get to carry around with a

1710
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,439
bunch of [ __ ] that you probably don't

1711
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:57,479
want and we kept our we kept our

1712
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:00,198
agreement to the companies because we

1713
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:02,358
haphazardly promoted them so with us

1714
01:09:00,198 --> 01:09:04,879
it's more of um we really take a long

1715
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:06,400
time to make sure that each company that

1716
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,838
we're choosing and selecting and working

1717
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,960
with does have a product that's going to

1718
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:12,198
be helpful useful something we haven't

1719
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,158
seen before um and then we do our own

1720
01:09:12,198 --> 01:09:16,039
stuff like uh like you know Zar was

1721
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:19,439
talking about like we have the we did

1722
01:09:16,039 --> 01:09:22,319
the little uh tool stands which came

1723
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:25,960
from which came from like eating dinner

1724
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:28,039
at we were eating dinner at a spot in LA

1725
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,600
and then when you leave there you flip

1726
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,519
over your little Chopstick stand and it

1727
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,640
says I stole this from whatever the name

1728
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,520
of the restaurant is and I was like oh

1729
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,640
this is a [ __ ] great idea and I I

1730
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,920
took it and I used it as a a dab stand

1731
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,960
for a while so then I was like this is a

1732
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,960
great thing and it kind of puts us on

1733
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,640
their on their table they see our logo

1734
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,000
um so it just kind of a great idea and

1735
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,000
they're they're inexpensive they're not

1736
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,359
super costly uh but that we put in the

1737
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,800
sonicators we put in the um the magic

1738
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:58,679
carpets which we did with um with some

1739
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,679
people from out of country so yeah we're

1740
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:02,359
super stoked man those bags yeah those

1741
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:04,840
bags come together in a really cool way

1742
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:07,960
and then of course the sponsors like 710

1743
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,520
labs and davock and chillet and all

1744
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,319
these guys that come forward um and and

1745
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,400
make sure that we have the products DNA

1746
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:15,840
and and Crockett and you know when

1747
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,198
you're getting that much stuff in your

1748
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,520
gift bag like I think we we we

1749
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:22,039
deconstructed a gift bag and I think

1750
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,840
we're going to release um in some some

1751
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:25,319
we're going to send out some uh some

1752
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,840
content we'll put up some content that

1753
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:28,439
will show like what the actual value of

1754
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,560
the gift bags is but I think we're going

1755
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:31,879
to now refer to them as the 90u bags

1756
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,640
which I think is great

1757
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:38,920

buddy Dan who he's got these 3D printers

1783
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,840

you like put your Banger into and it

1785

plugs in through a

1786
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:47,279
USB and then it like dries your Banger

1787
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,198
after you dunk it in the

1788
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:52,238
alcohol what that's crazy yeah the

1789
01:11:50,198 --> 01:11:53,799
little Banger dryer that's that's it

1790
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,399
right there little Banger dryer I have

1791
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:58,880
to have these inserts because I've got

1792
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:01,399
little 10 10 mil JPS there but uh what a

1793
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,199
cool little product that is that's

1794
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:06,158
beautiful so much Innovation we were

1795
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:08,638
messing around with um when we were

1796
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:10,920
looking at the dab dab tool stands and

1797
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:13,319
some of the other stuff uh we found

1798
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,319
these hearing aid

1799
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:17,079
dryers that you that were these little

1800
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:19,399
tiny hearing aid dryers and like you pop

1801
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:20,800
the top open and it was mesh basket

1802
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:22,439
inside and you would drop your heate in

1803
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,880
there and close it and it would had a

1804
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:25,960
fan on the bottom that would blow up

1805
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,159
through it so we were sourcing these

1806
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,719
things but I kept breaking them and I

1807
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:31,079
was like I could not find a good source

1808
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:32,960
for them because I want because a banger

1809
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:34,079
would fit in there with your stuff and

1810
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,960
you could close it up and it would just

1811
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,760
blow air through it but well that's

1812
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:41,399
basically what this is doing yeah that's

1813
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,719
a great looking product so um cash how

1814
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:47,479

1848
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,480
actually was looking last night I was

1851
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:15,638
got to try that so that was really nice

1852
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,359
man very smooth thank you so that's

1853
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:20,079
different than what I gave you is

1854
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:23,639
actually different than what I won with

1855
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:25,880
but okay it's still in the same we what

1856
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:28,520
I would consider the G same gas category

1857
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,079
but still has some like some

1858
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,920
complexities there I don't know like

1859
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,439
whenever you try it

1860
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:39,719
like different T at different tents it's

1861
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:42,079
like gassy but also like tropical floral

1862
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:45,039
smooth it's like I don't know it's it's

1863
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:47,559
interesting but um yeah I appreciate it

1864
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:50,198
man in the vent like just kind of going

1865
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:52,600
on that a minute was was amazing for so

1866
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:54,678
many reasons you know from looking at

1867
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,360
from last year to this year last year

1868
01:14:54,679 --> 01:15:00,119
was great but this year I felt like had

1869
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:03,039
a better layout and the hash bar was

1870
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:06,479
really focused and it just had a really

1871
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:09,600
good flow to it and you know it was good

1872
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:12,000
to see Don and Aaron of course and um I

1873
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,280
picked up their the pack that they had

1874
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,639
they they hooked me up on that and got

1875
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:19,000
some other other single packs from those

1876
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:20,639
them as well stoked we're really stoked

1877
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,840
to put that into the into the green

1878
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:25,920
houses this

1879
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,639
summer um but overall I mean it just I

1880
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,279
think I thought the judging was much

1881
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:32,279
better this year I felt like it it

1882
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:34,399
really was really honest like it just

1883
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:36,960
you didn't you just had no idea like I

1884
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:38,439
to be honest like completely forgot I

1885
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,679
didn't even know what our number was I

1886
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:44,198
had to call my cousin I was like yo like

1887
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,920
what number are we um and that was even

1888
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:48,678
after the fact because I didn't even

1889
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,800
know um it was good it was good to go

1890
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:54,158
through it and just kind of be

1891
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,400
methodical and and really give everybody

1892
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:59,359
the time of a day but I also agree with

1893
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:02,679
Scott um and I understand the

1894
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:06,279
circumstances it was uh I you know I can

1895

01:16:55,279 --> 01:17:00,840
and like he's really Leading The Way

1918
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:02,479
with like day two we woke up and he had

1919
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,159
a video cut from day one that was

1920
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:06,319
running that morning so it's like he's

1921
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:07,839
really on top of it yeah shout out to

1922
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:09,840
those guys man they they do a really

1923
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,199
good job and I think you know there are

1924
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,039
certain things this year that we tried

1925
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:15,839
to really narrow down on and focus on

1926
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:18,479
one of them was the hash bar the other

1927
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,719
was um the layout so it's good to hear

1928
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:23,119
people um recognizing some of that stuff

1929
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:25,319
and it's you know that it's it's not

1930
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:27,039
hard to be prepared and to lay it all

1931
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:29,799
out I think we we spent a little more

1932
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:32,560
this year on production and then the

1933
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,239
actual like team of producing the event

1934
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,520
so I think that paid off a lot for us

1935
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:38,519
too and it gave us the ability to to put

1936
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,360
on an event that we had all the boxes

1937
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,080
checked but one of the major components

1938
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:45,479
that made it so great was that we really

1939
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:47,679
didn't have any makers that were late or

1940
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:49,799
that were holding us up or that were you

1941
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:51,679
know causing problems and and you know

1942
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,159
that'll happen sometimes because you got

1943
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,119
Logistics and you got so many different

1944
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:57,960
moving Parts but for this year it was I

1945
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:59,760
mean didn't have any issues and then

1946
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,960
after the event didn't have a single

1947
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,600
maker have any issues or complaints um

1948
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,600
you know we had one little hiccup where

1949
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:09,679
the judges boxes that we ordered uh

1950
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,760
because there was an issue with Printing

1951
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,560
and they weren't uh honest about it it

1952
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,520
actually didn't arrive on time so we're

1953
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:17,000
shipping those out now but it gives us

1954
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,520
like that little Comet Tail to be able

1955
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,600
to reach back out and send those to you

1956
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:23,320
guys as well as the uh the new product

1957
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,400
uh Carta is launching a brand new

1958
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:27,759
product that they're going to send out

1959
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:30,279
to each one of the judges so gives us a

1960
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,719
little touch point after the event and

1961
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:34,479
sometimes you can turn those lemons in

1962
01:18:31,719 --> 01:18:37,039
lemonade make it good um so it was uh

1963
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:40,198
but best year yet man even talking to

1964
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:43,238
Meredith even talking to Golden um we

1965
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:45,119
had you know just great sponsors great

1966
01:18:43,238 --> 01:18:46,959
makers everything worked out the guests

1967
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,639
were amazing everyone you know didn't

1968
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,960
have any issues any trouble so um I

1969
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:53,359
think we might have bent the gate a

1970
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,039
little bit with h with some mistakes

1971
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:56,799
that we made but you know we'll pay for

1972
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:59,000
that but uh everything else man it was

1973
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,679
really uh you know from all the work

1974
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,198
that we put into it when it all works

1975
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:03,960
out and when everyone has a blast it's

1976
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:06,000
just a hugest payoff ever so I got to

1977
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,198
thank everyone um you know for coming

1978
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,840
out and doing it and there's nothing

1979
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,039
better than um tormenting your friends

1980
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,800
with hash you know there's nothing

1981
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:15,158
better than uh putting the boys through

1982
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,159
the gauntlet or the ringer and you know

1983

2012
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:24,919
friend Farms who uh is going to be

2013
01:20:22,119 --> 01:20:26,599
working with us in New York so um oh

2014
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,800
nice yeah we're still is that is that

2015
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,440
who put in the material for you guys so

2016
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,199
we had part of the material we grew

2017
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:34,759
ourselves which we have our own living

2018
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:38,198
soil beds and then Brian contributed

2019
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:42,199
some material that we we grew or he grew

2020
01:20:38,198 --> 01:20:44,119
indoor living soil um called gas mask

2021
01:20:42,198 --> 01:20:48,198
and gas mask was a part of that we

2022
01:20:44,119 --> 01:20:51,559
blended with two other uh really one

2023
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:55,719
other batch that we had it was like like

2024
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:58,920
I'd say it was a a quarter of of the

2025
01:20:55,719 --> 01:21:01,800
batch was was the gas mask so it was uh

2026
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:04,880
it adds it's a nice it's a really good

2027
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:07,960
varietal Brian's a super talented grower

2028
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,880
it's the material was phenomenal we just

2029
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,960
yeah it just was meant to be so and it's

2030
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:15,400
funny because I was telling Marcus like

2031
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:17,480
we did a batch just with Brian that was

2032
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:19,238
meant for it and then when we watched it

2033
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:22,919
I called Brian I was like this just

2034
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:25,919
isn't it like for whatever reason and so

2035
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:28,639
we went back in and uh my cousin and I

2036
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,840
kind of kind of came up with this so big

2037
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:34,000
shout out to Z the rest of the team

2038
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,760
great work great work man yeah no we

2039
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,399
appreciate it man it was uh it was one

2040
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,199
of those situations where I think just

2041
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,359
putting it all together and at all

2042
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:43,599
working out was perfect and you know

2043
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:46,158
I've talked to a bunch of people

2044
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,560
afterward that are um you know some

2045
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:50,638
people want to compare Legends to other

2046
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,360
events and or compare other events to

2047
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,319
other events and I think it's it's kind

2048
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:56,158
of a slippery slope because why would

2049
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:57,759
you do that when you can attend both

2050
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:59,359
events and have a great time they might

2051
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,079
be different speeds they might be at

2052
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:03,759
different places they might have

2053
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:05,639
different formats but um you know you

2054
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,079
you get out of it what you put into it

2055
01:22:05,639 --> 01:22:09,440
and if you go into it with a good

2056
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:11,600
attitude and you go into it with uh you

2057
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:13,799
know with a desire to meet people and

2058
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,600
have fun and and rip some turps and have

2059
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,679
a blast they're all awesome you know

2060
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,000
it's it's afterward uh or or the people

2061
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:22,199
that I think don't enjoy themselves that

2062
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,760
want to criticize and and try to draw

2063
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:25,198
these dividing lines and it's the same

2064
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,920
thing in politics right now it's the

2065
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:29,198
same thing you know in wars and other

2066
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,480
[ __ ] everyone wants you to kind of

2067
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:33,759
decide and it's like we're not we don't

2068
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:36,759
have that issue we're not politics we're

2069
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,280
not any of those things we're hash so

2070
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,719
just go and have fun and smoke hash and

2071
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:41,639
have a great time whether it's at ego

2072
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,198
whether it's at Legends whether it's at

2073
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:45,560
the hash ball whether it's at a local

2074
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:46,919

you know they had a great event looks

2090
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:17,279

because I know how much goes into it I

2095
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:27,158
know how much how many things go wrong

2096
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:28,760
and then how you deal with those things

2097
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:29,839
are really going to determine whether or

2098
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:32,159
not you're going to have a successful

2099
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:35,360

2100
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:37,599
so I appre apprciate you doing these

2101
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:39,799
events because you know there was a

2102
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,760
period of time there for everyone that

2103
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,920
you know we're like [ __ ] this will never

happen again you know and so uh you know

2105
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:48,719
big props to you and and everyone else

2106
01:23:47,158 --> 01:23:51,920
throwing these events again because you

2107
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:54,439
know the culture you know there was

2108
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,440
definitely uh you know a fear that would

2109
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:59,479
really kind of go to the Wayside and

2110
01:23:56,439 --> 01:24:02,359
especially um you know in in California

2111
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:04,959
so um yeah stoked that uh these are

2112
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:06,599
happening again yeah or to or that it

2113
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,800
goes to like profiteers like people who

2114
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,840
are just putting on minimal

2115
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,199
infrastructure and you know there's card

2116
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,119
T there's card tables and shit's just

2117
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:16,759
kind of more like a sesh which which

2118
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:18,840
still has its place a sesh is a great

2119
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,320
place to go and get you know find some

2120
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:23,159
deals and find some great stuff and see

2121
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:25,198
who you like but um we try to provide

2122
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:28,279
something that just had

2123
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:30,279
every corner every turn would impress us

2124
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:31,559
would make us kind of you know say oh

2125
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:32,840
this is nice you know we've stayed in

2126
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,080
nice hotels and we've been to Great

2127
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:36,679
events and we've done those things so um

2128
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:39,319
the food is something that I think I

2129
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:43,039
wanted to ask you guys about because I I

2130
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:45,679
I personally get to set the entire menu

2131
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:47,560
um so that's a lot of stuff that I like

2132
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:50,840
and that's probably why I have this uh

2133
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,159
this gut issue but um I just wanted to

2134
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,400
get some feedback from you guys about

2135
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:56,679
the food what did you think about the

2136
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:56,679
food what did you think about that

2137
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:07,118
stuff uh I'll go uh first I guess um I

2138
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:11,279
think the food was really good however I

2139
01:25:07,118 --> 01:25:13,519
don't think there um it could have been

2140
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:17,118
food that okay I'll put it to you like

2141
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:20,080
this if there was like a fire Taco

2142
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:23,359
Stand um I would have been totally down

2143
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:26,519
for that you know um I'm a simple guy so

2144
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:29,439
maybe um some of those flavors were more

2145
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:33,400
than um I wanted to challenge my body

2146
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:35,519
with at that event um but yeah I think

2147
01:25:33,399 --> 01:25:40,039
um I think it was good you know bunch of

2148
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:42,440
my team had some um yeah I think if you

2149
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:45,880
if I was to have a a

2150
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:48,960
suggestion um and this is a logistical

2151
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:51,039
nightmare uh before I before I say it is

2152
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,719
like you know how can you get maybe one

2153
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:55,000
or two or three food trucks with

2154
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:58,639
different Cuisines so get appeal to like

2155
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,840
different people um I think you know if

2156
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:04,079
that's something it logistically that's

2157
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:06,079
a nightmare but um

2158
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:08,760
yeah yeah just personally that's

2159
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:12,118
something I would never do I think the

2160
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,800
the food truck kind of creates a A vibe

2161
01:26:12,118 --> 01:26:15,279
that's definitely I mean you're standing

2162
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,639
there and there's a there's three or

2163
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:19,079
four lines now and there's you know the

2164
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:20,679
food truck can run out of food and you

2165
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:22,238
have less control so it's when you're

2166
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:24,679
delivering that much food to somebody

2167
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:25,799
you have to have you have to understand

2168
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,760
all of it and what's going to go out

2169
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,800
there so food trucks I think are dope

2170
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,360
that's just something that I don't think

2171
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,119
we'll ever do but um and there's also a

2172
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:35,719
reason for the menu the reason for the

2173
01:26:33,118 --> 01:26:38,118
menu is also Marcus originally did it in

2174
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:40,118
a leevan restaurant so he wanted that's

2175
01:26:38,118 --> 01:26:42,198
Mar that's the Marcus half is like to

2176
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:44,198
have Lebanese food and to pick a great

2177
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:46,000
restaurant so Legends started in a

2178
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:48,399
Lebanese restaurant so we want to have

2179
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,800
the Lebanese food and then I bring in

2180
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:52,399
from my childhood of skateboarding and

2181
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,480
being an [ __ ] in Boston we used to go

2182
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:57,599
to these um we' go to these big brunches

2183
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:59,319
at these huge hotels and there'd be like

2184
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,239
20 of us and we'd be all roasted and we

2185
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:02,799
go in there and just like eat and then

2186
01:27:01,238 --> 01:27:04,959
take a bunch of croissant with us and

2187
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,679
leave and that was kind of part of

2188
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,158
that's my addition to it is like well

2189
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:10,000
brunch is the greatest thing ever if

2190
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:13,198
you're high um so that's kind of how the

2191
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,600
two menus come together um but Taco I

2192
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:16,559
just got to think about taco trucks

2193
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:18,239
where I've been to too many events and

2194
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,199
there's like a hamburger truck and a

2195
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:23,118
taco truck and it just kind of I feel

2196
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,678
like uh it's not like a sit down thing

2197
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:27,799
to eat and we want people to have like

2198
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,199
sit down and enjoy hash and sit down and

2199
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,679
enjoy food um so that's kind of why we

2200
01:27:30,198 --> 01:27:35,000
go in that direction but I think we

2201
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:36,440
can we can of course figure out things

2202
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,880
that are a little more simple but that's

2203
01:27:36,439 --> 01:27:42,039
why we do if you went there's a fruit

2204
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:44,079
bar that has cut fruit the whole time it

2205
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:46,039
has drinks it has tea it has water it's

2206
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,679
kind of like a little Oasis that just

2207
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:50,238
has more simple stuff to kind of keep

2208
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,760
you um recharged and charged while

2209
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,638
you're doing the event so we could

2210
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,079
probably add and if you looked over

2211
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:56,639
there there were like a lot of finger

2212
01:27:55,079 --> 01:27:59,039
foods and stuff that was going out on

2213
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,719
that other side um over by the hash bar

2214
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,880
we had like a massive section that we

2215
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:04,399
were serving other food at so I

2216
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,159
definitely missed that I don't know how

2217
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:09,000
I mean I was in a in a in a cloud of

2218
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:10,960
smoke roasted yeah well that's where the

2219
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,439
definitely didn't see that so the same

2220
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,319
spot that we had all the drinks so

2221
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:16,519
there's a massive drink bar that was all

2222
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:19,000
to the left of the hash bar and that

2223
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:22,560
whole entire wall after the gzy art dis

2224
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,359
display there was a huge you know spread

2225
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,960
there that had all the fruit all the

2226
01:28:24,359 --> 01:28:28,319
pastries all the cookies and snacks and

2227
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,639
all that stuff was served out there all

2228
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:30,920
day and there was little finger food and

2229
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:33,800
stuff like that that was on that table

2230
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:37,639
as well so yeah I think maybe some user

2231
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:39,679
eror on my on my end a not figuring out

2232
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:41,760
where that was we kind of like did you

2233
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,840
drink anything did you drink anything

2234
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,880
while you were there uh like uh alcohol

2235
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,119
wise no like all the because we had all

2236
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,600
the beverages like there a massive

2237
01:28:48,118 --> 01:28:51,599
beverage station that was to the left of

2238
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:55,000
the bar I wasn't sure if you were able

2239
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:58,239
to man I don't know how uh I could have

2240
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:01,840
possibly not seen that but I have an

2241
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:01,839
idea of how how you didn't

2242
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:09,000
see so much

2243
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:11,600
drink yeah I

2244
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,238
mean after Vegas I don't think I drank

2245
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,639
for a week oh man that could be rough

2246
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:18,399
what was uh tell you what oh go ahead

2247
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,840
Marcus well no I was just going to say

2248
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:21,039
in regards to your last conversation I

2249
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,520
was like you know the way you could

2250
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:26,000
marry uh what you had replied to him

2251
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:29,119
Addison regards to Leia like the whole

2252
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,719
food truck uh lineup idea is a bummer

2253
01:29:29,118 --> 01:29:33,000
like the food trucks are great the

2254
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:35,600
lineup part is a bummer but imagine that

2255
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,359
you had a taco truck or two and you had

2256
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,280
them parked out back but no one was

2257
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:41,799
going up to those trucks they were just

2258
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:43,599
hammering out tacos Non-Stop and filling

2259
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,880
trays that were then brought into the

2260
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,520
place put down just like they would be

2261
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,480
any of the other food and people just

2262
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,320
grab them that way so there's always

2263
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:54,959
solutions to these things is all I'm

2264
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:57,759
saying and uh I agree with uh both of

2265
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,960
what you said I you know yes Legends of

2266
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:03,119
hashish had Lebanese food it was in a

2267
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:05,279
Lebanese restaurant for 13 plus years

2268
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:08,399
that being said it certainly won't have

2269
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:10,319
to be Lebanese food forever we could we

2270
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:13,679
could revisit different menus and

2271
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:15,840
whatnot and uh like Addison said take in

2272
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,520
intake people's opinions it would be

2273
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,800
great to send out a little questionnaire

2274
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,280
about this Addison and see what kind of

2275
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:23,679
numbers we could get in regards to all

2276
01:30:22,279 --> 01:30:25,719
all of the things like how did you like

2277
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,600
the cereal bar what did you think of the

2278
01:30:25,719 --> 01:30:30,079
the you know the little Oasis what did

2279
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,480
you think of you know the the the menu

2280
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:32,880
what did you think of the hash bar all

2281
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:34,638
these different things I told them

2282
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,719
earlier before you came in I'd love to

2283
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:38,239
hear some positive things that you have

2284
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,920
to say about Legends but we'd love to

2285
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,559
hear anything that we can help fix it as

2286
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,079
well because there's oh yeah you that's

2287
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,119
really where the real value is it's nice

2288
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:47,719
to get like oh let's all Pat Addison on

2289
01:30:46,118 --> 01:30:49,719
his back because he [ __ ] crushed it

2290
01:30:47,719 --> 01:30:51,039
so hard but it's also nice to be like

2291
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:52,520
hey dude if we just do this a little

2292
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:53,960
differently it could even we want to

2293
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,639
make it better every year is BAS

2294
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,279
basically where I'm coming from and

2295
01:30:55,639 --> 01:30:59,039
that's how we did it I mean we what you

2296
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:01,319
saw in year two was us taking the

2297
01:30:59,039 --> 01:31:03,079
feedback from year One what you saw here

2298
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:05,399
in year three was us taking feedback

2299
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:08,359
from year two and I think you know we're

2300
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:09,759
already um you know Marcus you and I are

2301
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:11,158
already talking about other stuff I

2302
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,280
think we could talk about that at some

2303
01:31:11,158 --> 01:31:15,679
point but um I might have accient I

2304
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:17,800
might I might have [ __ ] it up earlier

2305
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:20,719
and said something that's fine you

2306
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:24,199
talked about what about about uh you

2307
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:27,960
know rocking Legends in uh in Barka oh

2308
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:30,559
yeah yeah so that's that's uh that's

2309
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,480
actually that's scary for me that's like

2310
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:33,880
I'm I'm excited but at the same time I'm

2311
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:35,279
a little scared because I like that

2312
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,880
imagine how it was when I just did it

2313
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:39,559
out of my pocket and just like try like

2314
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:42,800
wasn't from Barcelona I'd have to be

2315
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:45,520
renting venues and chairs and tables and

2316
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:48,440
all this crazy [ __ ] and it was just like

2317
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,440
super stressful everything's in Euros so

2318
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:52,879
from a Canadian standpoint it's like oh

2319
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:55,479
how much is it it's just ,000 it's like

2320
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,480
oh so like 18 00

2321
01:31:55,479 --> 01:32:01,718
Canadian like every every bill every

2322
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:05,000
bill was like double the the

2323
01:32:01,719 --> 01:32:07,760
bill of course I'm paying for everything

2324
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,600
with no sponsors whatsoever not even my

2325
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,119
own company yeah that was we'll crush

2326
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,960
this out dude we got the right people on

2327
01:32:12,118 --> 01:32:16,639
our side and uh I think it'll be nice

2328
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,960
it's not going to be anything like what

2329
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,600
you've put together in Los Angeles it's

2330
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:23,279
going to be Barcelona style it's going

2331
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:27,520
to be more intimate it's going to be you

2332
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:30,519
know what it Isen is I spent time with

2333
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:32,800
him at at Legends and I gave him some uh

2334
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:35,040
a couple dabs of some some fresh press

2335
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,800
and I think a couple I think some of the

2336
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:40,519
stuff that both Marcus and you

2337
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,320
have yeah Lorenzo's awesome top-notch

2338
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,960
dude man like I remember when he came on

2339
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:46,679
the scene I remember literally like I

2340
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,760
met him quite a few years ago it could

2341
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:50,920
be as as many as 10 years ago at this

2342
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:52,360
point maybe at SAS I'm not sure exactly

2343

2417
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:53,158
things to make it a special evening and

2418
01:35:51,319 --> 01:35:55,399
you know nowadays there's just so many

2419
01:35:53,158 --> 01:35:58,079
different things things that bombard the

2420
01:35:55,399 --> 01:36:00,079
senses that uh you know from the

2421
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:02,679
perspective of Legends it's all about

2422
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:04,479
curating the right products the right

2423
01:36:02,679 --> 01:36:06,319
sponsors the right hash makers we're

2424
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:09,879
like curators and we're creating a

2425
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:11,639
living art gallery of hash you know

2426
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:14,279
that's what Legends of hash is and it

2427
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:15,800
happens for a night it's a popup I mean

2428
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:17,759
wouldn't it be an amazing thing one day

2429
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:20,039
to see like Legends of hash just

2430
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,000
dispensaries with like the hatch bars

2431
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:23,760
like the whole like little cereal bars

2432
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
like the whole concept just put in into

2433
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,119
a baller dispensary that's like the

2434
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,560
legends of hash like you want to feel

2435
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:32,920
like what it was like to be at this

2436
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,280
event like go to that dispensary I

2437
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,199
wouldn't even call it a dispensary I

2438
01:36:34,279 --> 01:36:38,439
would call it like a a hash bar you know

2439
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:40,479
yeah you got to go to the legends of

2440
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:42,039
hash hash bar man that place is crazy

2441
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:46,959
everyone in that City would want their

2442
01:36:42,039 --> 01:36:50,000
dabs in that hash bar hash Gallery yeah

2443
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:52,480
that's it man so you had a good Legends

2444
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,439
anyway is is what you're saying with the

2445
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:57,039
cereal bar and

2446
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:59,919
no doubt no doubt I think whatever we

2447
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:03,479
can keep doing to curate those like

2448
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:06,399
little uh points of of experience I mean

2449
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:08,638
these hash makers are putting you know

2450
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:11,158
all all everything they can into into

2451
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:14,639
making the best product and um this

2452
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:15,719
whole event like I I I love that that's

2453
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:18,000
that's what we try to do with our

2454
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:20,439
packaging right like the the user

2455
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,639
experience and uh making sure that

2456
01:37:20,439 --> 01:37:24,759
everybody has a positive interaction and

2457
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,199
so uh you killed it like with the

2458
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,400
stencil it's like those little things

2459
01:37:26,198 --> 01:37:30,118
the little moments that stand out and if

2460
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:32,198
if you can put a bunch of those together

2461
01:37:30,118 --> 01:37:34,479
the whole time it's like oh the detail

2462
01:37:32,198 --> 01:37:39,158
here and there and and and the effort

2463
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:42,598
put into uh the event man you guys we

2464
01:37:39,158 --> 01:37:44,279
yeah crushed it that's what's up dude

2465
01:37:42,599 --> 01:37:46,679
that is what's up and we'll continue to

2466
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:49,118
try you know like one of one of my ideas

2467
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:51,079
was uh to always have like at at the end

2468
01:37:49,118 --> 01:37:54,118
of Legends I used to go with this guy

2469
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:56,279
Sid and Sid has a h a bubly bubbly

2470
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:58,399
collection of of pipes from Afghanistan

2471
01:37:56,279 --> 01:38:00,039
if you open the book hashish there's

2472
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:02,359
pictures in the middle of Rob's book

2473
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:04,519
hashish and in those pictures you'll see

2474
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:06,479
these Hubbly Bubbly pipes these Afghani

2475
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,480
pipes that are like you know two three

2476
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:11,319
feet tall big long pipe on them and

2477
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:13,479
you're Big Bowl on this thing like it's

2478
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:15,719
a serious hashm smoker tool like it's a

2479
01:38:13,479 --> 01:38:19,959
much bigger rip than a dab even a big

2480
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:21,920
dab even a huge dab and so you know Sid

2481
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:23,880
would bring a one of these down to

2482
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,639
Legends and it would be like aund years

2483
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:27,880
old and he'd let us all puff on it for

2484
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:29,359
the night so it was this real honor to

2485
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:32,239
be able to smoke this pipe from

2486
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:34,920
Afghanistan in Amsterdam from Sid's

2487
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:37,399
collection and at the end i' I'd just be

2488
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,239
trashed especially because like all the

2489
01:38:37,399 --> 01:38:40,960
dead smoke in the original restaurant it

2490
01:38:39,238 --> 01:38:43,079
was such a small environment you'd be

2491
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,480
rebreathing the Smoky air which was

2492
01:38:43,079 --> 01:38:47,279
terrible I'd go up to his house and this

2493
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:49,559
guy would have like 10 or 15 different

2494
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:51,198
types of honey from all around the world

2495
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,880
and you'd start you know have a spoonful

2496
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:56,399
of this one and you just I couldn't

2497
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,639
believe how well it cleared my throat

2498
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:00,839
and as a hash smoker I always want to

2499
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:03,359
have a honey bar where you can go up and

2500
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:06,239
get a little honey and just have access

2501
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:09,039
to Honey because honey will get your you

2502
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:11,598
you back on the dabs like nobody's

2503
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:14,319
business even if you got a sore wretched

2504
01:39:11,599 --> 01:39:17,520
throat a a spoonful of the right honey

2505
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:19,039
from the right environment is so

2506
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,199
medicinal you can't even [ __ ] I

2507
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:22,158
couldn't believe it I was like what the

2508
01:39:20,198 --> 01:39:24,919
[ __ ] it was Peruvian honey that he

2509
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:26,638
gave me a tiny teaspoon and it went down

2510
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:28,679
my throat and I was just like dude I

2511
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:31,440
feel like I could go do another Legends

2512
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:31,440
now

2513
01:39:32,198 --> 01:39:36,079
legitimately so shout out to

2514
01:39:37,158 --> 01:39:41,598
honey well I wished uh you know I I knew

2515
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:43,118
it was kind of going to play that out

2516
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:44,880
this way I think my email probably went

2517
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:46,559
to a lot of people's junk mails and I

2518
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,840
could have probably done a better job it

2519
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,719
would have been nice to have all the

2520
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:53,000
other winners as well as Darby and Scott

2521
01:39:49,719 --> 01:39:55,239

2522
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,319

01:41:00,039 --> 01:41:07,039
us and we didn't really intend for

2549
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:10,440
vessel life science to become a brand

2550
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:12,880
but I don't think uh many people intend

2551
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:15,799
many things to happen so we're stoked to

2552
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:18,520
to just be a part of the wave and just

2553
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:21,079
be a vessel for for what we've been

have you guys that's for sure yeah we're

2590
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:45,039
lucky to have

2591
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,520
Oklahoma did you guys do that Donnie

2592
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:51,158
Burger

2593
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:53,639
cross the PO yeah yeah so uh yeah that

2594
01:42:51,158 --> 01:42:56,598
was the one that won the the first yeah

2595
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:58,159
uh first place and um yeah we you guys

2596
01:42:56,599 --> 01:43:00,279
did the cross though or did you get that

2597
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,238
no no we got that from it's a it's a

2598
01:43:00,279 --> 01:43:05,639
pack from California SE Bank respect at

2599
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:08,678
California SE bank and uh yeah we just

2600
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:10,679
we actually got a couple uh freebies I

2601
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:12,359
think it was like two three pack

2602
01:43:10,679 --> 01:43:15,520
freebies and so we just popped all those

2603
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:17,519
at once we feno hunt everything that we

2604
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,199
uh grow we don't we've never taken any

2605
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,880
Cuts uh I think we were just like

2606
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:23,919
paranoid years ago that you know for

2607
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:25,880
bugs or whatever reason and just you

2608
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:28,840
know Black Market stuff kind of wanting

2609
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:30,880
to stay hidden or whatever um a decade

2610
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:33,360
ago so it's just something and so we

2611
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:36,279
just always like to hunt and that was uh

2612
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:39,279
the initial time the the the first feno

2613
01:43:36,279 --> 01:43:43,079
hunt wash so it was like five fenos is a

2614
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:45,559
five penos that's in there so um I think

2615
01:43:43,079 --> 01:43:48,519
it adds to like a a quite complex flavor

2616
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:51,159
same with the rainb tan that one um

2617
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:53,440
that's Bloom Seed Co and we've had that

2618
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:54,839
one for I don't know at least a year now

2619
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:56,238
but it's still three fenos and we've

2620
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:59,440
narrowed that one down so a lot of what

2621
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:01,158
we do is like mixed feno of that flavor

2622
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:02,439
we'll keep a couple um just kind of

2623
01:44:01,158 --> 01:44:05,118
depending because we want like a nice

2624
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:06,960
wide range of flavors uh give it a

2625
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:08,158
little bit of complexity so I mean

2626
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:12,279
that's just what that's what we love

2627
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:14,598
doing and onto R effect yeah

2628
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:15,519
um yeah we're just gonna keep doing that

2629
01:44:14,599 --> 01:44:17,880
I

2630
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:20,080
guess I think you're on the right path

2631
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:22,400
no doubt about

2632
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:25,079
it we're looking forward to the future

2633
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:27,158
that's for sure yes looking forward to

2634
01:44:25,079 --> 01:44:29,559
more Legends

2635
01:44:27,158 --> 01:44:31,598
things the people next time we gotta

2636
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:33,119
spend some more time I was I was super

2637
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:35,360
overwhelmed with smoking the hash and

2638
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:36,639
making sure we got through all those

2639
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:38,319
like you know like they all said gave

2640
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,800
everybody their their due diligence on

2641
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:42,479
that it does become work it does become

2642
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,480
work where you're really like holy [ __ ]

2643
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:45,479
like this is actually like going to take

2644
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:48,399
me

2645
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:52,319
hours Yeah by far the most dabs I've

2646
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:54,638
done it was great though it was awesome

2647
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:57,319
this is how we do it out in California

2648
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:59,679
just it's only it's 45 dabs man just get

2649
01:44:57,319 --> 01:45:02,158
it [ __ ] done we want to do more of

2650
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,239
that kind of stuff for uh for Oklahoma

2651
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:08,000
the the competitions out here man

2652
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:10,079
they're I don't know yeah but as far as

2653
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,479
like you know nice events like that

2654
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:14,319
sessiones we we're uh gonna throw one

2655
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:17,198
called blueg grass and hash later this

2656
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:19,479
year or next year I should say uh one of

2657
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:21,359
our buddies so that should be just try

2658
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:23,439
to bring that kind of culture more to

2659
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:25,559
Oklahoma for the people here and what

2660
01:45:23,439 --> 01:45:27,839
what I would suggest you do for that is

2661
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,960
that um you know we want to do smaller

2662
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:33,239
Legend Styles events in different cities

2663
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:36,158
where we can kind of find the talent

2664
01:45:33,238 --> 01:45:37,839
like scouting events so when we can't if

2665
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:39,759
there is events like what you just

2666
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:42,719
mentioned that aligns with our sort of

2667
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,880
bottom line we always are down with

2668
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:46,520
finding like the shining stars of these

2669
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,560
events and then you know inviting them

2670
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,599
into the competition of Legends for the

2671
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:52,599
next year kind of thing so we got to be

2672
01:45:50,599 --> 01:45:54,719
able to scout hash makers out there in

2673
01:45:52,599 --> 01:45:56,400
the world and that becomes uh you know

2674
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:59,399
the responsibility of the legends of

2675
01:45:56,399 --> 01:46:01,359
hash crew yeah well that's awesome man

2676
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:03,759

01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:05,799

a lot of um pheno hunting and um all of

2692
01:46:47,158 --> 01:46:53,039
that is extremely difficult and takes a

2693
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:55,400
lot of resources and a lot of time and

2694
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:57,760
um yeah I think uh this year we're

2695
01:46:55,399 --> 01:47:01,759
getting into uh we're getting like a

2696
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:02,880
culture lab and um fortish culture and

2697
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,280
so

2698
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,520
um that's really exciting and we have um

2699
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:09,158
you know some guys uh involved that um

2700
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:12,199
are kind of big in the scene and know

2701
01:47:09,158 --> 01:47:13,479
what they're doing and so you got that's

2702
01:47:12,198 --> 01:47:14,799
the most important thing you could have

2703
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:17,359
said when you said we're going to do a

2704
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,560
tissue culture lab I was like w that's

2705
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:20,880
like very specialized but then you said

2706
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:22,520
the next thing which was like we got

some guys who really know what they're

2708
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:28,800
doing from that exact that's the most

2709
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,479
necessary component yes you're doing

2710
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,520
Meemic tissue

2711
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:35,519

2712
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:39,840

2713
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:41,840

uh really clean environment and

2715
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:48,000
separating all that kind of stuff um you
