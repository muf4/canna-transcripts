23
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:51,280
we spent about two three months working

24
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,000
together with uh bubble man and uh we

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,039
finally have his brand release we've got

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
different categories we had to with so

27
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,519
many products going on between what he

28
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,718
was doing what you were doing and what

29
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:07,199
uh I am doing we put it together and we

30
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,199
have uh three categories that we put

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,039
together which was the Black Label the

32
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,079
Black Label anything that you see in the

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,560
black Black Label um there's a select

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,440
series and then there's a reserve series

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,800
and then we have what's the blue

36
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:28,639
label it's the blue label it's blue and

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,760
silver very nice packaging yeah you know

38
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,159
it came together the we had to separate

39
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,199
it because really the select is kind of

40
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,400
hand trim Smalls and then the reserve is

41
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,359
reserved for the nugs top of the plant

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,640
um a lot of people don't understand the

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,319
difference between hand trim and nug

44
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,639
runs in the full melt world but uh

45
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,399
that's what we wanted to have this show

46
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,439
and kind of talk about that um

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,480
specifically for full melt and what that

48
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,359
means for the Melt uh the rating uh a

49
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,518
lot of people out there probably don't

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,280
know where the star rating came from so

51
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,039
we're going to touch on that today too

52
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,120
the blue label is all the things that I

53
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,318
do with Blue River and it's the

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,719
combination of uh the reserve line and

55
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,238
the Tarpin this this kind of been an

56
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,039
experimental Road for I don't know about

57
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,799
eight months uh trying different things

58
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:23,439
and I finally came up with uh you know

59
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:27,519
like a 400 mgram vial which is 200

60
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:31,199
milligrams of tpin 200 milligram of

61
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,759
cannabinoids and we rich it's Rich it's

62
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,199
Rich it's so rich it takes a little

63
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,120
micro diber that comes with it and you

64
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:42,079
know good good way to calculate uh your

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,400
dabs and it's easy for people that want

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,719
to use it in vape pens or uh oh sure cuz

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,080
you can just dip it or spray it right

68
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,120
into same thing with a joint or on a

69
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,280
bowl or using like another concent tra

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,438
in it um and each one of them I kind of

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
did something different this was cookies

72
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,680
on cookies this was the sour d on sour d

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,680
and then there was one more that was uh

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,680

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,879

really weird freaky [ __ ] out here um out

137
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:47,359
in the backyard but it's a huge space um

138
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,000
really perfect for all kinds of

139
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,439
gatherings you guys used to do that

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,519
right uh yeah we had a an underground

141
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,478
hash bar bar here for a little while and

142
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,038
uh was just like a members only type of

143
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,478
club which Oakland allows uh for that

144
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,959
type of thing and uh uh it was the

145
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,318
biggest of its

146
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,359
kind I think that's ever been for how

147
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,919
long AG was that that started in 2010

148
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
when we were a block away at a smaller

149
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,079
place and then we moved over here after

150
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,598
about three or four months there yeah we

151
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,279
wound up having three different clubs

152
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,399
after the after the end of it yeah I

153
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,119
think we're losing you on the camera

154
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,159
yeah yeah yeah he's like just he's still

155
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,280
he's already leaning and we haven't even

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,280
started smoking the hash yet okay so we

157
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,399
used to do them um but yeah we should we

158
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,159
should do one uh that's coming up

159
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:37,038

well looks like

421
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,839
sift I'd say that's the best consistency

422
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:32,599
so far the freeze dry the never touch

423
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:34,678
freeze dry still in heads you know yeah

424
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,000
it's ridiculous house it just goes from

425
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:42,400
like it's weird powdery consistency just

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,759
greas two seconds super grease but this

427
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,559
is more like you can see the

428
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,839
heads individually greased on the glass

429
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:55,720

tur bring fantastic unreal right yeah

464
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,719
much better I think like that just with

465
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,918
a shovel I like these the double jar

466
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,000
thing you don't have to dip it in there

467
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,960
right I mean not there anything bad

468
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
about that but it's nice to keep it

469
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,319
separate yeah and it keeps it like kind

470
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,919
of protected from the right yeah a

471
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:48,558
little incubator yeah CU this it's very

472
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,000
clean and sterile out here but you know

473
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,720
out the crazy world you know it can get

474
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,240
dirty well and anything that gets in the

475
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,000
glass you could always dip your Dabber

476
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,200
in it and then take the edge off of that

477
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,398
with with a yeah sure yeah use that as a

478
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,360
diping jar instead of this

479
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:07,079
one and you know it's all and I was and

480
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,240
it's also a way to let it pull and

481
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,038
collect did you notice if you hold it

482
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,319
here anything from the sides will pull

483
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,119
and collect there if you just give it

484
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,639
like 30 seconds

485
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,038

497
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,278
it's a good way to do it by the hash

498
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,480
rosin that goes with the the turp oil

499
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,440
then you can go back and forth like that

500
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,798
and it'll last really long oh man that's

501
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,480
really good it's it's you know when you

502
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,798
get a I

503
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,798
smell someone just opened a bag of

504
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:24,918
cookies and usually if the rosin smells

505
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:27,759
like that's a good thing but when smoke

506
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,000
afterwards smells like that that says

507
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,200
something

508
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,599
it is cookies on cookies and cookies it

509
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,080
smells that's why it's called cookies

510
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,079
and cookies yeah it's too much it's like

535
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,558
yeah from the so the farmers you know

536
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:43,678
those are really it's really a

537
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,678
representation of them as well you know

538
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,640
the genetics and the resin speak for

539
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,120
itself all this is Sun resin too Sun

540
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,038
grown and that's intentional you know

541
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,959
that's what bubble man wanted to do so

542
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:00,599
this is like in Vineyards you get

543
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:04,240
different grapes yeah you know yeah

544
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,918
exactly different G uh different regions

545
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,880
what what do you know what makes a good

546
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,159
year for for wine it's uh it's like it

547
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,120
has to do with rainfall and like if it

548
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:15,679
rains heavy one year that the wine will

549
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,798
be good the next year or something like

550
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,399
that it has to it's like you know when

551
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:22,240
someone says oh that's that was a great

552
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:24,479
year for this Vineyard it has it has to

553
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,319
do generally with the the weather and

554
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,759
how the grapes were fed that year or

555
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,398
whatever how much how much water they

556
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,079
took up so you're telling me because it

557
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:35,199
rained this year tr's going to be nice

558
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:37,038
next year I I'm not sure you know since

559
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,919
maybe since we're in in the Cannabis

560
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,519
industry since all the Cannabis caught

561
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,720
on fire last season then maybe we're

562
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,339
going to have a good season this year he
