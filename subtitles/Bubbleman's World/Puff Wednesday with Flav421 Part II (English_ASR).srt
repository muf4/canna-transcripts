the the trapped opal chips in here and

18
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,959
under here and here under here a lot of

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,599
people haven't seen before you can't

20
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,079

21
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,559
I could definitely see um Buck if you're

22
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:22,319
listening to this um I could see you uh

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,560
at one point in time adding a small

24
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,839
mouthpiece here for an exhale Tu imagine

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,920
you have your

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,600
inhale and then you've got your exhale

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,680
where you go and it follows it along the

28
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,759
spine and it blows it out of the mouth

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,560
of the fish I mean how sick would that

30
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,519
be that' be pretty sick I did it earlier

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,118
when we hit a bowl I blew my smoke

32
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,920
through the back chamber here and it

33
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,399
came out but not as nice as it would

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
come out if they actually had it set up

35
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,079
yeah so that was breathing the smoke so

36
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,600
it's breathing the smoke yeah such a

37
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,199
beautiful piece man yeah I love this

38
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,759
look at that tiny little drop of water

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,118
on the tooth kind of made it look

40
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,079
different I was like that's not right

41
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,200
kind of cool too

42
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:08,639
it's just perfect RPP the yellow the the

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,679
faint yellow um in the blue is beautiful

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,679
this is a de Darkness pull and they've

45
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,878
just pulled it out further to get these

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,439
these different shades okay in in the

47
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,120

ahead it disappears like

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,239
magic

57
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,479
yeah ah that is such a incredible piece

58
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,480
of

59
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,799
glass always a

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,919
pleasure hey I think we have another

61
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,519
amazing piece of glass we're going to

62
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,598
hit up next let's go get it say bye to

63
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,599
the

64
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:25,560
angler you know to take one of the most

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,040
uh in my opinions just like it it has to

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,199
be technically difficult to pull and

67
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,318
attach glass like that Angler fish with

68
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,560
the technique of Marcel's ratachello

69
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,438
work with the air trapping in it I just

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,799
have an idea that it's an extremely

71
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:43,400
technical pipe and then to be taken back

72
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,799
you know more than 10 years like uh

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,239
almost 15 years to fish 2000 which my

74
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,920
favorite this piece could have even been

75
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,680
done I believe in 1999 yeah it was it

76
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,639
was it was made for the New Year's show

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,280
of fish and it has the fish marble and

78
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,719
whatnot and the five uh uh

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,680
Dolphins right the five Dolphins from

80
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,598
what I believe Marcel had told me was

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,719
they each represented a member of fish

82
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:16,798
and then um he had also he also had um

83
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,319
the sound man and then maybe this was

84
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,599
the light guy CU Paul langu do was you

85
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,759
know he was a very important member of

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
the band as was Chris corota for

87
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,680
experience for the lights yeah for the

88
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,959
whole experience of that show so cool

89
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,879
well as Marcel when he talked to me

90
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,319
about this piece when I first got it off

91
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:39,240
a number of years ago um he explained it

92
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:42,399
that at the time in the whole community

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,120
in the borrow scene he hadn't or there

94
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,319
hadn't been the tools and some of the

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,120
techniques needed to accomplish some of

96
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,560
the Visions oh yeah that that they had

97
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,399
that's what I was going to say that pipe

98
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,160
that we just hit yeah this pipe

99
00:04:53,399 --> 00:05:01,000
represents absolutely yeah I agree and

100
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,600
to like this is one of my most prized

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,600
pieces of art that I have in my

102
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,400
collection um yeah well I have a history

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,320
with it I love it yeah you were the

104
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,560
first person to ever ever have it

105
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,719
brought to brought up after it was made

106
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,759
yeah Marcel brought it to my house and

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,600
he uh he cleaned it up after the fish

108
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,560
2000 show at the seino Indian

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,759
reservation there in Florida the one

110
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,879
that where it went around for like 2

111
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,199
hours Alligator Alley even longer yeah

112
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,439
it was a 7 and a half hour set he was

113
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
tripping mad balls and he was like oh I

114
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,240
was pretty sure it was going to come

115
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,319
back but he just send it out into the

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,079
Trippers and it would

117
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,400
just he always came back and so he I

118
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,000
remember specifically this for a fact he

119
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:45,079
came up and he was like the only thing

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,560
this piece is missing is your Vibe yes

121
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,839
he was like you weren't at the show with

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,240
us and I guess I had taken Marcel to

123
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,638
maybe his first fish show which was I I

124
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,478
believe 9999 in Vancouver where I

125
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,000
miracled which was uh basically giving a

126
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:04,079
free ticket uh 18 of my my friends into

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,120
their first fish show a miracle to all

128
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,240
18 of them that's awesome three rows of

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,800
six seats [ __ ] that's awesome yeah close

130
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,360
to the stage and then in the end I

131
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,079
didn't even sit with any of them I ended

132
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,919
up taping the show and I had to go down

133
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:19,439
on the floor and be in the taper section

134
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:21,959
but uh uh he was in the group Marcel was

135
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,038
Miracles so I think we should hit this I

136
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,239
think we

137
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,000
should what uh what do you want to Puff

138
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,680
I mean what do you want to Puff is that

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,439
a why there so much selection more

140
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,280
astroy it's true it's true let's just

141
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,719
hit the

142
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,159
Astro and this though is this the cured

143
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,440
stuff yeah oh yeah that stuff's The

144
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
Taste on that it's like ridiculous it is

145
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,279
ridiculous at this though look at the

146
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,279
color on yeah this one's Prett really

147
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:55,038
Oh I thought it was for

148
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,799
you ah yes beautiful beautiful piece

149
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:01,159
want me to carve me all right you want

150
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,639
me to light you sure that would be great

151
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,639
in the least let me drive your

152
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,199
beeline I'm going to build up your flame

153
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,240
a little bit so you're not left hanging

154
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,199
can be a little bit tricky um hitting

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,079
with a be line if you're outside in the

156
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,960
room not that I think you're all idiots

157
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,519
but it's definitely like build up a big

158
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,079
flame before you hit out of a certain

159
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,839
piece particularly this one which has uh

160
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,719
what I would say um the last of the

161
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:30,478
flower bowls this pipe definitely has a

162
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,120
deep punched flower bowl yep um

163
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,360
it's Unique it's different there's no B

164
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,840
you know there's no um pull Bowl this is

165
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,520
