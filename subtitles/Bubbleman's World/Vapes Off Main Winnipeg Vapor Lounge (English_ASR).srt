is this like a little dispensory right

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,799
here well this was going to be the this

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,000
is where you pay your ad when I built it

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,880
this was where you paid your Mission got

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,840
into the lounge but this is going to be

45
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,399
a bit of the medical marijuana resource

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,959
center side of things okay but I don't

47
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,080
know what they're

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,920
doing like I said I haven't been here in

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,239
a long time since they got it open well

50
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:18,759
let's go check it

51
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,360
out crime smoking marijuana is not a

52
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:26,239
crime using drugs generally is not a

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:29,120
crime and uh assassine to hurt people

54
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,519
more by enforcing criminal law on people

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,840
who smoke

56
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,039
or use any drugs for that matter and I

57
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,800
say d lies let's take them under the

58
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:42,120
hands of the criminals and uh and and

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,400
start making our our streets

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,840
safer um so your point absolutely I uh

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,200
finally turned the camera on I've been s

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,519
I've been sitting and talking we we are

63
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:58,560
at Vapes off Main right and it started

64
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,360
as Vapes on all right cool and that was

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,598
was it Eddie from the beginning Yeah

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,319
Eddie and B here been involved Eddie

67
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:10,000
and EDD I learned about it through Bill

68
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,359
uh from his Facebook page seeing him

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,318
post about it when I first saw the the

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,920
words Vapes on Main it got me excited

71
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:18,560
cuz I'm from Winnipeg originally I

72
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,318
haven't lived here in almost 20 years

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,640
but I thought uh definitely nice to see

74
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:26,839
a vapor lounge here in Winnipeg and uh

75
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,119
my hats off to these guys uh for doing

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,878
it and we've been sitting around this

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,560
table puffing for the last hour or so

78
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,798
and having good conversation and uh yeah

79
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,280
I just thought I would give you guys

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,840
from Bubble man's world a little bit of

81
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,598
a glimpse into Vapes off Main and maybe

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
uh maybe we could go around the table

83
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,639
and everyone could kind of introduce

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,039
themselves and tell us a little bit

85
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,759
about your cannabis passion kind of

86
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:55,400
crazy how it how fast it went actually

87
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:57,959
like I I I am I was here a year ago and

88
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,480
I was here when everything started with

89
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,239
Eddie and Bill and at the first main

90
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,318
location like it's on Main and it really

91
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,438
got like we started talking on Facebook

92
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,318
we had a post on 420 saying hey we're

93
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,759
opening a new

94
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,839
cannabis a week after that somebody from

95
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,680
CBC comes and asked to have an interview

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,918
and I was like okay sure sure no problem

97
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,400
I'll give you an interview with Bill and

98
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:31,000
the the management and after that in a

99
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:32,638
week we got every I was like CTV CBC OIC

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,720
Free Press doing everybody doing their

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,160
own reports it and I left a year ago and

102
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,600
now I come back and it's a new place

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,439
downtown crazy things are happening

104
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,240
around the place so it went fast that

105
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,800
was super fast and and Bill do you think

106
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,038
that the media was interested in uh do

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,400
you think you having a history as a

108
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,399
police officer in the city and now being

109
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,918
an outspoken cannabis activist and

110
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,799
really outspoken for the plant do you

111
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,439
think that br a little bit of that media

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,840
in was that part of the attention that

113
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,399
they

114
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,399
were I mean I it could have it could

115
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,120
have I've been speaking in the city for

116
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,079
quite a number of years now for law

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,879
enforcement prohibition know for Le

118
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:20,198
right yeah Le and since over 7 years now

119
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,079
8 years writing letters and everything

120
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,199
so I'm and then in my previous position

121
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:30,478
in the police there was fairly high

122
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:32,280
profile position as well staff Sur major

123
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,959
crime in the street

124
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:39,279
came late 9s and then I said the hell

125
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:43,359
with that [ __ ] I got out that's 2001

126
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,318
and uh uh I was already familiar with

127
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,600
cannabis of course I mean I grew up in

128
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,840
the 6s but it wasn't something that I

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,520
Wasing the police department to enforce

130
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,679
sure because I could care less about it

131
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,159
and I didn't have a nose for it and if

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,519
you didn't have a nose for it you

133
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,639
been and so I essentially like a lot of

134
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,680
offic I don't want to run off at the

135
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,439
both here and take all the time here but

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,560
as far as Vapes on Main goes that was an

137
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,680
interesting thing I'd been to Toronto

138
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:21,319
I'd been to Vancouver

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,038
uh new Dana few people I spoke

140
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,800
for

141
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:31,279
regarding Y and Johnny Tran and Leah K

142
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,120
came with Eddie my one day we met them

143
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,478
at a demonstration and they said we're

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,598
looking for a director to set up private

145
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,159
sort of a h Club private club but that's

146
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,519
what I'd heard that it started was a

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,599
private club it's sort of a they're

148
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:51,399
called Social Clubs in the problem they

149
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:54,639
private whatever we can have out we want

150
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:57,000
but the um I figured it was a good

151
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,038
opportunity to give the cause a bit of a

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,959
kick in the ass simply by

153
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,878
getting in because I've already been so

154
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,399
active and I thought I'd be remiss if I

155
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,639
didn't get in to Simply you know you not

156
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,598
not give my sanction to it so much as

157
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,800
saying hey I'm with the I'm with the

158
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,680
people here on this this is the kind of

159
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,520
thing we need in this town and

160
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,038
dispensaries are going to be next

161
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,519
absolutely Vice magazine came out to do

162
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,759
an interview so it went great well

163
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,318
that's awesome and it's slowly just

164
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,280
grown into the entity that it is today

165

174
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,120

00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:16,680
that building for sure yeah yeah I mean

181
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,038
yeah like Bill said I mean things really

182
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,959
took off cuz I I just heard of the whole

183
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,918
thing like uh when they put out that

184
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,359
newspaper thing they kind of put it out

185
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:30,120
and uh I think fre press ran it and CBC

186
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,000
or whoever ran it

187
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,599
and yeah it went [ __ ] man definitely

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,719
after that a lot of people started here

189
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,680
and voted I guess my position you know I

190
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,039
mean I don't understand you so well

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,319
person then the as some of my friends

192
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,958
are here in the medical aspects and the

193
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,399
intricacies of plan s I'm not that much

194
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,399
into that I'm a crie guy and I seen

195
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,039
people stop this [ __ ] no crime

196
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,759
anymore no victim no crime and I'm

197
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,759
talking about all drugs yeah since

198
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,278
because we can't afford to have the kind

199
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:09,278
of vience we're seeing in our streets

200
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,519
like Siri BC for example 40 shootings in

201
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,759
the past two months or whatever it is

202
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
absolutely I mean that's all cocaine and

203
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,519
heroin and whatever it is it's all these

204
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,360
drugs that because they're not regulated

205
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,000
or legal that they're able to other

206
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
people can just take control of them

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,360
that's right and that's that's why I I'm

208
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
with leap on that issue too we got to

209
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,639
pay control and of course cannbis

210
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,919
considered part of that for people don't

211
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,439
understand that most of the Cannabis

212
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,519
Growers now are mums and pops and and

213
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
more in the professional growing they

214
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,600
don't deal with in other products or

215
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:45,000
none of their drugs simply cannabis and

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,639
uh um that's the big difference in my

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,919
view I support the cannbis people I

218
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,759
don't support the other drugs but I say

219
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,159
let's legalize and take it out of the

220
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,439
hands of the criminals and the cartel I

221
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,399
agree 100% it comes down to seems like

222
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,399
Common Sense really considering if you

223
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
Black Market profits we already know

224
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,200
what prohibition did because back in the

225
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,519
day of alcohol prohibitions and and it

226
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,079
was the police force who really took a

227
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,639
serious look at the at prohibition when

228
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,120
for the first time in the history people

229
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,639
just started literally killing the

230
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,639
police that was under prohibition all of

231
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,600
a sudden it was a war they were shooting

232
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,639
each other for alcohol and it was like

233
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,800
well this is insane considering most of

234
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,759
those policemen drank alcohol on their

235
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,838
time off even under the under

236
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,399
prohibition they still went to the speak

237
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,880
easys or the whatevers and ended up

238
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,958
having a drink or two and now it's like

239
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,679
we we they they realized way back then

240
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,759
that eliminating alcohol prohibition

241
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,519
would eliminate all the crime that went

242
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,759
along with it and just regulate and all

243
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,278
those old company uh all those old

244
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,919
people that were Smugglers and

245
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,480
Bootleggers are now the biggest alcohol

246
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,559
companies on the planet literally like

247
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,879
the bronfman well literally it's rumored

248
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,638
that Al might have been down here in

249
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:07,519
this in this I wouldn't be surprised

250
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,519
this the

251
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,599
hotel so this would have been filled up

252
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,078
with uh alcohol barrels at one point he

253
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,240
was to do hung here

254
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:23,759
like hanging out at Al's place here with

255
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,159
Al it's a historical place for

256
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,159
prohibition we should get that story

257
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
down

258
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,958
that's where a guy like David Mal David

259
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,159
Maline comes in handy cuz that's what he

260
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,679
does he would literally hear that story

261
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,120
and then he would figure it out he would

262
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,958
just follow it and find it and do fi

263
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,120
follow the history and then make it

264
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,278
available in some cool little book or

265
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,440
piece of paper or something he's

266
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,278
definitely like a lot of people should

267
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,079
look at that guy in regards to his

268
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:57,200
activism and he's portrayed himself over

269
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,599
the course of the last 20 years he's

270
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,920
he's also he's hardcore man I firmly

271
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,159
stand behind David Maline and most of

272
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,559
the things that he does uh cannabis

273
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:11,039
activism related I remember we from

274
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,399

because it's a traffic it was the same

329
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,879
thing he passed the joint and that's he

330
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:43,519
did time aatul I think he did 30 days or

331
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:47,559
something it was kind of like wa what

332
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,240
like 30 days yeah 30 days oh well Mark

333
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:53,399
was always one to push the envelope in I

334
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,360
thought it was ironic too because uh you

335
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,720
know just laughing like crazy what a

336
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,759
stupid thing for us to be wasting our

337
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,800
time

338
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,639
we had all over the place but I mean he

339
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,639
wanted to get arrested and push the

340
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,399
cause and I admired him for it even as a

341
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,720
c from

342
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,759
afar I did oh yeah absolutely because

343
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,320
even then there was a lot of us guys on

344
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:22,399
the job who were

345
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:25,920
not uh uh the drug Warriors right that

346
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,559
uh you saw from The French Connection B

347
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,439
we used to see people try and emulate

348
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,559
those kind

349
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,759
detectives no we see if there was no

350
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,879
victim I didn't want anything to do with

351
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,079
it well that's the you're homicide

352
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:43,360
detective like I wanted a

353
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:46,758
victim I honestly I've never met a

354
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,000
homicide detective that cared about

355
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:51,440
cannabis they don't even they don't even

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,679
really care about drugs in a sense like

357
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,839
they'll you know what I mean like if

358
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,278
they need if they just want some

359
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,079
information like we just need to solve

360
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,559
this murder I don't care that you had a

361
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:03,439
bunch of heroin just tell

362
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,000
how we operated because that makes sense

363
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
you're trying to solve a [ __ ]

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,679
homicide which I met many heroin addicts

365
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:15,440
and some of the homicides here was quite

366
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:18,318
uh enlightening for me you know um not

367
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,680
what you expect that's real police work

368
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:24,278
but and then when I started to get

369
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:26,638
involved F leap and they came home they

370
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,919
articulated pretty awesome law

371
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,799
enforcement against prohibition it's it

372
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,919
you know very powerful group of people

373
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,399
to stand up well they won't appreciate

374
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:39,519
me sitting here talking about it cuz I

375
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,600
went my t-shirt but because it's such a

376
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,039
uh we'll put the website the video This

377
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
legal operation gentlemen if you are

378
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,919
watching and I'm Bill Vander graph of Le

379
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,439
sometimes I speak from you for you

380
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,278
sometimes I don't I say kiss my ass the

381
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,519
uh the fact is it's a legal operation

382
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,679
going on here I've already checked Vice

383
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,720
magazine you remember saw the the

384
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:07,119
yard so yeah absolutely I mean I'm mm so

385
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,038
I'm definitely happy I I was going to

386
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,239
ask my hotel today for instance I mean

387
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,240
I'm staying at a nice hotel in the city

388
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,078
spent a fair amount of money and then I

389
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,679
want to know where can I use cannabis

390
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:18,038
cuz I know if I walk out into the forks

391
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,319
and sit in the middle of the thing and

392
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,919
pull out my mother ship and a big

393
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,318
blowtorch start torching my nail which I

394
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,600
did in all in my defense this morning in

395
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,879
front of the forest and then I went down

396
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,959
to the river and I did it there and then

397
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,320
I went on the bridge and I did there

398
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,240
most of the people were just looking at

399
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:38,480
me yes but I thought I wanted to ask the

400
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,240
hotel like where where can I medicate

401
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,038
and it's like it's amazing that these

402
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,440
hotels don't have anywhere that they can

403
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,400
tell their patrons their

404
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,240
customers where they can go do this

405
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,200
safely and because they can't do that I

406
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,880
can potentially invite unwanted

407
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,720
attention into my life by being in a

408
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,480
city that I might not you know be aware

409
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,319
of of how it works so

410
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,440
it is what it is I'm glad that the Vapor

411
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,158
Lounge exists and uh we're just going to

412
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,320
continue here with this group of uh

413
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,880
great individuals I'll put all the links

414

416
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,120

417
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,879
bit well all right guys we have made it

418
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,319
back to the beautiful hotel here the in

419
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,360
at the forks and uh we got the sun

420
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,918
setting behind us uh with the city of

421
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,240
Winnipeg really kind

422
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,440
of prominently displayed wouldn't you

423

Building and the old Bank building

425
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,120
there's not too many high-rise buildings

426
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,359
but that is definitely right behind Al's

427
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,959
head there the majority of them and then

428

the uh the Human Rights Museum which uh

430
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,280

431
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,399
looking building now can you go up to

432
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:53,359

00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,759
you can get a long ways up there okay

435
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,240
okay I'm not sure if you get right to

436
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,879
the top or not but

437
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,000
thanks for the Water by the way I know

438

contractors uh that work there were

439
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,200
shaking their head the whole time they

440
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,880

444
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,080
butter oh I know what I'm looking

00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,599
for the Dabber which should be beside

446
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:35,678
you there and the resin is the Dabber

447

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,919
hitting this LH as well as this rosin

450
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,200
pretty

451
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,120

452
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,960
wouldn't you oh yeah so we thought we'd

453

finish it off with the last session here

454
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,600
at the end at the forks sun going down

455
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,960

456
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,319
out of the Mother Ship not like there's

457

458
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:06,918
Ship but uh I'm going to do a combo

459
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:06,918
rosin LH

460
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,519
rip

461
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,839
o nicely

462
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,480

dabs use my right hand so the camera

464
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,079
actually shows

465
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,519
it oh will be required to flick the

466
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,798
switch

467
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,240
that was a te's rip as you can see the D

468
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,480
nail was at 74° and now that I've

469
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,640
clicked the switch flick the switch

470
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,759
she's climbing beautiful thing about

471
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,159
these things they don't take that long

472
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,798
to heat up the few times in my life

473
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,960
where I've actually done what I just did

474
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:50,960
which is put the Dabber into the cold

475
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,000
Bowl um I've managed to sort of get my

476
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,440
hit in me like probably a minute

477
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,798
later so not too

478
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,038
bad well the analog I think's a little

479
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,558
slower to warm but yeah this is fast

480
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,279
you'll see like in less than a minute we

481
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,720
will be ripping this bowl yeah it's

482
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:10,960
already up to 300

483
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,240
yeah halfway there so there's that is a

484
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,240
good

485
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,798
thing

486
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,880
359 got my Dil set at about 680 today

487
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:26,200
we've been uh on this trip I've gone as

488
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:29,039
low as 580 and as high as 750 so quite a

489
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,519
wide variety of uh of rips we're getting

490
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,400

511
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,399
on doing that and I could still

512
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,159
potentially do that tomorrow morning

513
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,840
wake up real early and just decide that

514
