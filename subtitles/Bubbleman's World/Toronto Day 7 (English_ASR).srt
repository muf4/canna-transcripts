Vancouver and not only are we in

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,159
Vancouver but we have Tracked Down the

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,600
owner of the Purple Med T which is

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,719
pretty damn cool and he's even in the

37
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,959
camera right now he doesn't think he is

38
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:37,118
he's F in he's in and we're going to

39
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:40,679
give him the camera back or the the med

40
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,719
back my neighbor jumped out of the truck

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,000
dropped his medtainer kicked it by an

42
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,078
accident probably and this rolled into

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,560
the airport that's a hypothesis because

44
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:52,559
we really don't know but is this yours

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,879
it must be wow is it do you recognize it

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
how many joints you have in it there's

47
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,319
three and some loose stuff there too

48
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,000
well actually uh I gave one away to a

49
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,718
gentleman that truly truly needed

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,478
joint was

51
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,919
very thisy was crying crying crying so I

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,439
had to give him so we gave the guy who

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,680
was crying a joint I lit this one just

54
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,759
out of good faith and want to try

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,800
whatever was in here I had no idea and I

56
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:20,560
tast excellent excellent so so it

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,120
was it's all yours he didn't recognize I

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,840
think really nice we apparently it was

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,519
mine so here let's give it back to Mike

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,479
I didn't find it he found it thank you

61
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,879
so much well I I found it but he picked

62
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,878
it up I was walking and I saw the med

63
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,399
taner and I thought you guys were

64
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:37,959
playing a joke on me and I was like I

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,319
had no idea I was blown I was like and

66
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,840
then well he had no idea because he

67
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,199
didn't believe that you had left the

68
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,120
truck when you dropped him off to go in

69
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,639
the airport I didn't think he went in

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,840
the airport oh I I was looking for um I

71
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,199
yeah he didn't know and I didn't know

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,000
and we were just like so we have figured

73
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,318
out the mystery it's our good friend

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,840
Mike who had the medtainer full of weed

75
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,839
the medtainer came with us to Toronto we

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
were able to share a joint or two with

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,759

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,000

them that uh well that I needed it to

166
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,279
dab my

167
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,359
hash I called it my stuff and I remember

168
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,679
this security guy going your stuff hey

169
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm like well I

170
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,759
hash you going to get a rip of this Mike

171
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,759
oh sure awesome what was fun is we

172
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
actually came here went Toronto and and

173
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,360
Mark got through the security line

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,199
really quick

175
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,360
but I did not and the reason being is

176
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,680
because in front of me was a bunch of

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,520
family and they had all their baby

178
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
bottles and Juice bottles and they got

179
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,399
searched and they got their stuff taken

180
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,478
apart you see all that but but but the

181
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,879
best part about this whole thing is

182
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,959
after everybody was searched in front of

183
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,680
me all my bags went through the guy

184
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,318
behind me goes I go you know what the

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,598
funny thing is I open up my suitcase

186
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,439
full of weed I said the guy with all the

187
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,719
weed got through with no problem and the

188
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,399
people beside me were just like Mike

189
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,520

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839

we've changed the name so many times

235
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600

236
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,519
marijuana is what you smoke for medicine

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,480
uh hemp is what you use for industrial

238
