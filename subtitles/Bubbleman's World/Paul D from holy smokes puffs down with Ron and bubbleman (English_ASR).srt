that that was last night today two times

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,360
so so last night you did it so we can't

21
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,680

00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,679
where uh sometimes just butter in there

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,040
but anyways mess I burned it first and

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,680
then just just so we can have some hash

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,118
browns I just wanted hash browns and

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
then I left to go get you and to go get

30
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,078
the bubble bubble machine out of the

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,319
shop and everything else get all ready

32
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,919
to go and I had the element on on six

33
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,839
ready ready to put the plate on put the

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
half on I was going to help him and then

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,360
I walk away and I burned the

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,679
butter so now round three you really

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,679
want the

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,519
half it sounds like something I might

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,159
want okay so half are finally making the

40
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,680
pan there dude woohoo hey we're

41
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,120
photographing dry sift

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,840
resin have you got on the uh so we're

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,680
doing some macro photographs this is our

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,680
dirty our one time

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,080
cleaned and our Pure headies just small

46
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:44,839
amounts but uh the lesson is good I

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,159
think the whole process was good look at

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,120
that difference in

49
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,840
color yeah so we can really and I want

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,039
to learn from this lower buds not

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
supply growing the bigger plants and

52
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,439
having the buds lower in the plat so

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
these all one little bit of contaminant

54
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,120
in there but for the most part pretty

55
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,598
darn heavy

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,239
oh Ron was just saying how glad he was

57
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,639
that the camera wasn't on why is that

58
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,280
Ron because here I'm so stoned that that

59
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,598
we I was sitting here and I remember the

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,719
last little episode there we're talking

61
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,399
about how be burnt the B and and and

62
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,039
then I got it going I left the AL do

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,519
went picked up Paul that way down the

64
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,959
road and gone for a long time anyways I

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,680
come back and here I'm talking to you

66
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,200
have a hoot and then I come back I'm

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,280
talking to you guys and I'm I'm thinking

68
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:28,479
I'm stirring heating it up cooking so

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Mark can keep on doing what he's doing

70
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:36,598
and the El start and almost not

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:40,480
on a to without the El on this is how we

72
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:43,679
do here in the cies all right we're

73
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,560
going to try some of this aren't we yeah

74
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,799
you you wanted uh Paul to give it a

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,640
little tast that's any good the colors

76
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,920
are really beautiful the smell how the

77
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,279
smell the smells too things can look

78
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,759
good and they're they're total tops and

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,400
the beautiful thing is is when you have

80
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,479
bit large you can only get good tops

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,319
from bigger plants we all know that it's

82
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,000
t you got a hell of a breed but uh but

83
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:08,119
for Purple Kush and see the they purpled

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,519
out nicely when the girls trim these of

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,519
course when they're Bud fress these are

86
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,319
bone dry but when the girls trim these

87
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,079
that would they would sit there and I'd

88
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:16,519
say look no put a little extra into that

89
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,879
and trim them between and make let's try

90
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,840
to make it look like a cactus in the end

91
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,199
so people can have this buds for you and

92
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,560
uh and so we put a little extra care

93
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,560
into trying to make them all so they're

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,000
all this little nugget stuck otherwise I

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,280
found a purple kush it ends up like this

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,360
here because it's such a tight growing

97
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,839
plant that's so so dense that you can't

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,840
leave that as a bud so then they all end

99
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,719
up being smaller like then you end up

100
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,198
getting a lot of this stuff the which

101
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,280
are still nuggets we should all grow

102
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,240
nuggets if we can agreed you know they

103
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,918
when someone hits the floor it should

104
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,840
have a clunk yeah oops still want to

105
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:53,959
throw them on the floor just tossing his

106
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,679
nugs

107
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,758
around but that's Paul but Paul's going

108
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,478
to roll one up and then then give us a

109
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,160
they're both the same everything's it's

110
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,279
all the same bass

111
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,759
thisen well this is what yeah yeah this

112
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,359
is already let's take a nicer one though

113
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,400
take out nice one let's take it so

114
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,160
that's uh that's

115
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,879
probably yeah let's just because

116
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,960
everybody always wonderers about weight

117
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,279
because everybody always wonders about

118
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,879
weight things when they see they all

119
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,239
that's not a pound of P I'm going to put

120
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,279
that nugget on the scale we see how that

121
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,280
do where is uh oh here it

122
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:33,720

watertight medtainer you can break your

125

cannabis up with it oh no way how do you

126

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,759
could you not hit that with a a badon

148
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,399
racket it would just disinte dry it

149
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,919
would just disintegrate that's the only

150
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,439
way it can be to be safe right to be

151
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,318
putting you know met medtainer should

152
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:55,079
next think about getting getting us

153
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,560
people really high quality uh con bigger

154
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,639
containers so that we can have uh so we

155
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,598
can be confident that there's that uh

156
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,478
that what we put our I have to use a new

157
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:07,759
B bin every time between storages of of

158
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,878
material right just because I just don't

159
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,759
want because I just don't know what's

160
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,759
going on right I like the idea of just

161
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,120
having a screen right on the bottom of

162
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,598
that oh wouldn't that be neat and you

163
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,560
could just I should make without

164
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,560

00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,879
your whole house used to smell like

00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,720
skunk man Sam or whoever you are or

235

true fat Leaf big old nugget we uh man

237
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,319
those I heard I heard bikers had it

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,240
breed out like there was a lot of biker

239
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,079
weed that they didn't anybody had

240
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,278
control breing it out I we just lost it

241
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,439
because we were all afraid of getting

242
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:53,519
busted because we didn't have can

243
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,639
filters back then it's true lot of

244
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
people wouldn't buy it if it was too

245
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,720
stinky back in the 60s or L late 60s

246
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,399
early 70s probably 75 something we used

247
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,040
to have one big skunk plant in the

248
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,919
closet one 1000 wat light good air good

249
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,679
air in and out as much as we could that

250
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:11,078
plant stunk one one plant one 1,000

251
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,838
Watts that was the old days and if you

252
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,559
got made it by you made it by you're

253
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,000
lucky but you wouldn't believe how many

254
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,838
times the neighbors would always say hey

255
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,759
I don't care what you're doing and then

256
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,800
of course filters came in and big rooms

257
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,039
came in and all but then we lost it

258
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,599
because nobody really want everybody was

259
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,240
against that smell was going to kill us

260
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,519
that that smell will kill you yeah

261
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,799
getting now we want her back cuz now now

262
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,159
we can honestly be proud of that smell

263
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,278
walk down the street and smell that

264
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,480
smell we can go hey that guy's growing

265
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,720
some dank all right so we're at we're at

266
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,278
a half of the of that well well rolled

267
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,759
joint by the way Paul and tastes good it

268
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,679
looked good so now it tastes good I

269
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,439
think it's good but you know what I I'm

270
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,719
the grower and I feel hard it's hard

271
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,160
when when Mark's here with me because

272
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,240
when you're smoking dry sift when you're

273
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,759
smoking bubble of the highest qualities

274
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,600
in the world yeah and then you have your

275
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,720
high the best I could grow it pot world

276
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,480
you know like the stuff to try to have

277
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,800
it just it's just so hard for pot

278
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,480
smoking pot to measure up to go in the

279
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,679
same uh it shouldn't be a contest this

280
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,639
is about this is but it's hard anyways

281
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,599
so I feel inferior when I have but pot

282
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,360
that we can make bubble out of when I

283
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,920
got when it's compared to dry sifted

284
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,959
bubble it's really tough so I'm humbled

285
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:30,000
by bubble and and and uh and dry sift I

286
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,078
really am so you have my humility Mark

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,759
I've tried to grow the best bud and I

288
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,679
hope it passes our standards anyways for

289
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,480
what plot oh yeah totally I would

290
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,198
compare it to something like say

291
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,278
moonshine like you can make moonshine

292
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,679
out of your wine you can take your nice

293
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,240
good wine make it into Grappa and it's

294
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,039
the Grappa is way stronger it'll kick

295
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,320
your ass but there's something to the

296
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,480
wine you know it's got its subtle

297
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,760
overtones and its tastes and that that's

298
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
what the bud has you know yeah you can

299
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,480
you can extract it make it way stronger

300
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,199
with so holy smoke what do you give it

301
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,959
is it is it does it deserve to be holy

302
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:03,719
smoke oh yeah this is AA a quadruple a

303
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,638
maybe even the way it's trimmed and

304
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,959
stuff triple

305
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:12,240
A oh it's so hard to get that seriously

306
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:16,000
you feel inferior when you're taking a

307
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,919
what's it call a dab dab of a of a fancy

308
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,679
fany bubbling product and uh and that's

309
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,919
the first thing you wake up to it's but

310
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,000
you know the crazy thing is it's sad we

311
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,399
were saying on the way in the ride when

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,879
I picked you up but the problem is that

313
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,320
it's not available to everybody in the

314
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,159
world yeah you know I I still like good

315
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,680
old low Tech although I got to say like

316
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,159
I love smoking I love this is the first

317
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,958
joint I've smoked in a long time but I

318
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,679
VAP 99% of the time and it gets me

319
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,479
higher it's a way more efficient use of

320
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,359
weed I miss smoking every once in a

321
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
while I'll smoke a joint just to smoke

322
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,600
so with the taste of this Reaper because

323
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,839
I because remember that I also got

324
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,560
scared that this is a this is the first

325
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,000
batch of Reaper I've everever taken down

crisises or or through a little more

333

make also a good bubble house is that

336
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,399

337
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,278

338
