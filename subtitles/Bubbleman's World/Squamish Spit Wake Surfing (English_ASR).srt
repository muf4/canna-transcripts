00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,239
that was a accurate turn either way this

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
is my first time out here really [ __ ]

62
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,519
cool environment pretty stoked to be

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,519
around uh all these people getting into

64
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,319
the sport activities um obviously I'm

65
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,959
not one to smoke a bowl and then sit

66
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,399
around and do nothing I'm one of those

67
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,920
guys that really likes to get active so

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,640
uh I found a little bit of really nice

69
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:09,199
sweet skunk dry sift from my past can't

70
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,479
believe it just popped up out of nowhere

71
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,839
but uh I figure that's what we're going

72
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:16,399
to blast here today so I got the torch I

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,959
got the ship and why don't

74
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,959
we why don't we get started

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,619
[Applause]

76
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:50,519
[Applause]

77
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,599
if you're anything like me you like to

78
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,720
clean your ceramic till it turns white I

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,199
don't like hitting on on the Char in any

80
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,759
way shape or form so we're going to wipe

81
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,759
this one up

82
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,490
[Applause]

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,759
nice all

84
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,759
right I think that'll

85
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,359
do always make sure when you put your

86
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:24,918
torch down that you're careful not to

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,720
put it in a situation where it's going

88
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:30,758
to tip over and burn your truck well

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,120
those birds are really cool floating so

90
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,360
beautifully not sure if you guys can see

91
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,959
those Ravens that are just floating by

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,919
there they're floating on the Wind

93
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,079
barely flying just using the natural

94
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:48,198
wind that is wicked up here really good

95
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:51,680
wind oh yeah very cool

96
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,680
probably right above

97
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,758
us or not all right let's get this down

98
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,159
so we can actually

99
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
hit a nice

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,720
temp

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,680
dab for those of you that know the

102
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,560
ceramic by Brother ship or by Hive it's

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
the same uh company I believe that did

104
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,478
the work for them but they are

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,918
definitely um very thick quality

106
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,758
Ceramics but you really need to have to

107
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,519
heat it up good and once you've heated

108
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,960
it up good it is definitely going to

109
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,719
take about a minute plus uh before it's

110
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,799
cooled down so this is extremely

111
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,599
extremely dry dry sift that I found so

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,439
I'll probably just do a

113
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,639
dunk I suspect that's a very big hit

114
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,639
right

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,639
there all right here we go powdery

116
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,598

120
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,038

121
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:56,439
always nice to see a little bit of

122
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,439
footage dunks up

123
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,879

129
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,400
little clips of the uh of the kipe uh

130
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,639
borders and we'll come back in and do

131
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,439
yet another dab for our way out and

132
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,639
we'll give thanks to the mother ships

133
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,639
had the smallest amount of

134
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,038
water still managed to get it to perk

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,038
see you

136
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,000

all right so I'm back out on the spit

139
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
fairly windy not sure how it's going to

140
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,158
turn up I've turned my phone around so

141
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,479
the um mic isn't picking up the wind but

142
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,038
it can still be picking up the wind so

143
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,550
to give you an idea where I am I'm out

144
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,918
