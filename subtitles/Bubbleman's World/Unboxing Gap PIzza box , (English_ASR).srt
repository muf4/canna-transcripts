00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,520
with a dab because that always seems to

13
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,320
be a good idea we've got some beautiful

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,940

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,840
little bit more height on the camera now

22
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:10,260

26
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,400
company that I found here in Canada so

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,140
it might not be very good for my

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,420
American listeners but I'm telling you

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,640
from the Canadian perspective this is

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,000
really cool I live in a home that does

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,560
not offer delivery really at all there's

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,359
very little delivery that comes to my

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,879
house and So lately I've been looking

34
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,680
into a couple of different companies to

35
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,539
try and find food that can get delivered

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,780
to my house and that's what this box is

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,299
so we're gonna do a quick dab

38
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,400

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,140
little bit more we'll see what happens

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,759
here

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,859
so this is some hash Ross and I'm about

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,080

52
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,719
hash rosin Just Gonna Take A little dab

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,640
not looking to get completely torn right

54
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,639
this second all right

55
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:35,159
wow that was almost like uh

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,340
a low temp dab hit it up a little bit

57
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,340
more

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,080
very light

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,959
that's what you call a tiny tiny little

60
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,739
dab but really

61
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,360
I'm mostly just to dab to make it seem

62
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,319
appropriate for this channel because

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,200
this channel is full-blown dab content

64
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,299
but I do want to show you guys this okay

65
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,098
so I just got this

66
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,420
this is the general

67
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,919
Pizza

68
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:13,079
assembly this company is called GA Pizza

69
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,598
Gap pizza.com if you want to check them

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,340
out so like I said I live in a place

71
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,919
where very few people deliver it's

72
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,979
ridiculous and so I ordered from this

73
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,079
company you can go check them out at

74
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:27,840
g-a-p-i-z-z-a.com and this is how the

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,280
Box arrives right a little bit of a lift

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,219
here

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,900
a little bit of dry ice right maybe do a

78
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,818
little sifting later with that we'll see

79
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,760
be careful when you're touching dry ice

80
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,339
it can burn and hurt your fingers that

81
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,979
was close right there so here's what we

82
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,860
got inside of here we got these

83
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:50,219
beautiful Italian style thin crust

84
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,580
pizzas this one is the cheese Wizard

85
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:57,840
it's got provolone mozzarella Grana

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,400
padona padana and pecorino Romano just

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,439
for this pizza right here so I ordered

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,319
two of these ones because I thought

89
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,780
I need two of those

90
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:10,378
then I got three of these this is the

91
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,438
Mila Margarita this has mozzarella Grana

92
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:15,298
padona and basil and that is that

93
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,579
particular Pizza in a nutshell I

94
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,340
actually got three of these because

95
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,100
Margarita is actually my pizza so

96
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,859
there's three of those

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:29,520
and then finally I got these plant-based

98
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,460
pizzas this one is a plant-based

99
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,159
mozzarella pumpkin seed parmesan and

100
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:38,159
fresh basil so this has no dairy in it

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,800
it's just a kind of a plant-based vegan

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,740
pizza if you will and I actually ended

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,240
up getting three of these as well I

104
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,460
don't have to pull them all out I'm sure

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,800
so

106
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,899
eight pizzas in total cost me 80

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,819
Canadian dollars with delivery they

108
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,899
delivered them right to my door and I do

109
00:04:53,819 --> 00:05:00,000
not live uh in a close area uh for for

110
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,739
delivery so I was really stoked on this

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,579
and I figured you know what it's not

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,680
exactly cannabis uh content but let's be

113
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,198
honest we all know one of the major side

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,240
effects of inhaling cannabinoids and

115
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,819
terpenes

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,259
is ordering pizzas and now if you're in

117
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,819
Canada anyway you might be able to do it

118
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,139
in America I'm not saying you can't but

119
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,759
I know that this is a Canadian company

120
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,000
or at least that I was able to order

121
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,400
from them here in Canada so go check it

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,160
out the next unboxing video I'll be

123
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,339
doing for food is going to be the salad

124
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,800
company that I found they are called

125
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,359
inspired

126
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,699
go.ca or.com you can Google that and

127
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,199

128
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,879
gonna take another dab because that

129
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,900
first dab

130
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,639
it wasn't much let's be honest there was

131
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,179
not much of a dab there so we're gonna

132
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,019
put our second marble set together here

133
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,019
keep this little guy

134
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,139
little guy and dab it down

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,939

136
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,860

144
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,259
call that show but it's going to end up

145
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,258
on the YouTube channel as well

146
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,600

147
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,000
of that content and then these little

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,800
unboxing videos of something that's not

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,720
actually a product that someone sent me

150
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,180
but actually products that I myself have

151
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,460
ordered so you know the pizzas and then

152
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,019
the salads as well were just spectacular

153
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,239
I couldn't believe how fresh they

154
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,918
arrived um we ate them all before I was

155
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,680
able to do any type of unboxing video

156
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,899

that actually have deep knowledge uh Max

168
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,740
and Dom are the guys you want to go see

169
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,918
foreign

170
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,180
much better

171
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,819
that's it so you guys can't really see

172
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:38,038
this but off camera I am dunking so I've

173
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,860
got my little isopropanol vial right

174
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,259
here I don't have my Banger basket yet

175
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,038
from Mike lagru but I am a waiting one

176
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,620
and it's just a quick clean full dunk of

177
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,659
the Banger and I'll be honest

178
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,538
I haven't tried it yet with DC glass

179
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,280
cleaner I will for certain do that but

180
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:59,159
um there's just no way to clean these

181
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,038
tarp slurpers with with um with Q-tips

182
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,800
if you hit them enough little bits of

183
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,779
resin end up getting locked away and uh

184
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,780
it just won't stay new and these are so

185
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,638
valuable and and so precious to me uh

186
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,859
that I am just down with taking the

187
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,199
utmost delicate care of them and so

188
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,939
that's what's happening there in the

189
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,240
meantime I don't think there's much else

190
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,240
to say

191
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,038
toaster oven and see how well they taste

192
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,500
I you know from everything I've seen

193
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,300
they look and taste delicious for now

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,639
may the full male bless your bowl sooner

195
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,580
than later I may go cook a pizza and let

196
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:42,080
you know how it is

197
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:45,500
[Music]

198
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,500
no no no no no no no
