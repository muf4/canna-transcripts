little bit of an experience on the

motorcycle there I pulled up and I went

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
to park the bike and I I put my foot

21
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:59,558
down and there was a bunch of mud there

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
I didn't realize how thick it was and

23
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:04,679
when I put my foot down my foot slid

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,159
just enough to pull the bike

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,799
over woo it pulled all my momentum all

26
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,520

nice little dab spot to bring uh the

55
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,878

81
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:00,039
way propped up in a way so that it

82
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:01,238
actually lights us up now probably it

83
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,679
won't be the best

84
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,480

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,120
um I'm not even sure where I put the

110
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:53,240
nail I know I pulled it out oh there it

111
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,199
is the nail always comes in handy with

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,160
the

113
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,160
Hitman so we'll pop that on

114
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,000
there all right all right so try to

115
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,478
stand at a reasonable distance so I'm

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,680
not right up on the camera with my head

117
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,240
chopped out of it but uh I don't really

118
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,439
have a table here so it's going to be a

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,960
little

120
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,360
bit of a of a

121
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:17,879
workout especially for the dabs going to

122

dabbing on the Pacific Ocean and if you

125
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:29,079
guys want to learn where this particular

126
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:32,758
place is um when you're heading uh South

127
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,800
uh North nor West Northwest on Marine

128

Drive which is Marine Drive North which

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
when you come off of uh the Lion's Gate

130
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:39,639
Bridge if you go left or right you're

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,478
going into North Vancouver or West

132
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,519
Vancouver you want to take the West

133
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:45,879
Vancouver left which wraps around and

134
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,318
takes you uh towards Whistler the lower

135
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,639
It's The Old Highway basically before

136
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,080
the big Highway got put in and as you

137
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:56,598
pass the gas station about 6 km from the

138
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,680
bridge um you'll come up to a bridge and

139
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,038
I I showed it a little bit it's got uh

140
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,360
it's basically and I'll show it right at

141
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,360
the end of the video so you guys get an

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,000
idea where it is there's just a

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,598
staircase right next to the end of this

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,598
little Bridge there's uh rails on each

145
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,279
side that are kind of silver and white

146
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,639
and at the at the end you just pull in

147
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,478
I'll name I'll give you guys the street

148
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,000
name as well when we get up there and um

149
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:18,519
yeah there's just the staircase you come

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,319
down here and there's literally this

151
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,359
epic beautiful almost private beach I'm

152
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,520
not sure if you guys can see there's

153
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,919
some people right there look I'm

154
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,918
squashing their heads squashing their

155
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,519
heads any new K Kids in the Hall fans

156
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:36,159
out there remember the squashing your

157
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:38,000
heads video that was classic classic

158
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,199
hilarity all right so we're doing a

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,639
brave move here we've got the

160
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,840
dab on the Dabber and we're now going to

161
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,120
heat up our

162
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,839
nail outside dabbing is always a little

163
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,519
bit tricky just because you can't really

164
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,158
see the heat of the nail I go by the

165
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,478
sound as long as the torch is making the

166
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:56,719
right sound I know that I'm uh I'm

167
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:00,158
heating it up

168
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,000
good and uh luckily it's not windy at
