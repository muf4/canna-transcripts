12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,879

the Olympics and go 125 mph up on an ice

16
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,439
wall and the whole nine yards so uh the

17
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:01,558
unity in the community team it's pretty

18
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,560
exciting I wonder if they'll let us

19
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:08,039
purchase a video of us sliding down in

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,829
the bob sled cuz that would be if we if

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,360
we can do that you're right I will

22
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:15,840
[Music]

23
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,000
absolutely shaking around going around

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
the

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,560
corner tell it's exciting it really look

26
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,640
it up look it up Whistler uh Bob

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
sledding uh you can see you read the

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,159
whole thing and one of the things says

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,200
that be prepared for extremely or fairly

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,159
strenuous workout so I mean everything

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,399
like Flav mentioned earlier he said

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,118
everything in Whistler is hard and any

33
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,799
sort

34
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,799
of if you can't get in and out of the

35
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
Bob site you're not allowed to go yeah

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,520
there's a whole list of things that you

37
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,159
don't fit if you can't keep up with them

38
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:49,920
running with the Bob said you might get

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,920
dragged dude if you weigh too much if

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,280
you weigh too little ran over by Matt

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,118
ran over by the mark Matt whoever you

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,399
know the break

43
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,239
guy o I hope I'm not in charge of

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,599
breaking I want to steer I'm steering

45
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,519
hell

46
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:10,439
yeah iig I don't think they let you

47
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,280
steer I originally thought you were

48
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,560
actually going to do the

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,080
skeleton I don't know you can do the

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,598
skeleton but it's like what do you do

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,480
they just CU you go head first with the

52
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,959
skeleton do you just I can't believe you

53
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:28,439
tuck your arms in and you just go they

54
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,319
must I think they do I think they just

55
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,000
DRP you in and there's nothing you can

56
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,598
do and you just s it blew me away that

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,759
they let people do that but it's only

58
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,280
like like a quarter of the track with

59
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:42,199
the skeleton so I I just don't think it

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,878
has the you have the option to gain the

61
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:49,479
150 km an hour that the real skeleton

62
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,959
Pros get to right yeah exactly so this

63
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,079
is that

64
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,719
seven-year Master

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,440
cush tastes nothing like Master Kush now

66
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,840
tastes like the most insane like

67
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,840
perfumey hash

68
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,280

171
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,759

172
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,120
much smaller wiener than

173
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,120

heat how you feeling about this Dave I'm

371
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,078
feeling pretty excited about this

372
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:24,160
actually I am too I'm suppar to go down

373
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:25,838
120k down down a slope 125 km an hour

374
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,960
dabbed out of our

375
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,918
skulls dabbed out of your skulls

376
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,558
I'm

377
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,559
prank to to who I don't know I don't

378
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,679
know

379
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,600
perfect uh

380
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,600
so um basically what what we've done

381
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,879
already

382
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:55,199
be probably quicker today ni and cold in

383
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,280
the quick uh and you're going to

384
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,240
experience with three 4GS in the last

385
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,798
corner

386
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,720
okay uh I ne worse fear when they come

387
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:07,960
here uh if you crash okay so we we sent

388
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,200
over 6,000 SLS last season and we didn't

389
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,960
have a single crash so it is still a

390
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,519
possibility this is an movement for uh

391
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,440
there is a possibility the side might

392
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,440
take over uh so in that case what we

393
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,759
want you to do is p on nice and tight

394
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,360
we're going to get you to make yourself

395
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,279
as small as possible so how to do that

396
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,119
is top your head in towards your knees

397
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,918
there's nice big high backs on the side

398
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,839
which will protect you and we come get

399
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,640
you out as soon as we can but don't

400
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,798
worry about it

401
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,280
today so um uping out we don't like

402
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,599
force anyone to get into the S if

403
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,599
another point you feel super

404
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,319
uncomfortable then it is okay to back

405
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:50,639
out um what I would say is you go to the

406
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:53,678
start at least talk to the pilot talk to

407
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,640
the Traer talk to us uh will make you

408
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,080
try and feel more comfortable everyone

409
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,280
seems to be a lot more comfortable once

410
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,798
they see the pilots what Happ now is

411
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,558
we're all going to walk down the corner

412
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,558
16 the first six people are going to go

413
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,119
up in the van and then everyone else is

414
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:09,079
going to watch the first two sleds

415
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,319
coming down which is pretty cool so uh

416
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:14,079
from there then we'll get you up uh in

417
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:16,759
two sleds at a time and uh yeah let's

418
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,519
see if finish so I'll just follow

419
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:22,079

420
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,079

425
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,480
down the sliding Center I guess we're

426
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,480
going to going to see inside

427
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,678

470
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,278
seen them bring the cable up from the

471
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,440
peak to Peak Gondola there's like a

472
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:01,759
documentary on it it was pretty wild wow

473
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,519
I think it's on like massive

474
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,558
construction that job massive called

475
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,720
massive how do they get the cable from

476
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,798
one side to the other uh they actually

477
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,679
just strain along the valley floor yep

478
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,519
and then slowly tighten it up they to

479
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,038
cut they had to cut like a path oh yeah

480
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,918
they cut a lot of trees which actually a

481
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:19,480
really nice ski run so thick on both

482
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,200
sides but I'll tell you if you don't

483
