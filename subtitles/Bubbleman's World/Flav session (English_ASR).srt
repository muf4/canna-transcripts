uh yeah let me go like this this is the

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,799
one that I want to really hit is this

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,600
going to come out nicely y yeah no very

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,719
well comes out always very nicely when

47
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,640
it's warm so I like that all right so

48
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:59,959
tell me about this little cup piece that

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,759
one is the team Japan cup from treating

50
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,399
myself don't ask me what year I don't

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,519
know I think 2012 2015 something like

52
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:10,560
that years ago cup piece it was the it

53
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:12,439
was the first team Japan collab that

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,360
they did together in a slop cup other

55
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,400
than the

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,280
um um practice cup that they did that uh

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,239
Marco Rena had that I think he actually

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,640
no longer has but anymore but did have

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,120
and um it was the one that was the

60
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,958
competition piece that was made it was

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,280
uh dke and uh Rose uh

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,878
condo and

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:42,479
um Rose roads kajima um and they were up

64
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:46,120
against Carlson and I think delene and

65
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:51,000
Aaron serson oh yeah and Team Canada was

66
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:53,759
uh Stratus and Corey and JT glass I

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,719
think the detail on that is so insane

68
00:02:53,759 --> 00:03:00,359
yes it's so the dot work is ridiculous

69
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,239
yes like ridiculous

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,000
wish you guys could see oh wait I can

71
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,039
take pictures and you can yes and

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
actually you know what actually I'm

73
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,199
going to go off camera for half a second

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,680
so I'm just going to go and get the

75
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,079
accessories that came with this cuz yeah

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,680
they're pretty [ __ ] oh yeah you got to

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
see the accessories for certain I'll

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
tell you one thing I haven't hit a ton

79
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,079
of these uh cups but I really love the

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,158
way truly you're holding a cup in your

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,159
hand and you're sucking out of a straw

82
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,280
yes whether it's made of glass or not

83
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,679
the feeling of holding a cup and a straw

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
is so common and you're so used to it

85
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,799
that it's really quite a neat effect to

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
be getting a rip while doing that and I

87
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,200
got to I got to give it up to these guys

88
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,199
they definitely did the most ridiculous

89
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,158
I was at this event and uh I walked by I

90
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,280
took some photos of these guys blowing

91
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,919
uh different components of the pieces if

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,878
I can find them I'll share them on this

93
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,438
video it's always a bit of a pain in the

94
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,399
butt uh but yeah here we go we got what

95
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:57,039
do you have the stamp okay well it's uh

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
the Dabber a

97
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,959
Dabber I I call this is this is the

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,438
perfect rosin press cuz if we literally

99
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,199
squeeze like a 100 G of rosin out right

100
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,680
now you could pick it up with this flat

101
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:12,078
part so good it's a paper weight and it

102
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,840
has two go up nice and close and then

103
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,959
put your hand behind your other hand so

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
it focuses in on it like go close close

105
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,478
close block out the whole screen and

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,240
then the camera will grab it once I get

107
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:27,439
out of the way do it grab There It

108

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
close to that

that I always have to do and it's so

120
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,879
nice to be able to just sit here and

121
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,879
puff a bowl while my bro does it yeah

122

125
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,119
close of

126
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,319

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,319
bubble man

128
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,000
puffing W this is like one of the only

129
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,039
pieces you shouldn't here get rid of me

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,199
and before you it's you really have to

131
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,199
like block out almost

132
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:33,560
everything there you go almost

133
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:37,079
that looks cool no it's not clear

134
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,079
though now it's clear yeah

135
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,478
boom might be able to take your hand

136
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,359
away

137
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,639
now all right well I'm going to hit some

138
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,759
of that rosin right there little OG

139
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,439
rosin I think I still have some almost

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,439
thought I got my

141
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,279
head just in case you need more

142
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,639
[Music]

143
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,199
I really like that yeah I love that

144
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,759
piece you know there's so many times

145
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,520
that you'll see a beautiful piece and

146
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,598
then you'll take a hit out of it and be

147
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,680
utterly and completely

148
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,439
disappointed I'm not going to name names

149
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,199
or name pieces that's not my my my

150
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,319
mission uh but I really do appreciate a

151
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,520
piece that comes together as much in the

152
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,240
function as it does in the artistic ver

153
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,639
uh totally agree

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
and that's what I love about Mothership

155
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:38,360
actually is that the function like the

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,800
scientific um function of the pipes are

157
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,160
as on par as what you know people like

158
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,960
to think about the well you know what

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,000
it's exactly true they turned Proto into

160
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,959
art yeah they people are like that's

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,038
just a Proto piece it's like yeah say

162
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,719
that about any Fab egg it is just a

163
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,519
Proto piece but really anytime you saw

164
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,520
that for the first time really your jaw

165
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,000
hit the floor and you were like that is

166
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:03,799
beautiful how did they come up with that

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,680
what Brilliance did that come out of so

168
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,478
you really can't deny that the function

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,120
is so great that even without the

170
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,199
artistic the function is the art yes

171
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,120
when function becomes art M yeah yeah

172
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,879
and it's taken like the whole scientific

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,360
thing to another level like I mean there

174
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,599
were the the to certain Tauros that are

175
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,919
unique and like one off ones sort of and

176
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,360
you know ones that are more work than

177
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:32,240
others and this that and the next thing

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,520
but but um with Mothership it's really

179
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,800
it's taken it to to the very next level

180
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:41,598
where even the most basic production

181
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,360
piece is also so artistic mhm yeah and

182

since this is the Taurus piece and this

219
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,120
is the clein piece and that's the Fab

220
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,079
it's the Fab Taurus clim H technically

221
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,560
speaking just you know people being

222
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,479
[ __ ] you know liking the one at the I

223
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,799
think it's the Taurus Fab Klein dude

224
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,800
it's the

225
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,958
TFK dude this thing has a dish for a for

226
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:43,838
a base like there's literally it's you

227
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,439
could put water in here and it would

228
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,000
stay in there and it's quite you know

229
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,560
deeper than it looks for as small as the

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,799
plate is really piece of that's the uh

231
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,599
the September shot for their month's uh

232
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,479
this month's uh

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,959
calendar yeah that's why I've been

234
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,560
puffing on it cuz someone tagged me into

235
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,479
their photo of um some mentioned it yeah

236
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,239
and um yeah and I was like oh [ __ ] I

237
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,480
haven't hit you in a while let's get you

238
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,320
back the thing is ridiculous it is like

239
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,039
it's like it's more than you expect it's

240
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,560
it would be like driving a a superar and

241
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,120
then you get in and you give it gas and

242
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,679
you're like holy [ __ ] that went way

243
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,799
faster than I had

244
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,958
anticipated exactly that's it right

245
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,679
there so I guess I should probably uh

246
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:31,319
rip this better yo [ __ ]

247
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,319
yeah always

248
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,679
ripping great way to exchange nails with

249
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
that drop down the drop down if it was

250
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,759
only for that it would be a good idea

251
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,719
the drop Down's a necessity to life uh

252
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:46,078
it really is you know they're just like

253
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,200
enail I I love enails I think they're

254
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,879
fantastically convenient devices the

255
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,600
only thing that's ever sort of sketched

256
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,240
me out is the extra weight you know like

257
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,959
I mean like a unit like this is really

258
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,399
nice cuz there's it doesn't add an extra

259
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:01,078
amount of weight the drop down keeps the

260
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,519
heat Source away from from the piece yep

261
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,719
um although I usually personally I find

262
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,000
that this is a little bit like asking

263
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,759
for it I'll usually have my drop down

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,320
pieces turned in almost as much as

265
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,879
possible and much closer to my piece I

266
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,639
just feel I do that with my Taurus I

267
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,000
bring it really into especially with

268
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,200
this particular nail cuz it's really a

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,639
beast it's a beast true oh yeah she gets

270
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,480
the job done we're talking about of

271
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:32,519
course the uh silicon carbide uh hybrid

272
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,519
titanium nail from denail wonderful

273
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,799
little unit I actually I actually

274
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,039
ordered one two weeks ago this is my own

275
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,519
little creation this is from enrio

276
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:46,240
sublimator oh yeah and this is the piece

277
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:49,600
that actually fits this oh go so they

278
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,680
denil had a very tiny tiny little tube

279
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
and it would get hot especially if you

280
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,120
wanted a real nice slow dab and leave

281
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,120
that thing on there for for a bit so

282
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,480
super small gauge I just took Enrico's

283
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,560
piece and put it on the little guy works

284
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,480

everyone up to the third floor and it

438
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,319
took like hours to get everyone up there

439
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,558
and then simultaneously everyone wanted

440
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,319
to leave and it took hours to leave

441
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,000

443
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,720
in my life so I I can't claim to have

444
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,359
have been to them all but no me neither

445

of them yep all Amsterdam ones they'll

450
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,159
miss it more than anyone and are they go

451
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,759
to Jamaica I can imagine that they'll be

452
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,200
there I'd have a hard time if they

453
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,640
weren't it would be insane if they

454
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,759
didn't make they have to judge the the

455
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,759
Legends absolutely you know and

456
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,599

457
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:48,240
Michael Rich our longtime friend uh who

458
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,918
passed away recently in Amsterdam uh and

459
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,440
one of the founders of Legends uh of

460
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,080
hash uh maybe we'll be celebrating him

461
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,919
this year in Jamaica that would be

462
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,558
[ __ ] cool you know cuz I remember

463
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,240
someone said it a couple years ago you

464
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:03,079
know it won't be long before you guys

465
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,480
are celebrating us old guys once we

466
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:07,960
start passing away so I even remember

467
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,599
when I heard them say that I I felt a

468
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,558
weird feeling like ah cuz you know it's

469
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,759
true it's not a mystery you know so sure

470
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,200
you might yeah people die and the older

471
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,279
they get uh the more likely it

472
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,080
becomes it's just sort of the equation

473
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,759
that you can't sort of avoid yeah it's

474
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:26,798
