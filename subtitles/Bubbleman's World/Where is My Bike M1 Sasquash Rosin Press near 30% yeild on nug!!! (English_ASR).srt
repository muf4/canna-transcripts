00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,219
hey guys welcome to bubble man's world

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,900
today we're with the Sasquatch Rasen

4
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:18,179
press team and we're gonna be squishing

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,980
up a little where is my bike from karma

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,070
genetics we're gonna be squishing it on

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,839
the m1 the rosin press the Sasquatch

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,050
wasn't pressed teen was cool enough to

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:43,850
fly right up and do the first press with

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:51,929
me that tells us this an 8 gram press

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:54,480
guys before a grand press now we'll know

12
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,659
where we stand and this is the headband

13
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,000
again or the head this is the where's my

14
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,238
bike this is the one I'm really excited

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,238
about

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:18,299
Wow it looks almost the same size yeah

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:20,549
where's my where's my bikes got the

18
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,720
major we're gonna see a good squish off

19
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:29,219
of eight grams aren't we

20
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:32,060
let's do it right boys and girls men and

21
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,060
women

22
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:41,539
I'm gonna collect that I feel like the

23
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:44,120
best thing I could do is just sit on my

24
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,470
ass and throw all of this hey what you

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:55,010
got over there with that pump thing

26
00:01:45,469 --> 00:02:12,650
there thingamajiggy three little quick

27
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:14,390
gas pumps and you're ready to rock no

28
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,240
it's good to see like little mistakes

29
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:19,819
and recoveries and sort of flap upward

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,909
so if you hear to grab you don't slide

31
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,229
your bag across your freshly-made rosin

32
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:40,939
it's always talking about that little

33
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:42,469
there we go pre squish depending on what

34
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:44,180
temperature you're at your pre squish is

35
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:48,019
gonna be between like five to ten

36
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:51,469
seconds not really mm-hmm much I always

37
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:53,810
just did it intuitively and sometimes

38
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:57,139
like I mean a lot of times two people

39
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,909
don't do a preheat right it's not always

40
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,649
recommended with certain strains

41
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,639
sometimes just wanna [ __ ] start

42
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,980
dumping instantly so uh a preheats not

43
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,518
really nice like this bike pretty my

44
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:15,349
dark and your product and with certain

45
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:25,879
strains so there's no we should actually

46
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:29,469
got you a gauge oh yeah the pressure

47
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,469
gauge I can get one

48
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:43,990
this is yes looking really nice spot you

49
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,960
said this is a month old - or like

50
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:55,689
months three months so you said two

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:04:20,379
months well taken care of dude for sure

52
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:23,230
smell it you try to get most of it out

53
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,500
on the first squish as well oh yeah for

54
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,860
sure

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,430
90% a lot of times there does nothing

56
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,910
comes out on the second dress yeah like

57
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,620
I don't do second presses just because

58
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,240
there's nothing there something else

59
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,840
yeah I'll give them the people who've

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,960
make it up well yeah but yeah some

61
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,259
people make like coconut capsules just

62
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:52,649
whatever took them down with some

63
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:52,649
coconut oil just make some capsules

64

65
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:14,070
by the cb1 and cb2

66
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,069
[Music]

67
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:23,789
it's such a nice color look at this so

68
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:27,319
people are aware here you want to see

69
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,580
this you can see the corners of the bag

70
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,279
when the weed is packed in here it

71
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:37,740
wasn't squared out yeah so these corners

72
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:41,250
after the fold when you make the fold it

73
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,990
got some oil trapped so like what you

74
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:47,430
want to do is try to square out

75
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,769
everything as much as possible make it

76
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,970
nice and square not have any kind of

77
00:05:49,769 --> 00:06:01,439
rounded edges so that when you fold it

78
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:03,930
over it has no voids in the corners try

79
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:12,300
to make sure those corners are packed up

80
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:14,449
as well I'll get this one we'll be able

81
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,449
to

82
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:46,180
smell that further away I'm like right

83
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:48,430
there oh yeah all right so let's see

84
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:55,449
what this is if that ended up being two

85
00:06:48,430 --> 00:07:01,209
point three holy crap eight 25% would be

86
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:04,080
you two so it's two point three twenty

87
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:07,568
eight twenty nine percent or something

88
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:21,188
thirty percent yield on that where's my

89
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:22,520
bike that's a good that's a beautiful

90
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:25,680
beautiful
