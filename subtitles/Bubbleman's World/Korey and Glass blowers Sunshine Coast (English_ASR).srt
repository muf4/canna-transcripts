00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,199
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world I

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,199
am just uh doing a little session out

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,359
here on the hood of my truck beautiful

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,519
morning here in British Columbia we're

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,239
about to actually head over to the

7
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,879
sunshine coast to visit Cory and

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,200
Stratosphere they've got a bunch of

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,600
glass blowers over there and they've

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,600
been doing some wonderful things for the

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
last couple of weeks unfortunately they

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,679
ran out of oxygen the other day so we

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,280
won't be seeing them actually do their

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,640
trade but we will be lucky enough to see

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,000
the entire group of um pieces that were

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,759
made for the show down at Mr EDS in La a

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,519
gallery that I guess is organizing them

18
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,479
so I

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,480
think I think it's time for a little

20
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,479
blast

21
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,478
all right so we got a little little bit

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:20,478
of concentrated X for the morning

23
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,478
blast M nice nice

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:29,520
nice it's definitely like dry sift

25
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,919
butter not the easiest thing to collect

26
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,920
but

27
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:38,719
patience is a

28
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,959
virtue all right

29
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,319
so pretty stoked on heading over there

30
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,359
going to see Flav as well today going to

31
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,559
go see Flav and uh check out some of his

32
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,799
collection that we haven't seen in a

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
long time and just had an overall

34
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,880
wonderful session with him it's been

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,960
months since I've seen him he's got a

36
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,798
tarpine delivery coming so he's going to

37
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,879
be quite excited about his flavors that

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,439
are coming coming to him today so maybe

39
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,879
we'll do a little tarpine Gauntlet we'll

40
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:05,478
see what happens happens not exactly

41
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,000
sure how it's going to play out but uh

42
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,000
looking forward to the day nonetheless

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,039
it's just beautiful got the Drone so I'm

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,560
unfortunately I'm sure I'm not able to

45
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,639
drone uh on the ferry but

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
guaranteed we will be droning on the

47
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,679
Sunshine Coast today for sure we'll

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,959
figure out some nice footage for you

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,599
guys to

50
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,598
see all right here we go

51
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,280
took a tiny little bit of water in the

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,200
mouth there but um well it's always more

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,759
enjoyable when it's the fresh fresh cold

54
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,439
water that hasn't had a single hit

55
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,919
thrown gone through it so uh yeah give

56
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,199
thanks to the Hitman little baby cakes

57
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,359
there little piece I picked up in Spain

58
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,039
a couple years ago and it's really

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,560
served me well it's been pretty strong

60
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,120
it's dropped a numerous times it's never

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,560
broken and uh it's always gotten the job

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,920
done so shout out to them for making a

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,400
cool little pipe like that and I guess

64
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,878
really all there's left to do is drive

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,480
to the ferry so of course I'm going to

66
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,359
bring you guys along with me show you a

67
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,959
little bit of the road on the way there

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,760
and then maybe once we get to the ferry

69
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,689
we can uh chill out and have another

70
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:38,139

well as always I've gotten here to the

82
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:18,240
ferry a little bit early which is uh

83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,160
definitely better than showing up a

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,720
little bit late I'm not going to lie

85
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,039
been sitting here for a while now and

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,479

session sweet little unit easy to use

89
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,279
and uh a lot less overpowering than uh

90
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,519
than the concentrates obviously which is

91
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,399
generally what I appreciate and am

92
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,879
looking for but sometimes it's just nice

93
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,159
to have a little hit of J herbs and of

94
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,319
course there's all of you out there that

95

have been telling me for years there's

96
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,680
just something different about the herbs

97
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,720
well of course there's something

98
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,560
different about the herbs it's the herbs

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,720

179
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,519
say put a little bit less than last time

180
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,120

181
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,399

185
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,278
mil maybe a

186
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,919

titanium Nails I've never done it myself

192
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:36,078

193
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,919

195
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,078
themselves all right so we'll put that

196
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,680
away nice if I could find my carb cap I

197
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:49,399
don't think I'm going

198
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:51,359
to well it happens like that sometimes

199
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,360
it is what it is no carb cap for this

200
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360

[Music]

204
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,639
well that was just about perfect aside

205
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,560
from the fact that I dropped my Dabber

206
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:23,759
got a few

207
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:26,000
carpet skirs on the Dabber

208
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,120
but that can always be cleaned off and

209
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
in the

210
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,519
meantime I'm going to wait until the

211
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,440
ferry gets to the end and uh we'll

212
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,959
continue our journey towards

213
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,839
Stratosphere and Cory glass to see what

214
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,838

00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,000
little intro seeing as though I filmed

225

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,360

227
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,318

keys around my neck is this safe that's

271

easy I'm driving no no no although if

272
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,959
you had it in your hand and you were

273
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,439
swinging it around like this as you were

274
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,919
dabbing that might be a little sick you

275
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,558
know you know what that's still too

276
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,280
nerve-wracking for me one of these just

277
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,759
catching it totally it's like well how

278
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,199
about it just be like the most

279
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,759
respectfully you can when you hit a

280
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,160
piece like that and there's a lot of

281
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,079
little hooks that you can grab on to and

282
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,279
send that thing for sure owe it to

283
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,798
yourself to be wary and take care and if

284
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,079
you're not comfortable don't don't it's

285
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:40,079
it's I would actually say it's the

286
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:42,199
probably the most the the most breakable

287
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,759
piece that I own the one that has the

288
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,919
most amount of fine detail fragility

289
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,279
when it comes to like the butterflies

290
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,000
and the flowers and this is even

291
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,119
compared to hands and the legs and the

292
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,679
fingers every single aspect of the whole

293
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:59,639
piece and the leaf that's thin scre it

294
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,679
deserves the most um care and respect in

295
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,559
that sense when handling it it's in good

296
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,360
hands yeah it is in good hands at least

297
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,918
absolutely well I'm looking forward to

298
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:09,399

00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,358
30 seconds or 40 45 somewhere in between

696
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,599
easy enough to find out easy enough to

699
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:47,838
faceted ones over here also so this next

700
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:50,598
one here is a cubic cycler that I made

701
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:54,759
with uh hippo glass so all hippo glasses

702
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:57,079
fume sections with uh a bunch of hippos

703
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,800
marbles really stoked on this piece I

704
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:02,599
love like this one out in the sunlight

705
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,160
is so nice come on yeah that is a nice

706
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:08,680
piece it looks straight up

707
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:12,078
like like Plumbing yeah yeah it is you

708
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:12,078
know it's really

709
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:20,399
cool she pulls back that one nice pull

710
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,839
on it thank you and then uh the next one

711
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,720
we have is similar design so this one's

712
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:27,799
with uh John costic and this one's got

713
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:30,519
the Lucy over

714
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,359
uh lemon drop yeah you can't even notice

715
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:34,239
the Lucy it looks like straight lemon

716
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:36,920
drop and with the UV it just pops right

717
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,559
out same thing yeah same thing it's got

718
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,440
it as the crop circles so under when

719
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,920
it's a little darker it really pops out

720
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,318
it's harder to see with the bright

721
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,440
lights man that's nice though yeah we'll

722
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:51,358
definitely make sure we get some some

723
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,720
photos on all of these and then uh the

724
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:57,559
next one's uh just myself so slightly

725
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:00,039
different uh take on that design I

726
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,799
switched around a triangle and uh piping

727
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,759
goes a little different few more horns

728
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,519
on this one yeah beautiful I really like

729
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,880
this one thanks it's definitely got that

730
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,358
Personal Touch to it mhm the the ones

731
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,800
that I've made in the past are a lot

732
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,880
bigger than these ones they're they were

733
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,519
uh 3 and 1/2 in squares I knock these

734
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,200
ones down to uh 2 in squares so they're

735
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,599
compact a little more comfy in the hand

736
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,639
you got to make your own bangers for

737
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,000
this that they're also Square yeah those

738
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,679
will be coming you know not just like

739
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,039
the trough but something

740
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,318
square and it really go so nice with

741
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,960
this whole concept to have when you're

742
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,639
sitting there's something comforting

743
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,480
about just seeing glass in shapes that

744
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,118
aren't the standard vessels you know I

745
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,599
love standard vessels I love all the

746
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,680
different jars and all the different

747
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,720
sort of vase type things that you can do

748
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,679
but this is just kind of really a cool

749
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,279
concept where you've got like a little

750
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,039
cube of glass in your hand thanks I've

751
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,280

752
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:58,358
norm and uh doing what everybody else is

753
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,920

these guys who do this amazing artwork

785
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,000
and of course focus on the plant that we

786
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,960
love by creating pipes to you know use

787
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,480
for cannabis and cannabis concentrates

788
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,199
it's just a wonderful thing that we've

789
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,559
come such a long way that it's not so

790
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,399
much fighting the law anymore and the

791
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,319
worry of having your pipe shop busted

792
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,880
and having your pipes taken away it's uh

793
00:44:43,318 --> 00:44:46,679
it's definitely a shrinking word yeah

794
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,119
times are changing times are changing

795
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:53,480
for sure well thanks for having me man

796
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:53,480
thanks a lot Marie as always

797
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,239
Sage Johnny K get some glasses on this

798
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,240
it's bright as [ __ ]

799
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,000
hey so what's up guys I'm back with John

800
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,719
K you heard that name a few times and uh

801
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,358
most of his glass actually got packed up

802
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,239
but he's got a couple of nice pieces out

803
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:11,598
here that he's going to tell us about uh

804
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,519
so pick one and start telling us all

805
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,680
right well this is uh what they call it

806
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:19,679
drop drain recycler so it's uh it's got

807
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,598
the perk with the drain built inside of

808
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,199
it which is a little different than most

809
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,880
recyclers you see yeah I noticed that

810
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:28,239
right away I thought at first I thought

811
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,800
oh it's it's short I it didn't quite go

812
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,439
about halfway down but then I realized

813
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,359
you were filling the entire chamber with

814
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,280
water and it really chugs definitely for

815
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:38,719
sure so this is a collaboration with JT

816
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,440
glass or Jared

817
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:44,679
toner and uh

818
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,559
yeah yeah it's spin real nice it's

819
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:49,199
pretty beef Cakey too A lot of times

820
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,480
these recyclers feel really dainty to me

821
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,078
they feel almost like they're just going

822
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,159
to break and this thing feels like it's

823
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,359
like been super sized or something yeah

824
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,759
these are designed essentially for e-

825
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:00,759
nails or you know more heavy setup not

826
