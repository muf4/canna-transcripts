you just quoted the doctor yeah dude

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,359
that's amazing so let's talk about that

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
for a little bit because when you said

46
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,319
it i was like

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
for just a split second i was like how

48
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,639
does he know about the living gold but

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,359
then i remembered

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,159
we linked up in jamaica many years ago

51
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,159
and we traveled up to my buddy's grow

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,478
it wasn't a hike it was a straight wall

53
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,038
climb

54
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,878
it was like a no we were climbing a wall

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,639
like it was a ladder and i remember when

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,120
we got up there and he had like 55

57
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,719
gallon buckets and stuff and i was like

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
how did you get this up here and he was

59
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,520
like

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
on my head

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,239
like he climbed up this wall with these

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
huge things on his head

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,159
you know the other crazy thing about

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,919
this is we got to the top and uh

65
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,159
myself we're just like sweating oh my

66
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,238
god we're dying and there's not one

67
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,479
droplet of sweat i know

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,759
you remember he also he also climbed

69
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,479
that mountain

70
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,519
with shoes that had no shoelaces and the

71
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,679
tongues of his shoes were flipped out in

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
front of his shoe yeah and i remember

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,360
just being like looking at me in remo we

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,680
got like you know like the proper shoes

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,360
all tied up good and like i'm looking at

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,640
the doctor and he's just like are you

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
okay

78
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,839
you know kind of just like i don't know

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
it's a full-on jamaican experience but

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,759
the only the weird thing about that trip

81
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,280
is that when we sat um

82
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,199
in his little hut and we're smoking the

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,680
living gold he kind of gave me

84
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,280
some foreshadowing of what the next few

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,159
years my life was going to be like

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,318
because he

87
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,079
i don't know i had this captured on on

88
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,598
video where he starts telling me that

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,879
don't worry cannabis is going to take

90
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,039
care of you it's going to give you food

91
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,039
it's

92
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,439
since right no this was in western

93
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,079
he's doing really good man i mean he's

94
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,479
still got eight foot long dreadlocks and

95
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,360
yeah mikey was his name and they called

96
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,399
him geronimo because he used to drive so

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
fast

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,120
it was like geronimo

99
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,560
like he would just rip by like it was

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
kind of funny because he was the super

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,239
chill dude but he would drive like an

102
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,919
utter maniac and i remember all the

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
stash spots that he used to have on his

104
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,158
car and i was just like dude like

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
these stash spots are not good and you

106
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,079
are the ultimate heat score like he's

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,159
got his joint was like four times the

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,599
size of that like no he used to roll

109
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,000
these giant like

110
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,318
15 gram joints that were only like that

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
long but like that wide and he just he

112
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,518
would just have it hanging out of his

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,840
mouth all the time

114
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,959
he was uh definitely a character he

115
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,679
crushed sugar cane for us and made like

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,600
passion fruit sugar cane some other

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,918
juice when we were up on top of the

118

drinking amount of gourds dude it was so

119
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,439
good

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,079
a really jamaican experience authentic

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,639
yeah that was authentic for sure

122
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,198
shout out to mikey the good doctor

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,000
geronimo if you were making that uh

124
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,879
bubble hatch we made that big

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,120
i absolutely remember the ocean uh

126
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,719
i remember was like crashing against the

127
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
wall and you could hear the ocean around

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
there i was staying there yeah yeah

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,319
beautiful setting to make out that was

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,399
unbelievable it was the nicest place

131
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,478
i've ever made hash in my life you've

132
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,758
seen it there must be videos of that to

133
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,680
be honest i'm just certain that we

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
filmed that and we just documented the

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,959
whole thing we put it up i'm not sure

136
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,119
where it is now because we made it well

137
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,399
what we wanted to do today was film this

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,399
intro

139
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,000
do the cooking but i brought the rosin

140
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,918
press and i've got that turned on and i

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,839
thought maybe you could capture the

142
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,959
rosin pressing for your channel we can

143
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,119
kind of cross

144
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,879
it yeah okay give you the money shots

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639

this dab happen

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,039
yeah

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
sounds like it's going to take off

154
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,360
yeah

155
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,439
it feels like it's going to take off

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,879
like when i'm when i'm hitting it i feel

157
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,439
like it's just going to go

158
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,759
shoo like a spit a fidget spinner or

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,759
something

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,639
so i've gotten away from my wasteful

161
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:05,439
ways of q-tips and now i'm in the

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,879
wasteful isopropanol phase

163
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,399
no no this is actually good it's an

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,759
efficient way your bangers are always

165
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,719
going to be clean

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,720
beyond

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,919
and actually if you're dabbing on the go

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
that's awesome because you can just like

169
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,399
dab a hot dab throw it in there cools it

170
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,639
yeah and you can go it's nice that it

171
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,239
doesn't chas the banger you know these

172
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,400
bangers are like 400 us dollars

173
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,400
yeah yeah so once you've heated them up

174
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,079
too much and you don't clean the little

175
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,000
bit of resin that's there and then you

176
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,918
heat it up again for the next ab it just

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,399
starts darkening darkening and then you

178
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,879
have to torch it to get it off and it

179
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,959
kind of creates a foggy glass which i

180
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,959
love the fact that he frosted this glass

181
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,959
already right i think that's a good idea

182
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,638
to you know poor johnny b he's told me

183
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,879
he's gone through like he doesn't buy

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,160
these ones he buys the the chinese ones

185
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,478
that are like

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,199
20 to 30 to 40 dollars but yeah he was

187
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,399
like

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,759
he was telling me the other day he went

189
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,000
through like a dozen of them or

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,598
something like because he just he keeps

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,959
chasing them

192
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,959
you should do clothes first you gotta

193
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
you understand using cannabis for pain

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
yes cold starts are not the best for

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,199
using cannabis for pain they truly

196
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,198
aren't like john likes hot gaps for

197
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,680
preserving the turks yeah that's the way

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
to go you get all the trips absolutely

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,038
absolutely but have you ever hit one

200
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,839
that's just too hot and then you're like

201
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,719
whoa

202
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,560
i am way higher than i normally am yeah

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,120
i think we can all agree when you when

204
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,120
you hit a 900 degree dab you're just

205
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680
like your lungs are on fire your lungs

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,000
are on fire and your throat hurts

207
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
it's not good it's not i agree but i

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,639
definitely don't know i'm a grandparent

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,639

210
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,879

the fruity smell but then it even has

246
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,399
that background flavor of like the

247
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,199
mildly stale whatever the cereal is made

yeah it should be pretty tasty so

376
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
preparation

377
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,839
for the ceviche i guess

378
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,920
i like to soak it with the lime for a

379
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,800
good like hour half hour to an hour

380
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,919
prior and then add all the extra goodies

381
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:35,838
stuff so i'm gonna put some mango

382
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,838
and put some red pepper

383
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,958

384
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,040
all the stuff's normal

385
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,278

510
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,839
or a green pause on the camera here

511
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
i'm totally joking i'm gonna do that all

512
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,240
over again i've been recording the whole

513
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,679
time but i just thought i'd you know

514
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,440
i think we're baked enough for such a

515
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,440
joke to go over decent

516
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,200
you know what i remember a few years ago

517
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,960
i was filming something uh we were

518
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,640
judging um

519
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,798
one event i can't remember what event it

520
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,360
was and we spent hours and hours and

521
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,798
hours filming and judging this stuff and

522
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,199
then we realized the microphone was

523
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,400
awesome there was no audio whatsoever so

524
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,880
we redid the whole thing oh my god

525
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,559
yeah see always check

526
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,559
to make sure your microphone's on um

527
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,240
that's why my microphone and my camera

528
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,798
are just one in the same and you can

529
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,480
never do it over the same

530
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,079
oh god no

531
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,839
okay so that was right it would have

532
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,000
been fun though if you guys just over

533
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,439

have been math yeah it would have been

535
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
