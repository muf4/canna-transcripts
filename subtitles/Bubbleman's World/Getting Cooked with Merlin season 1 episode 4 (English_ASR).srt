204
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,639
10 grams

205
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,079
per kilo

206
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,240

207
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,279
10 grams per kilo

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,960
holy crap yeah one percent

209
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,799
yeah that's uh that's for the five

210
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,638
triple zero

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
i don't know it was definitely the

212
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,280
strongest product i've ever consumed and

213
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,959
what is that that was in amsterdam first

214
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,198
time yeah

215
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,799
yeah i left cross-eyed

216
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,240
i used to hear people tell stories of

217
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,240
leaving his house cross-eyed and like

218
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,399
uh and then i smoked his hash like a lot

219
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,079
of it because he kept just keeping me

220
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,479
bombing after bombing up after longer

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,120
like i'm certain that night he hit 50 or

222
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,360
60 bombers wow i'm certain i hit

223
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,519
probably around 20.

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,759
and that was like a lot and i remember

225
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,240
leaving there just being like

226
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,278
trying to kind of get my way home from

227
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,360
the area of amsterdam that he lived in

228
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,240
bikes flying everywhere yeah

229
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,200
oh my god just driving trying to like

230
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,120
not get my tires stuck in a tram track

231
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
fall into the canal

232
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,159
falling into the canal was never a

233
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,079
problem but the tram tracks are

234
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,759
deceiving and if you don't pay attention

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,519
to them and you you don't cross them

236
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,559
properly and you go like one's going the

237
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,799
same way as you and you go into it

238
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,278
[Music]

239
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,719
it's uh it can get ugly fast how many

240
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,240
years did you live there

241
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
i didn't live there for any years but i

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
traveled there like 40 or 50 times for

243
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,639
sure since 95. lots of trips to

244
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,800
amsterdam yeah it's a great place for

245
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,199
sure i've only been twice but both

246
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,278
memorable oh yeah i mean i'm sure i

247
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,160
probably spent almost a year in

248
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,320
amsterdam if i added come back yeah if i

249
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,838

250
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,120
don't know

251
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
it's a

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,600
definitely a cool city i've never had

253
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,879
the pleasure oh well one day soon here

254

i'm

256
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,800
the world will open up again one day

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
soon and one can only hope and when it

258
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,399
does

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,839
traveling will be afoot

260
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,639
traveling is there but just these

261
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,560
vaccine passports there

262
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,559
yeah but that's not really opening it up

263
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,838
i just mean once it's opened back up

264
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,879
yeah for everyone just yeah

265
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,000
especially not live like um

266
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,879
like under

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,159
a medical emergency or a health yeah go

268
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,000
back to normal

269
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,319
yeah or someone that's going to be kind

270
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,519
of normal maybe maybe even normal can be

271
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,360
a bit different because a lot of the

272
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,000
systems we're currently operating on are

273
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,200
like faulty broken

274
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,639
and just need replacing

275
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
there's always room for improvement

276
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,720
right yeah

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
there is i like the way uh greta would

278
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,600
say about the system she's like well if

279
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,039
the system

280
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
is not working

281
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:46,399
you replace the system yeah try to fix

282
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,159
the system just replace it yeah yeah

283
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,759
i'm ready to do some replacing i mean

284
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,199
that's it i mean what it's done for the

285
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,958
workplace as well like you shouldn't

286
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,040
have to go to do a nine-to-five job

287
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,359
anymore unless you're you know unless

288
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,199
you're working a physical physical labor

289
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,720
job most of the jobs that was just

290
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,360
taking admissions for nothing but people

291
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
driving to work

292
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,679

312
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,958

put a little bit of olive oil in there

317
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,320
and while

318
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,159
i you didn't see it but on on camera but

319
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
earlier i made

320
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,000
some butternut with some curry with some

321
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,239
cayenne pepper

322
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
with uh or not curry sorry with cumin

323
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480

olive oil garlic and ginger and then

326
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,600
roasted it all in the oven at 420

327
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,839
degrees 420 degrees yeah that's what's

328
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
up and it's pretty much ready right now

329
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,480
so we got a nice little crisp roast

330
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,599
flavor to the butternut squash

331
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,600

337
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,040
translucent get some flavor stuck to the

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,039
bottom of the pan there

339
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,879
a bit of salt

00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,838
a bit of pepper

341
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,079
and you can see in here they're kind of

342
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,519
hidden because

343
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,638
they kind of took on the color but

344
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,440
there's like roasted garlic in here

345
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,278
there's roasted pieces of ginger in here

346
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,950
and all that flavor is like trapped

347
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:29,119
inside and it's all gone

turps it can it gets stuck in there and

365

you kind of like you know airs out and

366
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,319
then you get the right smell

367
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,399
flavor filter all right paul you want to

368
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,360
start by putting those into the blender

369
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,360
right over there cool

370
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,480
here these are the beets

once or twice

372
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
move it around

373
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,720
scrape the walls off so you can get a

374
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,720
nice consistent beet

375
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:58,440
i'd rather eat this than the beef tart

376
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,439
oh my god you just ground up

377
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,759

380
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,519
dish when it's all done how about

381

382
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,399
now

391
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,399
we're gonna hit it with a little bit of

392
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,399
lemon

393
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
a little bit of olive oil

394
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,319
it'll give it a really nice shine if you

395
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,599
can see

396
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
could you drop it down a bit into the

397
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
sun

398
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,519
there you go

399
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,759
really nice makes it a nice shine on it

400
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,360
yeah it really does

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,519
you can use all sorts of different oils

402
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,919
i've done it with pistachio oil a little

403
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,879
pinch of salt

404
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,879
a little pinch of pepper

405
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,120
now this is where the real flavor from

406
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,120
this part comes in

407
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,240
with a few capers

408
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,519
you're really preparing food for all of

409
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,759
the senses even beyond the palate

410
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,440
yeah i mean i it's nice to have

411
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,278
different textures and flavors that kind

412
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,320
of bind together it makes the dish

413
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,600
better

414
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,920
once you kind of understand that

415
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,680
everything kind of flows right

416
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,679
so chop up your capers a little bit

417
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
how are those onions coming paul they're

418
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,439
coming up great

419
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,318
get nice and brown nice let's just

420
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,838
reduce the heat a little bit on there

421
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,279
let's get our capers in there you want

422
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,558
to get this to

423
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,639
marinate a little bit that's why i'm

424
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,480
getting this one done first

425
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,480
get the capers in and then this is the

426
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,599
part that really adds a little nice kick

427
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,400
to it

428
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,119
is some horseradish a little horseradish

429
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,480
little house and peppa exactly

430
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,479
get all that mixed in there

431
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
we're so close to having the sun shining

432
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,240
in it but it's just not quite there i

433
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,240
think we're right here

434
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
color is great it's worth doing for

435
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,960
honestly because it was just in the

436
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:51,119
shade and it didn't have that yeah it's

437
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,759
so vibrant red super vibrant dude yeah

438
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,159
beautiful yeah so now that that's

439
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,960
marinating i'll just let that sit

440
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,960

that's very very good

445
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,079
now we'll get these squashes up here

446
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,200
butternut

447
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
all grilled up and mashed ready to go

448
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,759

449
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,880
15 to 20 minutes at 420 degrees in the

450
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,400
oven

451
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,600
and it gets nice and soft and then what

452
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,480
did you put on there you said you put

453
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,199

a little bit of olive oil all of it so

457
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,200
now you can see where it's going to get

458
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,200
a nice coating in the bottom there

459
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,318

almost

463
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,720
it's getting there

464
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,369

[Music]

just absorb them

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,480
then we'll get a little bit of veggie

468
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,319
stock in here i like to take the stuff

469
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,839
with no salt so that you can adjust it

470
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:28,720
yourself after

471
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,480
get that going

472
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
now we'll turn up the heat on here to

473
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
get it boiling

474
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,038
one little extra thing

475
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,119
this is like cooking with

476
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,119
splashes and all yeah dude it's awesome

477
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,640
a little bay leaf in there just remember

478
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,320
to take the bay leaf out before you

479
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,440
blend it

480
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,720
because we're gonna blend this i just

481
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,279
want these flavors we'll make sure we

482
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,440
mention that again sit together exactly

483
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,879
yeah it's definitely very very important

484
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,519
you don't want to eat

485
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,280
sharp bay leaf so usually when we make a

486
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,359
bunch of courses like we're about to do

487
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,440
we serve them one after another today

488
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,359
it's all going to be about timing so

489
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,240
soup's going i think the next part we're

490
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,918
going to do

491
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
is the bar grass sauce because it takes

492
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
about 15 minutes to mix

493
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,720
we want to get a bit of time so a little

494
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,399
pot on there medium heat

495
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,360
we're going to get some

496
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,200
olive oil right here

497
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,519
so what is a

498
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,279
blah blah sauce

499
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,558
it's a barb language with mean white

500
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,079
butter sauce

501
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,000
not like on fish a lot of the time

502
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,158
you'll see you'll see like a yellowish

503
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
white sauce yep i mean it's really gonna

504
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,520
go well and you're calling it bar blanc

505
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
bar blend

506
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,079
bar blah yeah

507
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,479
i'm eating white butter

508
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,079
it's a classic french sauce and it's

509
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,279
gonna go really good with the corn and

510
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,599
with the scallops it's gonna be

511
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,359
delicious cool yeah so we'll just let

512
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,000
that heat up a second

513
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,279
um while that's happening

514
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,519
we'll make the avocado mix here

515
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,038
so um

516
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,279
what we're gonna do i cut up these

517
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,119
avocados already yeah i put a little bit

518
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,000
of lemon on them so that it would

519
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,439
preserve it and it stays the color

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,119
yeah you squeezed like half a lemon

521
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,600
under them right exactly it just

522
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,279
preserves the with the acid it contains

523
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,519
it right well it kept them from browning

524
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:22,279
out completely yeah exactly

525
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,279
i'll just scrape that nice green color

526
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,608
[Music]

527
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
we're gonna go two full there's two full

528
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,519
avocados here

529
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,000
for four people i would suggest about

530
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,000
two full

531
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,519
maybe put a little bit more

532
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:49,038
lemon the avocado adds an amazing

533
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,720
texture to the dish it sure does yeah

534
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,720
and this time i'm going to go with a

535
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,960
little bit of dill extra in there as

536
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
well

537
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,839
use your people put cilantro but i like

538
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
dylan

539
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,439
because it's

540
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,679
super powerful like an herb

541
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,200
what's the terpene on dill

542
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,200
i'm not sure

543
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,080
the top of my head

544
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,080
i'm sure it's got a nice variety of them

545
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:19,599
for sure is it so pungent yeah

546
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,599
put a little bit of that in there

547
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,720
[Music]

548
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,279
a little bit of salt and pepper super

549
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,038
simple for the avocado

550
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,038
simple is better with mexican food

551
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,440
i don't know if i'd consider this

552
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,079
mexican but

553
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,080
this bottom part of the semi-glock

554
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,079
definitely

555
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,720
shine and you want to get it mashed a

556
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,720
little bit because when we're going to

557
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,919
put it into the molds after

558
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,440
it'll just be

559
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,640
easier to work with

560
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
that's why you're not mashing it

561
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,360
completely yeah i won't still want big

562
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,759
chunks yeah but i want it like mashed

563
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,359
enough that it's kind of like emulsified

564
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,599
yeah we'll let that just sit there for

565
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,779
right now well this is hot now

566
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,519
get our shallots in here

567
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:19,200
[Music]

568
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,430
did you have just a bit of oil in there

569
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,630
yeah just a little bit of olive oil

570
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,630
[Music]

571
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,639
there's not your shallots going

572
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,849
now we're gonna add a little bit once

573
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,520
this these get a little

574
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:37,599
[Music]

575
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,879
a little translucent of salt as well

576
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,319
just so everyone knows that it looks

577
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
like i'm putting a lot of salt it's

578
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,038
kosher salt i'm always using it's a lot

579
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,720
more granular a little less salty a lot

580
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,960
easier to salt stuff

581
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
pretty

582
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:49,960
um much

583
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
a little bit of salt i'll sweat those

584
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,480
onions out a bit

585
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,640
or shallots i should say

586
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,839
then

587
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,720
a little bit crazy with this one

588
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:08,558
i'm gonna put some white wine

589
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,558
we're gonna put some white wine vinegar

590
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,600
and we're gonna let that boil down

591
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,200
i just want this to be super hot and

592
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,798
kind of get some flavor stuck to the

593
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,240
bottom of the pan

594
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:32,079
before you throw in the alcohol exactly

595
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,599
and then we'll really let these reduce

596
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,639
then it would finish it with some good

597
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,719
butter it would be delicious

598
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,799
these shallots are getting

599
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,839
nice and translucent and super cooked

600
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,200
you can see they're like melting lemons

601
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,199
now we're gonna hit it with a little bit

602
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,759
of white wine about a quarter cup to a

603
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,759
half a cup

604
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,079
let's get the boil out there

605
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,440
kind of hoping for a little more boil

606
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,798
but i think it'll be good and then we're

607
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,720
also gonna put

608
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,440
a little bit of red white wine vinegar

609
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,440
in there as well

610
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,799
now we're just going to let this boil

611
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,079
out and kind of reduce

612
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,639
and then we'll add the rest of the

613
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,960
ingredients beautiful

614
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,880
this is going good all those flavors are

615
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,679
coming together let's just turn it down

616
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,679
and let it simmer

617
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,200
looks great yeah it's gonna be great

618
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,880
at the end we put a little bit of

619
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,679
coconut milk and it really brings that

620
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,760
creamy flavor to it it's delicious

621
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,320
so let this boil down i'm gonna turn

622
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,240
this up a little bit next is prep the

623
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,918
corn

624
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,000
it's gonna be for the scallops that

625
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,600
we're gonna do okay so what's your

626
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,119
favorite dish to cook

627
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,879
i don't really have one i like to cook

628
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,839
something new pretty much every time i

629
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,360
eat

630
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,278
it's pretty good i like to do all those

631
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,959
tiny things if i like something i'll

632
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,960
make it again and again until i perfect

633
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,880
it and then kind of forget about it like

634
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
pull it out so it's about the journey

635
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
not the destination yeah exactly i like

636
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,840
to always eat it

637
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,440
i don't know it's fun

638
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,839
for me it's like a decompression from

639
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,038
the super stressful work environment see

640
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,558
that's what growing always was for me

641
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,640
that's it was always you know watering

642
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,960
the plants getting in there training

643
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,400
them it was always very cathartic

644
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,360
totally

645
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,880
so this corn has already been boiled

646
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,240
it's pretty hard to find fresh corn at

647
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,679
this time of year unfortunately this

648
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,558
one's from

649
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,400
i think it's from mexico or southern

650
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,839
southern us

651
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
it's nice to have pressure corn you can

652
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,439
do it with uh canned corn as well look

653
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,798
at it

654
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,798
frozen corn i should say

655
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,240
a little bit

656
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,640
now we're ready to go with that

657
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,919
we're going to fry that into a pan so

658
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,919
all this is going here

659
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,360
did you say you're going to fry the corn

660
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,278
in a pan

661
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,119
yeah we're gonna fry it in a pot and

662
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,960
cream it with a little bit of cream and

663
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,479
a little bit of parmesan it's gonna be

664
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,240
delicious

665
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,360
i think what i'm gonna do here is turn

666
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,359
this one on in the back

667
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,679
this is where the butter comes into play

668
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,919
we're also going to prep butter for our

669
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,600
barbed sauce if you can look over here

670
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,759
yeah it's starting to

671
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,918
starting to reduce down sure turning

672
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,000
into like more of a sticker goop with

673
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,320
the shallots

674
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,079
so what we want to be prepped for is to

675
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,678
have cold butter

676
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,558
to add in there in increments so you

677
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,038
want

678
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,879
it's a decent amount of butter in yours

679
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,759
it's not for the faint heart i think

680
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,278
butter is good for you

681
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,398
we should put a little rosin in there

682
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,079
with it

683
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,599
oh my god

684
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,720
new floor just

685
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,359
gonna go back

686
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,200
and go to sleep yeah for two days

687
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,119
for two days

688
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,600
yeah i'll get the one piece that it all

689
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,599
was sitting on

690
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,158
i just put a gram in yeah i think i ate

691
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:55,439
about a gram yeah cannabis that can

692
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,440
eating cannabis can get you

693
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,679
yeah i think that it's a nice one

694
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,159
i enjoy it great sleep

695
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,720
i sleep great all the time yeah oh

696
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,520
absolutely yeah i'm a hash smoker man

697
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
house smokers don't not sleep great

698
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,240
because you're not you're not doing a

699
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,559
cannabis smoker

700
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,480
for sleep well i think that when i

701
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,558
smoked cannabis it was different from

702
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,319
when i started smoking hash for sure

703
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,240
yeah it was just yeah for sure i used to

704
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,398
like cough and have like phlegm in my

705
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,319
throat and like cough up little things

706
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,079
sometimes definitely it's more i've

707
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,558
never had that for 20 years of just

708
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,678
smoking hash wow i've never had anything

709
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,119
like that

710
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,880
and i remember that was 20 years ago i

711
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,599
was only like 28.

712
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,200
so i was thinking i was like

713
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,359
i shouldn't be like coughing up like

714
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
flam and stuff caught that but i was

715
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,199
smoking

716
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,519
major joints dude like a couple of zips

717

worth of weed a day big three four five

718
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,839
gram wheat joints you know

719
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,480

720
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,000
bueno for me so oh man

721
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,399

722
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,480
the concentrate healthier i think i'm

723
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,398
i'm addicted to just having a joint i

724
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,038
appreciate you having your joints some

725
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,639
of my friends speaking of which

726
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,679
some of my buddies call me the smoking

727
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,080
chef

728
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,240
the smoking chef girl's got a joint in

729
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,240
my

730
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,959
mouth all right this is getting pretty

731
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,480
good here you can see it's very very

732
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,240
syrupy now

733
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,599
now we're going to reduce the heat down

734
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,319
on here

735
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:26,678
we're going to add in

736
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,678
a bit of a bit of cream

737
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,158
you want to get the heat way down

738
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,558
because you do not want to boil your

739
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,679
cream so take it off for a sec

740
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,678
get your cream in there

741
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,558
about a third of a cup in there good job

742
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,558
not boiling it

743
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,918
stir that down

744
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:49,599
here i'll get this shot of like you

745
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,840
stirring the pot with a joint in your

746
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:55,719
other hand that'll be our thumbnail for

747
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,720
this video there you go

748
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,240
a little bit butter is going here

749
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,440
for the butter we're gonna just wait a

750
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,519
little bit and get it a little bit brown

751
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,440
it's called a bar noisette it just kind

752
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,119
of has a little extra flavor it'll add

753
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,640
to the corn and then we'll cream it and

754
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,398
we'll put some cream in there it will

755
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,159
still it'll still be a bit junky too

756
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,439
so now you can see this is turning into

757
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:27,120
a nice medley right here

758
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
a little bit of salt to it

759
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,679
you just want to keep this constantly

760
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,278
stirring

761
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,038
and then as the heat is low we're going

762
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,798
to just stir in

763
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,119
cold chunks of butter a bit at a time

764
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,759
and it'll become like a bechamel kind of

765
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,119
consistency

766
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,839
we'll start with our first one right

767
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,839
here

768
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,119
and you really just want to slowly melt

769
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,038
it in

770
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,038
each chunk at a time

771
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,640
kind of whipping it in almost if you can

772
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,519
see melting it and whipping it and

773
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,440
adding air

774
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,880
we're going to do this a few times

775
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,880
until this sauce thickens up

776
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,960
and then we'll just put it on the side

777
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,959
and wait for our scallops

778
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,960
cube number two

779
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:29,359
all three of us actually i i guess

780
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,278
we all eat fairly healthy although paul

781
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,599
did have the the record this summer i've

782
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,359
never seen anything quite like it

783
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,759
we spent a lot of time on this on the

784
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,000
road together this summer visiting

785
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,759
dispensaries across this great country

786
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,798
and we had a we had a blast we bumped

787
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,398
into each other twice yeah

788
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,519
from different provinces

789
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,119
yeah and uh we

790
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,240
yeah we ate some pretty good food but

791
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,319
paul ate how many 72 pizzas about that i

792
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,000
touched about 72 different pizzas across

793
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,558
the you know one road trip if you're

794
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,398
gonna he was having like pizza anxiety

795
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,558
like i need to get pizza you'd get pizza

796
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,918
i was sweating marinara sauce man i was

797
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,000
sweating

798
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,440
it was some serious how long was your

799
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,319
trip it was 65 days

800
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,278
okay

801
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,278
73 different cities and we have 421

802
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,200
stores if you can imagine in the 70s of

803
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,119
pizza that means you had pizza almost

804
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,480
every single day of your trip no problem

805
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,239
oh yeah

806
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,839
i was thinking it was like a two-week

807
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,319
trip and this [ __ ] was eating

808
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,158
like six or seven [ __ ] eight pizzas

809
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,158
ten pizzas a day or something goes in

810
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,120
the next butter i was like whoa how many

811
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,120
pizzas did he eat

812
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,759
yeah it's starting to you see it kind of

813
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,038
thicken up and getting kind of shiny on

814
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,158
us definitely

815
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:43,599
up at the same time we don't want to

816
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,760
forget see we're starting to get a

817
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,359
little bit of a hazelnut color into the

818
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,278
butter we're almost there yeah we're

819
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,038
building flavor on the bottom too as you

820
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,359
can see we're gonna

821
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,839
soak all that up

822
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,359
so this soup is coming along quite nice

823
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,519
as well it's getting bigger this is only

824
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,359
like one

825
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,359
one meal we're gonna have a three chorus

826
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,359
all at once which is hard to do usually

827
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,959
but i think i think i can time it right

828
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,879
for us

829
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,640
if there's anybody that can it's mad

830
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,399
merlin the magic

831
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,159
oh [ __ ] that's why i don't wear white

832
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:14,798
shirts when i cook anymore

833
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,720

much ruined different that's why you

851
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,159
need a good dry cleaner yeah

852
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,200
we're getting nice and browned here

853
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,200
it's time to hit it with our

854
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:10,340
corn into the

855
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,339
[Music]

856
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:20,159
[Music]

857
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:24,398
a lot of flavor in there

858
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,398
now just to pick up the juices

859
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,199
you will add

860
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,398
a bit of oh wait that's the wrong

861
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,800
this guy's collecting broth like

862
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,358
i love cooking vegetarian food but

863
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,200
during the week i i do cook uh meat as

864
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,239
well

865
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,078
in in

866
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,879
very good moderation though i try not to

867
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,880
eat it all the

868
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,520
i time brought up a vegetarian so i know

869
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,000
what it is we're going to add a little

870
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,759
bit of uh vegetable stock here

871
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,559
and kind of clear off all that stuff

872
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,000
that's on the bottom

873
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,000
get a little bit of liquidity to it

874
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,159
keep that heat moderately low because

875
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,880
we're going to put a little bit of cream

876
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,879
in there as well

877
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,838
to cream in the corn creamed corn

878
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:31,838
exactly

879
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,520
now we're gonna hit it with a bit of

880
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,519
salt and pepper

881
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,200
you know just let that simmer a little

882
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,119
bit while it heats and then we'll just

883
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,719
hit it with the emulsifiers

884
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,960
we'll be able to do the soup at the same

885
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,959
time

886
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,960
okay how's our barbed wine coming you

887
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,039
can see it's starting to thicken up on

888
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,639
us a little bit here

889
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,639
as we add butter bit at a time

890
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,640
this sauce is going to be delicious

891
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
hard not to be with uh it's mostly

892
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,000
butter

893
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,000
exactly well the shallots the vinegar

894
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,559
and the wine really give a nice acidity

895
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,838
to the to it as well so it makes it cool

896
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,679
and it's just going to be we're going to

897
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,799
just have a few little dots on the side

898
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,319
of it with the

899
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,839
scallop and with the corn i think

900
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,880
they're all going to really melt

901
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:42,880
together as flavors

902
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,358
emulsification to it and you don't want

903
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,009
to go too much because we still want

904
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:52,838
those beautiful kernels of the

905
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:57,599
[Music]

906
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,599
corn nicer if you can get it deeper

907
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,480
this show should be in 3d

908
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,320
shit's flipping everywhere if you didn't

909
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,000
notice on the camera there is stuff's

910
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
going everywhere oh nice we're getting a

911
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,440
nice thickness here now

912
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,440
yeah that looks great

913
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,679
let's get one more stick of butter in

914
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,079
there one more stick of butter keep it

915
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,078
going

916
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
and when it cools it gets really thick

917
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:37,079
because of all the butter as well right

918
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,078
oh we're gonna strain out those uh

919
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,160
well you know what they say right a

920
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,838
stick of butter keeps the doctor away

921
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:51,679
now exactly

922
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:55,199
i'm pretty sure that's what it is yeah

923
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,199
that sounds like a quebec motto

924
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,480
um okay while this is clean let's put it

925
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,759
in the back here let it heat up and kind

926
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,400
of go together

927
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,079
and we'll take care of this um where's

928
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,599
my toms

929
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,359
from there

930
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,359
we're gonna not forget our bay leaves

931
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,280
before we emulsify this

932
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,559
shake the bay leaves out very important

933
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:24,159
they're not poisonous or anything but

934
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:26,559
they're super brutal texture

935
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:29,199
digestion bay leaves

936
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,639
chunks in your meals

937
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,480
we're back at it

938
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,480
all right this thing is thickening up

939
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,760
pretty good for the barbell sauce let's

940
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,760
straight up the shallots

941
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,159
have a little saucy here

942
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:45,399
for oh filtering it right through here

943
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,399
look at this

944
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,359
it's great you are not joking about how

945
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,000
how smooth that silky that sauce is

946
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,838
going to be oh yeah

947
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,880
and when it cools just a little bit it's

948
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,880
going to get really thick

949
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,639
i wonder if i have a little bit of

950
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,480
truffle oil pad in there to be pretty

951
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,400
good too

952
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,880
truffle oil right yeah

953
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,200
so do you use a spoon sometimes to mesh

954
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,280
that out a little bit

955
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,439
just sort of squeeze you can tell it is

956
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,599
drier than you think right yeah

957
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,000
gravity does most of it for you

958
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,000
totally

959
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,400
oh wow

960
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,760
little veloute sauce there huh yeah

961
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,760
really nice all right

962
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,280
lions bay

963
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,199
lion's bay water

964
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,320
fresh from the mountains

965
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,598
right off the mountain yeah

966
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,920
okay

967
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,160
i will emulsify this thing

968
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,159
catch you

969
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:02,199
[Music]

970
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:15,078
[Music]

971
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:30,639
looks awesome

972
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:32,318
[Music]

973
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,519
when you roast the garlic and you roast

974
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:37,679
the ginger together it really works well

975
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,000
um i'm just gonna turn that down a

976
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,000
little bit

977
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,239
we've got a pretty good consistency here

978
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,920
oh it looks amazing man

979
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:52,039
now we're going to add a little bit of

980
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,039
coconut milk to it

981
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,639
i like this brand the argument

982
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,239
a roy d i don't know it always tastes

983
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,679
pretty good did you know in the future

984
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,279
what we'll have to do is we'll have to

985
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,399
get um

986
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,519
our guests and this the sous chefs like

987
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,400
my like short training seminar before we

988
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,920
film

989
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,119
because there's all sorts of things he

990
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,039
could be doing

991
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,880
right yeah right but it's the timing

992
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,279
right you're doing you i just you only

993
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,400
know when you need it exactly so that's

994
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,240
the tricky part

995
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,800
so that whole canon in there goes in

996
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:28,078
there it's gonna get extremely creamy

997
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,160
just diluted the color so nice yeah

998
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,160
that's like the color of spring

999
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,358
or fall i should say sorry

1000
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,358
the color of fall butternut squash is

1001
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:41,199
like a very fall time

1002
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,799
yeah it's one of our favorites at home

1003
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,719
you've never had one before you've never

1004
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,318
had a butternut squash soup

1005
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,000
you don't eat much vegetables yeah like

1006
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:48,960
most things you cook i have not eaten it

1007
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,639
before

1008
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,159
yeah

1009
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,318
yeah this is a good one man

1010
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,719
i'm gonna put butter in the soup pick it

1011
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,960
up no it just makes it a nice silkiness

1012
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,959
right

1013
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,838
you'll see it gets a nice shine to it

1014
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,358
you know this can use a little bit of

1015
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,519
that

1016
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,279
truffle oil

1017
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,440
oh a little bit of the soup that we

1018
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,120
talked about last time oh yeah a tiny

1019
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,199
little bit of herb spicy

1020
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,199
[Music]

1021
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,119
there we go

1022
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,119
i would say a little bit of salt as well

1023
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,960
but you can really taste the ginger in

1024
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,959
the soup it's delicious

1025
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,920
season it all up you want to grab a

1026
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,920
spoon there paul for

1027
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,838
good marcus try you want to try a

1028
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:48,318
two-pole grab another spoon here no

1029
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,159

1030
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,358
are you kidding me that's great oh that

1031
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,358
is delicious

1032
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,119
great

1033
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,279
and we didn't really do that much icing

1034
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,880
besides the initial one when we played

1035
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,359
if he spiced it slightly different it

1036
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,318
would be a dough

1037
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,719
it tastes like a buttermilk dumpling

1038
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,039
it's not too far off it's not too far

1039
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,838
off and i think the lentils

1040
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,920
exactly exactly well use

1041
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,838
in here i put a little salt slice them

1042
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,760
on an angle put a little bit of olive

1043
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,358
oil a little bit of salt a little bit of

1044
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,480
pepper now we're going to put them in

1045
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,239
the oven at our favorite number 420 420

1046
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,480
degrees in the go

1047
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,318
while that happens i think that this is

1048
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,960
ready that's ready let's get the pan hot

1049
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,650
for the scallops

1050
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:38,639
let's get the pan hot for the scallops

1051

[Music]

1052
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,039
where they're

1053
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,358
okay so that's heating we've got to prep

1054
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,639
the scallops at the same time which uh

1055
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:52,639
i'll show you guys how to do

1056
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,679
[Music]

1057
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,679
find where i put them

1058
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,399
i think they're up to the left above

1059
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:00,399
your tomatoes

1060
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:07,039
and above the tomatoes yeah nice all

1061
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,480
right so uh it's really important to

1062
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,039
prep your scallops

1063
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,639
and everybody knows this but there's a

1064
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,639
little membrane

1065
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,400
around

1066
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,400
a scallop like a little muscle that you

1067
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,480
have to take off when you get them

1068
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,480
because that little muscle is super

1069
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,480
chewy

1070
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,560
man i wonder if that muscle in that

1071
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,078
little creature ever thought

1072
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,639
there would be a group of beings that

1073
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:40,160
would classify that muscle

1074
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,159
as chewy yeah

1075
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,599
that's a real existential crisis yeah

1076
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,960
man i got these two muscles

1077
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,599
sure

1078
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,599
if only scallops like evolved to have

1079
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,240
more of that muscle maybe humans would

1080
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,480
leave them the [ __ ] alone

1081
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,159
they're just all around you so if you

1082
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,400
want to see out thinking like that we

1083
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,480
can thank for delicious tasty weed

1084
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,000
there you go for real

1085
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,519
okay so you know what i don't know this

1086
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,519
one does no

1087
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,280
so this sometimes they have it sometimes

1088
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,599
they don't luckily on this nice beauty

1089
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,960
one we don't have it so okay here's a

1090
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,559
perfect example

1091
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,318
if you can see right here there's an

1092
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,159
extra muscle that you can see that's

1093
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,159
attached here oh yeah and you kind of

1094
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,358
just peel that guy

1095
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,358
right off

1096
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,920
and then you have your scallop so this

1097
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,519
one's good right that one's good exactly

1098
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,280
so you want to put them on a nice dry

1099
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,639
towel because you want them padded dry

1100
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,240
that one has a technique that we're

1101
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,480
going to be doing well that's true i

1102
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,399
kind of feel like i'm peeling off the uh

1103
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,318
iono ribeye

1104
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,559
it is kind of that way

1105
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,639
that last one has one too

1106
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,078
yeah before i realized this every time i

1107
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:47,759
made scallops and especially when you

1108
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,680
make like a ceviche or something you can

1109
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,920
cook properly yeah and when you make a

1110
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,118
ceviche you know that chewy part of this

1111
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,119
scallop

1112
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,119
and everyone is like ugh what is this

1113
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:04,480
that's awesome

1114
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,480
i'm just gonna wash my hands again

1115
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,839
a favor here and we'll drain out the

1116
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,920
beet mix that we had here and then we've

1117
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,599
kind of let it sit together and as you

1118
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,838
can see there's a lot of juice left in

1119
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,838
the bottom of here

1120
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,639
it'll spill out all over the plate so

1121
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,719
what i like to do

1122
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,679
here

1123
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,439
grab a little strainer

1124
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:30,719
and then just put all that bead in there

1125
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,480
and then press it down so that we can

1126
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,039
get all the liquid out of there

1127
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,559
we'll build our plates for our beet

1128

tartare dish

1129
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,559
okay

1130
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,440
and i got a little mold here

1131
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:58,559
so i like to do it with a round mold

1132
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:01,118
let's start with oh okay get your little

1133
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,239
mold there exactly

1134
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,880
and then we're gonna start with the

1135
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,879
avocado

1136
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,309
kind of push it down to the bottom there

1137
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,389
really nice distribution

1138

1147

00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:22,960
to share with everyone

1166
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,960
you know yeah the reveal was really good

1167
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,799
and then wall sorry what did you say

1168
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,319
well that's well these are i'm making

1169
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,318
these i'm gonna have a

1170
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:38,880
rip dude look at that mustache happy

1171
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,880
halloween folks

1172
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,119
that's gold we're also going to roast a

1173
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:44,318
few pine nuts here okay

1174
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,240
so this is always tricky you don't want

1175
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,000
to burn those yeah

1176
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,799
roasting pine nuts and burning them to a

1177
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,239
crisp is a fine line it's a very fine

1178
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,000
line have you would you say that

1179
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,358
something i learned this week though is

1180
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,920
that a dry roast is much easier to

1181
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:02,239
to handle so we're gonna have no oil and

1182
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,920
we're just gonna dry roast in a cool pan

1183
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,519
in a cool pan we're going to put it at a

1184
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,280
low heat it's not going to take very

1185
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,719
long but

1186
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,480
it'll be just gravy and they're not

1187
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,480
going to burn before that nutty flavor

1188
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,440
kind of comes out perfect so we'll just

1189
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,440
finish these up real

1190
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,519
dude that quick looks so nice with the

1191
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:23,759
sun on it now i'm blocking the sun but

1192
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,159
we've had about a month of rain

1193
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,640
and it's nice to have a few days of sun

1194
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,639
that's so nice

1195
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,440
the two colors

1196
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:40,000
are a banger just alone yeah totally

1197
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,639
well then then you add the textures

1198
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,800
and the flavors it's a triple threat

1199
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:48,078
totally hey paul would you mind checking

1200
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,079
on the croutons in the oven

1201
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,280
hard and then it pulls out nice and

1202
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:53,279
straight there

1203
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,839
and number three

1204
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,078
you just want to make sure when you do

1205
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,679
with the beats that you push it down

1206
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,680
really hard otherwise

1207
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,039
it well not really hard but like with a

1208
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,719
bit of pressure

1209
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,159
that way the mold comes out nice and

1210
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,239
easy and you don't get beads all over

1211
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,838
you i see you tapping the edges too yeah

1212
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,959
exactly you want to really push that

1213
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,239
down

1214
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,280
make a nice flat surface on the inside i

1215
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:30,399
don't think you messed it up

1216
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,079
okay now we got our three

1217
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,400
dishes there

1218
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,240
just pulled out the croutons just pulled

1219
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,680
out the croutons they're nice and brown

1220
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,358
they look great now we can just let

1221
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,838
these rest a little bit while we get the

1222
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,358
rest of the meal ready you kind of smell

1223
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,400
a little bit the pine nutty flavor

1224
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,719
coming out they're getting a little

1225
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,680
rounded see they're dry roasting yeah

1226
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,959
yeah dry roasting a little pine nut

1227
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,960
flavor

1228
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,720
it takes you know you really get the

1229
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,720
flavor out of here before burning them

1230
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,959
if you put oil they'll burn before you

1231
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,719
get the flavor out okay okay we got a

1232
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,720
little preparation going on here this is

1233
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,118
a little behind-the-scenes b-roll it may

1234
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:08,639
make it into the show it may not

1235
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,240
the old b-roll set up

1236
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,078

1237
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,000
dude how about that let's give him a

1238
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,359
little shot of the glacier across the

1239
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,800
way

1240
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,598
yes seriously

1241
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,519
winter is here in the mountains

1242
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,359
i gotta get my drone we would have done

1243
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,440
a drone video

1244
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,519
i did let everyone know that the drone

1245
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,159
is gonna be back

1246
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:32,159
it's coming back the battery's ordered

1247
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,239
it's the top of anvil island that we're

1248
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,399
looking at right now

1249
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,479
i went to squamish the other day

1250
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,160
and there is faces that you can ride

1251
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,920
right now oh yeah whistler has like

1252
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,719
three meters of snow

1253
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,838
i was in squamish the other day too yeah

1254
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,838
all right let's see if we have enough

1255
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:52,639
time to do another quick little

1256
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:52,639
dabaroo here

1257
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,799

1261
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:08,480
start now

1262
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:12,318
this is not the best dabber

1263
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,318
for dropping cold starts in but

1264
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,559
i didn't bring any of my gear

1265
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,800
so i'm blessed to have access to what i

1266
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,800
have

1267
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,000
let's give it a cold start

1268
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,159
this

1269
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,799
that

1270
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,800
was tasty

1271
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,440
wow

1272
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,440

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,119
that you guys have both been in the

1276
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,800
background of this little

1277
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:46,160
clip we can come back here

1278
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,160
well i'm gonna clean this

1279
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,799
it's all nice set up oh yeah all right

1280
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,839
well i'll come set up the camera over

1281
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,160
there

1282
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:56,880
let's clean the banger

1283
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,480
get the tripod here

1284
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,160
probably have to go get my other battery

1285
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,159
because this one looks like it's almost

1286
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,199
done

1287
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,118
oh yeah

1288
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,598
the nuts are almost roasted here the

1289
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,400
nuts are roasted look at that dry roast

1290
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,240
nice

1291
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,800
brown color on them looks amazing

1292
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,558
looks amazing can we just grab these

1293
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,440
nuts and put them on there now it's

1294
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,440
great oh yeah

1295
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,519
so how am i going to set this camera up

1296
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,679
you want to finish the cook first

1297
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:30,000
oh sure absolutely that's a good idea

1298
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,078
all right we got our pine nuts cooling

1299
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,559
over next to our tartare now the next

1300
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,119
step here is get our pan super hot for

1301
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,280
the scallops which is the final part of

1302
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,559
our dish everything's warm everything's

1303
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,960
ready

1304
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:46,559
prepped plates are made

1305
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,000
i think we're getting to good heat here

1306
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,599
we're going to add a little bit of grape

1307
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,639
seed oil

1308
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:56,720
it's a lot higher temperature

1309
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,719
and one of these not too too much but

1310
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:00,798
just to coat it right

1311
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,000
wait a second

1312
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,000
get a little out

1313
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,318
yeah just want to get the coat there

1314
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,679
okay

1315
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:13,440
now we're getting out there let's get

1316
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,598
our scallops that we prepped earlier

1317
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,960
that are super nice from the market down

1318
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,838
the road here

1319
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,240
you want a nice padded

1320
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:25,679
dry a little bit of paper towel on there

1321
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,838
that way we get a really good sear

1322
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,039
you can kind of round them out so now we

1323
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,039
got this high temp here

1324
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,839
yeah i think that's gonna be good so

1325
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,159
when you put them down this is the most

1326
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:40,719
crucial part for the good sear is you

1327
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:43,118
want to get them down and really place

1328
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:47,959
them and push them down firm so that it

1329
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,960
gets a nice crust on it okay

1330
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,440
i like to do the widest side down first

1331
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,440
it's a nice

1332
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,440
presentation

1333
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:08,159
now for me i know that my pan is hottest

1334
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,200
over here so i concentrate mine right

1335
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,358
now

1336
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,199
with a gas grill you wouldn't really

1337
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,199
feel that same

1338
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,679
hot spot well i imagine there's hot

1339
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,199
spots on on gas problem would be

1340
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:21,118
different for that yeah

1341
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,639
that's very good comes in

1342
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,599
distributed

1343
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,279
100

1344
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,519
but even then there's still a hot spot

1345
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,880
in that pan for sure definitely cast

1346
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,880
iron is the way to help on that

1347
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:37,039
let those things dry out now the whole

1348
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,079
key to this thing is you want this first

1349
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,599
sear

1350
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,599
at the high heat with oil

1351
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:45,199
and once those are seared when you flip

1352
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,838
them you essentially want to start

1353
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,759
hitting it with butter and basting it as

1354
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,159
you go okay now that i think about it

1355
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,520
just so it's a little bit better

1356
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,519
we're gonna add garlic

1357
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:01,440
into the bottom of that pan as well it's

1358
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:03,279
going to make it super tasty butter

1359
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,240
that's going on top

1360
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,480
out

1361
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:07,919
we'll keep those sitting on the side

1362
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,280
right here

1363
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,358
along with our cubes of butter

1364
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,200
now these you can tell underneath it's

1365
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:18,719
starting to get a pretty good little

1366
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,719
browning sear on there

1367
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,259
hey paul while we do that you want to

1368
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:28,278
just help them you can

1369
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,278

chef ocd

1371
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,839
it doesn't make all the difference in

1372
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,119
the world if you drop a drop on the side

1373
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:46,960
of the board

1374
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,119
you you eat with your eyes now look at

1375
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,000
this that's like that's just what you

1376
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,000
wanted to look like

1377
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,838
now we got a nice sear on all of these

1378
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,838
oh look at that

1379
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,720
and you'll see they kind of like stick

1380
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,480
in place when you flip them back over

1381
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,959
this is when we hit our garlic down in

1382
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,358
the corner start hitting it with a bit

1383
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,358
of butter

1384
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,720
really a lot

1385
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,280
you're getting a little bit of flavor in

1386
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,279
there now we want to just

1387
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,319
tilt your pan up like this as they're

1388
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,280
frying

1389
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,719
and just literally spoon butter garlicky

1390
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,640
butter

1391
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:27,109
all over those scallops for them to

1392
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,219
finish

1393
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,219
[Music]

1394
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,759
get that garlic right up in there

1395
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,199
you really want to do this at very high

1396
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,679
heats

1397
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,199
so that it really gets that good sear

1398
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:48,719
when you go down you can get a little

1399
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,879
more heat going

1400
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,399
back to it and then you can pull it back

1401
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,559
up you don't want to do this too long

1402
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,798
about two minutes aside probably at the

1403
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,798
moment

1404
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,880
you can see all that lactose foaming up

1405
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,599
but it smells so garlicky good

1406
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:12,200
and the butter pretty much bastes and

1407
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:12,200
cooks the scallop itself right

1408
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,719
okay

1409
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,719
these are getting pretty close to ready

1410
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,160
for two seconds in that pan and let them

1411
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,079
finish off i grab something

1412
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,798
to hold them in

1413
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:35,280
while we wait to plate we want a little

1414
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:37,358
bit of paper towel

1415
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,240
we have our nice barbed sauce that is

1416
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:42,078
really kind of reduced down and it's

1417
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:45,199
super nice

1418
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:48,640
um at the same time we will set up

1419
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:51,358
planking over here as well

1420
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:53,279
for a scallop so why three plating areas

1421
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:56,239
if you guys can see right now we're

1422
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,880
going crazy today yeah you do and yeah

1423
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:01,118
you are and yeah you did

1424
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,358
okay here we go these are all ready to

1425
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,358
go

1426
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,440
okay now it's going to be plating time

1427
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:13,440
so let's start with our we'll start with

1428
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:16,960
the scallops paul's wonderfully done

1429
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,000
here wonderful didn't mess up at all

1430
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,679
good job

1431
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,280
we're going to start with the corn for

1432
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,039
the for the scallop so we'll put a

1433
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,559
little

1434
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,558
dollop on each one here

1435
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:32,480
i like to make little piles first to

1436
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:36,400
kind of measure

1437
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,000
exactly how much corn we have each

1438
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,240
you want to be nice and generous on the

1439
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,798
corn it's delicious

1440
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:45,279
you can see that like burnt butter or

1441
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:46,719
browned butter i should say

1442
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,160
color of it

1443
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:51,639
and we'll just give it a quick little

1444
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:51,639
swipe down

1445
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,318
okay

1446
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:11,838
just make two nice little dollops there

1447
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,838
on the side

1448
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,880
this is when it comes in handy to be

1449
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,159
baked to do this you kind of take your

1450
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,680
time

1451
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:31,279
totally

1452
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,279
and then we'll grab our scallops

1453
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,319
you missed the public okay these look oh

1454
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:42,480
that looks spectacular

1455
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:44,159
just in that butter white butter sauce

1456
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,960
it really has thickened up as it cool

1457
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,039
down

1458
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,280
yeah it's going to be delicious and then

1459
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:53,719
for the smell of color

1460
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,720
get a little bit of parsley on there

1461
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,400
as well over here we're gonna put

1462
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,400
parsley on all of our soups

1463
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,760
i think i got a little more left here

1464
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,798
i like to throw it around all right now

1465
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,880
let's finish our

1466
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,038
let's finish these put a little bit of

1467
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,039
pine nut roasted pine nuts on the top of

1468
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,039
them

1469
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:27,599
and then we're gonna grab a little bit

1470
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:31,839
of these alfalfa sprouts

1471
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,838
just build a tiny little nest there

1472
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:35,838
tiny little nest there

1473
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:45,240
now we'll grab a little bit of olive oil

1474
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,240
this is infused with garlic

1475
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:01,640
12 year old vinegar

1476

12 year old vinegar right yeah

1477
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:07,759

you're still getting it yeah

1479
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,839

1480
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,239
it's delicious and just add some toasts

1481

1482
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,159

1494
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:19,920
like honestly sure this is so

1495
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,919
ridiculously gnarly

1496
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,598
i don't even like it

1497
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,759
i guess you know what you should start

1498
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:28,720
by announcing what each dish is and then

1499
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,200
just gobble it up so we got a pan-seared

1500
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:33,118
scallops with a barbell and a creamed

1501
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,439
corn with a barn rosette

1502
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,039
and then we have

1503
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,519
our butternut

1504
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,160
squash roasted soup with garlic and

1505
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:44,639
ginger yep then our beet tartar with

1506
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:45,838
roasted pine nuts avocado

1507
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:48,798
and

1508
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:50,558
some sprouts and vinegar and oil

1509
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:51,920
well that's just absurd and ridiculous

1510
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:53,119
on all levels but why don't we take a

1511
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,318
bite of each

1512
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,760
thing here and

1513
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:57,038
as we do we'll let you know what we

1514
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,559
think i think you know what we're going

1515
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,000
to think but

1516
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,599
oh my goodness

1517
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,079
they just fall apart

1518
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,318
just fell apart

1519
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,318
the trick is to get up another car oh

1520
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:09,318
yeah

1521
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,038
that barble is amazing

1522
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:22,440
i think it's really quite incredible

1523
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:37,079
the contrast plays really well together

1524
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,599
this is definitely loud

1525
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,639
that was spectacular i could have

1526
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,798
crushed that like

1527
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,118
non-stop

1528
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:09,838
soup it's hard to put it away right now

1529
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,838
isn't it yeah

1530
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,280
well the soup is just

1531
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:22,000
delicious even like the way the

1532
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,280
aftertaste that that plays with this

1533
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,358
yeah it kind of works so good

1534
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,880
just the creaminess of this

1535
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:33,838
yeah the texture of it is absolutely

1536
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,838
silky

1537
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:46,280
[Music]

1538
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,280
garlic

1539
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,119
that's really nice these are all

1540
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:53,599
ridiculous yeah

1541
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,358
this is such a sweet looking dish as

1542
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,519
well as

1543
01:06:55,358 --> 01:07:00,078
clearly being delicious with the 12 year

1544
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:03,119
vinegar

1545
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:07,440
croutons as your

1546
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:09,760
kind of pork i guess yeah exactly

1547
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,200
again that contrasting texture is just

1548
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,119
impeccable

1549
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,838
seems to be a really good theme working

1550
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,838
through today

1551
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,599

1552
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,079
everything's awesome dude

1553
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:30,240
would you give it six stars

1554
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,079

1555
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,078

1556
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,760
that's a 90 micron full mount meal right

1557
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,440
there right there

1558
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,000
looks like full mountain clear double in

1559
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,798
that clear dome right there just try it

1560
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,079
try try uh try going that film yeah

1561
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:48,000
exactly

1562
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,000
purity excellence achieved

1563
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,760
wow

1564
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:01,759
that's a great way for people

1565
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:01,759
who have a hard time with avocado

1566
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,760
to go into it to get past it yeah

1567
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:12,639
really

1568
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:14,159
really yeah it's really a different dish

1569
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:15,118
with the horseradish gets a little

1570
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:17,759
pungent

1571
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:21,679
yeah it's like a spring dish for sure

1572
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,679
and the capers give it a salty

1573
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,000
well knocked it out of the park once

1574
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,880
again i feel like you pulled the cape

1575
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,960
around my taste buds

1576
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,880
super pleasure

1577
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,798
oh it was an absolute honor i say with

1578
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,039
the amount of time and energy

1579
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,359
that merlin put into this we owe it to

1580
