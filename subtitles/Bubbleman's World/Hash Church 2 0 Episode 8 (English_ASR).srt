4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,800
admit once so we took some long break so

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,150
see a good group of the regular chatters

9
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:29,729
in the chat room you know I still to

10
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,709
this day after several hundred episodes

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,539
of hash Church get a little bit of

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,730
butterflies in my stomach that's how

13
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,579
much it means to me to do an episode of

14
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,959
hash Church each day it's exciting I

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,750
always want it to be good

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,149
I never want it to be bad and there's a

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,659
responsibility in it you know so I guess

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:53,070
without further ado I will send out the

19
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:56,358
links to our group I do have quite a few

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,999
people this Sunday afternoon or morning

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:03,239
it's gonna be 14 plus of us that get the

22
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:04,609
invitation so only a fraction of us are

23
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:11,009
going to be able to come into the room

24
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:12,719
that being said there we go said that's

25
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,640
and that being said I'm sure we can

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,109
rotate and I'm sure if some people want

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,969
to come in and they don't get a chance

28
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,700
other people can leave the room for a

29
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,099
little bit here and there and I have set

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,969
the rooms oh what's going on here did

31
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:31,500
that not go through that's weird huh I

32
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:33,658
might have to do this again

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:42,659
bear with me I've had a little bit of a

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:44,610
technical difficulty let's see what's

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,140
going on here let me just make sure I've

36
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:51,438
done this correctly so we can get

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,368
everyone in here ah the old hash Church

38
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,599
intensity's yeah this isn't gonna work

39
00:01:53,368 --> 00:02:01,228
so I got to do this again let's see it's

40
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,538
Sabo Sara Jon Wendy Darren mark angel I

41
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,718
think I can remember that I think I can

42
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:08,550

43
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,139
want to get these invitations sent out I

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,080
did send the email out and that worked

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,250
fine but for whatever reason it's saying

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,230
there's no participe

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:21,930
and this other one so let's see it was

48
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:23,340
Sara Sunday it was Sabo it was angel

49
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,950
Vasquez

50
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:32,370

51
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,179
sure I'm forgetting some let me see if I

52
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,709

53
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,240
we know participants 1 ah Wendy don't

54
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:44,580

send it right here

57
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,969
let's see if that doesn't work let's see

58
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,500
if that doesn't work because that was

59
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,759
everyone that said they wanted to be in

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,949
it sometimes it's a little bit difficult

61
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,560
when you set up the chat when you set up

62
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:01,019
the private message in facebook to send

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,739
out these chats if I get a message it

64
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:08,310
can mess things up for me but hopefully

65
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:10,020
yeah hopefully that works anyway in the

66
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,670
meantime while I'm waiting for everyone

67
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,130

00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:40,209
better we also have Joe who is a new

166
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,180
friend of mine

167
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,459
I met him recently he reached out to me

168
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,569
he's from Brazil and and and Joe is

169
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:52,239
really the sort of the person behind

170
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,889
ganja talks and the bubble man solvent

171
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,900
list extraction course that we're gonna

172
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,399
be doing here in the next little bit we

173
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:59,949
kind of started it with a four-part

174
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,060
series of free courses and I've just

175
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,979
been super stoked with the

176
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,259
professionalism that he's displayed so

177
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,180
far with his team and I thought it would

178
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,769
be kind of a cool idea to bring him in

179
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,800
and have a little bit of a talk about

180
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:13,899
that as well we got Johnny be who needs

181
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,710
no introduction you know Johnny be

182
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:20,500
Johnny be Johnny be he's in the room you

183
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:22,839
know Johnny B we also have Sarah Sunday

184
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,899
who just popped in Sarah someone

185
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,229
actually here on Google chat and Sarah

186
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:32,579
of course runs the karma cup which what

187
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,450
has it been four or five years now Sarah

188
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,038
are we on for

189
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,930
five can you hear me can you hear me

190
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,250
I don't think Sarah can hear me but

191
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,359
she's working on it anyway we'll be

192
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,149
talking a little bit about the upcoming

193
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,639
karma Cup in September and then of

194
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:52,360
course my good friend Sabo is also in

195
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,070
the room creator of the vape exhale this

196
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,440
little unit how sweet are these little

197
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,629
units here so I'm sure Sables always got

198
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,709
great things going on I love all the

199
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:01,629
things that he's doing one of the most

200
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:04,448
important things that I wanted to

201
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:08,828
discuss with him today was sort of the

202
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:11,559
cannabis parenting the parent a cannabis

203
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:13,448
entrepreneur panting young children in

204
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,509
this day and age and sort of just get an

205
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:18,278
open discussion going on on so somewhat

206
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,259
of the difficulties of that but also the

207
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,389
obstacles that we need to overcome

208
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,909
because you know parenting is a whole

209
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,948
different trip it's not really just all

210
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,778
about what you yourself are into and

211
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:30,669
what you like but you also have this

212
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:32,110
responsibility to your children to make

213
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:35,078
sure that you don't put them in a

214
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,789
situation that causes them embarrassment

215
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,559
or creates obstacles for them so I

216
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,559
thought we would start have a little

217
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,838
conversation about that as well and I

218
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,778
guess I pretty much introduced everyone

219
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,089
so far dr. mark shall dawn needs no

220
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:50,889
introduction he was crushing it on the

221
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,740
last few hash searches it was kind of

222
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:56,379
like dr. mark Church we could have

223
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,389
called it after last science one where

224
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:01,198
he went and just dropped the

225
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:03,338
power-knowledge ball on on his

226
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:05,919
hydrogenation process and some other

227
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:11,350
interesting things so thanks welcome

228
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:13,838
everybody welcome everybody very happy

229
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,879
to have you all here not really sure who

230
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,890
to open it up with how to talk about I

231
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,679
guess I'll talk a little bit about the

232
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:24,068
ICRS which mark you should absolutely go

233
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,439
to in the next the next one that is that

234
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:31,240
is an event I think it might be an event

235
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,889
designed for you all your peers you know

236
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,740
it was a little bit over my head I won't

237
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:39,579
lie the first day was incredible welcome

238
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,019
skunkman Sam into the room Sam I am I

239
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:43,299
don't know if any of you saw the picture

240
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,028
of me with Sam I am on my lap there

241
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,099
about a week ago when I was at his house

242
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:49,950
there Sam

243
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,080
doing his thing sitting all happy with

244
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,770
his with his little boa hey what's going

245
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:59,100
on guys

246
00:10:52,769 --> 00:11:01,019
smoke ash so yeah it was Sam of course

247
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,180
and chimera who really inspired me

248
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,100
chimera more than anyone to head out to

249
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:08,579
the ice ers this year it was my first

250
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,139
one that I've ever been to and Sam kind

251
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,790
of warned me he said you know the first

252
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,189
day or two will be really good and very

253
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:18,269
cannabis plant related and then it'll go

254
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:21,950
deep into the cannabinoid study and as

255
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:23,939
as it did it totally got super deep

256
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,770
turned into some hardcore

257
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,530
you know science where they're testing

258
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:31,620
on lab rats and mice and monkeys and

259
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,209
stuff and both myself and Ian who I was

260
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,669
with from Sager International we're

261
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,889
having a borderline difficult time with

262
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:39,629
that aspect of it I I'm sure many of you

263
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,399
remember some of the first times dr.

264
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:43,500
Natasha came in and started talking a

265
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,480
little bit about the my studies from a

266
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,049
cat from a cannabis person's perspective

267
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,399
it's somewhat shocking because generally

268
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:54,029
most of us aren't sitting around

269
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,329
torturing mice into figuring out how

270
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,309
cannabinoid receptors work but this is

271
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,889
happening out in the world and of course

272
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,359
these people join annually at the

273
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,789
International cannabinoid Research

274
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,500
Society an exceptional group of people I

275
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:09,000
do have to admit there were some

276
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,600
wonderful people there that I got to

277
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,159
hang out with and I will probably you

278
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,899
know make an attempt to make it there

279
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,779
next year depending on where it is

280
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,850
unless it's in America in which case

281
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:23,039
I'll have to maybe just read the

282
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,290
footnotes nothing against my American

283
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,230
brethren and sistren

284
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:30,500
just terrified of your government is all

285
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:36,149
[Laughter]

286
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,889
so yes so are we so are we not to start

287
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:40,620
with politics this early in the morning

288
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,419
we can finish it right at that but yeah

289
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,669
a wonderful group of people at the ICRS

290
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,009
mark you should definitely 100% make an

291
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:50,009
attempt on heading out there yeah I'm

292
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:55,490
totally I've been told for many years I

293
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:59,519
need to go chimera in this year and I oh

294
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,970
I know why is my wife's birthday and we

295
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,360
went

296
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,199
tray in Central Park I saw that that was

297
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,568
wonderful it was home looked absolutely

298
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:13,409
spectacular I guess it's the post

299
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:15,500
picture of asking what was it 22 or 23

300
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:18,568
years ago you asked her to marry you

301
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,389
yeah oh that happened and sold your

302
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:27,828
field actually yeah before Jerry Garcia

303
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:30,480
died in 1995 I asked my wife to marry me

304
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:32,609
not knowing that just you know a little

305
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,579
over a month later Jerry would be gone

306
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,490
and our lives would take a different

307
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:43,138
direction from that point forward but

308
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:46,289
true ever impacted on the fact that I

309
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,659
lived during the time of Jerry Garcia in

310
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:52,259
my lifetime was just amazing that I got

311
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:55,379
to see so many of his concerts and it

312
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:56,789
had such a profound effect Marcus I

313
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,500
don't know if you know but I used to

314
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:01,469
play in a Grateful Dead cover band

315
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,839
that's how I met my wife and so I remind

316
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,939
children all the time if it wasn't for

317
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,970
Jerry Garcia you guys wouldn't be here

318
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:11,549
so through is that as a lead into your

319
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,250
parenting thing I was well I think it is

320
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:16,318
I think it's a perfect and it's not

321
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,259
really my parenting thing it's it's a

322
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:21,240
conversation little started on his on

323
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,399
his podcast and it was one that I was

324
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,250
gonna be a part of but it kind of got

325
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,889
canceled out and so I don't know you you

326
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,958
want to have a good discussion of both

327
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:32,789
cannabis entrepreneurs cannabis growers

328

332
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:53,578
you happening so things are going really

333
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:55,558
well up here in California obviously uh

334
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:58,198
well I don't want to say really well

335
00:14:55,558 --> 00:15:00,088
there's a bunch of compliance issues and

336
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,458
things that everyone is taking care of

337
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,860
that various levels of headaches

338
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:07,799
depending on where you are in the supply

339
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,139
chain but Aldi's for me with the can of

340
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,879
parenting and the can of dads uh that's

341
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,740
been going along really well it seems

342
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,710
that you know 18 months

343
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,409
when we first started it it was met with

344
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,540
a lot more resistance you know a lot of

345
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:23,969
people were very surprised that I would

346
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:26,789
be open about talking about my cannabis

347
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,430
use while um you know at a PTA meeting

348
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:31,289
and over the last year and a half you

349
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,779
know things have definitely changed many

350
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:35,519
of the other parents have become

351
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,980
proponents of the cannabis movement here

352
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,230
in California so it's not just you know

353
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,450
me telling a bunch of people but it's a

354
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,580
group of people telling other parents

355
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,770
and the fact is you know I live in the

356
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,160
Silicon Valley and a lot of the parents

357
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:52,019
here are cannabis users so um we are all

358
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,360
kind of coming together and figuring out

359
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,610
a you know how do we talk to our

360
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,820
children about you know the shift in the

361
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,889
state where it was you know medical last

362
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,990
year and now it's adult use and then

363
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,970
also just you know help the other

364
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,590
parents who maybe have not consumed

365
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,740
since their college days you know

366
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,720
understand how to put on the training

367
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,190
wheels and get accustomed to cannabis

368
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,470
again and we've actually been seeing

369
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,900
quite a few parents you know switch from

370
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,180
you know having a beer or a glass of

371
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,579
wine you know after work to now you know

372
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,679
maybe getting a vape pen and taking a

373
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,420
couple puffs the CBD so you know I've

374
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,109
seen a lot of change over the last 18

375
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:33,179
months and it's been really cool yeah

376
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,980
absolutely it's amazing it's definitely

377
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:38,250
a conversation for the times I know that

378
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,789
when I first had my children 17 plus

379
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,279
years ago I was was not a conversation

380
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:46,709
that was I was personally willing to

381
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,750
have it was more like this closet thing

382
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,879
hiding it in the closet much like what

383
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,009
Cuban just said right now in the chat

384
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,960
room he's like wow I would never share

385
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,639
that with the school system or parents

386
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,620
it goes to show you that there's this

387
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,080
vibe of fear and that's really the thing

388
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,570
that needs to be sort of deconstructed

389
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,340
and removed we shouldn't be afraid to

390
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,230
have this conversation I know that we've

391
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,579
all come from this sort of great not all

392
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,190
of us but a lot of us have come from

393
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,960
this gray area situation where you know

394
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,700
fighting for cannabis today is much

395
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,100
different than fighting for cannabis 20

396
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,830
plus years ago where they sort of had

397
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,079
this no zero tolerance thing going on

398
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,059
where they just you know arrest you and

399
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,559
and and throw away the key type of thing

400
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,629
lots of people did lots of time for

401
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,700
cannabis over the years

402
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,380
but I think we owe it to ourselves in to

403
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,269
our communities to sort of be that

404
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,370
strong voice that says look I know I'm

405
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:38,160
not doing anything wrong not breaking

406
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:41,579
any laws a lot of us now have medical

407
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,140
licenses and are protected in that sense

408
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:46,500
that we need to be able to have this

409
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,660
conversation particularly about and with

410
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,390
our children in regards to cannabis use

411
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,308
and welcome to forest who just came in

412
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,530
who has of course a very unique

413
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:58,048
background in the sense of you know not

414
00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:00,000
having any fear whatsoever about having

415
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:03,150
this discussion because you know his

416
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,740
foundation is even it's even more harsh

417
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,440
than a lot of us who are just trying to

418
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,450
protect our healthy children forests of

419
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,640
course has a very sick child who's been

420
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,740
suffering for many years and cannabis is

421
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,030
a huge alleviation to that and any

422
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,380
parent who's going to be put in a

423
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,000
situation where they're going to be in

424
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,880
trouble from the police or they're gonna

425
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,460
keep their child from potentially

426
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,240
perishing it makes it a very easy

427
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:29,100
decision which is I'm gonna fight for my

428
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,870
child's rights to be able to be as

429
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,029
healthy as possible and to improve the

430
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:35,129
quality of their lives before I'm gonna

431
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,349
be worried I mean you know what it boils

432
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,480
down to fear and scarcity and love and

433
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,609
abundance and what side of the coin you

434
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,440
want to fall on for the choices that you

435
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:45,808
make in the direction that your life is

436
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,150
going on fear and scarcity is something

437
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:50,009
that sucks a lot of us in too often and

438
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,570
it's very easy to be like oh I would

439
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:53,190
never I don't want to talk about that I

440
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:55,019
just want to stay under the radar and

441
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,759
then there's that love and abundance v

442
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:58,379
which is like you know what people need

443
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,900
to hear about this we need to have this

444
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,820
discussion and the bottom line is that a

445
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,679
lot of people do use cannabis and a lot

446
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,359
of people I mean imagine we live in a

447
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,179
day and age where you you'd want to be

448
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:12,298
afraid of your cannabis use whereas you

449
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,720
can be a proud abuser of alcohol and

450
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:17,460
almost have never any negative

451
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,538
consequences it just seems like somewhat

452
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,720
of a social tear on a tear on the social

453
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:26,579
fabric of our very communities so I for

454
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,429
one I'm excited to get a little bit into

455
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:31,699
this conversation perhaps forest you

456
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:33,590
want to give us a little bit of a little

457
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,788
of an update with what's going on with

458
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:41,329
you and Silas and tell us about

459
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:43,849
parenting and cannabis use well good

460
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:46,908
morning everybody sure it's been to see

461
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,918
y'all wow that's a big question let's

462
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:53,269
just hit it right off the bat huh get

463
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:55,940
going you know I mean again like you

464
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:59,298
said for those who don't know I have a

465
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:02,480
child who has a rare seizure disorder :

466
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:05,888
a hysto syndrome it's one of the two

467
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,120
approved conceived conditions for the

468
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:09,740
epidural it's drug that's getting a

469
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,538
whole bunch of attention the first FDA

470
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,159
cannabinoid based approved medication

471
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:18,069
because the conditions are so serious

472
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,440
essentially I mean these kids have

473
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:23,629
intractable catastrophic forms of

474
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,360
epilepsy they don't respond to other

475
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,730
types of medications now we know because

476
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,009
those medications don't interact and

477
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,630
adjust the right receptor systems in the

478
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:36,829
body to correct the problems unlike

479
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:40,730
cannabis and you know from the very

480
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:43,849
beginning we've had to fight this stigma

481
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:46,099
you know with children and cannabis and

482
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,199
youths and we've been kind of on the

483
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:51,349
front lines of that battle for you know

484
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,980
10 years because it's we've really had

485
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:57,798
to help shift the cultural understanding

486
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,630
of cannabis and a lot of that has to do

487
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,609
with the dressing just what you're

488
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,220
talking about the fears and stigmas that

489
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:07,729
are surrounding cannabis and having to

490
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,490
really address them one by one based on

491
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:14,509
their merit and you know what we found

492
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,308
is that when we started doing research

493
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:18,589
because now we're getting into wanting

494
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,690
to give our own child cannabis which is

495
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:22,638
a lot different than me one to use it

496
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,308
it's a real different decision giving it

497
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:27,740
to your kids and getting people to

498
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:30,740
improve allowing us to do that we had to

499
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,409
look at all the science and in research

500
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,399
surrounding cannabis surrounding its

501
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,399
perceived harm

502
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:41,289
everything from IQ and cognitive

503
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:44,889
development to stunting brain growth to

504
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:47,529
Nerone Adel use in cannabis and what I

505
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,240
found going into it really wanting to

506
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:52,240
know what the risks are with my own

507
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,049
child was that you really start to see

508
00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:00,779
how biased and poor a lot of the science

509
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:03,190
is that sets out to demonstrate harm and

510
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:06,579
really found that there was very little

511
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:09,400
evidence to support a lot of the stigmas

512
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:10,869
and fears have come around or that are

513
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,180
applied to cannabis you know and we all

514
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:14,799
know that when you use cannabis and you

515
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,870
use it frequently and people who use

516
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,389
cannabis medicinally their brains work

517
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:21,969
a little different after a while it

518
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,360
changes the way receptors work the the

519
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:27,640
greatest studies the most respected

520
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,819
studies show you know that cannabis can

521
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,700
impact the way you think you know for up

522
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:35,769
to two weeks if with heavy use you know

523
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,690
the the effects might last up to two

524
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:42,279
weeks afterwards and what they've

525
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:45,820
demonstrated is maybe a one or two point

526
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,559
decrease in IQ which if we can get into

527
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:49,450
the question of IQ if those tests are

528
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,579
valid but what they've shown is that you

529
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,160
know the the maximum amount of harm they

530
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:56,349
could demonstrate was that you know

531
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,140
people will have an affected way of

532
00:22:56,349 --> 00:23:00,490
thinking for maybe two weeks of course

533
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,780
that affected way of thinking and

534
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,849
changing the way the brain works is

535
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,970
exactly where a lot of the benefit comes

536
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:08,589
from and the the what we didn't

537
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,630
understand with effects of memory and

538
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:12,639
short-term memory are now a lot of the

539
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,550
things that we're finding are what

540
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,470
applies to correcting issues like PTSD

541
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:20,049
with endo family deficiency disorders

542
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,690
and other issues so once once we embrace

543
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:24,639
that there was really zero long-term or

544
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,890
permanent harm demonstrated with

545
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,370
cannabis we were able to start really

546
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:33,160
discussing that on a more scientific

547
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:38,049
level working with kids so you know we

548
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:41,230
we work with kids full time we give we

549
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:46,359
have children who are on doses of 2500

550
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:48,880
milligrams a day and show zero long-term

551
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,379
effects their body suggested it corrects

552
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,670
the issues that are that are not

553
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,620
functioning well in the body and we've

554
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,850
actually seen the exact opposite of what

555
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:57,219
is proposed

556
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:59,199
to have happened you know the theory is

557
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,339
what that if people are kids are using

558
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,230
cannabis then they're not going to

559
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:04,418
develop cognitively that they're gonna

560
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,639
see decreases in IQ it's going to stunt

561
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,528
their brain development and what we're

562
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:10,778
seeing across the board is the exact

563
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:12,638
opposite we see in when the body starts

564
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:14,710
to be able to regulate electrical

565
00:24:12,638 --> 00:24:16,808
signaling signaling and neurotransmitter

566
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,399
function correctly the brain functions

567
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:20,740
in a more healthy manner we see

568
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:24,489
increases in IQ we see increases in

569
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,109
cognition we see kids often and you know

570
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,599
it sounds like nonsense until you're

571
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:31,019
actually working with these populations

572
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:36,359
but you see children who couldn't speak

573
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:36,359
prior to using cannabis and you know

574
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,129
yeah yeah with with kids

575
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,288
everything's oral and suspensions and

576
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:46,538
measured dosing typically three or four

577
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:48,339
times a day our goals being to keep

578
00:24:46,538 --> 00:24:51,339
sustained levels in the body you know as

579
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:53,980
a supplement to try to correct or or

580
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:56,888
mitigate issues of based on endo family

581
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,528
deficiencies so yeah oral suspensions

582
00:24:56,888 --> 00:25:02,288
measured doses and you know those high

583
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:05,349
doses well they used to be rare but now

584
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:07,798
with some of the epidemics trials the

585
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:10,449
kids coming to us or coming to us with

586
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,128
recommended from their doctors not just

587
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,230
random doctors off the street like the

588
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:17,168
head of you know neurology at Stanford

589
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,599
and UCSF large clinics that have worked

590
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:22,450
with this drug are now recommending

591
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,339
starting doses for kids primarily focus

592
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,460
on CBD cuz that's all they can work with

593
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:30,819
now but starting it starting at ten

594
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,159
fifteen milligrams per pound bodyweight

595
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:34,990
and in quickly having them recommend

596
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,429
even higher up to twenty five milligrams

597
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,919
per pound we had a kid come to us the

598
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:40,929
other day so we get kids who are coming

599
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,778
with doctor's notes saying hey my

600
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:45,820
child's nine weighs a hundred pounds can

601
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:49,329
you guys help us sustain a 2500

602
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:51,308
milligram a day dose right so we see

603
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,288
that more and more and I think where

604
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:55,028
that's gonna be a bubble that bursts a

605
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:57,730
little bit some of those large doses

606
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:59,648
some of that is because the medical

607
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,329
establishment is only working with CBD

608
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:04,739
and when you spray it a great another

609
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:06,679
criminal sorry to interrupt but

610
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,410
twenty-five hundred

611
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,710
as a day I mean how or does that make it

612
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,420
cost ineffective I mean you know just

613
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,090
cost per milligram wise I was doing the

614
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,730
math in my head and it seems like I mean

615
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:24,559
I give my kids significantly less I mean

616
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,900
they have less severe issues but I was

617
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:31,490
just curious I mean how do people make

618
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:33,290
that work economically they don't you

619
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,049
know that's that that's a great question

620
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:37,190
I mean they don't with with some of the

621
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:38,839
work and maybe we'll get into a little

622
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,330
later that we're doing with legislation

623
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,220
here in California I've recently gone to

624
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:45,349
a bunch of dispensaries just to get what

625
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,600
is available and what does that play out

626
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:49,939
to in the real world if parents are

627
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,000
trying to meet the recommended doses

628
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,529
that doctors are asking and just

629
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,660
recently you know we were looking for

630
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,279
the only full plant medicine that we

631
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,830
could find they had all the necessary

632
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:03,589
requirements right proper testing

633
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:05,419
results proper labeling for dosage you

634
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:08,990
know the right credibility to use on

635
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:12,230
young kids it was about 300 milligrams

636
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:15,079
and it was 80 bucks you know so you're

637
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:19,339
looking at in reality if people if

638
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:21,559
people treating rare disease in trying

639
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:24,619
to follow the recommendations of these

640
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:26,809
doctors they're needing to spend you

641
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,939
know one the kids will have to drink

642
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,559
five to eight of those bottles a day

643
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:35,240
just to reach the sustained dose and

644
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,589
then you have the cost you know

645
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,500
somewhere anywhere between eight hundred

646
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:42,109
and twelve hundred dollars a day to make

647
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,460
that make that dose and and some people

648
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:44,899
will point to like well there's these

649
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,259
other products on the market that are

650
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:51,320
1500 milligram tinctures but we're

651
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:54,109
seeing very few whole full-spectrum

652
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:56,689
plant products being put out at those

653
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:58,509
doses we see a lot of isolate products

654
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,890
that seems the quality seems to go down

655
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:03,470
with some of these products is the

656
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,120
dosage level goes up and the efficacy

657
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,400
goes down with them too so if they're

658
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,979
not if they don't carry the medical

659
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,930
efficacy necessary to where we're not

660
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,370
seeing the results then we have to go

661
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,710
down to the full plant which are lower

662
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:17,000
doses and it becomes you know it's just

663
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,340
not it's not doable

664
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,089
so that's one of the real differences in

665
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:26,548
fricassee between whole plant and

666
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:28,949
specifically meteor distillate based

667
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:31,139
products they're sort of very much so

668
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,558
mark because so that that would agree

669
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:37,470
again I'm trying to understand the

670
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,298
nature of all the other ingredients that

671
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,058
are in there other than the cannabinoids

672
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:43,908
that are attic adding it happens so

673
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:49,259
those are everything else that's being

674
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:51,570
extracted yeah yeah I mean so this is

675
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:57,089
where we get into the unknown right but

676
00:28:51,569 --> 00:29:00,538
I for my school believer so just from

677
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:01,769
anecdotal evidence I am 100% a believer

678
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,419
of the entourage effect

679
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:05,278
I think obviously we're still learning

680
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,169
some of the interactions and

681
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,659
modifications the terpenes do to

682
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:12,059
cannabinoids but I've seen it firsthand

683
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,970
where we have kids on say like a strain

684
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:18,658
like ac/dc is a good universal Type

685
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:21,960
three low THC strain that we use high

686
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:23,850
CBD but at times you brighten out it

687
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:32,038
doesn't grow well in our area so it's

688
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:34,889
hard to keep keep the numbers there face

689
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:39,089
to fight so the cannabinoid profile

690
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:41,429
exact same doses a different strain and

691
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:42,750
I think the strain was electric the last

692
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:46,169
one that we had a really bad reaction

693
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,659
and we've seen kids have go from seizure

694
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:52,890
control to in the hospital with the

695
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:55,049
changes in strain so so again yeah that

696
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,028
leads to that chirping profile what is

697
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:58,109
available that's another problem right

698
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,538
now with some of the commercial

699
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:04,019
marketplace you're just shopping based

700
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:05,908
on CBD and THC but rarely can in some

701
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:08,908
source but it's just harder to find

702
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:11,549
harder to find sustainable a single

703
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:13,679
strain full plant because it does make a

704
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:15,450
difference and yeah we've just seen you

705
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,980
know I've seen you know some of the bait

706
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,798
it's kind of like the more we purified

707
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,569
CBD the less effective it is and I think

708
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:23,908
that works well the science shows with

709
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,769
almost every cannabinoid so you know you

710
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:28,080
see moderate or you might see some

711
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:30,210
benefits but when you're dealing with

712
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,599
kids who are in hospice or having you

713
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:36,750
know 2,500 3,000 seizures a month

714
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:39,269
then you know dropping it by 10% is good

715
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,369
and if that CVD isolate is safe and

716
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:43,650
clean and you drop it by 10% well that's

717
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:46,019
a benefit but that's where people I

718
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,120
think confuse the potential that is in

719
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,710
cannabis with just some efficacy they

720
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,779
start trying a product they see a little

721
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,400
bit of benefit and they stick with it

722
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:56,609
whereas when you're able to really start

723
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:00,780
to dial in the cannabinoid profile that

724
00:30:56,609 --> 00:31:02,729
best meets the malfunctioning need of

725
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,019
that unique braid so all sorts of

726
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,089
different things can go wrong that

727
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,879
caused the EC s to not function properly

728
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:10,199
when you start to really dial in what

729
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,130
works for that brain then you start

730
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,730
seeing efficacy into the 50% 60% up to

731
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:20,070
80 and 90% % percentile so it's not as

732
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,659
simple as black and white when people

733
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:23,339
talk about these things and that's I

734
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,450
think that causes some confusion online

735
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,849
where they say well I've tried this

736
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,779
product and it did good for me and what

737
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:29,339
I really try to get people to think

738
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:31,230
about well okay what is good for you

739
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:33,449
look like what was your baseline what

740
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,849
percentage of increase and benefit did

741
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,740
you get and are you satisfied there is

742
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:40,769
there better potential out there with a

743
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,019
higher quality product or continuing to

744
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:45,210
work with different profiles that might

745
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:48,418
you might respond better as an

746
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:52,079
individual yes I just want I wanted to

747
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,730
go back real quick about in regards to

748
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,038
you know what they say is going to

749
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,769
happen to the brain when you use

750
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:01,019
cannabis as a youth or what not some of

751
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:03,058
the tests that they use to acquire these

752
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,429
results because they're not testing

753
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:07,918
humans per se and after going to the

754
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:11,009
ICRS and listening to a lot of these

755
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,380
different sort of tests and scientific

756
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:15,419
experiments they put forward you know

757
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,679
the ones that were sponsored by NIDA the

758
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:22,919
National Institute of drug drug abuse

759
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,720
were very negative and we you know my

760
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,220
friend and I ian had a hard time sitting

761
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,620
through them and watching them torture

762
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,288
these rats blowing like the equivalent

763
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:33,029
of multiple kilos in vapor into these

764
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:35,609
cages where the rats are just getting

765
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:38,548
inundated they're trying to this test in

766
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:41,069
particular was on how the offspring of

767
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:44,429
animals are affected by cannabis use but

768
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:45,319
they use the most extreme level and not

769
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,140
oral but

770
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:50,659
vapor blowing vapor into these rats

771
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,790
faces and then and then coming up with

772
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,040
these results that said oh you know the

773
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:56,629
the children were unable to walk the

774
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,670
offspring were unable to walk properly

775
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,960
and have all these sort of negative

776
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,820
connotations and I was sitting in the

777
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,160
audience thinking I wonder if the

778
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:06,710
torture of the parents in a gas chamber

779
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,440
had anything to do with the outcome of

780
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,900
how these small offspring react and and

781
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,559
it's it's it's laughable Forrest you are

782
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,440
correct

783
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,329
it's insane that that's kind of how some

784
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,690
of this information is collected for

785
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:23,799
people to use in arguments against or

786
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,539
you know the use of cannabis in

787
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:30,200
developing Minds I mean once again it's

788
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:31,490
pretty hard to do to to argue with the

789
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,930
fact someone's having two to three

790
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,720
thousand seizures a month and then

791
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,799
suddenly you know you hit the right

792
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,100
cannabinoid profile and you bring that

793
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,509
down 90% that's astronomical yeah and I

794
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,759
think you hit the nail on the head

795
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:45,379
that's what we see mostly when you look

796
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,960
at these studies I tend to see two

797
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,550
problems to jump out first and Mark

798
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,460
might have some insight into that as

799
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:55,129
well but you know they have they either

800
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:57,289
use dosages that are just not real world

801
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:00,470
applicable right they give the

802
00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:02,420
equivalent of hundreds of pounds of use

803
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:07,220
you know to into some of these animals

804
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:09,829
or they don't account for comorbidity so

805
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,480
in the human trials they you know

806
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:14,630
especially in if we're talking might be

807
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,820
natal use in pregnancy they don't

808
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,490
account for alcohol or tobacco use and

809
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,100
in a lot of those studies so those are

810
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,379
things you man welcome those are things

811
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:25,849
that that are people have to take into

812
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,710
account so it does it makes it hard so

813
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:30,619
it makes our fight back to working with

814
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:33,260
children primarily and trying to educate

815
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:35,509
the public it makes it much more

816
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,140
difficult because you know it's hard to

817
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:42,230
teach people to read past the headlines

818
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:44,299
let alone read past the abstract on a

819
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,668
study right because even the abstracts

820
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,230
can be slanted towards where the funding

821
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:52,699
came from but when you get into the

822
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:54,918
study itself you really see the full

823
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,599
picture of the study so for example one

824
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,059
of them that I mentioned you know saying

825
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:02,029
that cannabis can

826
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:04,400
and I the IQ heavy cannabis use 40s use

827
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:07,040
can lower the IQ so as the title says

828
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,990
that the abstract says that but you get

829
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,829
in the reading the study and they show

830
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:14,629
that the doses were extremely high and

831
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:17,239
the worst case scenario they could find

832
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,250
was that the the effects lasted for 10

833
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,379
to 14 days and that there were no

834
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,150
permanent effects you know that to me

835
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,280
shows that yeah if you're using heavy

836
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,230
amounts of THC your brains gonna start

837
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,750
to function a little differently and

838
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,219
doesn't demonstrate harm but if you just

839
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,320
read the title and just read the

840
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:34,969
abstract you know they say okay I've got

841
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,420
something to support my argument so it

842
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:43,129
makes it really challenging but the

843
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:45,079
reality is is that the all we have to do

844
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,030
is look at what medications are

845
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,579
typically prescribed for an ailment and

846
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,230
compare them to the side effects of

847
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:54,380
cannabis and what's been demonstrated

848
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,960
and even if we accept some side effects

849
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,130
that really I think can be questioned at

850
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,840
this point but if we give them the

851
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,269
benefit adapt and accept some side

852
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,400
effects we're gonna see that it is still

853
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:06,259
the safest and best treatment option not

854
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,500
just for efficacy but for potential

855
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,860
long-term harm I would take a 2 percent

856
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,019
or a two-point IQ decrease in my son for

857
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,240
example who already has developmental

858
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:19,460
delays is gonna live and need caring for

859
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:22,639
his whole life if you can tell me the

860
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:25,490
difference between a 72 IQ and a 70 IQ

861
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,809
versus living and dead then maybe you

862
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:28,849
can argue that this isn't a safe

863
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,529
treatment option but when we look at the

864
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:32,509
other medications that are provided for

865
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,310
a lot of these kids and there's some

866
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,110
kids there's some people here popped in

867
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:37,250
who might be able to talk about this and

868
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,809
you look at the side effects and you

869
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,139
live with those side effects from from

870
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:43,880
damage to internal test ins liver damage

871
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:46,009
behavioral and mood changes weight gain

872
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,470
the the list that has Steven Johnson

873
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:50,470
syndrome a the list of effects that come

874
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:54,799
with a lot of these medications are

875
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:56,000
documented in real so even if we say and

876
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,250
I mean it seems like the bar for

877
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,500
cannabis has been set as either has to

878
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,929
be harmless or it's going to kill you

879
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,280
right but that's not the case even if we

880
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,859
look at the side effects we start to

881
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,350
understand them if we compare those to

882
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,050
what our other treatment options are and

883
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:12,348
then compare those to the efficacy that

884
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,829
they

885
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:14,829
provide

886
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:21,669
good afternoon it's pretty deep

887
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:26,609
radiology the masses when treating these

888
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:32,440
kids or yourself or any adult awesome

889
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:34,630
I'd like to give hi everyone my name I'm

890
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,389
a pageant I have a plexus so I would

891
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:40,090
like to talk a little bit about myself

892
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:45,460
about this issue I think light makes

893
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:50,230
totally Saints so I have epilepsy since

894
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:53,769
I'm 16 years old I was against cannabis

895
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:56,740
for long period of my life I'm from

896
00:37:53,769 --> 00:38:00,130
Brazil so here is like really strict

897
00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:03,159
really dangerous that say this way to

898
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,860
relate with cannabis because of the

899
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:08,559
cartel and all those things so I

900
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:12,820
realized that cannabis was good for me

901
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:18,239
when I was it was like five years ago I

902
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:22,030
was was living in in a bedroom with no

903
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:24,819
soundproof and light proof it had like

904
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:29,230
my life was completely just about taking

905
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:32,620
really hard medicine and like just like

906
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:35,170
having a totally different life and when

907
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:38,769
I start to consume cannabis every day my

908
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:41,320
life's changed totally he liked how my

909
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:44,590
life were like I could have a normal

910
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,570
life like go out with my friends like do

911
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:49,990
all those things that I couldn't do for

912
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:53,289
like so long and I come from that really

913
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:55,989
conservative family in Brazil this is

914
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:59,559
really like religious sites really pure

915
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:02,379
gym one thing related to parental thing

916
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:05,320
as well is my family when they saw the

917
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:08,110
result of like using cannabis every day

918
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:11,769
they saw that I got really really better

919
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:14,710
soon of using so they changed all like

920
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:17,050
their mentality because they could see

921
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,130
it they could see that I was getting

922
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,950
better every day

923
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,110
so my my experience that I would like to

924
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:25,989
share with you guys is like when a

925
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,960
parent when a father and a mother see

926
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:31,779
that you get better doesn't matter which

927
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,079
like the medicine you see the results in

928
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:38,109
epilepsy as I like have since I'm a kid

929
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,480
it's a really like strong illness you

930
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:42,519
know you need to like it's unbelievable

931
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,980
that's like in Brazil even in some

932
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:48,250
countries in Latin America we still have

933
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,539
these policy against cannabis even I've

934
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:55,389
seen the great result holds the Sarty

935
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:57,880
interfere that because I'm a person hi I

936
00:39:55,389 --> 00:40:02,170
think it's good to share experience that

937
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:05,320
I have with that thank you thank you Joe

938
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,358
for sharing and welcome to Wendy and

939
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,920
Colton Turner who have just come into

940
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,769
the room at a perfect time as we're

941
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,710
discussing sort of you know parenting

942
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,420
and cannabis use not only in the

943
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,858
situation that the conversation turned

944
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,519
to which was actually giving your

945
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:24,009
children cannabis but also under the the

946
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,570
conversation of the dialogue of being a

947
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,190
parent who uses cannabis maybe

948
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,530
medicinally or recreationally for

949
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:32,019
yourself and having children and the

950
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:34,269
sort of obstacles that are needed to be

951
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:36,039
overcome throughout the you know how do

952
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:38,469
you discuss that with your children do

953
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:41,019
you hide it from there from the schools

954
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:43,209
and from the parents and the friends or

955
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:45,338
is it something that we're at a time now

956
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,829
where we can open this dialogue and be a

957
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:50,108
little bit more open about it but really

958
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:51,819
welcome both to both of you it's great

959
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:55,750
to see you and I hear you guys made a

960
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:58,539
pretty big move recently yep for the

961
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,639
first time in four years because of the

962
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:03,460
laws in the state of Illinois and

963
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,170
because I'm able to get the medicine

964
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,019
that I use here

965
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:10,180
I've been finally able to move from

966
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:15,608
Colorado back to my home state of

967
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:17,649
southern Illinois and it's fantastic but

968
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:19,659
the reality is is that there's still a

969
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,260
lot of patients who are also stuck in

970
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:22,210
states

971
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,740
you know like Colorado that can't move

972
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,500
back home because they don't have access

973
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:28,209
or you know patients that can't move to

974
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,429
Colorado in the first place simply

975
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,889
because you know they don't have you

976
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:34,659
know the kind of money or anything to to

977
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:36,549
make that kind of move it's a really big

978
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:39,519
decision and parents are still getting

979
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,980
prosecuted for giving their kids silly

980
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,480
little things like th the herb this

981
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,119
I say silly little things like tht

982
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,280
because I don't think it's a big deal

983
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:52,750
but silly little things like CVD you

984
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:57,040
know this is CVD is I mean come on

985
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:59,440
people it's nothing I mean it helps with

986
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,650
no kind of crazy side effects at all and

987
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,599
and I think that people just really need

988
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,030
to start waking up and and I think they

989
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:09,309
have I think people are getting it I

990
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:13,530
think law enforcement is really the

991
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:17,650
issue then they don't want to let go of

992
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:21,609
what they have invested in the war on

993
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:25,210
drugs but but I think that the parents

994
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:28,389
have kind of changed I did I mean I I

995
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:31,030
was against cannabis from the from you

996
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:33,909
know since I was little and raised in

997
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:37,060
southern Illinois and you know thought

998
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:39,789
that all cannabis are all marijuana was

999
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:42,608
bad and and then Colton got sick and my

1000
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:46,840
eyes opened and I changed my mind

1001
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:51,159
and I changed it I mean I did like a 720

1002
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:56,890
and it it's still I'm still spinning I

1003
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:59,199
think the the efficacy of the cannabis

1004
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:03,960
plants on it so many of these diseases

1005
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:06,639
that these kids have is so grand and

1006
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,650
people don't you're right people don't

1007
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,420
want to talk about that and people want

1008
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:14,740
to say you know Greta grabbed those

1009
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,260
headlines that THC drops your IQ I would

1010
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:20,199
have I would rather have an an a

1011
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:24,250
motivational kid or kid like you know

1012
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:29,829
that had at 73 and now is a 70 um

1013
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:33,130
IQ then a dead kid and and that is just

1014
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:39,608
exactly what this is um do you think

1015
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:41,800
morphine makes his IQ drop probably is

1016
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:43,210
there Studies on that he'll I don't know

1017
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,910
I haven't looked at it I mean I've been

1018
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,220
put on medications that have way worse

1019
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:49,299
side effects than cannabis I mean I was

1020
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:51,429
on one medication

1021
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,230
it could cause you know five different

1022
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:54,839
forms of cancer yeah and you're

1023
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,670
concerned about cannabis

1024
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,650
it doesn't make any sense I wanna have

1025
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,380
an FDA approved for it and they put it

1026
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:04,349
on it anyway

1027
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:06,420
it's crazy a lot of this stuff is just

1028
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:09,690
you know it's still the the reefer

1029
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:12,389
madness mentality and a lot of parents

1030
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:15,210
haven't and a lot of legislators have it

1031
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:18,629
still we just got back from Washington

1032
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:21,659
DC about a month and a half ago and they

1033
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:24,809
we talked to one legislator that was

1034
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:27,299
like no no no no no it's bad for you we

1035
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:28,559
don't think it's a horrible drug we

1036
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,120
don't want to have anything do with it

1037
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,340
you know and I'm sitting here thinking

1038
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,309
okay my kid has been on this for four

1039
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:40,500
years so he started this when he was

1040
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:43,110
actually 13 been religiously at 14 14

1041
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,159
years old he's still developing he still

1042
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:49,130
has a developing brain and he's fine

1043
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,989
well I remember when you told the story

1044
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,880
initially how he was absolutely not

1045
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:55,709
developing he was wasting away to

1046
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,349
nothing and when you started giving him

1047
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:03,659
cannabis he actually started developing

1048
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:05,489
yeah so he was in failure to thrive all

1049
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:10,679
it means behind in growth for means

1050
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:14,579
behind them growth he was in a failure

1051
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:18,649
to thrive is is like he is not growing

1052
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:23,279
he's not it his cognitive issues are

1053
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:25,470
being decreased he is wasting away the

1054
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,960
protein and his muscles are wasting and

1055
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:30,509
are grass as developing as a human being

1056
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:35,159
was basically rendered down to zero yeah

1057
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:39,270
and now he's 18 years old he's speaking

1058
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:42,989
at all these crazy events and with such

1059
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:46,369
intelligence and and he's taller than me

1060
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:50,039
now he wasn't he was way shorter than me

1061
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:52,230
four years ago and you know he's a

1062
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,329
normal kid he's shoveling snow he's

1063
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,219
riding his bike he's hanging out the

1064
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,799
only thing that he can't do is try the

1065
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:03,719
car I would say he's above normal and

1066
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:06,780
he's quite exceptional I mean what daily

1067
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,649
dose is he getting right now so I take

1068
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,390
so right now I

1069
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:12,880
medicine that you know I helped

1070
00:46:10,389 --> 00:46:14,500
formulate with a company called Mary's

1071
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,559
medicinals and it's a medicine called

1072
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,900
the remedy one to one by coltan it's

1073
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:22,839
exactly what I take but you know we also

1074
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:25,059
you know like to dose it differently for

1075
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:29,349
example I like to take you know 15

1076
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:31,599
milligrams of both CBD and THC and I

1077
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:34,390
take that oil and then I put them into

1078
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,119
little pill capsules that I order off of

1079
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:40,118
Amazon or buy at the local supermarket

1080
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,829
and I would put them in pills and then I

1081
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:45,849
take them like a pill four times a day

1082
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:49,059
so a total of 60 milligrams of both CBD

1083
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:52,088
and THC per day and there are days where

1084
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:57,420
he can't sleep so he takes an extra dose

1085
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:59,619
of THC so he can sleep um you know he's

1086
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:03,490
there's there are days where he could be

1087
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:08,260
up to a hundred and fifty milligrams of

1088
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:11,919
THC but his normal regulated dose is 60

1089
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:14,109
milligrams a day so Colton how do you go

1090
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,088
about sort of educating your school

1091
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:18,400
friends and the kids that your peers

1092
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:20,469
that are your age I mean obviously it's

1093
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,389
a discussion that you probably had with

1094
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:24,459
more than a few of them I'm sure that

1095
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:26,858
the discussion of recreational vers

1096
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:32,260
medicinal comes up how do you how do you

1097
00:47:26,858 --> 00:47:34,659
navigate that sort of that area before

1098
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,970
we get into that I want to say I don't

1099
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:39,730
feel like there is a recreational

1100
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:44,439
situation I feel like recreational is

1101
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:49,240
over-the-counter because I use cannabis

1102
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:52,000
for a bug bite or a headache or a sore

1103
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:54,129
muscle and I feel like it's more you

1104
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,469
know over-the-counter she doesn't have a

1105
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,630
debilitating disease to use it for but

1106
00:47:56,469 --> 00:48:00,848
it still benefits her so you can go to

1107
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:05,140
time go to Walmart and you can get Tyler

1108
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:07,059
and for your minor ailments and or you

1109
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:09,699
can go to the pharmacy and get Tylenol

1110
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:11,140
three for your major elements and I feel

1111
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:14,379
like that's kind of what it is it's

1112
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:16,798
medicine across the war I I'm I agree as

1113
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,269
well in fact I even would add a third

1114
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:21,690
option to that which it's preventative

1115
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:23,429
why should we wait and we get

1116
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,760
if we can take something that can

1117
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:28,440
actually get our system into a nice you

1118
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,109
know running order where it's like

1119
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:40,050
you're preventing potential sickness and

1120
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:42,139
so I'm a yeah so when we first started

1121
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:45,570
cannabis a lot of our friends and family

1122
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:47,819
surprisingly were very supportive they

1123
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,619
you know we're basic you know our

1124
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:51,809
Grandma and Grandpa you know we were

1125
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:54,030
terrified that they were going to you

1126
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:56,849
know Remus and you know at least this

1127
00:48:54,030 --> 00:49:00,000
long long lecture about how my parents

1128
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:01,650
are terrible people and they said well

1129
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,639
why aren't you in Colorado right now why

1130
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:07,800
haven't you left yet so uh you know as

1131
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,289
we learn you know because we didn't know

1132
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,200
we knew as just as much as they did so

1133
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:15,838
the more that we learned about cannabis

1134
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,299
and about the community in the industry

1135
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:21,420
surrounding it the more we would talk to

1136
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,769
them about it and educate that and it

1137
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,599
was just kind of a learning process

1138
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:25,920
because then they would get curious and

1139
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,559
then they would learn something and then

1140
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,568
they would teach us about it so it's a

1141
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,269
really great you know circle of

1142
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:34,739
Education when it comes to our friends

1143
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:37,980
and family every one of Coulson's

1144
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:40,078
grandparents takes Eadie well you know

1145
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,469
what you are this is the thing for the

1146
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,060
longest time you had you know

1147
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:47,009
Rastafarians and hippies were the ones

1148
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:50,639
preaching this word and they were looked

1149
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:52,260
at as down upon and so people really

1150
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,960
wanted to listen to nothing that they

1151
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,450
said but well now when you have a child

1152
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,159
who's going to be educating you on this

1153
00:49:57,449 --> 00:50:00,989
and not only just any child but a child

1154
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:02,940
that potentially actually saved their

1155
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:05,759
own lives and if not save their own

1156
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,400
lives increase the quality of their

1157
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,470
lives somewhat astronomically and now

1158
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,088
you're related to them and that you love

1159
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:14,608
you have love for them it's gonna be

1160
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:17,400
much easier to hear that that message

1161
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:19,199
that these same you know Rastafarians

1162
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,079
have been singing about in reggae music

1163
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,659
for 40-plus years and just being looked

1164
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,849
down upon laughed laughed at in fact you

1165
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:30,088
know and I've always said it from from

1166
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:32,970
the state of view that young sick

1167
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:34,360
children are the last leg that

1168
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:36,039
prohibition has

1169
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,320
and on and it's crumbling underneath

1170
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:40,989
them because this just takes apart their

1171
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,820
entire arguments of oh well it's you

1172
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:44,799
know like I remember a friend of mine

1173
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,809
who was suffering from from wasting

1174
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,850
syndrome from the AIDS medication he was

1175
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:50,349
on and he went to his doctor and the

1176
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:53,019
doctor said listen you know the the

1177
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:54,460
cannabis the cannabis is gonna is gonna

1178
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:56,259
raise your blood pressure it's gonna

1179
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,760
have you snacking on all sorts of bad

1180
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,680
things and you're gonna you're gonna

1181
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,540
potentially have a high blood pressure

1182
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,719
maybe a heart attack and this is a guy

1183
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:06,880
who was literally like months away from

1184
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:08,980
dying and he's like what is my doctor

1185
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,260
thinking telling me that I'm gonna get

1186
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:14,380
high blood pressure I'm like on the cusp

1187
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:16,120
of death I just need to eat food you

1188
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,150
know and that's what it was doing for

1189
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:22,690
him so yeah that's the way it was with

1190
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:25,930
Bolton completely and he was on the cusp

1191
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:28,510
of cusp of death and and we didn't know

1192
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:32,799
what to do and it definitely hasn't

1193
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:35,230
raised his blood pressure any and and I

1194
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,600
think that the stigma with all the

1195
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:41,469
Rastafarians and and the hippies were

1196
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:44,409
just wrong I mean every day I thank God

1197
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:47,469
for those people because if they

1198
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:49,869
wouldn't have kept up with their fight

1199
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:53,399
in their love and their passion for this

1200
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:56,769
plant my kid wouldn't be here today and

1201
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:00,519
we need to we we really need to respect

1202
00:51:56,769 --> 00:52:03,519
those people and and you know appreciate

1203
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:06,429
the the torment and the hell that they

1204
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:09,940
went through trying to tell us the truth

1205
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:13,329
when we weren't listening and I just you

1206
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:15,670
know I just have so much respect for

1207
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:17,920
just anybody anymore because I don't

1208
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,930
care what they look like I you know we

1209
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,280
we always get oh you're the all-american

1210
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:25,750
family and we are you know we we do we

1211
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,540
do look like that all-american family

1212
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:31,360
and we are able to walk into legislators

1213
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:34,360
offices and get listened to because we

1214
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,460
you know we look like that all-american

1215
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:39,880
family which is so wrong

1216
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:42,130
we we have created this social stigma of

1217
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,110
what you're supposed to look like and

1218
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:46,450
and what you're supposed to do and and

1219
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,269
how you're supposed to act and you know

1220
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:51,739
in

1221
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:53,780
I just I look back at where the cannabis

1222
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:56,509
plant has come from and where it is now

1223
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:59,769
and it was our Rastafarians it was it

1224
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:02,420
was our hippies that brought it here and

1225
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:07,340
you know I think God for them every

1226
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:10,570
single day you have no idea you know how

1227
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:15,590
thankful and grateful I have been to

1228
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:17,660
those people very well said Wendy I I

1229
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:19,820
agree as well it's a you know the

1230
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:21,349
keepers of the plant you know who knows

1231
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,180
where this plant would be if it were if

1232
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:25,339
it wasn't for people who were willing to

1233
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:27,019
you know not just people who were

1234
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,579
willing to you know make money off

1235
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:29,900
prohibition but people who were really

1236
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:31,730
new to the importance of protecting

1237
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,670
these genetics and keeping them alive

1238
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:36,440
amazing people like skunk man Sam who

1239
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,960
travelled the world to all the hash

1240
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:42,079
producing countries and collected seeds

1241
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,990
and bred incredible medicinal cultivars

1242
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,610
you know props to all of you guys who

1243
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:48,339
have been doing this for for so many

1244
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:51,559
decades really

1245
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:55,460
Mr cash pulled the question please

1246
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:58,730
it potent in your medicine like so it's

1247
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,789
a one-to-one THC CBD is that right is

1248
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:04,490
that what you said it was yes it's a

1249
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:06,559
isolated CBD and THC with terpenes

1250
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:10,189
reintroduced with the terpenes okay and

1251
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:13,639
so when you take it to control your your

1252
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:17,358
medical condition you also think that

1253
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:20,750
you can feel what's called psycho

1254
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:24,139
activity like do you feel debilitated

1255
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:26,059
like dizzy or you know the so called hi

1256
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:30,460
I'm just trying to understand whether or

1257
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:33,679
not there's that sweet spot of having a

1258
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:36,108
efficacious treatment to control your

1259
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,919
medical condition but that doesn't

1260
00:54:36,108 --> 00:54:41,480
create the high that would maybe

1261
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:44,180
frighten some patients or keep some

1262
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,760
patients from wanting to try an avatar

1263
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:49,009
in therapy now that's a very good

1264
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,930
question and the first thing that that I

1265
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:55,100
tell people when they ask that is first

1266
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:57,919
not to be afraid of THC because you know

1267
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:59,809
they if they're scared that you know

1268
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,769
it's gonna damage their kids brain then

1269
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:05,150
why are other kids you

1270
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:07,940
for their seizures so I always say well

1271
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:10,639
you know what we did is we micro dosed

1272
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,740
so what we did is we took the oil that I

1273
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:15,829
take and we started with a very small

1274
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:19,219
amount and we slowly you know increase

1275
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:21,799
that dosage until okay if I go above

1276
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:24,459
this line I'm gonna feel some kind of

1277
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,530
intoxication we're gonna stay right here

1278
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:31,250
so our goal is basically to put as much

1279
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:32,900
CBD and as much THC in my system as

1280
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:35,659
possible without feeling that

1281
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,730
intoxication so and then what what level

1282
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:40,879
is that for you right now and does that

1283
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:42,920
level change according to patient or

1284
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,460
body weight or different medical

1285
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,889
conditions we haven't we we haven't

1286
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:51,470
noticed that body weight hadn't had an

1287
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:53,690
issue with it when it comes to Crohn's

1288
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:55,429
disease we have noticed that Crohn's

1289
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:59,420
disease is crohn's disease as far as

1290
00:55:55,429 --> 00:56:02,059
diseases runs in anybody they it's this

1291
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:05,180
it's the same mechanism that's causing

1292
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:09,920
the inflammation but it has nothing to

1293
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:14,329
do with with weight or or anything like

1294
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,570
that or if you're male or female we know

1295
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:20,599
a little girl that that is taking 20

1296
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:22,309
milligrams per dose which is five

1297
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:25,130
milligrams higher than what Colton's is

1298
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:27,559
and then we know a gentleman who's about

1299
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:30,760
250 pounds that only takes five

1300
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:34,329
milligrams so it really um my husband

1301
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,050
had a really good analogy everybody has

1302
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:38,389
pot holes

1303
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:42,920
everybody has their Road that has their

1304
00:56:38,389 --> 00:56:45,319
potholes and maybe my pot holes are you

1305
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:50,630
know I have ten and Colton only has

1306
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:54,860
eight and maybe you have fifteen so we

1307
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:58,820
just need that amount of cannabinoids to

1308
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:01,550
fill our pot holes that's a that's a

1309
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:03,880
good analogy number of receptors right

1310
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:06,500
so if your pot holes are the little

1311
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,360
areas that the molecules need to bind

1312
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,630
into what you're saying is that a

1313
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:14,370
certain level of disease or medical

1314
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:17,329
condition could affect the level of

1315
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:20,130
receptors or even our own body's way of

1316
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:23,460
regulating the endocannabinoids system

1317
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:25,920
is by changing the number of receptors

1318
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:28,019
and how those receptors are expressed

1319
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,019
during variety of different conditions

1320
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:34,650
such as the inflammatory response which

1321
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:37,559
is really just underpins a lot of you

1322
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:39,930
know malfunction in the body when there

1323
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:42,059
is inflammation and what the

1324
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:44,460
inflammation occurs from whether it's

1325
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:47,099
from a wound or whether it's from

1326
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:49,559
something in the diet or whether it's

1327
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:51,210
from buildup of toxins there's all kinds

1328
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:54,840
of reasons for it

1329
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:57,990
but I think like : you're a perfect

1330
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:03,980
example of again yeah like sort of the

1331
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:07,349
the use of of cannabinoids as as

1332
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:10,710
hormones because hormones have an impact

1333
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:13,739
on growth and how your body is basically

1334
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:17,519
looking for certain things in its diet

1335
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:20,399
and in nutrition to catalyze growth and

1336
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,650
to catalyze the formation of new bone

1337
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,740
cells and new muscle cells and your

1338
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:28,590
whole experience that you had which was

1339
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:31,799
again that cannabinoids were somehow at

1340
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:34,829
the at the point of catalyzing that

1341
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:38,580
growth above and beyond your medical

1342
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:41,340
condition was just you know is a real

1343
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:43,469
testament to how again I'll go back to

1344
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,870
something i interjected before when

1345
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:47,669
Marcus was talking that these things are

1346
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:51,690
not only preventative but their

1347
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:55,230
nutritional so CVD will be a fortified

1348
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:58,200
item in foods for years to come from

1349
00:58:55,230 --> 00:59:01,860
baby food through geriatric medicine

1350
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:05,579
because it's a fat soluble antioxidant

1351
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:08,700
that is doing preventative damage from

1352
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:11,400
free radical mediated oxidation in fatty

1353
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:13,619
tissues and most antioxidants like

1354
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,110
vitamin C are water soluble they don't

1355
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:18,659
get into fatty tissues fortunately the

1356
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:21,090
cannabinoids and body has evolved

1357
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:23,730
mechanisms to hold on to them which is

1358
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,338
why we can't pass a urine test very

1359
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,619
quickly

1360
00:59:25,338 --> 00:59:29,449
shows that our body is basically holding

1361
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:32,298
on to these molecules because they're so

1362
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:34,278
useful and so beneficial to fighting

1363
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:37,009
disease and fighting things like free

1364
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:39,650
radical mediated damage and fatty tissue

1365
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:41,869
so in your pancreas and in your brain

1366
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,789
and in any place where there's fatty

1367
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:45,588
tissue there's cannabinoids if you're

1368
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:47,778
using them and you're getting them at

1369
00:59:45,588 --> 00:59:49,880
the right level to where basically their

1370
00:59:47,778 --> 00:59:52,429
metabolic products are being stored

1371
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:55,160
within you know your fatty in your

1372
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:57,710
Oedipus tissue which is actually helping

1373
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:59,748
you stay healthy and as you burn that

1374
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:03,528
tissue those are released throughout

1375
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:04,998
your body and eventually excreted but

1376
01:00:03,528 --> 01:00:07,400
you know the other question I wanted to

1377
01:00:04,998 --> 01:00:09,909
go back to forests and ask I know that

1378
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,769
we were talking a little bit about

1379
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:15,018
distillate based products versus whole

1380
01:00:12,768 --> 01:00:16,968
extracts I think that we had talked

1381
01:00:15,018 --> 01:00:19,098
about this on a previous episode of

1382
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:21,829
hashed Church fours where you were

1383
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:25,430
looking again for different suppliers

1384
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:27,890
and looking at how it comes down to now

1385
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:30,588
the extraction process that you're using

1386
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:32,900
if you're making a whole plant extract

1387
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:35,679
because the whole plant is being

1388
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:38,809
extracted now and not all extraction

1389
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:40,788
processes are created equal right so you

1390
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:43,099
have things like dry sift which is an

1391
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:45,979
extraction process or you have solvent

1392
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:47,778
methods where it dissolves everything

1393
01:00:45,978 --> 01:00:49,308
that's in the plant and and brings it

1394
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:53,509
out so what I'm trying to understand

1395
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:58,309
from forests is your plant extracts that

1396
01:00:53,509 --> 01:01:01,460
are being used for your formulations are

1397
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:03,890
they ethanol based extracts and if

1398
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:05,630
they're ethanol based extracts I like to

1399
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:07,788
get an idea of like what are the other

1400
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:11,059
components that are coming along for the

1401
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:14,539
ride that we should you know look to see

1402
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:17,150
in other extraction methods when we look

1403
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:19,190
at whole plant extracts because I do

1404
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:22,160
believe in act everything that you guys

1405
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:24,559
were saying about entourage effects and

1406
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:26,478
that there's a lot of soluble and make

1407
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,979
me not so soluble components that are

1408
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:30,199
being extracted in the extraction

1409
01:01:27,978 --> 01:01:32,659
process I like to understand like what

1410
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:35,028
those components are and how we can make

1411
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:37,248
sure that those are in whole plant

1412
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:39,199
extracts versus somebody just making

1413
01:01:37,248 --> 01:01:40,969
distillate and adding it to

1414
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,939
some hemp seed oil or something like

1415
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:45,618
that yeah now that's a good question and

1416
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:48,530
this is this is a great conversation

1417
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,849
that I have some things to add on dosing

1418
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,890
as well and we're getting a lot of

1419
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:54,260
questions on the chat about different

1420
01:01:51,889 --> 01:01:57,230
conditions and how they responds but to

1421
01:01:54,260 --> 01:02:00,380
get to that question first yes we I have

1422
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:02,510
become a die-hard fan through trial and

1423
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:07,930
error and seeing what works and what

1424
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:11,869
doesn't of cold ethanol wash extraction

1425
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:15,440
we've just the first run get the ethanol

1426
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:17,960
out leave it as is um you know there's a

1427
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,030
lot of really good closed-loop systems

1428
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,130
now with some of our tractors that are

1429
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:24,170
able to do large amounts the

1430
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:26,720
old-fashioned you know but quite

1431
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,250
expensive rotovap even though I've

1432
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:30,409
looked at some of these other that spray

1433
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:32,420
mist distillers and other things that's

1434
01:02:30,409 --> 01:02:34,639
another conversation but what they're

1435
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,670
having what they're doing this is they

1436
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,509
are providing what I feel

1437
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,760
comparing to the other extraction

1438
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:42,530
methods that we have available barring

1439
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,030
some of the solvent free more work

1440
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,010
extraction so we just don't have the

1441
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:47,660
ability to do I will just leave those

1442
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:49,730
out of its I'm a big fan of those as

1443
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:54,618
well but talking about co2 and other

1444
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:56,539
sort of gas extractions we we get an oil

1445
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:59,510
that I think represents the best we can

1446
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:02,269
the whole plant profile of the original

1447
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:04,400
flower and you know you can tell right

1448
01:03:02,269 --> 01:03:06,920
away by how it smells you know when you

1449
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,858
feel when you smell a cold ethanol wash

1450
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,930
my extract verses others you can see

1451
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:13,690
your decarboxylated in that oil or

1452
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:17,059
you're not decarboxylated

1453
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:18,380
so we've done both what I found is I

1454
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:21,559
don't see too much of a difference

1455
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:22,880
actually in when we go to the final test

1456
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:25,009
results and I think that has to do with

1457
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,410
the distillation process right in the

1458
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:29,180
heat involved in the time involved we'll

1459
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:31,549
see a little bit more acidic compounds

1460
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:33,980
but for the most part we see a lot of a

1461
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:36,560
lot of it transfer over with what we're

1462
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,659
seeing anyway so typically we

1463
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,099
decarboxylate but the more I do test

1464
01:03:38,659 --> 01:03:41,629
friends and compare the tests I'm

1465
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:43,609
wondering if I shouldn't be because

1466
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:45,349
we're not seeing too much you know we

1467
01:03:43,608 --> 01:03:46,818
get a lot of that decarboxylation

1468
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:49,579
through the rest of the process

1469
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:52,289
unfortunately anyway so it hasn't been

1470
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:54,580
too good for acidic

1471
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:57,279
teachers and acidic compounds that we

1472
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:59,019
use but so what we're seeing is we're

1473
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,550
seeing significant irking levels that

1474
01:03:59,019 --> 01:04:05,860
you lose further in the distillation

1475
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:07,840
process and we're seeing as far as other

1476
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:10,750
cannabinoids right you continue to get

1477
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:13,710
we see consistently you know levels even

1478
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:16,030
if there's small levels of CBG in other

1479
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:20,230
compounds in there that I think play a

1480
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:22,180
difference but you know really the main

1481
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:24,130
difference I see is in the percentage of

1482
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:26,379
terpenes and I think that's because

1483
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:29,170
we're limited by what we're testing for

1484
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:31,240
still I really feel that there's a lot

1485
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:34,059
going on that we're just not looking for

1486
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:35,979
yet and you see that in that other

1487
01:04:34,059 --> 01:04:37,539
material up there cannabinoids

1488
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,880
percentage and some of the tests that we

1489
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:42,070
get so I think there's a lot care that

1490
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:43,930
we're not aware of but what I've noticed

1491
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:45,400
if I could boil it down the one simple

1492
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:49,960
thing it's definitely the trippin

1493
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:51,789
continent is higher and whatever else is

1494
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,159
in there is is having an effect that

1495
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:57,130
where we're learning about now but but

1496
01:04:54,159 --> 01:05:00,399
it definitely there without a doubt when

1497
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:03,220
we try it in the real world there is a

1498
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:07,800
very significant difference in efficacy

1499
01:05:03,219 --> 01:05:09,699
so that's what we stick to and as far as

1500
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,820
you know we're getting a lot of

1501
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:14,439
questions on here about dosing and what

1502
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,460
works right for what conditions and

1503
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,950
we're talking a little bit about

1504
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:21,250
milligram dosing with Colton and others

1505
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:24,009
in and your question about you know what

1506
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:27,010
where is that level that that seems to

1507
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:29,830
work and you know with working with over

1508
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:32,230
a hundred and ninety children at this

1509
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:36,579
point all the things I've done with my

1510
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:40,900
own son I have seen absolutely close to

1511
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:43,569
no consistent pattern whatsoever with a

1512
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,309
few exceptions where we have conditions

1513
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,840
like we're learning about gervais

1514
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:48,549
syndrome and others that have specific

1515
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,890
genetic markers that are tied to

1516
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:53,140
specific receptors we can start to get a

1517
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:55,719
little more we see a little more trends

1518
01:05:53,139 --> 01:05:57,609
on what tends to work with those kids

1519
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:59,799
but it goes I think it goes back to

1520
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:01,390
learning about kind of ducked some of

1521
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,690
dr. Russo's theories and others about an

1522
01:06:01,389 --> 01:06:04,219
endo cannabinoid tone

1523
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:06,230
you know I think there's so many

1524
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:09,739
different things that can go wrong in

1525
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:13,400
the system and I think a lot of times we

1526
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:16,159
look at a consequence and we try to

1527
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:18,019
determine what is necessary for that

1528
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:19,699
consequence we need commando cannabinoid

1529
01:06:18,019 --> 01:06:21,980
system isn't functioning properly and

1530
01:06:19,699 --> 01:06:24,588
save the consequence of that poorly

1531
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:27,050
functioning neurotransmitter and electro

1532
01:06:24,588 --> 01:06:31,219
signal control is a seizure right or a

1533
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:33,230
migraine or an incident with IBS right

1534
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:35,209
or whether some other sort of flare-up

1535
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:37,490
right you can start to look at those

1536
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:39,849
incidences and I think what we want to

1537
01:06:37,489 --> 01:06:43,338
do is say well there's the consequence

1538
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:45,440
but so what is needed but but what I've

1539
01:06:43,338 --> 01:06:47,210
begun to feel and I'd like to hear your

1540
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,170
thoughts on this Marc looking at the

1541
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:54,349
lack of consistency and reading you know

1542
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:56,780
in learning more about the EECS it seems

1543
01:06:54,349 --> 01:06:59,119
that that consequence does not

1544
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:01,369
necessarily equate to causality and

1545
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,349
there's several different things that

1546
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:05,480
can go wrong in this system that will

1547
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:07,369
result in the same inability for the

1548
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,530
body to not regulate neurotransmitter or

1549
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:12,140
electrical signaling properly so we

1550
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:15,819
could be not producing an animai into a

1551
01:07:12,139 --> 01:07:15,818
rapid I know glycerol or these other

1552
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:25,509
your doctor cannabinoids recipes right

1553
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:27,579
looking at a lot of the mental health

1554
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:30,068
problems the looks like a lot of it

1555
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:32,019
could be malformed the cb1 and cb2

1556
01:07:30,068 --> 01:07:34,630
receptors so that they can bind properly

1557
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:36,928
we could not be producing the enzyme

1558
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,929
necessary

1559
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:45,610
you

1560
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:58,079
we froze up usually if I wait a few like

1561
01:07:55,409 --> 01:08:00,118
10 seconds it'll kind of unfreeze but I

1562
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,680
guess forest will have to I thought it

1563
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:05,160
was me freezing out

1564
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:08,699
yeah I've blasted a few of APIC sales

1565
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:12,480
here and I was also kind of like is he

1566
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:16,108
coming rosin - oh no up in for a second

1567
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:19,020
I I think mark you said something that I

1568
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:20,429
say a lot with the folks that I work

1569
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:22,770
with who need cannabis

1570
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:24,989
there's something about a sweet spot and

1571
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:29,429
Colton you made reference to this as

1572
01:08:24,988 --> 01:08:31,678
well where you get enough cannabis phyto

1573
01:08:29,429 --> 01:08:33,569
cannabinoids into the bloodstream where

1574
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:37,829
you're seeing benefit for the condition

1575
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:40,350
you're trying to treat while keeping the

1576
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:43,289
dose low enough that depending on what

1577
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:46,350
your need is the THC is not an issue for

1578
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:48,810
you that person and the thing that's

1579
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:51,569
fascinating about THC and psychoactivity

1580
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:54,569
and whatnot is you can view it as a side

1581
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:56,250
effect that's problematic or you can

1582
01:08:54,569 --> 01:09:00,000
view it as a side effect that is

1583
01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:03,238
beneficial like in my case I enjoy the

1584
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:08,639
psychoactivity of THC but to me there's

1585
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:10,789
an undeniable of CBD and THC together I

1586
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:13,588
love that Colton's

1587
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:17,100
remedy that you mentioned earlier is

1588
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:19,528
more or less equal parts CBD and THC and

1589
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:22,048
I don't know about the solvent type or

1590
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:25,020
the extraction that you're doing but

1591
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:27,750
yeah I would really like to follow up

1592
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:35,850
with what he was what Forest was sharing

1593
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:38,819
about cold wha cold ethanol and rosin he

1594
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:40,440
meant he alluded to rosin but pointed

1595
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:43,830
out how much Labor's involved in doing

1596
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:48,028
it and we have already a lot of things

1597
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:50,338
going on but I'm pretty sure that

1598
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:51,889
there's things going on in the cannabis

1599
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:56,189
plant with all the different varieties

1600
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:58,350
it's not just CBD and THC or even CBC or

1601
01:09:56,189 --> 01:10:00,869
cbn or the other cannabinoids that we

1602
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:03,060
test for but isn't there something like

1603
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:05,789
a hundred and some cannabinoids

1604
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:08,280
then this been identified in cannabis

1605
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:09,930
and then a whole bunch of other terpenes

1606
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:19,380
and we know that the mix of cannabinoids

1607
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:20,880
and terpenoids all side if you will but

1608
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:22,619
when you start we're looking at it in

1609
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:26,520
the medical realm it really becomes

1610
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:28,380
important what what specific plant is

1611
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:31,500
going to be of benefit to different

1612
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:33,840
people and then the dosing thing again I

1613
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:36,060
I say I say to the people that we're

1614
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,310
trying to help is you have to sort it

1615
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:41,400
out with for yourself you find that

1616
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:43,560
sweet spot your body will tell you when

1617
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:44,639
you're getting benefit and you're still

1618
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,390
comfortable with it

1619
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,340
I think now I think that's the the value

1620
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:52,050
of cannabis and it's such a limitation

1621
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:54,569
of people because we're very much like

1622
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:56,820
oh I think this is the best well this is

1623
01:10:54,569 --> 01:10:59,130
what's best for me and so I think

1624
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,809
cannabis is a quiver and that it's all

1625
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:02,550
about having all of these extraction

1626
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:04,710
processes and doing monomolecular

1627
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:06,900
medicines with and without terpenes

1628
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:10,079
added and doing full plant profiles and

1629
01:11:06,899 --> 01:11:12,029
everything in between because it's a

1630
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,519
plant that you don't have to go to just

1631
01:11:12,029 --> 01:11:16,469
once to hone in and dial in to what

1632
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,740
works for you you can go through the

1633
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:21,570
quiver and shoot each arrow to find that

1634
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:24,210
spot that works for you because you know

1635
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:25,739
as humans it's like well if something's

1636
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:27,630
great for one person it doesn't

1637
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:29,670
necessarily mean that's how it's going

1638
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:32,930
to be great for the next person and a

1639
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:35,100
lot of people who have these intense

1640
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:37,050
epileptic diseases and whatnot have

1641
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:40,110
found very much that how it's a very

1642
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:43,380
specific profile that's how Halley's

1643
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:46,259
Comet got named here in BC based on

1644
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:48,390
Halley rose and her form of epilepsy and

1645
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,789
her specific brain and what works

1646
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:52,260
specifically well for her it's not to

1647
01:11:50,789 --> 01:11:54,600
say that that plants not going to work

1648
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:58,020
for a lot of people but to me the real

1649
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:00,210
value of cannabis is the quiver it is a

1650
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:02,970
plant that brings so many things and

1651
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:05,310
just imagine not only medicinal

1652
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:07,740
recreational and preventative aspects

1653
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:10,230
from the resin gland but also essential

1654
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:12,359
amino acid rich seeds they literally

1655
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:13,829
contain all of the essential amino acids

1656
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:15,569
that our body needs but can't produce

1657
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,649
including the three required for

1658
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:18,659
children

1659
01:12:16,649 --> 01:12:19,859
then fifty to a hundred thousand

1660
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:23,159
commercial products through the

1661
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:25,920
cellulose and the fiber and the the

1662
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:27,539
actual plant so it's pretty incredible

1663
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,670
when you really break this plant down

1664
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:32,039
not only as a medicine but its ability

1665
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:34,680
to do all of these other things produce

1666
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:37,439
plastics and metals and produce

1667
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:40,950
incredibly healthy seed oils it's it's

1668
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:43,079
mind-blowing really I I think it's

1669
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:46,139
almost like every human has their own

1670
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:49,170
DNA and so does in cannabis and we just

1671
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:52,829
have to find that right cannabis plant

1672
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:55,890
for our DNA you know it it's just so

1673
01:12:52,829 --> 01:12:57,479
vast out there it's crazy and we say all

1674
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:59,520
the time you know Colton has his own

1675
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:00,989
product but that doesn't mean that that

1676
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,830
product is gonna help your Crohn's

1677
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:06,960
disease it helps his and and but that

1678
01:13:04,829 --> 01:13:08,279
doesn't mean that it's it's gonna help

1679
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,159
yours and that you're gonna need the

1680
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:13,019
exact same dose this is not Humera

1681
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:15,599
or not tylenol where you can just go to

1682
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,130
the store and get it and it's gonna take

1683
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,070
care of it it's you know it's not yeah

1684
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:22,409
it's not a one size fits all and we've

1685
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:24,149
noticed that throughout the years you

1686
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:26,130
know helping people with with Crohn's

1687
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:28,319
disease that it isn't a

1688
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:28,949
one-size-fits-all and and that's a good

1689
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,199
thing

1690
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:33,239
yes we're not a one size fit we don't

1691
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,889
have a one-size-fits-all system to

1692
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:39,449
process that was kind of those kind of

1693
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:42,300
things but we feel like as nor as how

1694
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:45,420
medicine has been normalized that we go

1695
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:47,400
to the doctor and he hands us these

1696
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:51,239
pills and he says this is going to take

1697
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:53,009
care of your illness and that we have

1698
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:55,469
that instant gratification most of the

1699
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:58,230
time and that this is supposed to work

1700
01:13:55,470 --> 01:14:01,110
and if it doesn't work right off the bat

1701
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:03,119
it you have to give it time and then we

1702
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:04,559
go back to the doctor and say hey this

1703
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:07,769
doesn't work out or that didn't work

1704
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,330
Cantus is the same way you know just

1705
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:11,130
because you're using cannabis doesn't

1706
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:14,369
mean that you have the right strain and

1707
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:16,739
that you have the right and amount of

1708
01:14:14,369 --> 01:14:18,840
cannabinoids in that strain or terpenes

1709
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:20,939
you may have to find a different one but

1710
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,310
you will find something everyone where

1711
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:25,259
everyone wants to use that argument that

1712
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:26,820
oh well Bob Marley smoked weed all the

1713
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,739
time but he died of cancer

1714
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:30,389
well that's because just because he was

1715
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:32,908
smoking weed doesn't mean that he

1716
01:14:30,389 --> 01:14:36,090
smoking the right kind of weed that he

1717
01:14:32,908 --> 01:14:37,498
needed for his illness and you know I'm

1718
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:40,349
pretty sure he also smoked a lot of

1719
01:14:37,498 --> 01:14:42,809
cigarettes in his time too but you know

1720
01:14:40,349 --> 01:14:44,279
everyone has their own different levels

1721
01:14:42,809 --> 01:14:46,679
that they need for their own different

1722
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:50,099
illnesses because for each person you

1723
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:52,139
know for every cannabinoid it's going to

1724
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:54,869
affect not only the person differently

1725
01:14:52,139 --> 01:14:58,229
but the disease as well we actually

1726
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:59,880
found that Crone cells have cb2

1727
01:14:58,229 --> 01:15:01,708
receptors attached to them and they're

1728
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,229
just they're just sticking out like a

1729
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:08,130
switch and they're waiting for THC to

1730
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:10,050
pass by to flip that switch and then THC

1731
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:12,090
will flip that switch and the

1732
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:14,729
inflammation will go away and then the

1733
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:17,429
CBD will help heal the damage that the

1734
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:19,949
Crohn's disease had done well we have I

1735
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:22,679
mean we have everybody says oh this is

1736
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:24,569
you know the tip of the iceberg the tip

1737
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:26,849
of the iceberg is not even close to what

1738
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:29,698
we are we're a tip of Antarctica yeah

1739
01:15:26,849 --> 01:15:33,479
it's just it's so crazy how much more

1740
01:15:29,698 --> 01:15:35,248
science and how much more the research

1741
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:37,739
and development we really need to do on

1742
01:15:35,248 --> 01:15:39,929
this planet they need to make it

1743
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:41,339
accessible you know in my opinion we're

1744
01:15:39,929 --> 01:15:42,868
at the point where we know it's safe

1745
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:45,360
enough it's like you know what the

1746
01:15:42,868 --> 01:15:48,029
science is important but basically open

1747
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:50,609
the floodgates let this accessible and

1748
01:15:48,029 --> 01:15:52,918
the science can catch up and maybe not

1749
01:15:50,609 --> 01:15:55,498
have to torture small rodents and

1750
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:57,479
animals you can actually even just look

1751
01:15:55,498 --> 01:16:00,958
at the people who are currently using it

1752
01:15:57,479 --> 01:16:02,639
because there are so many animal testing

1753
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:07,069
thing just for a second to see you guys

1754
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:09,599
all know I mean so it's unfortunate but

1755
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:12,179
the way that they determine the safety

1756
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:14,909
of a lot of the things that are in human

1757
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:17,099
diet and the things that humans are

1758
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:20,368
exposed to in terms of environmental

1759
01:16:17,099 --> 01:16:22,409
hazards is unfortunately using animal

1760
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:23,998
testing models they're not always

1761
01:16:22,408 --> 01:16:26,458
accurate but typically they're an

1762
01:16:23,998 --> 01:16:28,648
indicator on how things are going to

1763
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:31,769
behave in humans and when you're talking

1764
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:34,949
marked before about that one test where

1765
01:16:31,769 --> 01:16:37,949
they're environmentally insulting by

1766
01:16:34,948 --> 01:16:39,958
inhalation toxicity yeah that's a very

1767
01:16:37,948 --> 01:16:43,539
very torturous test that they send

1768
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:45,819
animals through to make sure that the

1769
01:16:43,539 --> 01:16:49,029
pounds that are in the products and the

1770
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:51,789
fragrances and the toothpastes and the

1771
01:16:49,029 --> 01:16:54,219
ice creams that humans buy and use are

1772
01:16:51,789 --> 01:17:00,310
safe and what they do is they try to

1773
01:16:54,220 --> 01:17:02,980
establish where the level of effect or

1774
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:06,100
observed effects are and so they try to

1775
01:17:02,979 --> 01:17:09,189
establish where that level is by

1776
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:10,840
basically overdosing the animals until

1777
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:12,969
they don't die anymore and they're like

1778
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:15,869
okay at that point that's sort of like

1779
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:18,550
the lethality thing where do we not see

1780
01:17:15,869 --> 01:17:22,119
narcosis in the animals where do we not

1781
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:23,829
see the animals be lethargic in the case

1782
01:17:22,119 --> 01:17:26,619
you were talking about markets it's

1783
01:17:23,829 --> 01:17:29,289
what's called a genealogy study where

1784
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:31,329
basically they have the the

1785
01:17:29,289 --> 01:17:33,519
environmental insult happened to a

1786
01:17:31,329 --> 01:17:36,659
mother that then gives offspring and

1787
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:39,160
then they look for any kind of you know

1788
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:41,470
abnormalities that could be passed on to

1789
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:43,899
the offspring and as those animals

1790
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:46,360
that's due to the treatment that they

1791
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:48,789
you know we're exposed to as mothers or

1792
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:50,769
as breeding you know adults so the point

1793
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:54,039
is is that there's a lot of this sort of

1794
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:56,740
animal testing that goes on it's gone on

1795
01:17:54,039 --> 01:18:01,000
for you know ages and that's how they've

1796
01:17:56,739 --> 01:18:03,729
established toxic levels of a variety of

1797
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,369
different things and in some cases

1798
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:08,409
they've done that testing directly on

1799
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:11,380
humans so this is like testing where

1800
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:15,460
this is where we see an effect in humans

1801
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:18,760
at this dose for example butane I think

1802
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:22,630
5000 ppm is typically what the upper

1803
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:25,300
limit is of butane contamination in

1804
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:27,250
cannabis extracts some states have it

1805
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:30,190
even lower than that but the reason why

1806
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:31,630
it's set at 5000 ppm sound like a bulk

1807
01:18:30,189 --> 01:18:33,789
from lightning came down from heaven

1808
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:37,630
it's that's where they've observed

1809
01:18:33,789 --> 01:18:39,729
what's called the acute no effect level

1810
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:42,520
so it's people can be exposed at that

1811
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:44,859
level and not acutely be affected by he

1812
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:47,230
won't fall over and die at higher levels

1813
01:18:44,859 --> 01:18:49,569
yeah in laboratory animals and in this

1814
01:18:47,229 --> 01:18:51,399
case in humans they actually have shown

1815
01:18:49,569 --> 01:18:55,029
that yeah these things can actually

1816
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:56,129
cause you know some type of effect and

1817
01:18:55,029 --> 01:18:58,920
so

1818
01:18:56,130 --> 01:19:01,109
is unfortunate but in the society we

1819
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,139
live in everything from your air

1820
01:19:01,109 --> 01:19:06,179
fresheners to things that are used in

1821
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:09,389
laundry detergents things that are used

1822
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:12,779
in all kinds of household products have

1823
01:19:09,389 --> 01:19:15,960
to be tested to determine their safety

1824
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:18,929
and to determine how they impact human

1825
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,359
safety and an environmental impact as

1826
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:23,639
well and so a lot of that unfortunately

1827
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,639
was done with the animals they now

1828
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:27,960
actually have testing where you don't

1829
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:29,550
have to do it in animals they could

1830
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:32,550
actually do it in the computer it's

1831
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:35,039
based on animal testing in all this data

1832
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:38,130
bank mining that they can do based on

1833
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:40,139
the level of data that exists but let's

1834
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:42,690
face it if you develop something news

1835
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:45,600
sometimes you have to do some level of

1836
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:47,309
testing before you give it well the

1837
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,110
thing that surprised me was when I spoke

1838
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:51,420
to some of the scientists who did some

1839
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:53,219
of these experiments I was like well why

1840
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,319
do you have to give the rats so much and

1841
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:57,480
then the guy said some big scientific

1842
01:19:55,319 --> 01:19:59,789
words he was basically well the rats are

1843
01:19:57,479 --> 01:20:02,339
so and so which was basically him saying

1844
01:19:59,789 --> 01:20:04,380
that the rats require like 10 times more

1845
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:06,449
to get high they don't get high the same

1846
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:09,600
way humans do and I'm like well how do

1847
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:11,698
you know that and he's like well we

1848
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,050
don't really it was like a guess we just

1849
01:20:11,698 --> 01:20:14,669
guessed it because we don't see any

1850
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,500
effect so we don't really know if they

1851
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:18,239
are high we can give them quite a bit

1852
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,219
and they just there's no effect so we

1853
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,859
have to give them a lot to see any

1854
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:25,560
effects and I'm like well that's insane

1855
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:31,349
that's completely an insane way to

1856
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:33,000
gather data at least for cannabis right

1857
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:36,000
I mean I know that there's mice that are

1858
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,310
specifically bred for guys yes they

1859
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,800
created and they did create my suite

1860
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:42,870
they also spoke about that which was

1861
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,369
also just yeah it's I know it's kind of

1862
01:20:42,869 --> 01:20:47,488
creepy and everything like that but it's

1863
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:50,340
again we we now understand things at a

1864
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:53,609
molecular level and biology is just a

1865
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:55,260
manifestation of chemistry so it's

1866
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:57,839
really it's just an interesting thing

1867
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,820
again and when we look at like coltan

1868
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:03,210
and so many other people who have the

1869
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:05,219
situation where it's really as you know

1870
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:08,460
dr. Russa would say an endocannabinoid

1871
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:10,090
deficiency were to go back to the pond

1872
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:12,579
ology which I

1873
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:14,619
is beautiful by the way especially when

1874
01:21:12,579 --> 01:21:17,680
you consider pot and holes you know I

1875
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:20,229
don't know anyway so the pothole analogy

1876
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:23,470
would say that again there is a a dance

1877
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:26,289
that's played in between molecules that

1878
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:28,300
are binding to these receptors and the

1879
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:30,960
more we understand about the molecular

1880
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:34,420
nature of that interactions and what's

1881
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,279
responsible for those interactions in

1882
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:38,170
these diseases and how those

1883
01:21:36,279 --> 01:21:41,139
interactions underpin these diseases

1884
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:43,000
will really have a better grasp on how

1885
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:46,690
it all works and how it can be parlayed

1886
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:49,680
into cannabinoid based therapy from the

1887
01:21:46,689 --> 01:21:49,679
plant we all know and love

1888
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:55,689
indeed I want to jump in and say that I

1889
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:59,409
think chemistry is an attempt to

1890
01:21:55,689 --> 01:22:02,710
understand biology and put a name on it

1891
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:04,750
not that it's wrong I like I said I love

1892
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:07,960
the science that comes with this work

1893
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:10,060
but my life is so commonplace mother

1894
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:12,310
nature's chemistry right you know it's

1895
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:15,190
like okay mother nature had this

1896
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:17,380
chemistry set it's all in in water and

1897
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:20,099
when you think about it the fascination

1898
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:22,560
of biochemical synthesis and some of the

1899
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:25,300
metabolites that are isolated from

1900
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:27,490
sponges and whatnot and snake Venom's I

1901
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:30,039
mean these are very very complex

1902
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:32,019
molecules that it would take a synthetic

1903
01:22:30,039 --> 01:22:33,460
chemist like me years to make and

1904
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:36,580
construct from different building blocks

1905
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:40,029
and mother nature can do it like she's

1906
01:22:36,579 --> 01:22:42,069
farting out you know bacteria in yeast

1907
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:45,460
and it's unbelievable there's now

1908
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:47,859
actually technology to make cannabinoids

1909
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:50,890
in yeast so just like you're brewing

1910
01:22:47,859 --> 01:22:53,349
beer and you make cannabinoids and this

1911
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:55,930
is just the beginning of the merger of

1912
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:57,850
modern methods and biotechnology with

1913
01:22:55,930 --> 01:23:00,369
what it can do for cannabinoid

1914
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:03,160
production so I'm absolutely convinced

1915
01:23:00,369 --> 01:23:06,279
when CVD production happens in big food

1916
01:23:03,159 --> 01:23:08,470
and starts being fortified into all

1917
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:10,869
different kinds of food that CVD will

1918
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:14,010
not come from plants in a greenhouse

1919
01:23:10,869 --> 01:23:18,760
that will certainly come from engineered

1920
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:20,710
yeast to make cannabinoids we saw those

1921
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:23,270
guys speak as well the ones that are

1922
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:24,949
producing synthetically Kanab

1923
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:27,380
it's in a lab right now and that was

1924
01:23:24,949 --> 01:23:27,920
which group mark there's a couple doing

1925
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:31,190
it now

1926
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:33,319
well I can't off the top of my head

1927
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:38,960
remember but I did take a picture of one

1928
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:42,079
of his slides mmm

1929
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:44,899
Florida sounds actually yeah yeah so

1930
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:46,809
Florida's probably the T word right does

1931
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:49,549
that ring a bell

1932
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:51,830
um not really there were so many

1933
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:53,060
different groups it was yeah I mean

1934
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:54,859
there's a couple different groups that

1935
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:57,289
are doing this now it's really exciting

1936
01:23:54,859 --> 01:24:01,969
technology and just you know some people

1937
01:23:57,289 --> 01:24:03,859
mark I I think the challenge is that if

1938
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:06,560
you're if you're genetically engineering

1939
01:24:03,859 --> 01:24:08,809
yeast to produce a specific cannabinoid

1940
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:11,120
how do you know that the specific

1941
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:12,740
cannabinoid you get is what's needed for

1942
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:16,760
the various conditions you're trying to

1943
01:24:12,739 --> 01:24:19,369
treat again yeah mother plant the mother

1944
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:23,890
plant cannabis is such an incredibly

1945
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:26,720
complex organism if you will it's like

1946
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:29,210
my understanding it's like eighty to a

1947
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:31,789
hundred million years that plant has

1948
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:33,319
been on this planet and human beings

1949
01:24:31,789 --> 01:24:38,630
have only been here what a couple of

1950
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:41,359
hundred thousand years so we can try and

1951
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:43,520
rewrite and what she can do for us but I

1952
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:45,920
don't think we always are going to hit

1953
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,070
the nail right on the head I don't think

1954
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:52,579
there's only one or two things being

1955
01:24:49,069 --> 01:24:54,199
provided by that plant that's absolutely

1956
01:24:52,579 --> 01:24:56,630
you know like if you do an alcohol

1957
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:59,179
extraction you're probably extracting a

1958
01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:01,400
fair amount of water soluble material

1959
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:04,280
and you wouldn't be extracting if you're

1960
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:06,799
say doing like a butane or even if

1961
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:09,259
you're doing a natural infusion like an

1962
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:13,520
olive oil inflation or some vegetable

1963
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:15,949
oil or seed oil infusion so again these

1964
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:18,170
are all I guess what Marcus would call

1965
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:21,019
different little you know Quivers in the

1966
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:24,350
or arrows in the quiver to use the

1967
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:28,210
metaphor but it just I think what it

1968
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:30,440
creates is again different types of

1969
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:33,409
extracts in terms of their final

1970
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:35,879
chemical makeup and so like I think what

1971
01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:37,920
I was trying to you know get out of

1972
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,609
talking with Horace was trying to

1973
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,829
understand I know it's a very complex

1974
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:46,259
medical condition that Silas suffers

1975
01:25:43,829 --> 01:25:49,319
from what is that particular conditions

1976
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:51,060
sort of we know with the canal we know

1977
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:53,130
cannabinoids are good it's almost like

1978
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,870
you take the cannabinoids out what's all

1979
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:57,210
the rest of the stuff that really makes

1980
01:25:54,869 --> 01:26:00,000
that formulation work for that

1981
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:03,420
particular medical condition and to show

1982
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,170
like with Colton's case how you can

1983
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:10,409
actually measure this into a daily

1984
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:12,569
regimen of let's call it nutrition

1985
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:15,479
because he's nutritionally fortifying

1986
01:26:12,569 --> 01:26:17,789
his diet with these cannabinoids that

1987
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:20,819
his medical condition doesn't render his

1988
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:23,460
body able to make on their own to fill

1989
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:26,460
all the potholes that he needs because

1990
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:28,439
he needs more pot to fill the holes oh

1991
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:30,960
my god I will not use that analogy

1992
01:26:28,439 --> 01:26:32,909
anymore but you guys all know what I

1993
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:36,060
mean I mean said the point is that your

1994
01:26:32,909 --> 01:26:39,619
body's level of cannabinoids is now

1995
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:43,440
being in enhanced or fortified by

1996
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:46,019
something nutritional that's by the way

1997
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:51,719
in his diet he's taking in his mouth

1998
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:56,160
he's vaping it or anything so it's yeah

1999
01:26:51,720 --> 01:27:00,119
nutrition yeah and to use the pothole

2000
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:01,529
analogy one more time you know everyone

2001
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:03,840
has their Road then they need their

2002
01:27:01,529 --> 01:27:05,189
potholes filled but y'all see I don't

2003
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,630
know if this will make sense but you

2004
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:10,189
also have to make sure that you're using

2005
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:13,380
the right cement to build over my holes

2006
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:16,409
because you know a lot of people need

2007
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:18,470
certain commits there are things that

2008
01:27:16,409 --> 01:27:22,019
they're better off staying away from

2009
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:24,180
just for example a you know I'd say

2010
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:30,750
about a couple years ago we started

2011
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:32,190
experimenting with THC THC II uh and we

2012
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:34,409
found that it was an appetite

2013
01:27:32,189 --> 01:27:37,079
suppressant and that's great for

2014
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:39,420
somebody with diabetes or someone who

2015
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:41,250
just wants to lose weight but it is

2016
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:44,460
detrimental to someone with a wasting

2017
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:46,199
disorder mmm so you have to really think

2018
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:49,300
about you know what cannabinoids are

2019
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:50,559
good for you and which ones really are

2020
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:53,079
we're gonna be great if we just had a

2021
01:27:50,559 --> 01:27:55,269
blood test that we could just pull out

2022
01:27:53,078 --> 01:27:56,139
in your blood and say okay these are

2023
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:57,610
your deficient

2024
01:27:56,139 --> 01:28:01,449
these are where you're deficient in

2025
01:27:57,609 --> 01:28:03,819
cannabinoids in in in terpenes and then

2026
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:08,498
just say okay this is the plant that you

2027
01:28:03,819 --> 01:28:11,049
need BAM there you go they could

2028
01:28:08,498 --> 01:28:14,158
probably do a cannabinoid end up

2029
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:17,050
cannabinoid profiling on individuals a

2030
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:19,210
technology exists so I mean maybe it's

2031
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:21,130
being developed and maybe again the way

2032
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:24,130
that they look at things in the future I

2033
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:27,190
use this metaphor loosely the other day

2034
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:29,260
I was like you know that the body's the

2035
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:33,158
endocannabinoids system is the body's

2036
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:35,889
own pharmaceutical company and so if you

2037
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:38,920
keep that cannabinoid end up cannabinoid

2038
01:28:35,889 --> 01:28:40,840
system nurtured mostly through diet but

2039
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:43,719
I think also as law has to do with your

2040
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:46,809
your genes and like your healthiness but

2041
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:49,448
also maintaining a good diet because

2042
01:28:46,809 --> 01:28:52,150
what you are you are what you eat I

2043
01:28:49,448 --> 01:28:54,549
think our friend Todd you just tell us

2044
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:56,888
that but at the end of the day what you

2045
01:28:54,550 --> 01:29:00,969
take into your body is a manifestation

2046
01:28:56,889 --> 01:29:04,118
of what your body has to use to defy

2047
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:06,248
itself against this you know onslaught

2048
01:29:04,118 --> 01:29:09,238
of environmental toxins that we're all

2049
01:29:06,248 --> 01:29:11,710
exposed to every day in this world so

2050
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:14,799
it's a good thing to be able to keep

2051
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:17,550
that system fortified and nurtured and

2052
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:20,529
to know that you can do it every day and

2053
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:22,449
not be completely debilitated with your

2054
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:25,268
you know knocked out or zonked out on a

2055
01:29:22,448 --> 01:29:27,308
couch like you would be if you're opiate

2056
01:29:25,269 --> 01:29:31,530
or a handful of other medications it's

2057
01:29:27,309 --> 01:29:34,210
just so much safer better for people

2058
01:29:31,529 --> 01:29:36,158
yeah that would be great we're a long

2059
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:37,960
way off from that but boy would that be

2060
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:39,788
great I mean CBD and these other

2061
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,260
cannabinoids work on so many different

2062
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:44,139
receptor points and their

2063
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:45,940
pharmacological effects are so very you

2064
01:29:44,139 --> 01:29:48,069
know that it's kind it's what they call

2065
01:29:45,939 --> 01:29:50,319
a dirty drug you know and because it

2066
01:29:48,069 --> 01:29:53,198
doesn't stick to one and reception

2067
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:55,328
points so we really have this large

2068
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:58,629
impact of cannabinoids which is why we

2069
01:29:55,328 --> 01:30:00,819
see this large impact of effect but you

2070
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:02,980
know I know I got cut off earlier and

2071
01:30:00,819 --> 01:30:05,649
and just I don't go over it again in

2072
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:08,139
case it was all covered but the reality

2073
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:10,210
is is we just we have compounds now that

2074
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:12,220
can interact with receptor sites that we

2075
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:13,569
haven't had access to before on this

2076
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:15,970
level and we can interact with them

2077
01:30:13,569 --> 01:30:21,599
relatively and that's being conservative

2078
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:23,980
extremely safely so you know because a

2079
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,840
consequence an issue that happens

2080
01:30:23,979 --> 01:30:27,789
doesn't necessarily dictate causality

2081
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,880
you know we have to experiment and you

2082
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:32,590
know fix your road because so many

2083
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,989
different things can be causing the same

2084
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:38,260
sort of symptoms that we see Express

2085
01:30:34,989 --> 01:30:40,479
externally but you know back to where we

2086
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:42,159
talk about with kids you know this is we

2087
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:45,639
feel comfortable doing this because of

2088
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:50,920
the documented history of safety that

2089
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:52,900
cannabis has and when you see people

2090
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:54,520
with with real critical illness and this

2091
01:30:52,899 --> 01:30:56,500
is where the conversation with kids gets

2092
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:59,620
really completed is there's a big

2093
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:01,329
difference between neurotypical healthy

2094
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:02,890
kids should be getting ready for college

2095
01:31:01,329 --> 01:31:06,069
and they start sitting around taking

2096
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:07,960
bong rips all day that - isn't cannabis

2097
01:31:06,069 --> 01:31:09,549
is fault but it's just you know maybe

2098
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:13,659
not what's most what's best in their

2099
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:15,699
life at that time and treating real

2100
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:17,800
critical illness and when you have

2101
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:20,500
people with these critical illnesses we

2102
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:24,400
you know it's even harder to demonstrate

2103
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:25,989
some sort of negative impact and so you

2104
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:28,029
know because of the safety because of

2105
01:31:25,989 --> 01:31:29,949
the efficacy you know and when they're

2106
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:32,649
able to go through different cannabinoid

2107
01:31:29,949 --> 01:31:34,720
profile measure judge and track how your

2108
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:35,500
body responds there is a lot of

2109
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,720
potential

2110
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,880
if you treat proactively with cannabis

2111
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:42,070
methodically by really paying attention

2112
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:44,680
to what you're treating there is - a lot

2113
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:48,539
of potential for benefit and it's really

2114
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:51,250
great that the cannabis community and

2115
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:53,439
these all these new people who are not

2116
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:55,689
in the cannabis community are coming

2117
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:56,769
together to kind of teach this message

2118
01:31:55,689 --> 01:31:58,839
because it really is about public

2119
01:31:56,770 --> 01:32:01,510
education I mean we get asked all the

2120
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:03,340
time you know how do these kids smoke

2121
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:04,750
all that pot right they just say a lot

2122
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:06,220
of people don't even understand that

2123
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:09,069
cannabis is more than just rolling

2124
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,949
joints these days so you know when we're

2125
01:32:09,069 --> 01:32:13,840
able to bring these people in and

2126
01:32:10,949 --> 01:32:15,670
families like Colton's family and

2127
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,529
people like mark and this shows like

2128
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:18,699
this that can provide education everyone

2129
01:32:17,529 --> 01:32:21,039
who listens and then takes that

2130
01:32:18,698 --> 01:32:23,079
information out into the world we really

2131
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:26,859
see changes inside communities that are

2132
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:29,649
going to lead to cannabis reaching its

2133
01:32:26,859 --> 01:32:32,109
greatest potential for social good and I

2134
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:35,170
always felt that we're we've just barely

2135
01:32:32,109 --> 01:32:37,118
begun to grasp how much benefit in our

2136
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:39,279
communities in our society that cannabis

2137
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:41,920
can have we're just starting to get our

2138
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:47,170
handle on it but what is great just like

2139
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:50,920
was said before is that when you know

2140
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:52,810
you can kind of segregate yourself you

2141
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,908
know for political views right the only

2142
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:58,230
watched CNN you can only watch Fox News

2143
01:32:54,908 --> 01:33:02,408
but the reality is is that illness and

2144
01:32:58,229 --> 01:33:04,149
disease is non-discriminatory and it

2145
01:33:02,408 --> 01:33:09,069
hits everybody from every demographic

2146
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:10,868
and when it hits your family it is the

2147
01:33:09,069 --> 01:33:12,519
slap in the face that you know the human

2148
01:33:10,868 --> 01:33:15,460
brain needs to snap out of their

2149
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:18,340
paradigm and ideology and when it hits

2150
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:21,130
your family then it's your loved one or

2151
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:24,329
yourself whose life is on the line that

2152
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:26,560
all that all that programming in in

2153
01:33:24,329 --> 01:33:29,139
brainwashing from from being raised

2154
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:31,750
under propaganda about cannabis flies

2155
01:33:29,139 --> 01:33:33,789
out the window and you know that's why

2156
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:36,639
one of the missions with the clad rias

2157
01:33:33,789 --> 01:33:39,219
Network and why we work for free and

2158
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:41,618
don't charge any of our families is that

2159
01:33:39,219 --> 01:33:43,359
we feel that when when people come in

2160
01:33:41,618 --> 01:33:45,399
from our Sheriff's Department or from

2161
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:47,618
our military backgrounds from different

2162
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:49,359
church groups demographics that tend to

2163
01:33:47,618 --> 01:33:52,269
have some of the most stigma against

2164
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:55,658
cannabis and we can not only be there to

2165
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:57,820
help them but have them see the benefit

2166
01:33:55,658 --> 01:34:01,118
in their kids life without bleeding them

2167
01:33:57,819 --> 01:34:03,069
dry it changes communities and it

2168
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:04,569
changes hearts and minds and with that

2169
01:34:03,069 --> 01:34:05,769
one person's child is safe in that

2170
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:09,219
church group the whole church

2171
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:11,290
experiences that and when the and these

2172
01:34:09,219 --> 01:34:14,439
are both true stories and window in the

2173
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:15,760
when the sheriff comes the person who

2174
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:17,769
works for the sheriff's department comes

2175
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,719
top secret and scared because they feel

2176
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:20,980
like they're making a drug deal just to

2177
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:22,989
save their kids and they're worried

2178
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:26,649
about their co-workers finding out and

2179
01:34:22,988 --> 01:34:27,329
it's able to help and save the life of

2180
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:30,059
that trial

2181
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:32,460
that trickles into that community and

2182
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:35,039
this is why we're never going back to

2183
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:37,260
where we were with cannabis

2184
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:39,329
I mean organizations like Sam and others

2185
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:41,880
who are trying to keep the good old days

2186
01:34:39,329 --> 01:34:45,180
of prohibition just really don't grasp

2187
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:47,940
the impact that that sort of benefit has

2188
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:49,980
on communities and we're seeing it

2189
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:52,109
slowly trickle across the country and

2190
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:55,500
really it comes down to just education

2191
01:34:52,109 --> 01:35:00,500
and and where we started the elimination

2192
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:04,619
of stigmas you know you're in Washington

2193
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:06,449
Washington excuse me Washington yeah

2194
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:08,340
here in Washington we've had

2195
01:35:06,449 --> 01:35:11,429
legalization for coming up on six years

2196
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:14,220
now and what it's really done is brought

2197
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:16,740
about real normalization you know and

2198
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:19,020
the neighbors are so afraid of cannabis

2199
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:20,659
anymore and I've been teaching six

2200
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,710
semesters at Clark College

2201
01:35:20,659 --> 01:35:24,930
co-constructing of course their cannabis

2202
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:27,029
and your health and it's really opened

2203
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:30,119
it up they now the local community

2204
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:32,420
colleges after having us in there we're

2205
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:35,909
it's working on seven semesters I do

2206
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:39,090
bring in your plants to fruition you

2207
01:35:35,909 --> 01:35:41,399
know for highest yields and and that's

2208
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:44,520
you know best quality cannabis in the

2209
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:45,750
summer and so the community is really

2210
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,520
open we're getting a lot of sick

2211
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:49,920
patients in there and basically like

2212
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,960
everybody's saying we start low and slow

2213
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,640
with everybody we tell them we have a

2214
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,560
lot of Parkinson's patients coming in

2215
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:57,390
and people that are just interested then

2216
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:01,590
an offshoot of that as we started

2217
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:04,140
there's a patient's a medical group that

2218
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:05,909
takes care of themselves so they meet at

2219
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:08,130
my friend Jeremy's house like once a

2220
01:36:05,909 --> 01:36:10,859
month and they share strains and they

2221
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:12,480
share ideas and they they you know

2222
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:14,699
they're promoting the plan in a real

2223
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:15,989
positive way up here in Washington so

2224
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:18,599
that's what we've seen up here in

2225
01:36:15,989 --> 01:36:20,460
Washington as far as like the federal

2226
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,260
research goes we've been seeing them

2227
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:25,319
kicked the research can down the road

2228
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:26,940
since the 70s and then in the 80s again

2229
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:30,029
they kicked the research can down the

2230
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:32,399
road because I was like come on is here

2231
01:36:30,029 --> 01:36:34,439
in what Seattle like doing the town hall

2232
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:36,059
meeting a couple weeks ago and the main

2233
01:36:34,439 --> 01:36:38,869
thing from the state was they're saying

2234
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:40,320
it's such a complicated plant it's so

2235
01:36:38,869 --> 01:36:43,469
complicated you know

2236
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:45,689
and so as far as federal research goes

2237
01:36:43,469 --> 01:36:47,849
we definitely have to descale not

2238
01:36:45,689 --> 01:36:49,828
reschedule we've been saying this for

2239
01:36:47,849 --> 01:36:51,539
years because that just pulls everybody

2240
01:36:49,828 --> 01:36:54,118
out of the game and it only leaves the

2241
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:55,859
pharmaceutical companies in charge and I

2242
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:58,198
think that's our biggest our biggest

2243
01:36:55,859 --> 01:37:00,210
competition in here with legalization

2244
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:02,250
and stuff we've seen all the small

2245
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:05,520
medical mom and pops pretty much are

2246
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:07,380
gone and with the legal system they're

2247
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,940
doing acquisitions and mergers and it's

2248
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:10,618
big huge and you guys are seeing it in

2249
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:12,479
California down there too these mega

2250
01:37:10,618 --> 01:37:15,000
farms popping up all over the place I

2251
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:17,368
really feel sorry for all the people in

2252
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,238
Humboldt that really brought us the show

2253
01:37:17,368 --> 01:37:23,389
to be wiped out of the out of

2254
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:29,309
participating in the new system so

2255
01:37:23,389 --> 01:37:31,560
that's my two cents thanks Tom Wendy

2256
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:33,150
yeah I just wanted to say that I just

2257
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:35,520
wanted to give everybody a story about

2258
01:37:33,149 --> 01:37:39,420
and I think for us just knocked it out

2259
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:42,030
of the park because it is it's changing

2260
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:45,210
in the communities and we when we moved

2261
01:37:42,029 --> 01:37:47,279
to Colorado we we didn't tell anybody

2262
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:50,789
that we were going we were terrified and

2263
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:53,368
then when we went well when Colton and

2264

Tommy moved they came back to get us

2265

about six months later and um we were

2266
01:37:57,658 --> 01:38:04,078
packing our bags to put into the u-haul

2267
01:38:00,658 --> 01:38:07,638

um to talk to us and my husband was

2275
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:34,099
terrified he thought that he was going

2276
01:38:28,618 --> 01:38:37,289
to get a reaming and she didn't she she

2277
01:38:34,099 --> 01:38:39,449
expressed how how much gratitude she had

2278
01:38:37,289 --> 01:38:42,960

2279
01:38:39,448 --> 01:38:46,289

2280

church friends about us and it changed

2281
01:38:46,289 --> 01:38:51,118
our community we just went to the local

2282
01:38:48,988 --> 01:38:53,238
bar the other night to watch one of our

2283
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:55,549
friends play music

2284
01:38:53,238 --> 01:38:57,109
and one of the police chiefs our police

2285
01:38:55,550 --> 01:39:01,309
deputies came up to me and said we're

2286
01:38:57,109 --> 01:39:04,279
I'm glad you're home um it it we are

2287
01:39:01,309 --> 01:39:06,139
changing things all of us and and it

2288
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:08,689
just takes stories it just takes keep

2289
01:39:06,139 --> 01:39:10,880
talking about it it takes everybody not

2290
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:14,748
being afraid to wear a cannabis shirt in

2291
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:16,400
a Walmart and get those looks and asked

2292
01:39:14,748 --> 01:39:18,590
and have those questions asked of you

2293
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:20,868
and tell the truth because that's that's

2294
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:23,239
the main thing is getting the truth out

2295
01:39:20,868 --> 01:39:25,518
is going to help our cause from those as

2296
01:39:23,238 --> 01:39:27,288
long as the mentality of cannabis has

2297
01:39:25,519 --> 01:39:30,260
changed it doesn't matter how long they

2298
01:39:27,288 --> 01:39:31,819
try and prohibit or spread propaganda

2299
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:35,420
about it

2300
01:39:31,819 --> 01:39:38,118
cannabis will become legal as soon as

2301
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:40,880
you know everyone agrees that it's the

2302
01:39:38,118 --> 01:39:43,248
best thing to do for not only our people

2303
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,989
but for our country and our in the world

2304
01:39:43,248 --> 01:39:46,090
as well and if it doesn't we'll all just

2305
01:39:44,988 --> 01:39:48,768
reminisce

2306
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:50,659
well you can always move up to Canada we

2307
01:39:48,769 --> 01:39:52,849
got some federal laws going on up here

2308
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:54,738
where we've welcomed you with open arms

2309
01:39:52,849 --> 01:39:57,319
I think America is gonna do it I think

2310
01:39:54,738 --> 01:39:59,198
it's it's it's the only thing holding it

2311
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:01,939
back worldwide all these other countries

2312
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:04,069
doing it is is one thing but it's

2313
01:40:01,939 --> 01:40:05,839
America right America is the country

2314
01:40:04,069 --> 01:40:08,268
it's the country that exports its

2315
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:10,610
culture through media and movies and

2316
01:40:08,269 --> 01:40:12,530
music in a way that no other country

2317
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:14,598
does and that's why everyone in every

2318
01:40:12,529 --> 01:40:16,729
other country they love that culture

2319
01:40:14,599 --> 01:40:18,139
they love that music in those movies and

2320
01:40:16,729 --> 01:40:19,879
those shows and all of these different

2321
01:40:18,139 --> 01:40:21,949
things and you know that's how the

2322
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:25,099
propaganda was able to be pushed so far

2323
01:40:21,948 --> 01:40:28,038
and so wide news stories yes but like

2324
01:40:25,099 --> 01:40:30,679
you know derogatory jokes and comedy

2325
01:40:28,038 --> 01:40:32,960
movies and you know like different

2326
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:36,050
things that were done in these powerful

2327
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:38,359
mediums I mean my god a newspaper story

2328
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:40,070
just it just changes the minds of tens

2329
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:43,368
of thousands of people and it's like an

2330
01:40:40,069 --> 01:40:45,198
amazing story like like Colton's or like

2331
01:40:43,368 --> 01:40:48,618
Silas and the clad reason at work and

2332
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:50,178
it's just so sly q why aren't we

2333
01:40:48,618 --> 01:40:53,948
touching like a hundred thousand people

2334
01:40:50,179 --> 01:40:53,949
a day this is a very powerful message

2335
01:40:54,368 --> 01:41:00,049
because we're not getting to the

2336
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:04,968
mainstream media like we should be I

2337
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:06,288
think that we we need to know we've been

2338
01:41:04,969 --> 01:41:08,480
on the double

2339
01:41:06,288 --> 01:41:11,750
but there's been people that have been

2340
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:14,209
on the doctors in the dr. Oz Show but I

2341
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:16,038
just don't think that we're getting to

2342
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:19,908
the mainstream media like we should like

2343
01:41:16,038 --> 01:41:22,130
we really need to be pushing that we

2344
01:41:19,908 --> 01:41:23,859
call our facebook messages from people

2345
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:26,599
all over the world every single day

2346
01:41:23,859 --> 01:41:30,558
Facebook has been a godsend to our

2347
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:34,429
family in in our message but that's as

2348
01:41:30,559 --> 01:41:36,320
far as it's gone is you know we really

2349
01:41:34,429 --> 01:41:39,170
need to get out there and tell and show

2350
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:43,368
people look he's thirty five nanograms

2351
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:46,849
and he's fine he's not high he's taken a

2352
01:41:43,368 --> 01:41:49,518
lot of TV in and we need to get those

2353
01:41:46,849 --> 01:41:51,710
stories out I don't know I don't know

2354
01:41:49,519 --> 01:41:53,840
how to do it well also why is why is

2355
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:57,408
four different types or five different

2356
01:41:53,840 --> 01:42:00,260
types of cancer a side-effect okay but

2357
01:41:57,408 --> 01:42:02,868
getting high isn't like it's the worst

2358
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:04,869
thing on the planet to experience

2359
01:42:02,868 --> 01:42:07,670
euphoria because here's the thing like

2360
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:09,768
euphoria is kind of fun especially for

2361
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:12,529
people who have come along during a time

2362
01:42:09,769 --> 01:42:15,019
where they haven't been as engrained in

2363
01:42:12,529 --> 01:42:16,639
the fear and the propaganda because

2364
01:42:15,019 --> 01:42:18,320
that's really one of the worst things

2365
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:21,078
about getting a little too high on

2366
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:23,630
cannabis is the propaganda that you

2367
01:42:21,078 --> 01:42:25,729
carry with you subconsciously about this

2368
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:27,019
plant it creates this paranoid feeling

2369
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:28,279
well where do you think that paranoia

2370
01:42:27,019 --> 01:42:30,440
comes from it comes from the police

2371
01:42:28,279 --> 01:42:32,689
kicking your door down taking your kids

2372
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:36,288
away throwing you in jail and destroying

2373
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:40,279
your life that's a pretty heavy vibe to

2374
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:42,439
be really funny when he's high he we've

2375
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:45,018
got them high before and he is hilarious

2376
01:42:42,439 --> 01:42:47,960
and he feels good so what's so wrong

2377
01:42:45,019 --> 01:42:50,210
with that I mean the point of taking all

2378
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:54,380
these medications is to feel good and

2379
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:57,109
happy I'm telling you I'm telling you

2380
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:59,150
and me michaela on the documentary

2381
01:42:57,109 --> 01:43:01,908
stoned kids which I think vice has since

2382
01:42:59,149 --> 01:43:03,920
changed the name of that documentary but

2383
01:43:01,908 --> 01:43:05,750
it was called stone kids and Michaela

2384
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:07,130
Brandon's young daughter who was eight

2385
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:10,099
or nine years old and developed this

2386
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:12,349
harsh leukemia they were asking her like

2387
01:43:10,099 --> 01:43:13,819
she was on high doses of THC and and

2388
01:43:12,349 --> 01:43:16,369
they were like oh what's that like and

2389
01:43:13,819 --> 01:43:17,049
she was just so sweet and so honest in

2390
01:43:16,368 --> 01:43:18,339
her answer

2391
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:21,010
but it wasn't the nightmare that

2392
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:23,170
everyone is portraying you know it was

2393
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:28,059
it was really quite innocent and it was

2394
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:30,789
clearly not a negative thing yeah we

2395
01:43:28,059 --> 01:43:33,340
went it's all about it's all about all

2396
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:35,618
of the money you know we've been seeing

2397
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:37,449
it all over the place so a beak you can

2398
01:43:35,618 --> 01:43:39,460
trace it back there's really no money in

2399
01:43:37,448 --> 01:43:43,149
cannabis everybody can take care of

2400
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:45,730
themselves so you know and and you know

2401
01:43:43,149 --> 01:43:47,979
we have all these you know everybody's

2402
01:43:45,729 --> 01:43:49,359
been talking about it there's all these

2403
01:43:47,979 --> 01:43:51,308
wonderful products that come from

2404
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:53,439
cannabis and it does this amazing thing

2405
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:54,969
we have this into cannabinoid system and

2406
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:57,848
it feeds us and it keeps it everybody

2407
01:43:54,969 --> 01:44:01,239
healthy well how is that how is that

2408
01:43:57,849 --> 01:44:03,520
good for industry you know all right now

2409
01:44:01,238 --> 01:44:05,229
we have in in the United States in

2410
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:09,190
general we're more reactive than

2411
01:44:05,229 --> 01:44:12,328
preventative in micro toxins and fecal

2412
01:44:09,189 --> 01:44:15,969
matter in our food you notice that when

2413
01:44:12,328 --> 01:44:17,948
they have a recall it's only it's when a

2414
01:44:15,969 --> 01:44:20,050
thousand people have been affected and

2415
01:44:17,948 --> 01:44:22,598
then all they do is go after that one

2416
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:24,520
farm shame that one farmer that one

2417
01:44:22,599 --> 01:44:27,279
processing facility and then it's gone

2418
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:29,380
off the news we don't we don't really

2419
01:44:27,279 --> 01:44:32,198
take a proactive matter like they do in

2420
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:33,670
Europe South Korea and Japan you know I

2421
01:44:32,198 --> 01:44:36,698
think that's where we got to start we

2422
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:39,760
got to start you know at America

2423
01:44:36,698 --> 01:44:41,500
demanding that you know higher quality

2424
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:43,270
of everything because we're seeing the

2425
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:45,578
degradation and the downgrading of the

2426
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:47,590
cannabis here in Washington we're way up

2427
01:44:45,578 --> 01:44:51,219
here in the north we have mold issues a

2428
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:52,929
friend of mine edy from analytical 360

2429
01:44:51,219 --> 01:44:54,908
told me there used to be a 30 percent

2430
01:44:52,929 --> 01:44:57,880
failure rate and then the lobbyists for

2431
01:44:54,908 --> 01:45:00,368
the farmers and producer processors when

2432
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,949
and Lobby the state they drop the levels

2433
01:45:00,368 --> 01:45:05,170
and now there's no no failures from bold

2434
01:45:02,948 --> 01:45:07,089
so there's moldy weed going out there

2435
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:08,739
and if we want to put our best foot

2436
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:11,078
forward we've been fight for cannabis

2437
01:45:08,738 --> 01:45:13,718
for so long and it's so passionate to so

2438
01:45:11,078 --> 01:45:15,279
many of us that we really have to demand

2439
01:45:13,719 --> 01:45:18,130
that we put our best foot forward and

2440
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:20,649
not let happen to our regular food

2441
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:23,980
supply what that could possibly happen

2442
01:45:20,649 --> 01:45:26,170
to cannabis yeah I mean that and that's

2443
01:45:23,979 --> 01:45:27,819
through support right I mean I often say

2444
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:29,529
you've put a really good connection

2445
01:45:27,819 --> 01:45:30,549
there right at the end Tom which you

2446
01:45:29,529 --> 01:45:32,229
know I'm in this case

2447
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:34,539
Miss World I see people constantly like

2448
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:35,888
we need the best we need the cleanest we

2449
01:45:34,539 --> 01:45:38,349
need and then it's like if you look at

2450
01:45:35,889 --> 01:45:40,449
many other aspects of their life they're

2451
01:45:38,349 --> 01:45:42,219
not following those rules they're eating

2452
01:45:40,448 --> 01:45:49,299
some of the worst quality food that you

2453
01:45:42,219 --> 01:45:51,658
can eat their claim in their patients I

2454
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:53,889
have a hard time with that model too so

2455
01:45:51,658 --> 01:45:56,019
yes that's the scary thing about

2456
01:45:53,889 --> 01:45:58,029
cannabis is when you see that every

2457
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:01,480
other industry every other aspect a

2458
01:45:58,029 --> 01:46:04,059
'grill of it has just been so utterly

2459
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:06,488
destroyed that it is kind of worrisome

2460
01:46:04,059 --> 01:46:08,289
in the sense that that that could

2461
01:46:06,488 --> 01:46:11,169
potentially happen to cannabis as well

2462
01:46:08,289 --> 01:46:13,300
and then it's all based in profit so the

2463
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:15,460
the profit makers are the most important

2464
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:18,159
people in our and our oligarchy country

2465
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:20,980
that we live in here so it's it's really

2466
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:23,289
sad that they use us as pawns because

2467
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:24,669
what happens when we eat bad food for

2468
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:26,738
all these years well we end up getting

2469
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:28,719
cancer and then we feed off another

2470
01:46:26,738 --> 01:46:30,519
system the medical physicist amande then

2471
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:33,489
the pharmaceutical system and that's why

2472
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:35,889
they're fighting so hard and so tooth

2473
01:46:33,488 --> 01:46:41,109
and nail with you know keeping cannabis

2474
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:43,929
illegal through that forest well I just

2475
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:45,880
I just totally agree I mean we don't do

2476
01:46:43,929 --> 01:46:49,179
things because they're right I mean I

2477
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:51,219
love I love my country but but you know

2478
01:46:49,179 --> 01:46:53,500
it's been set up in a way and I think it

2479
01:46:51,219 --> 01:46:58,380
needs to be really reviewed and assessed

2480
01:46:53,500 --> 01:47:01,658
that you know things get done because

2481
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:03,520
politicians are lobbied they need luck

2482
01:47:01,658 --> 01:47:05,529
they need support to be put in office it

2483
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,119
cost millions of dollars and the people

2484
01:47:05,529 --> 01:47:10,210
who have those millions of dollars to

2485
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:13,750
lobby and get that support our business

2486
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:15,819
you know and it's very difficult to get

2487
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:18,039
something done that doesn't have a

2488
01:47:15,819 --> 01:47:19,590
profit motive or a business model behind

2489
01:47:18,039 --> 01:47:21,789
it it takes

2490
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:23,980
unfortunately it typically takes serious

2491
01:47:21,789 --> 01:47:25,988
death and in serious attention and

2492
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:28,118
people have to suffer and then there's

2493
01:47:25,988 --> 01:47:31,238
the when when there's a political price

2494
01:47:28,118 --> 01:47:34,179
paid for it then something is done and

2495
01:47:31,238 --> 01:47:36,669
really that's what I've tried to do with

2496
01:47:34,179 --> 01:47:38,590
with our work is with Silas and the clad

2497
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:40,868
raise kids and stuff the Colton's doing

2498
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:43,449
you know we have the hashtag make them

2499
01:47:40,868 --> 01:47:46,059
watch write for a reason

2500
01:47:43,449 --> 01:47:48,159
because they have to see the suffering

2501
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:50,080
people have to start sharing that and

2502
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:51,939
the stigma around cannabis is really

2503
01:47:50,079 --> 01:47:55,210
prevented a lot of sharing people are so

2504
01:47:51,939 --> 01:47:57,429
afraid to share that experience but you

2505
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:59,319
know I think that if politicians and

2506
01:47:57,430 --> 01:48:03,490
people are gonna have ideologies that

2507
01:47:59,319 --> 01:48:05,170
have real-life consequences to children

2508
01:48:03,489 --> 01:48:07,479
and adults and people suffering from

2509
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:09,730
terminal illness and they shouldn't be

2510
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:13,859
spared the consequences of that and I

2511
01:48:09,729 --> 01:48:13,859
think that this is why the social

2512
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:21,260
the the promote some of the legislation

2513
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:22,880
is changing some the national things are

2514
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:25,970
happening the progress we've seen in in

2515
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,880
California and other states is because

2516
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:30,949
of some of that social pressure and you

2517
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:35,510
know I think that it needs to not slow

2518
01:48:30,949 --> 01:48:37,250
down now because the reality is is we're

2519
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:38,510
I'm confident that we're gonna get there

2520
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:40,850
but that shouldn't make us comfortable

2521
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:43,280
you know our goal is to get there with

2522
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:45,920
as many people still alive when we get

2523
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:46,699
there and this whole like yeah it's

2524
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,859
gonna happen it's gonna happen

2525
01:48:46,699 --> 01:48:51,529
eventually just just settle down and I

2526
01:48:48,859 --> 01:48:55,579
get that a lot from politicians local

2527
01:48:51,529 --> 01:48:57,559
and national that that time that sense

2528
01:48:55,579 --> 01:48:59,920
of time that's a privilege and it's a

2529
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:02,510
privilege that not everybody shares and

2530
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:04,250
really unless you have illness you don't

2531
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:06,050
understand that time is a privilege you

2532
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:07,789
kind of just live in our in our human

2533
01:49:06,050 --> 01:49:10,610
paradigm that says we're gonna live

2534
01:49:07,789 --> 01:49:13,220
forever but when when you look at death

2535
01:49:10,609 --> 01:49:14,809
everyday you realize that you know

2536
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:16,699
what's gonna happen just give it a few

2537
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:18,980
years isn't always an acceptable answer

2538
01:49:16,699 --> 01:49:20,689
we want everybody to make it to that day

2539
01:49:18,979 --> 01:49:23,929
where they have these treatment options

2540
01:49:20,689 --> 01:49:26,210
so you know it'd be great if we just saw

2541
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:28,880
the law is changing but but money rules

2542
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:31,220
supreme man ideology is a close second

2543
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:33,020
and we're heavy we're we're we're

2544
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:34,280
steeped heavily on both here in the

2545
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:36,890
states and it's gonna take to the

2546
01:49:34,279 --> 01:49:39,710
community in the public to really hold

2547
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:41,539
politicians feet to the fire it's going

2548
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:43,550
to take them having to see the children

2549
01:49:41,539 --> 01:49:45,890
who were dying the adults who are

2550
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:48,710
suffering I'm not just here that aids

2551
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:50,390
wasting syndrome is being caused because

2552
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:52,069
of the bans and in the compassion

2553
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:53,510
programs in California that used to

2554
01:49:52,069 --> 01:49:54,979
treat them for years are no longer

2555
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:57,680
allowed to function under our

2556
01:49:54,979 --> 01:49:59,479
quote-unquote legalization they need to

2557
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:01,690
see what that looks like they need to

2558
01:49:59,479 --> 01:50:05,059
have that experience that we have

2559
01:50:01,689 --> 01:50:06,889
because that experience changes people's

2560
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,840
perspective right it's different hearing

2561
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:10,880
kids have seizures and this helps them

2562
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:13,010
when the kids have the seizure in the

2563
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,230
politicians office they tend to change

2564
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:16,520
their tune real quick

2565
01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:18,529
so I mean I would just put a call out to

2566
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:21,440
everybody who this is important to to

2567
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:23,329
realize that you know it takes work and

2568
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:25,449
the more of us who are sending emails

2569
01:50:23,329 --> 01:50:26,899
the more of us who are posting our

2570
01:50:25,449 --> 01:50:30,219
experiences

2571
01:50:26,899 --> 01:50:32,629
even when it's embarrassing and hard

2572
01:50:30,219 --> 01:50:35,899
the-the-the more but it has a real

2573
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:37,569
impact and and if I will get there you

2574
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:40,579
know that's why we go to Washington DC

2575
01:50:37,569 --> 01:50:43,039
that's why we knock on doors in our

2576
01:50:40,579 --> 01:50:47,210
politicians offices even if they're not

2577
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:49,250
our we're not in the Constituent um we

2578
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:51,619
we want to talk to every single person

2579
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:54,439
that we can possibly talk to you it's

2580
01:50:51,619 --> 01:50:56,599
it's absolutely ridiculous

2581
01:50:54,439 --> 01:51:00,049
the other yesterday and you know they

2582
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:02,210
just legalized a referendum but they

2583
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:05,869
still have a ways to go to make it make

2584
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:08,000
it an amendment but the the thing is is

2585
01:51:05,869 --> 01:51:10,488
that we we happened you're right we have

2586
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,340
to do this week I put it colton in front

2587
01:51:10,488 --> 01:51:16,519
of these people and say how can you deny

2588
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:19,250
him I mean I've shown people you know

2589
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,480
pictures of my colon and I don't know if

2590
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,969
you think that that's not embarrassing

2591
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:24,408
but it doesn't at once you show people

2592
01:51:22,969 --> 01:51:29,210
pictures of your colon you're not

2593
01:51:24,408 --> 01:51:31,250
embarrassed or scared of anything you

2594
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:32,719
know a lot of kids a lot of kids and a

2595
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:35,510
lot of patients you know they need

2596
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:37,399
cannabis and they're suffering without

2597
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:39,289
it regardless of you know

2598
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:41,979
whether the laws say that they should be

2599
01:51:39,289 --> 01:51:45,948
allowed to or not you know I believe

2600
01:51:41,979 --> 01:51:48,529
100% that we need research in I we need

2601
01:51:45,948 --> 01:51:50,689
you know clinical research for you know

2602
01:51:48,529 --> 01:51:52,399
not only the the negative sides of

2603
01:51:50,689 --> 01:51:55,579
cannabis but also the positive sides

2604
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:57,889
because most research has been you know

2605
01:51:55,579 --> 01:52:00,079
aimed towards the negative most look at

2606
01:51:57,890 --> 01:52:02,900
this there's been plenty of research on

2607
01:52:00,079 --> 01:52:05,689
the negative if there was something to

2608
01:52:02,899 --> 01:52:08,389
be found there they've had 60 years to

2609
01:52:05,689 --> 01:52:10,549
try to hash it out yeah it's our turn

2610
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:12,619
it's our turn now thank you guys you can

2611
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:15,079
take your night of cash and head on over

2612
01:52:12,619 --> 01:52:17,420
to the side and wait it's now our turn

2613
01:52:15,079 --> 01:52:20,179
we're gonna look for the positive well

2614
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:22,730
one of the we we bought for Bill our

2615
01:52:20,179 --> 01:52:25,130
fought for some research in Colorado for

2616
01:52:22,729 --> 01:52:27,859
an eye reading research study

2617
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:29,390
observational and Colton was the first

2618
01:52:27,859 --> 01:52:31,880
person to sign up for it and we're

2619
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:34,610
really excited and one of the questions

2620
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:38,900
that he was asked on this on this

2621
01:52:34,609 --> 01:52:40,519
research this survey was do you still

2622
01:52:38,899 --> 01:52:47,359
use or sell your

2623
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:51,560
opiates how does that have anything to

2624
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:53,329
do with cannabis they were they were

2625
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:55,039
basically just asking me you know they

2626
01:52:53,329 --> 01:52:59,899
were asking me if I was a drug dealer

2627
01:52:55,039 --> 01:53:02,029
because he's a cannabis user and we need

2628
01:52:59,899 --> 01:53:04,429
to get out of that situation we really

2629
01:53:02,029 --> 01:53:05,779
need to have um surveys and

2630
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:09,829
observational studies that are looking

2631
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:12,619
at efficacy and not looking at the drug

2632
01:53:09,829 --> 01:53:14,779
abuse situation and we need politicians

2633
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:17,269
that that are going to be open-minded

2634
01:53:14,779 --> 01:53:19,309
and we need to have families

2635
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:21,350
I would love to organize a group of

2636
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:23,900
families that are bringing their kids

2637
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:28,250
and saying look at them in the face and

2638
01:53:23,899 --> 01:53:30,079
tell them no I mean not just epilepsy

2639
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:33,380
kids but Crohn's kids and cancer kids

2640
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:35,659
and kids with autism and you know and

2641
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:38,840
just say look look at these kids and

2642
01:53:35,659 --> 01:53:42,319
cannabis is working for them how are you

2643
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:45,680
going to say that they can't use it in

2644
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:48,979
2015 I got to educate seven agents from

2645
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:53,510
the CDC and NIOSH on production of

2646
01:53:48,979 --> 01:53:55,449
processing of cannabis on my farm we did

2647
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:58,250
the first workplace health and safety

2648
01:53:55,449 --> 01:54:00,800
evaluation in the cannabis industry the

2649
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,060
study's been published we got the

2650
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,550
federal government to use the word

2651
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:06,890
cannabis instead of marijuana they

2652
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:09,260
called my farm an organic farm they

2653
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:12,470
stood straight up said I grow organic

2654
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:14,690
cannabis and what we got to do they came

2655
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:19,550
twice to my farm they came for two days

2656
01:54:14,689 --> 01:54:22,039
in August where we originally I'd set up

2657
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:23,989
a tour between Washington and Oregon and

2658
01:54:22,039 --> 01:54:27,850
all these different manufacturers

2659
01:54:23,989 --> 01:54:29,989
processors you know equipment machine

2660
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:31,910
manufacturers all this stuff to kind of

2661
01:54:29,989 --> 01:54:33,500
keep him updated because when I first

2662
01:54:31,909 --> 01:54:37,130
got on the phone with ten agents from

2663
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:38,479
the CDC they said I asked him well were

2664
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:40,699
you getting your information they said

2665
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:43,699
you tube and no offense to YouTube but I

2666
01:54:40,699 --> 01:54:45,260
said well isn't that you know wouldn't

2667
01:54:43,699 --> 01:54:48,139
you like to come out for a tours and

2668
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:50,510
that kind of an insult to our industry

2669
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:52,340
because there's a lot of mix information

2670
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:54,030
out there some of its really good some

2671
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:56,250
of its really bad I'd be happy to

2672
01:54:54,029 --> 01:54:58,139
introduce you to the industry and they

2673
01:54:56,250 --> 01:55:01,260
said yes they were interested so we had

2674
01:54:58,139 --> 01:55:02,788
I turned in the itinerary they said yes

2675
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:05,460
and then they said no we can't have our

2676
01:55:02,788 --> 01:55:08,368
agents going across state lines and into

2677
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:09,989
operations that may be illegal but we

2678
01:55:08,368 --> 01:55:11,759
can do is make your farmers secure

2679
01:55:09,988 --> 01:55:14,189
location where federal agents can learn

2680
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:16,079
touch and handle cannabis are you okay

2681
01:55:14,189 --> 01:55:17,368
with that I said sure they said well

2682
01:55:16,078 --> 01:55:18,960
you're gonna have to be vetted by the

2683
01:55:17,368 --> 01:55:20,308
federal government to grow you know

2684
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,559
we're gonna have to do background checks

2685
01:55:20,309 --> 01:55:25,079
and we said please because we've always

2686
01:55:22,559 --> 01:55:27,659
played by the rules you know I'm not a

2687
01:55:25,078 --> 01:55:29,639
mailer and I know ball shared across the

2688
01:55:27,658 --> 01:55:31,589
country that's just not my style but

2689
01:55:29,639 --> 01:55:35,210
normalizing cannabis and normalizing the

2690
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:35,210
plant for the better good of the plant

2691
01:55:35,899 --> 01:55:42,348
which agency resists you say this the

2692
01:55:39,538 --> 01:55:46,259
CDC Center Disease Control and NIOSH

2693
01:55:42,349 --> 01:55:49,288
especially so NIOSH so under the CDC

2694
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:51,329
there's OSHA and NIOSH OSHA is the

2695
01:55:49,288 --> 01:55:54,868
enforcement side for workplace health

2696
01:55:51,328 --> 01:55:56,609
and safety and NIOSH is the scientist

2697
01:55:54,868 --> 01:55:59,130
side so they do all the research and

2698
01:55:56,609 --> 01:56:01,948
write all these HAES health hazard

2699
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:03,750
evaluation and they thought it was

2700
01:56:01,948 --> 01:56:06,750
important enough well originally came

2701
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:09,510
because the Denver Police Union had

2702
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:12,149
filed a complaint that their officers

2703
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:15,389
were going into these a you know illegal

2704
01:56:12,149 --> 01:56:18,029
indoor grows and being contaminated by

2705
01:56:15,389 --> 01:56:20,520
mold I mean it was so important to them

2706
01:56:18,029 --> 01:56:22,229
that they brought in when they came to

2707
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:24,900
my problem they brought in curtain who

2708
01:56:22,229 --> 01:56:27,868
had spent the last two years in Africa

2709
01:56:24,899 --> 01:56:31,859
looking at he dead dead Ebola victims

2710
01:56:27,868 --> 01:56:34,948
and they came to my farm and we got to

2711
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:37,170
educate him for two days we brought in

2712
01:56:34,948 --> 01:56:40,049
the top people in the industry JD from

2713
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:43,380
scout Farm research told them all about

2714
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:45,570
hydrocarbons and we brought in Dana from

2715
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:47,578
goat labs we you know so we bought in a

2716
01:56:45,569 --> 01:56:50,130
lot of really qualified people we did a

2717
01:56:47,578 --> 01:56:52,349
farm-to-table you know we we grow old

2718
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:53,819
school we grow organic vegetables and

2719
01:56:52,349 --> 01:56:56,750
organic cannabis it's more of a

2720
01:56:53,819 --> 01:56:59,130
lifestyle for us than anything else and

2721
01:56:56,750 --> 01:57:01,078
so we brought him in and had him here

2722
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:04,078
for two days we want to had pizza and

2723
01:57:01,078 --> 01:57:06,159
beer but the thing is is I had one shot

2724
01:57:04,078 --> 01:57:07,840
they were there on my dime

2725
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:09,579
and when they came to the farm when we

2726
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:11,710
started at nine o'clock in the morning

2727
01:57:09,579 --> 01:57:14,019
we smoked two joints about ten feet away

2728
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:15,640
from them did a couple dabs and then we

2729
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:18,040
all went over there and said now we're

2730
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:20,920
gonna educate you and we smoked

2731
01:57:18,039 --> 01:57:23,019
throughout the two days periodically

2732
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:25,000
like we did and we roll joints in front

2733
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:27,880
of them and the whole nine yards no they

2734
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,819
didn't partake they're scientists I mean

2735
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:33,010
hopefully we did some good because I'm

2736
01:57:30,819 --> 01:57:35,170
sure the current administration's gonna

2737
01:57:33,010 --> 01:57:37,420
do we have anybody who's had any you

2738
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:39,399
know work with any of these people and I

2739
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:42,130
think from what they told me we're the

2740
01:57:39,399 --> 01:57:43,989
first people to ever work with any

2741
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:46,960
federal agency when they had to do for

2742
01:57:43,989 --> 01:57:49,569
cannabis at all in any in any Content

2743
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:52,029
you know so we had him there for two

2744
01:57:49,569 --> 01:57:53,409
days it was great we hugged him when

2745
01:57:52,029 --> 01:57:56,289
they got there we hugged him when they

2746
01:57:53,409 --> 01:57:58,720
left they're just really normal people a

2747
01:57:56,289 --> 01:58:00,579
group of the same people came back in

2748
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:02,619
October for harvest because that's what

2749
01:58:00,579 --> 01:58:07,199
they were there for they were there they

2750
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:10,750
documented our harvesting the bucking

2751
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:12,760
the big leafing all of it you can see

2752
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:15,550
the report and go to my website farmer

2753
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:19,480
Tom organics calm the that you can

2754
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:21,159
download the report we did a lot of good

2755
01:58:19,479 --> 01:58:23,889
work for cannabis and I think it's a

2756
01:58:21,159 --> 01:58:25,599
good step forward so that was a

2757
01:58:23,890 --> 01:58:28,750
privilege and honor for me to stand up

2758
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:33,850
for cannabis and I hope it leads and

2759
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:36,250
takes us in the right direction well I

2760
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:39,579
just had the most tastiest rip while you

2761
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:41,590
were telling your awesome story I can't

2762
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:43,869
even believe how tasty that was I left

2763
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:45,670
it in exhale for a little bit longer I

2764
01:58:43,869 --> 01:58:46,899
forgot I was getting into listening to

2765
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:50,319
what you were saying that's great work

2766
01:58:46,899 --> 01:58:52,929
Tom given that it's really exceptional

2767
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:55,840
we need more that normalization of

2768
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:58,840
cannabis use has been a big part of well

2769
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:01,329
even has church for that matter one of

2770
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:03,279
the reasons why I always I don't smoke

2771
01:59:01,329 --> 01:59:05,769
on purpose but I smoke because I would

2772
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:07,809
be smoking anyway and just I think that

2773
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:09,580
it's been an interesting topic to be

2774
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:10,990
able to have these great conversations

2775
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:14,140
as well certain people are still

2776
01:59:10,989 --> 01:59:15,219
enjoying cannabinoids you know while

2777
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:17,770
we're talking about these things

2778
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:19,090
definitely I just kind of hopped in by a

2779
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:22,330
regular day mode you know

2780
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:24,699

2786
01:59:36,069 --> 01:59:40,059
been a mainstay here on our farm and

2787
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:41,500
when we lived down in Williams organ we

2788
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:44,260
pretty much he lived underneath this

2789
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:47,979
thing for a year well I always like when

2790

people come in on their farms I never

2791
01:59:47,979 --> 01:59:52,059
will forget Eric from when he was with

normalization in Toronto maybe we could

02:00:03,819 --> 02:00:07,359
have Sarah talk a little bit about what

2799

good day just now it's my fifth year

2821
02:01:11,319 --> 02:01:17,529
doing the event so once you get to five

2822
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:19,660
years there's challenges always new

2823
02:01:17,529 --> 02:01:21,639
challenges but you start to feel a level

2824
02:01:19,659 --> 02:01:26,680
of confidence and what you've created

2825
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:27,280
and I'm super happy to to be to be doing

2826

2827
02:01:27,279 --> 02:01:32,529
so same thing is always best of all

2828
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:35,710
competition

2829
02:01:32,529 --> 02:01:38,710
I've got all sorts of categories and

2830
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:42,760
lots of good bud and hash and other

2831
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:47,850
cannabis products coming in always my

2832
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:52,270
goal is to improve the level of

2833
02:01:47,850 --> 02:01:54,190
education and awareness of like what

2834
02:01:52,270 --> 02:01:56,980
good stuff actually is what good

2835
02:01:54,189 --> 02:02:01,210
products actually are and to try and

2836
02:01:56,979 --> 02:02:06,039
promote that amongst the community to

2837
02:02:01,210 --> 02:02:09,520
raise pallets let's say you know I'm

2838
02:02:06,039 --> 02:02:13,180

2839
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:15,160
scientist so I can't contribute on that

2840
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:18,789
level unfortunately or fortunately or

2841
02:02:15,159 --> 02:02:22,779
whatever but this is my area that I can

2842
02:02:18,789 --> 02:02:27,460
contribute on I am a critic and I've got

2843
02:02:22,779 --> 02:02:33,069
a band of 200 critics that judge with me

2844
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:35,680
every year so let me just review the

2845
02:02:33,069 --> 02:02:37,359
categories real quick and if any of the

2846
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:42,250
viewers out there interested in possibly

2847
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:44,199

2850
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:55,829
got fudge into custody the hybrid

2851
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:59,250
concentrates indica sativa hybrid

2860
02:03:26,109 --> 02:03:33,250
by July 27th no labels it's a completely

2861
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:36,099
blind competition I don't I hate the

2862
02:03:33,250 --> 02:03:40,359
hope the hype machine and allowing that

2863
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:43,300
to dominate like what should be real

2864
02:03:40,359 --> 02:03:46,408
people finding out what they like about

2865
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:49,829
product I don't want the hype machine to

2866
02:03:46,408 --> 02:03:51,869
Taman ate that though I've been to the

2867
02:03:49,829 --> 02:03:55,559
event I don't know three or four years

2868
02:03:51,869 --> 02:03:57,479
out of the five now I suppose yeah and

2869
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:59,460
you know what one of the things I like

2870
02:03:57,479 --> 02:04:01,079
about it I'm not I don't focus much on

2871
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:02,850
the competition part of it because I

2872
02:04:01,079 --> 02:04:04,289
never really have in any of the cups

2873
02:04:02,850 --> 02:04:06,300
that I've gone to you but I like the

2874
02:04:04,289 --> 02:04:08,609
group of people that you bring Toronto's

2875
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:11,520
in a very unique position in Ontario

2876
02:04:08,609 --> 02:04:15,539
it's very populated province and there's

2877
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:17,909
just tons of cities all around Toronto

2878
02:04:15,539 --> 02:04:19,829
that people come in from and quite a bit

2879
02:04:17,908 --> 02:04:23,189
of young people you know people in their

2880
02:04:19,829 --> 02:04:25,109
20s and so it's really for me it's a

2881
02:04:23,189 --> 02:04:27,539
great time to be like I see a lot of

2882
02:04:25,109 --> 02:04:31,198
super excited people and I'm kind of

2883
02:04:27,539 --> 02:04:33,448
surprised by the level of knowledge they

2884
02:04:31,198 --> 02:04:34,678
already hold it's such a young age about

2885
02:04:33,448 --> 02:04:36,359
the plant and they're just they're

2886
02:04:34,679 --> 02:04:39,300
hungry they're showing up to you know

2887
02:04:36,359 --> 02:04:40,469
not just judge cannabis but to like meet

2888
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,940
all these different people that they

2889
02:04:40,469 --> 02:04:44,969
know through social media that have

2890
02:04:41,939 --> 02:04:47,819
either inspired them or or you know what

2891
02:04:44,969 --> 02:04:50,489
not the D 420 KS and the and the Johnny

2892
02:04:47,819 --> 02:04:52,408
B's and whatnot and it's just a really

2893
02:04:50,488 --> 02:04:54,869
all-around great event in that sense I

2894
02:04:52,408 --> 02:04:56,939
just get a small booth I never have

2895
02:04:54,869 --> 02:04:58,800
business cards I don't have flyers I

2896
02:04:56,939 --> 02:05:02,219
don't even have a sign on my booth

2897
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:04,560
I have no like no promotions whatsoever

2898
02:05:02,219 --> 02:05:07,829
of my company it's just me and usually

2899
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:11,070
some friends and it's just really great

2900
02:05:07,829 --> 02:05:12,929
I do it really for the for the meeting

2901
02:05:11,069 --> 02:05:15,420
of all these incredible young people

2902
02:05:12,929 --> 02:05:18,090
that are coming out to these events and

2903
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:19,980
just it's great to see Vancouver has

2904
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:21,659
nothing like it you know we we throw a

2905
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:23,279
cup every once in a while every six

2906
02:05:21,658 --> 02:05:24,929
months to a year and they just kind of

2907
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:27,238
peter out they've never had any real

2908
02:05:24,929 --> 02:05:29,340
substance to them aside from back in the

2909
02:05:27,238 --> 02:05:32,399
day when Marc Emery was throwing the

2910
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:34,920
tokers Bowls those were incredible I

2911
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:37,408
think it's it's definitely you know some

2912
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:39,420
what I'm not a huge proponent of like a

2913
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:41,879
High Times Cannabis Cup style but I do

2914
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:43,170
love and I've always Sam and I have both

2915
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:45,929
said this about the High Times Cannabis

2916
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:47,489
Cup even from back in the day but it

2917
02:05:45,929 --> 02:05:48,960
brought people together I wouldn't have

2918
02:05:47,488 --> 02:05:50,789
met the majority of the people I've met

2919
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:55,408
in the cannabis industry had it not been

2920
02:05:50,789 --> 02:05:57,389
for those early you know 95 96 97 cups

2921
02:05:55,408 --> 02:05:59,000
in Amsterdam and it's good to see people

2922
02:05:57,389 --> 02:06:00,619
like Sarah are

2923
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,319
continuing it you know in places like

2924
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:05,090
Toronto Canada you know there's the

2925
02:06:03,319 --> 02:06:07,179
Emerald cup down in California there's

2926
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:10,940
all these certain events that are

2927
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:12,380
definitely incredible times to go and be

2928
02:06:10,939 --> 02:06:15,859
able to meet remember we don't really

2929
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:20,029
still have a place to gather you know

2930
02:06:15,859 --> 02:06:22,219
like and just legally smoking and enjoy

2931
02:06:20,029 --> 02:06:24,500
our time together it's something that is

2932
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:26,240
an it is an important form of civil

2933
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:28,369
disobedience the same way we're fighting

2934
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:29,929
for the rights to use this planet as a

2935
02:06:28,369 --> 02:06:32,510
medicine and the rights to be able to

2936
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:34,670
even purchase it whether you believe in

2937
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:38,090
recreation or not recreationally but

2938
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:39,800
also to be able to gather and join and

2939
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:41,569
enjoy cannabis and share that

2940
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,699
information that's one of the things an

2941
02:06:41,569 --> 02:06:45,710
important factor that they've broken up

2942
02:06:43,699 --> 02:06:48,679
and they don't kind of seemingly want to

2943
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:50,329
have happen vapor lounges you know would

2944
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:52,730
there not be so many more if they were

2945
02:06:50,329 --> 02:06:55,189
licensed and legal I mean there's 60 to

2946
02:06:52,729 --> 02:06:57,319
70 thousand medical users in Canada

2947
02:06:55,189 --> 02:06:59,809
Canada alone federally medical users

2948
02:06:57,319 --> 02:07:01,880
you'd think there'd be places where they

2949
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:06,620
could go and enjoy their medicine

2950
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:08,659

later and he's gonna be able to talk

2990
02:08:36,170 --> 02:08:41,449
about his annual fundraiser a few people

2991
02:08:39,288 --> 02:08:43,189
did donate money I noticed today in the

2992
02:08:41,448 --> 02:08:45,469
chat room and all that money will go to

2993
02:08:43,189 --> 02:08:48,049
the khalad Reyes Network as well any of

2994
02:08:45,469 --> 02:08:51,139
the donations that come in today and so

2995
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:52,729
yeah it's true I Kai my son got a fever

2996
02:08:51,139 --> 02:08:56,328
and ended up in the hospital overnight

2997
02:08:52,729 --> 02:08:58,039
one time and that was just so crushing -

2998
02:08:56,328 --> 02:09:00,288
my wife and I we couldn't you just as a

2999
02:08:58,038 --> 02:09:02,149
parent you just have this you're trying

3000
02:09:00,288 --> 02:09:04,219
to fight these worst-case scenario

3001
02:09:02,149 --> 02:09:06,018
thoughts that come up in your mind but

3002
02:09:04,219 --> 02:09:07,248
when things are getting that bad when

3003
02:09:06,019 --> 02:09:09,679
you're actually watching your child

3004
02:09:07,248 --> 02:09:12,529
waste away in front of you in front of

3005
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:17,179
your very eyes the way Wendy had - that

3006
02:09:12,529 --> 02:09:19,158
is just so heavy that no doubt she has a

3007
02:09:17,179 --> 02:09:21,979
huge appreciation for the keepers of the

3008
02:09:19,158 --> 02:09:24,799
plant when it's done so much for her

3009
02:09:21,979 --> 02:09:27,979
family and for her son it's it's

3010
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:30,019
incredible it is heart-wrenching love is

3011
02:09:27,979 --> 02:09:32,510
incredible it's so powerful what you

3012
02:09:30,019 --> 02:09:36,099
guys are doing and showing stuff for us

3013
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:38,479
is doing like you said every plant is is

3014
02:09:36,099 --> 02:09:40,248
every strain everything is specific to

3015
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:43,159
someone else's DNA and all that kind of

3016
02:09:40,248 --> 02:09:46,279
stuff well man this plant has been

3017
02:09:43,158 --> 02:09:49,158
suppressed for for the last what less

3018
02:09:46,279 --> 02:09:51,498
than 100 years or so or and and for the

3019
02:09:49,158 --> 02:09:53,388
time before that this was something that

3020
02:09:51,498 --> 02:09:55,609
is absolutely I get in the Egyptian

3021
02:09:53,389 --> 02:09:58,368
there is it's in the it's in the tombs

3022
02:09:55,609 --> 02:10:01,799
it's everywhere this plaque was made for

3023
02:09:58,368 --> 02:10:03,368
us it's it's a no-brainer

3024
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:07,809
[Music]

3025
02:10:03,368 --> 02:10:10,488
yeah like let me share some like

3026
02:10:07,809 --> 02:10:13,610
information about here in Brazil like

3027
02:10:10,488 --> 02:10:16,549
five years ago was so hard to find

3028
02:10:13,609 --> 02:10:19,219
information so right now like more

3029
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:21,590
information being shared because most of

3030
02:10:19,219 --> 02:10:24,739
the population doesn't speak in English

3031
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:25,789
right so we need to have a translation

3032
02:10:24,738 --> 02:10:28,819
of the

3033
02:10:25,789 --> 02:10:31,909
like really big like studies to then

3034
02:10:28,819 --> 02:10:34,880
people trying to understand like the

3035
02:10:31,909 --> 02:10:38,119
benefits of that but right now in Brazil

3036
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:42,760
they are allowing some families to plant

3037
02:10:38,119 --> 02:10:47,359
that to like start having use of CBD THC

3038
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:51,650
my experience it was with cannabis

3039
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:53,599
because I move it to Canada some years

3040
02:10:51,649 --> 02:10:57,679
ago like six years ago

3041
02:10:53,600 --> 02:11:00,050
and like one day one guy came to me and

3042
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:02,539
say oh you have Apple app see you should

3043
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:05,900
be drinking you should be drinking

3044
02:11:02,539 --> 02:11:08,359
coffee you should be using cannabis and

3045
02:11:05,899 --> 02:11:10,129
I was like really my relationship

3046
02:11:08,359 --> 02:11:12,559
because I grew up in Brazil and

3047
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:15,859
everything was like knows like no

3048
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:18,170
cannabis is not good and all my doctors

3049
02:11:15,859 --> 02:11:20,719
in Brazil really good doctors the best

3050
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:23,449
and they are like oh like all saying no

3051
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:26,360
cannabis is gonna get your Wars you

3052
02:11:23,449 --> 02:11:30,139
don't use it for almost my whole life I

3053
02:11:26,359 --> 02:11:33,109
had like this mentality bad mentality

3054
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:35,390
about cannabis and because of the last

3055
02:11:33,109 --> 02:11:38,719
years like more information being

3056
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:41,810
translated to Portuguese so everything

3057
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:44,300
is changing really fast here even like

3058
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:47,000
people like my family really

3059
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:49,400
conservative like all like friends of my

3063
02:11:55,279 --> 02:12:00,500
was and people say oh you use cannabis

3064
02:11:58,369 --> 02:12:03,019
every day you could have like some

3065
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:05,630
problems with that and say man you don't

02:12:08,239 --> 02:12:13,969
read like all the like the information

3069
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:16,730
about you gets really scary so people

3070
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:18,199
don't really like know what they are

3071
02:12:16,729 --> 02:12:20,599
talking about when they see the

3072
02:12:18,199 --> 02:12:24,649
difference between like using like those

3073
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:27,320
like really drugs that like really makes

3074
02:12:24,649 --> 02:12:30,379
me makes you like don't have any memory

3075
02:12:27,319 --> 02:12:32,989
like have problems with like cognition

3076
02:12:30,380 --> 02:12:35,539
and like they say about cannabis because

3077
02:12:32,989 --> 02:12:38,510
they don't have any experience when you

3078
02:12:35,539 --> 02:12:39,769
have experience with really patient you

3079
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:42,289
change everything

3080
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:46,220
say no like how possible this is illegal

3081
02:12:42,289 --> 02:12:48,729
this imagine really powerful and one of

3082
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:53,360
the problems here is because we have

3083
02:12:48,729 --> 02:12:55,639
like in Brazil we have those Greek weeds

3084
02:12:53,359 --> 02:13:02,630
I don't know if you guys know like comes

3085
02:12:55,640 --> 02:13:10,820
from really bad it's really bad I wanna

3086
02:13:02,630 --> 02:13:13,609
show you guys yeah yeah this is not

3087
02:13:10,819 --> 02:13:15,829
really bad in like to do medicine okay

3088
02:13:13,609 --> 02:13:18,649
and we don't know which he strains it is

3089
02:13:15,829 --> 02:13:21,069
we don't have any information about it

3090
02:13:18,649 --> 02:13:24,049
so we have like the whole population

3091
02:13:21,069 --> 02:13:27,409
using cannabis without information about

3092
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:29,600
terpenes profiles which genetics but

3093
02:13:27,409 --> 02:13:33,079
that's what we have here is really

3094
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:35,990
strict if you plant here you are like

3095
02:13:33,079 --> 02:13:37,489
really like drug dealer you can go for

3096
02:13:35,989 --> 02:13:41,029
10 15 years

3097
02:13:37,489 --> 02:13:43,969
so like the problem is like they mainly

3098
02:13:41,029 --> 02:13:46,460
deal it's like having information about

3099
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:49,610
it so we have like we are doing a really

3100
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:51,710
great work Thank You Marcos bubble man

3101

your talk to University this is really

3105
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:05,470
important for the whole Latin America to

3106
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:07,820
people understand oh that is this is not

3107
02:14:05,470 --> 02:14:11,900
cannabis this is like something totally

3108
02:14:07,819 --> 02:14:13,729
different so that's what's happening

3109
02:14:11,899 --> 02:14:16,849
Brazil right now but I think we are

3110
02:14:13,729 --> 02:14:19,189
changing Latin America is going further

3111
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:22,910

3132
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:06,469
killer killer cannabis with that

3133
02:15:03,770 --> 02:15:07,790
tropical Sun just a matter of knowing

3134
02:15:06,469 --> 02:15:09,739
the cultivars that you're growing

3135
02:15:07,789 --> 02:15:12,289
growing narrow leaf drug cultivars that

3136
02:15:09,738 --> 02:15:14,779
are going to flourish and do well in

3137
02:15:12,289 --> 02:15:17,988
that very close to the equator

3138
02:15:14,779 --> 02:15:21,019

3160
02:16:08,238 --> 02:16:15,799
Brazilian families that are struggling

3161
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:18,500
moment thanks very much I will get in

3162

touch with you guys yeah a lot of it is

3163
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:22,520
just giving people the language you know

3164
02:16:20,359 --> 02:16:25,369
we're introducing new concepts like you

3165
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:28,219
said and sometimes we can really help

3166
02:16:25,369 --> 02:16:29,689
the learning curve by arming the

3167
02:16:28,219 --> 02:16:32,750
activists in your community with the

3168
02:16:29,689 --> 02:16:34,489
language that they need helping them not

3169
02:16:32,750 --> 02:16:36,138
have to start from scratch with their

3170
02:16:34,489 --> 02:16:38,510
arguments so that when you do have

3171
02:16:36,138 --> 02:16:40,098
opportunities you're making the most out

3172
02:16:38,510 --> 02:16:42,260
of them you know and that's something

3173
02:16:40,099 --> 02:16:44,510
that we work with with all of our

3174
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:45,889
volunteers so that if we get a chance to

3175
02:16:44,510 --> 02:16:47,450
be in front of a lawmaker in front of

3176
02:16:45,888 --> 02:16:49,489
officials we don't want to waste that

3177
02:16:47,450 --> 02:16:51,500
chance right we want to have the the

3178
02:16:49,489 --> 02:16:54,349
education the background the knowledge

3179
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:56,888
make sure that we are showing them that

3180
02:16:54,349 --> 02:16:59,689
we're not just playing with cannabis

3181
02:16:56,888 --> 02:17:00,949
that we understand the concepts well we

3182
02:16:59,689 --> 02:17:03,500
understand the risks and harms how to

3183
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:04,579
mitigate them and help educate them and

3184
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:06,959
when they feel like you can be a

3185
02:17:04,579 --> 02:17:08,760
supporter and and give

3186
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:10,589
then the power that they need to speak

3187
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:13,340
eloquently about it you know you tend to

3188
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:15,120
get some some more attraction so

3189
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:20,760
absolutely anything we can do to help

3190
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:22,050
were there for you yeah and I guess one

3191
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:23,880
of the people we haven't heard too much

3192
02:17:22,049 --> 02:17:26,789
from has been Erik from peer pressure

3193
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:29,098
he's been nicely calmly listening I'm

3194
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:31,530
sure very intrigued by the conversation

3195
02:17:29,099 --> 02:17:33,540
welcome Erik hey thanks everyone yeah

3196
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:36,750
this has been really enlightening to me

3197
02:17:33,540 --> 02:17:38,250
to hear you know your stories and you

3198
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:39,540
know with your children and everything

3199
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:41,849
that's going on especially you know

3200
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:43,500
Colden hearing your experience you know

3201
02:17:41,849 --> 02:17:45,269
this is something that we hear about a

3202
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,709
lot on the news but not necessarily

3203
02:17:45,269 --> 02:17:49,319
something that I know a lot of people

3204
02:17:46,709 --> 02:17:51,449
personally in that regard

3205
02:17:49,319 --> 02:17:53,010
you know I I haven't had a ton of input

3206
02:17:51,450 --> 02:17:54,929
so far because I work with peer pressure

3207
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:56,880
and we may solve them was extraction

3208
02:17:54,929 --> 02:17:58,920
equipment but you know I'd be curious to

3209
02:17:56,879 --> 02:18:00,718
get input from some of the other people

3210
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:02,340
on the panel here and it seemed like

3211
02:18:00,718 --> 02:18:04,518
Marc touched on this a little bit

3212
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:07,170
earlier but you know where some of these

3213
02:18:04,519 --> 02:18:09,239
extraction methods fit into the equation

3214
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:11,790
to really come up with the kind of whole

3215
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:13,679
plant medicine because we work with labs

3216
02:18:11,790 --> 02:18:15,780
across the country and across the world

3217
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:18,510
that are doing all kinds of things not

3218
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:20,630
just making rosin or bubble hash but you

3219
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:23,190
know everything from hydro carbon co2

3220
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:24,569
basically everything so we're in a

3221
02:18:23,190 --> 02:18:26,489
pretty good spot where we're connected

3222
02:18:24,569 --> 02:18:28,500
and we've got our ear to the ground with

3223
02:18:26,489 --> 02:18:31,019
these extraction labs but you know I'd

3224
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:33,659
love to hear from everybody else you

3225
02:18:31,019 --> 02:18:35,639
know where you see you know extraction

3226
02:18:33,659 --> 02:18:37,649
methods fitting in to solving these

3227
02:18:35,638 --> 02:18:39,768
problems for people that are having

3228
02:18:37,649 --> 02:18:42,869
these issues and you know when you have

3229
02:18:39,769 --> 02:18:44,309
isolates that are stripped away of the

3230
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:46,050
terpenes and some of the other really

3231
02:18:44,308 --> 02:18:47,670
important cannabinoids if those aren't

3232
02:18:46,049 --> 02:18:50,968
providing the medical benefits

3233
02:18:47,670 --> 02:18:53,099
you know what future technology and what

3234
02:18:50,968 --> 02:18:55,259
methods of extraction are gonna you know

3235
02:18:53,099 --> 02:18:56,579
provide that entourage effect and really

3236
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:59,069
are gonna be helping people out

3237
02:18:56,579 --> 02:19:01,138
considerably you know we work with a lot

3238
02:18:59,069 --> 02:19:03,149
of people that you know are big into

3239
02:19:01,138 --> 02:19:05,429
taking dabs and using it for medicine

3240
02:19:03,149 --> 02:19:07,440
but it's it's hard to do at home to make

3241
02:19:05,429 --> 02:19:08,849
it well regulated you know dosed

3242
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:10,889
medicine that's really something that

3243
02:19:08,849 --> 02:19:12,840
people you know need to get from a

3244
02:19:10,888 --> 02:19:14,369
licensed extraction lab or at least from

3245
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:15,690
people that have the equipment to do it

3246
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:18,059
so you know I'd love to hear from other

3247
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:20,170
people on the panel where you see that

3248
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:22,779
going and where you see extraction you

3249
02:19:20,170 --> 02:19:25,599
solving this medicinal problem for

3250
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:28,870
people in the future I would mention

3251
02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:31,659
just to start it off to go first once

3252
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:33,460
again I think it's gonna be I think it's

3253
02:19:31,659 --> 02:19:35,110
going to be that quiver that every

3254
02:19:33,459 --> 02:19:38,438
extraction process is going to be

3255
02:19:35,110 --> 02:19:40,689
required to be present and accessible to

3256
02:19:38,439 --> 02:19:42,340
people and from there it's anyone's

3257
02:19:40,689 --> 02:19:44,920
guess is with the majority of people

3258
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:47,319
with the majority of different elements

3259
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:49,180
we'll choose as their extraction process

3260
02:19:47,319 --> 02:19:52,799
but I know that it can be profound I'll

3261
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:55,659
never forget when Sheryl Haley roses mom

3262
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:57,969
you know first use the bubble bags and

3263
02:19:55,659 --> 02:20:00,340
she just said wow like I think it was

3264
02:19:57,969 --> 02:20:02,409
almost I can't remember if it was a year

3265
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:04,299
or almost two years that Haley didn't

3266
02:20:02,409 --> 02:20:06,879
have a seizure after she started using

3267
02:20:04,299 --> 02:20:09,039
bubble hash that she would I salute and

3268
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:11,500
then I believe mix back together or mix

3269
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:13,210
some of the the cultivars back some of

3270
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:15,340
the head sizes back together and she was

3271
02:20:13,209 --> 02:20:17,379
giving her them in capsules prior to

3272
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:19,180
that she was using like an oil and some

3273
02:20:17,379 --> 02:20:20,769
flour and it was like she was still

3274
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:23,409
having a seizure here and there even

3275
02:20:20,770 --> 02:20:25,149
though it was a 90% decrease and it's

3276
02:20:23,409 --> 02:20:26,829
kind of like Forrest said if you keep

3277
02:20:25,149 --> 02:20:29,649
looking you know sometimes it's not the

3278
02:20:26,829 --> 02:20:32,469
cultivar but it's the way you extract

3279
02:20:29,649 --> 02:20:34,299
the resin from the cultivar and so in

3280
02:20:32,469 --> 02:20:36,728
that particular case now this is my

3281
02:20:34,299 --> 02:20:38,409
guess and I know if chimeras listening

3282
02:20:36,728 --> 02:20:40,750
he might disagree as he did a little bit

3283
02:20:38,409 --> 02:20:42,610
in Amsterdam but I've always felt that

3284
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:44,290
there's a particular something different

3285
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:46,420
in the profile of the bulbous heads

3286
02:20:44,290 --> 02:20:48,610
versus the capitate stalks and this and

3287
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:50,200
the sessile stalked heads the three

3288
02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:53,620
different types of trichomes too-tall

3289
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:55,900
capitate stalked the medium sessile

3290
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:57,640
stalked and the tiny little you know

3291
02:20:55,899 --> 02:21:00,129
little glandular trichomes head that

3292
02:20:57,639 --> 02:21:01,569
sing sits on a single Stipe cell on the

3293
02:21:00,129 --> 02:21:03,938
leaf it looks like it's just right on

3294
02:21:01,569 --> 02:21:06,069
the leaf it's very microscopic it's the

3295
02:21:03,939 --> 02:21:08,020
harder ones to see and generally they're

3296
02:21:06,069 --> 02:21:09,969
not the ones that are extracted off in

3297
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:11,890
the process of bubble hash you leave

3298
02:21:09,969 --> 02:21:13,719
them behind and it's one of the reasons

3299
02:21:11,889 --> 02:21:15,039
when you make an oil whether it's rosin

3300
02:21:13,719 --> 02:21:17,109
or a solvent extraction that you're

3301
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:20,530
getting a much higher percent return

3302
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:22,390
sometimes upwards of 10% higher because

3303
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:24,280
there's all of these bulbous heads that

3304
02:21:22,389 --> 02:21:27,250
you're now accessing instead of you know

3305
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:28,780
simply mechanically separating the heads

3306
02:21:27,250 --> 02:21:31,600
that are easily breaking off of those

3307
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:34,120
long stalked bodies and so for whatever

3308
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:36,880
reason of emitting those

3309
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:39,220
bulbous heads in Haley's case was very

3310
02:21:36,879 --> 02:21:41,619
profound I'm sure adding them in someone

3311
02:21:39,219 --> 02:21:44,770
else's case will be very profound and I

3312
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:47,561
think it's why no system is going to put

3313
02:21:44,771 --> 02:21:50,860
any other system out of business sort of

3314
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:53,139
speak or out of out of it out of being

3315
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:54,400
an option and that goes for everything

3316
02:21:53,139 --> 02:21:58,239
from the people that want to do gas

3317
02:21:54,399 --> 02:22:01,060
extractions to co2 to cryo ethanol to

3318
02:21:58,239 --> 02:22:03,819
rosin pressing to bubble hash making to

3319
02:22:01,060 --> 02:22:07,539
mechanical screen separation of dry

3320
02:22:03,819 --> 02:22:10,389
sifting all of these different methods

3321
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:12,130
to me are going to stay valid and it

3322
02:22:10,389 --> 02:22:13,629
kind of gives you hope in this whole

3323
02:22:12,129 --> 02:22:16,869
cannabis industry of it not just

3324
02:22:13,629 --> 02:22:19,270
becoming this bland sort of Pharma model

3325
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:21,790
of having single molecules available but

3326
02:22:19,271 --> 02:22:23,739
that you know the idea of craft farmers

3327
02:22:21,790 --> 02:22:25,510
well that's really all of these

3328
02:22:23,739 --> 02:22:27,369
different extraction processes all of

3329
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:30,190
these different cultivars and it goes to

3330
02:22:27,370 --> 02:22:32,561
show you the value of every cultivar

3331
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:34,120
that it's not just gonna be one cultivar

3332
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:35,289
that's going to be the answer for every

3333
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:38,260
one but there's probably going to be

3334
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:39,880
maybe a thousand plus cultivars that the

3335
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:41,500
world the billions of people in the

3336
02:22:39,879 --> 02:22:43,239
world are going to want to have access

3337
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:43,569
to maybe tens of thousands for that

3338
02:22:43,239 --> 02:22:47,680
matter

3339
02:22:43,569 --> 02:22:50,529
I really think solving lists is going to

3340
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:52,450
be the way to go I've always chose the

3341
02:22:50,530 --> 02:22:55,239
high road we were the first ones to do

3342
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:57,280
strain-specific Doug runs for all of our

3343
02:22:55,239 --> 02:22:59,079
products back in the medical days about

3344
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:02,530
four years ago our here in Washington

3345
02:22:59,079 --> 02:23:05,590
and with the production being so high

3346
02:23:02,530 --> 02:23:07,870
there's no reason why we can't produce

3347
02:23:05,590 --> 02:23:10,090
the highest quality and go and I really

3348
02:23:07,870 --> 02:23:12,490
believe that the solvent list it you

3349
02:23:10,090 --> 02:23:15,579
know keeps the terpene profiles and

3350
02:23:12,489 --> 02:23:18,340
really does the job it's a it's a great

3351
02:23:15,579 --> 02:23:19,659
product and that's what we that's what

3352
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:21,760
we use here on the farm

3353
02:23:19,659 --> 02:23:23,530
I mean basically on our farm are our

3354
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:26,950
little medical farm that we have up here

3355
02:23:23,530 --> 02:23:29,290
right now we what we don't smoke and

3356
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:33,130
joints that year the following year we

3357
02:23:29,290 --> 02:23:35,980
make extra bubble hash with and we love

3358
02:23:33,129 --> 02:23:38,229
that process it oxidase it's a little

3359
02:23:35,979 --> 02:23:40,810
bit over that that period of time but

3360
02:23:38,229 --> 02:23:43,000
then it gives the more CBN effect and

3361
02:23:40,810 --> 02:23:44,560
Weezer for sleeping and it's I think

3362
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,280
solvent list is definitely the way to go

3363
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:51,310
and in my humble opinion

3364
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:54,340
I know I know that's our goal is to get

3365
02:23:51,310 --> 02:23:56,229
to solving this extraction we just have

3366
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:59,351
to kind of balance what we have access

3367
02:23:56,229 --> 02:24:02,140
to in time and volunteers and

3368
02:23:59,351 --> 02:24:06,210
ease-of-use but you know we would be

3369
02:24:02,140 --> 02:24:08,949
happy to test out any of those solvent

3370
02:24:06,209 --> 02:24:11,829
lists extraction methods in the machines

3371
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:14,021
and report back to anybody but you know

3372
02:24:11,829 --> 02:24:17,739
it's I agree a hundred percent you know

3373
02:24:14,021 --> 02:24:21,311
we're advocacy team seems to continue to

3374
02:24:17,739 --> 02:24:24,879
show better percentages of benefit tends

3375
02:24:21,310 --> 02:24:27,851
to be and how well you can maintain the

3376
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:31,239
integrity of what the plant is producing

3377
02:24:27,851 --> 02:24:33,819
and the better we can do that I think

3378
02:24:31,239 --> 02:24:36,851
the better options we'll have as far as

3379
02:24:33,819 --> 02:24:38,500
is potential success with folks because

3380
02:24:36,851 --> 02:24:40,590
I think even the I with cold ethanol

3381
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:43,511
you're washing out water-soluble

3382
02:24:40,590 --> 02:24:45,399
processes with other extraction methods

3383
02:24:43,511 --> 02:24:47,771
so you know you have huge loss of

3384
02:24:45,399 --> 02:24:51,909
terpenes and and other compounds in the

3385
02:24:47,771 --> 02:24:54,431
plant so I'm I couldn't agree with that

3386
02:24:51,909 --> 02:24:56,920
more and I look forward to a time where

3387
02:24:54,431 --> 02:25:00,011
that's that's a little where we can get

3388
02:24:56,920 --> 02:25:03,370
its an organization but again we you

3389
02:25:00,011 --> 02:25:05,050
know we kind of started the car driving

3390
02:25:03,370 --> 02:25:07,931
the car before it was finished being

3391
02:25:05,049 --> 02:25:09,100
built just out of necessity so we kind

3392
02:25:07,931 --> 02:25:10,601
of work with what we have and I think

3393
02:25:09,101 --> 02:25:14,530
it's one of the things we try to teach

3394
02:25:10,601 --> 02:25:17,471
folks is that yeah there is ideal but

3395
02:25:14,530 --> 02:25:19,511
you know there's a lot of benefit that

3396
02:25:17,470 --> 02:25:21,220
you can do at home that it's under ideal

3397
02:25:19,511 --> 02:25:25,030
you know there might not be the ideal

3398
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:26,680
processes but you know there are you

3399
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:28,271
know distillers that you can have on

3400
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:30,940
your countertop that look like mr.

3401
02:25:28,271 --> 02:25:34,360
coffee machines that some are garbage

3402
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:37,360
and some are decent and as long as you

3403
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:41,079
have access to good testing analytical

3404
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:43,569
labs and you can you can start making

3405
02:25:41,079 --> 02:25:45,549
some progress on your own and you know

3406
02:25:43,569 --> 02:25:49,029
that's what is beautiful about cannabis

3407
02:25:45,549 --> 02:25:50,709
is that it is despite everyone's best

3408
02:25:49,030 --> 02:25:54,730
effort whether it be pharmaceutical

3409
02:25:50,709 --> 02:25:57,369
companies or or other folks you know it

3410
02:25:54,729 --> 02:26:00,761
doesn't allow itself to be restrained in

3411
02:25:57,370 --> 02:26:01,900
inhale down and contain it it is for the

3412
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:03,790
people it is

3413
02:26:01,899 --> 02:26:07,390
here for us to integrate into our

3414
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:10,841
communities it is relatively easy to

3415
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:13,390
grow and produce and utilize on your own

3416
02:26:10,841 --> 02:26:15,220
and I think that is people get better

3417
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:17,440
understanding that and more comfortable

3418
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:20,140
familiarity they're gonna find that they

3419
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:22,301
have a lot of control over their health

3420
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:23,829
and in options you know especially as we

3421
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:27,609
get the laws to come into place to

3422
02:26:23,829 --> 02:26:29,200
mitigate the risk involved yeah I'll add

3423
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:31,780
something to that which is we're seeing

3424
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:34,240
a big trend on our end and you know some

3425
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:35,381
of the savvy er cannabis consumers that

3426
02:26:34,239 --> 02:26:37,271
have been you know growing their own

3427
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:38,800
it's really mainly the home growers you

3428
02:26:37,271 --> 02:26:41,021
know they identify the strains that they

3429
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:42,789
really enjoy either for you know

3430
02:26:41,021 --> 02:26:44,440
palliative medicinal or purely

3431
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:47,381
recreational use but I think going

3432
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:50,170
forward as home growing and the stigma

3433
02:26:47,380 --> 02:26:51,550
of cannabis tends to slowly get washed

3434
02:26:50,170 --> 02:26:53,290
away you know I think people are really

3435
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:55,600
going to be detailing their own

3436
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:58,480
treatments for themselves at home you

3437
02:26:55,601 --> 02:27:01,000
know finding that ac/dc strain if that's

3438
02:26:58,479 --> 02:27:02,619
what works for you at home you know not

3439
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,780
only growing it yourself but processing

3440
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:07,181
it at home yourself you know using

3441
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:08,860
either rosin bubble hash you know those

3442
02:27:07,181 --> 02:27:10,631
are really the main ways that people are

3443
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:13,601
able to do it safely at home without

3444
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:15,550
going the route of open blasting but as

3445
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:17,650
home growing really picks up and as this

3446
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:20,380
becomes more acceptable you know we're

3447
02:27:17,649 --> 02:27:22,659
really excited to see people tailoring

3448
02:27:20,380 --> 02:27:26,199
the strains that they find that they're

3449
02:27:22,659 --> 02:27:27,851
getting the most out of you know doing

3450
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:31,091
it at home and and repeating that

3451
02:27:27,851 --> 02:27:32,381
process as opposed to you know it seems

3452
02:27:31,091 --> 02:27:34,390
like can Colton in your case you guys

3453
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:36,609
had to move to Colorado and back I mean

3454
02:27:34,390 --> 02:27:39,310
I think over time we're gonna see people

3455
02:27:36,610 --> 02:27:41,739
really refining their own self

3456
02:27:39,310 --> 02:27:44,170
medicating practices for what they need

3457
02:27:41,739 --> 02:27:48,670
and what they want and doing it safely

3458
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:51,579
and easily well I couldn't agree more

3459
02:27:48,670 --> 02:27:53,739
for sure I we totally believe here on

3460
02:27:51,579 --> 02:27:55,479
the farm and have for years that the

3461
02:27:53,739 --> 02:27:58,390
plants are a healing plant and and

3462
02:27:55,479 --> 02:28:00,699
instinctively they know how to heal you

3463
02:27:58,390 --> 02:28:02,709
so that's why every grower says they

3464
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:06,700
grow the best weed because they do grow

3465
02:28:02,709 --> 02:28:08,890
the best weed for them so we've been we

3466
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:10,750
and back in the day when we had patients

3467
02:28:08,890 --> 02:28:12,459
we used to bring in an article of their

3468
02:28:10,750 --> 02:28:14,319
clothes or a picture or something that

3469
02:28:12,459 --> 02:28:14,609
had their energy and it in put it in the

3470
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:16,470
guard

3471
02:28:14,610 --> 02:28:19,860
and they seem to think over the years

3472
02:28:16,470 --> 02:28:22,680
that I really was designed for them and

3473
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:24,301
you know really healed them so I'm all

3474
02:28:22,681 --> 02:28:26,880
about the homegirl we really need to

3475
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:29,819
keep the homegirl going there's no

3476
02:28:26,879 --> 02:28:31,770
reason why the multi-millionaire

3477
02:28:29,819 --> 02:28:33,899
corporations down the streets can grow

3478
02:28:31,771 --> 02:28:35,909
hundreds of thousands of plants but

3479
02:28:33,899 --> 02:28:38,279
mom-and-pop can't grow a couple just

3480
02:28:35,909 --> 02:28:41,011
like they do their tomatoes peppers and

3481
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:42,900
onions so that's how we feel on our form

3482
02:28:41,011 --> 02:28:45,030
I think it's a personal thing and I

3483
02:28:42,899 --> 02:28:46,619
think is moves across the country we got

3484
02:28:45,030 --> 02:28:49,400
to insist that home grows a part of it

3485
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:51,780
yeah and there's such a deep variety of

3486
02:28:49,399 --> 02:28:53,279
cannabis strains and and I think that

3487
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:56,190
you and and many other people on this

3488
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:59,431
panel could speak much more to that then

3489
02:28:56,190 --> 02:29:01,920
you know I could but you know if I smoke

3490
02:28:59,431 --> 02:29:04,140
traditional chocolate I'm not feeling

3491
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:06,690
too good and there's people where that

3492
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:09,989
that really is is what they want so you

3493
02:29:06,690 --> 02:29:11,551
know I'm I'm very excited to see people

3494
02:29:09,989 --> 02:29:13,379
being able to dial this in for

3495
02:29:11,550 --> 02:29:14,640
themselves and grow their own because

3496
02:29:13,379 --> 02:29:16,050
it's not a one-size-fits-all solution

3497
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:18,181
you know we've been pretty much talking

3498
02:29:16,050 --> 02:29:21,000
about that the entire time whether what

3499
02:29:18,181 --> 02:29:22,980
part of the trichome this is coming from

3500
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,591
that you're getting the effects you know

3501
02:29:22,979 --> 02:29:26,939
but you know there's a lot more that

3502
02:29:25,591 --> 02:29:29,550
needs to be done there that goes without

3503
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:31,771
saying but you know hopefully more

3504
02:29:29,550 --> 02:29:33,300
people start growing at home or talking

3505
02:29:31,771 --> 02:29:34,891
with their friends you know there

3506
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:36,779
there's a lot to be done there so

3507
02:29:34,890 --> 02:29:38,850
hopefully that keeps building a lot of

3508
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:40,170
momentum because it is I mean it's

3509
02:29:38,851 --> 02:29:42,841
called weed for a reason it you know

3510
02:29:40,170 --> 02:29:45,479
it's not that hard to grow even if it's

3511
02:29:42,841 --> 02:29:47,040
not the indoor top-shelf mega stuff you

3512
02:29:45,479 --> 02:29:48,449
can still do a really good job at home

3513
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:50,790
and come up with a product that has

3514
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:52,740
benefits for yourself yeah my wife's

3515
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:56,341
totally strange specific she's been

3516
02:29:52,739 --> 02:29:57,869
using the Haze's an NDE haze for years

3517
02:29:56,341 --> 02:30:01,710
and years and years and that's all she

3518
02:29:57,870 --> 02:30:03,900
ever consumes and I think you know the

3519
02:30:01,709 --> 02:30:06,000
home girl also gives the the patient

3520
02:30:03,899 --> 02:30:08,609
because we're all patients the the

3521
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,140
ability to find their strain and then if

3522
02:30:08,610 --> 02:30:14,400
they're able to grow it themselves get

3523
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:16,289
the maximum benefit from it yeah you

3524
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:19,890
know I think that this is why so we're

3525
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:21,990
doing work in California with SB 829 to

3526
02:30:19,890 --> 02:30:25,489
really protect in for the first time in

3527
02:30:21,989 --> 02:30:29,239
the country established

3528
02:30:25,489 --> 02:30:31,369
compassion programs and really look at

3529
02:30:29,239 --> 02:30:35,720
that as the need to establish and

3530
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:37,101
protect the community resources that

3531
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:38,390
have developed in California that might

3532
02:30:37,101 --> 02:30:40,909
be unique to California I don't know

3533
02:30:38,390 --> 02:30:42,619
others can speak Colorado and Washington

3534
02:30:40,909 --> 02:30:44,869
we get a lot of calls for help for

3535
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:48,340
families there but in California we had

3536
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:50,990
20 years of the ability to just kind of

3537
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:52,521
work to integrate cannabis in our

3538
02:30:50,989 --> 02:30:56,299
communities and we developed a lot of

3539
02:30:52,521 --> 02:30:58,820
networks of just small local small-time

3540
02:30:56,299 --> 02:31:00,949
farmers they develop little patient

3541
02:30:58,819 --> 02:31:03,649
networks and they have time to really

3542
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:06,200
get to know and work with the people in

3543
02:31:03,649 --> 02:31:08,479
their communities and that is something

3544
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:11,030
that I think needs to be protected and I

3545
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:12,920
don't see it as a threat to industry

3546
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:15,290
either I mean I think that there is a

3547
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:17,920
place for everything and there are

3548
02:31:15,290 --> 02:31:20,450
people who need the over-the-counter

3549
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:22,069
sort of products that are provided and

3550
02:31:20,450 --> 02:31:24,590
there are always people who need more

3551
02:31:22,069 --> 02:31:26,810
specialized medicine and I think that

3552
02:31:24,590 --> 02:31:29,420
for me that's why protecting our small

3553
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:32,079
farmers is so important because they

3554
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:35,479
play an integral role in that sort of

3555
02:31:32,079 --> 02:31:37,510
communal networking that cannabis has an

3556
02:31:35,479 --> 02:31:40,520
opportunity to provide on a local level

3557
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:43,760
in you know its thumb when someone

3558
02:31:40,521 --> 02:31:46,641
fights so SB 829 here in California is a

3559
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:48,290
bill that will recognize compassion

3560
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:50,479
programs it sets up some of the

3561
02:31:48,290 --> 02:31:52,610
standards for that it is looking at

3562
02:31:50,479 --> 02:31:55,310
developing a new compassion license type

3563
02:31:52,610 --> 02:31:57,620
in California whether that'll be a type

3564
02:31:55,310 --> 02:31:59,060
13 license for you Californians you know

3565
02:31:57,620 --> 02:32:01,460
what that means or it'll be under the

3566
02:31:59,060 --> 02:32:03,799
medical guys we're not sure yet but

3567
02:32:01,459 --> 02:32:06,350
it'll be a compassion license and it

3568
02:32:03,799 --> 02:32:08,779
also takes the steps to start the proper

3569
02:32:06,351 --> 02:32:12,110
tax exemptions for charitable donation

3570
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:14,300
so it deals with the cultivation tax is

3571
02:32:12,110 --> 02:32:16,610
an excise taxes of making those all

3572
02:32:14,299 --> 02:32:19,789
exempt from any of those taxes in those

3573
02:32:16,610 --> 02:32:22,521
programs and because of that we're able

3574
02:32:19,790 --> 02:32:24,530
to really maintain some of these

3575
02:32:22,521 --> 02:32:27,739
programs that have been developed over

3576
02:32:24,530 --> 02:32:32,329
the years and really make sure that we

3577
02:32:27,739 --> 02:32:34,159
can have the benefit of our small time

3578
02:32:32,329 --> 02:32:36,500
farmer in local networks that in

3579
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:37,879
California are a big risk I mean it's a

3580
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:40,520
big topic now I've lost four

3581
02:32:37,879 --> 02:32:43,519
small farmers and being able to maintain

3582
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:45,200
that community is is really important to

3583
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:48,290
us and I think it directly relates with

3584
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:57,260
the ability to develop own and provide

3585
02:32:48,290 --> 02:33:08,660
specialized medicine and Silas is a cool

3586
02:32:57,260 --> 02:33:12,680
shirt thanks guys yeah so we definitely

3587
02:33:08,659 --> 02:33:14,510
gotta fight for this those of you who

3588
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:17,540
are in California please familiarize

3589
02:33:14,510 --> 02:33:25,850
yourself with SB 829 it's gonna need

3590
02:33:17,540 --> 02:33:27,590
your support we have you know it deals

3591
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:28,460
with taxes so we need a two-thirds vote

3592
02:33:27,590 --> 02:33:29,540
in the Senate

3593
02:33:28,459 --> 02:33:31,039
we've had to get through a bunch of

3594
02:33:29,540 --> 02:33:32,990
appropriations and other committees that

3595
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:34,790
have been difficult and we're getting

3596
02:33:32,989 --> 02:33:37,039
threats from the governor's office to

3597
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:38,870
potentially be toe the bill because just

3598
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:41,180
because it has exemption it's not

3599
02:33:38,870 --> 02:33:42,620
necessarily the context of what's

3600
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:43,819
important so we're working on those

3601
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:45,800
things but we're gonna need all the

3602
02:33:43,819 --> 02:33:47,989
support we can get so if you're in

3603
02:33:45,799 --> 02:33:50,539
California please familiarize yourself

3604
02:33:47,989 --> 02:33:53,869
with SB 829 at a senator weiners office

3605
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:57,080
and show us some support because it

3606
02:33:53,870 --> 02:33:59,420
really will be groundbreaking as far as

3607
02:33:57,079 --> 02:34:03,139
what it will give us the ability to do

3608
02:33:59,420 --> 02:34:04,819
to integrate charitable programs as it

3609
02:34:03,139 --> 02:34:05,949
pertains to cannabis and how we will

3610
02:34:04,819 --> 02:34:09,020
interact with the cannabis industry

3611
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:11,890
really my goal has always been if we can

3612
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:14,810
make the cannabis industry the hero and

3613
02:34:11,889 --> 02:34:17,239
help the people who aren't able to be

3614
02:34:14,809 --> 02:34:19,159
served any way it's not that we're

3615
02:34:17,239 --> 02:34:21,889
taking away clients a lot of these

3616
02:34:19,159 --> 02:34:24,680
people are either bedridden indigent who

3617
02:34:21,889 --> 02:34:26,629
don't have the funds to do it or using

3618
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:28,430
medicines like we talked about that are

3619
02:34:26,629 --> 02:34:29,389
very unique to that one person so

3620
02:34:28,430 --> 02:34:31,130
there's not a whole product line

3621
02:34:29,389 --> 02:34:33,648
developed these people just aren't able

3622
02:34:31,129 --> 02:34:35,539
to get services if we can make the

3623
02:34:33,648 --> 02:34:38,750
cannabis industry a hero for those

3624
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:40,820
communities I think everybody wins and I

3625
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:42,379
believe that it can be done and make

3626
02:34:40,819 --> 02:34:45,590
everybody more profitable and successful

3627
02:34:42,379 --> 02:34:47,478
in the long run if we take the gift that

3628
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:50,140
comes along with working with cannabis

3629
02:34:47,478 --> 02:34:53,120
and make sure we spread it out

3630
02:34:50,140 --> 02:34:54,800
into those areas of our community that

3631
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:57,920
need it you know one of the things they

3632
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:59,331
say is we get a lot as well how come you

3633
02:34:57,921 --> 02:35:01,581
know the cannabis industry just can't

3634
02:34:59,331 --> 02:35:03,290
take care of any pain right rare

3635
02:35:01,581 --> 02:35:05,661
patients rare seizure disorders rare

3636
02:35:03,290 --> 02:35:07,670
rare disease you know and it's it's

3637
02:35:05,661 --> 02:35:09,110
really to me it's kind of a silly

3638
02:35:07,671 --> 02:35:11,621
question but you know we just got to

3639
02:35:09,110 --> 02:35:15,051
look at it as you know how come

3640
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:17,000
McDonald's or you know the supermarket

3641
02:35:15,050 --> 02:35:19,251
chains aren't feeding all the homeless

3642
02:35:17,001 --> 02:35:21,591
and feed over hungry right you know some

3643
02:35:19,251 --> 02:35:23,630
of them have food programs and some of

3644
02:35:21,591 --> 02:35:25,550
them try to integrate social good but

3645
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:27,950
there's always a need at the local level

3646
02:35:25,550 --> 02:35:30,710
for meals on wheels right or other

3647
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:33,020
programs who go right into the homes of

3648
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:36,411
the people who are missed and cut out of

3649
02:35:33,021 --> 02:35:39,081
the system due to the serious needs that

3650
02:35:36,411 --> 02:35:41,031
they have and you know we can Institute

3651
02:35:39,081 --> 02:35:44,081
that into our cannabis industry and if

3652
02:35:41,031 --> 02:35:46,400
we do so you know I strongly feel that

3653
02:35:44,081 --> 02:35:49,190
everybody's going to benefit from that

3654
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:51,890
so SB 829 is really laying the

3655
02:35:49,190 --> 02:35:55,431
groundwork to establish the proper tax

3656
02:35:51,890 --> 02:35:57,979
exemptions the proper recognition of

3657
02:35:55,431 --> 02:36:00,890
charities and the ability to integrate

3658
02:35:57,979 --> 02:36:02,810
it into our industry so that there is no

3659
02:36:00,890 --> 02:36:04,581
waste there is no leftovers there's no

3660
02:36:02,810 --> 02:36:07,101
need for destruction everything is

3661
02:36:04,581 --> 02:36:11,531
funneled into charitable organizations

3662
02:36:07,101 --> 02:36:11,531
and everybody wins

3663
02:36:14,818 --> 02:36:22,318
I'm muted oopsie I guess we didn't get

3664
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:25,170
to say goodbye to Wendy and Colton they

3665
02:36:22,318 --> 02:36:29,100
were getting ready for the I believe she

3666
02:36:25,170 --> 02:36:30,809
said it was the County Fair yes dance

3667
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:32,850
competition so I guess her daughter's

3668
02:36:30,809 --> 02:36:36,180
big dancer will wish her luck at her

3669
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:38,939
competition and yeah what a great

3670
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:41,040
conversation today it started as just

3671
02:36:38,939 --> 02:36:42,270
that one of the topics we were gonna

3672
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:44,010
have but it kind of held the

3673
02:36:42,270 --> 02:36:47,790
conversation all day it's a it's a big

3674
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:51,420

3703

Francisco so we're gonna give the

3706
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:03,840
families down there we're gonna try to

raffle some things off raise some money

3708
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:08,430
the old fashioned way and just do some

3709
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:11,790
good you know in the foundation of our

3710
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:14,000
ability to to save lives in our

3711
02:38:11,790 --> 02:38:18,149
communities is the cannabis community

3712
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:20,639
the industry the consumers the culture

3713
02:38:18,148 --> 02:38:22,619
of the community as we've stood on their

3714
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:24,659
shoulders and then I get a lot of Pat's

3715
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:26,819
on the back saying hey Forrest good job

3716
02:38:24,659 --> 02:38:28,619
at all you know I'm just facilitating

3717
02:38:26,818 --> 02:38:30,299
its it's the community

3718
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:32,730
that does is doing this and they deserve

3719
02:38:30,299 --> 02:38:34,319
all the credit so anybody in the area

3720
02:38:32,729 --> 02:38:35,879
come out and say hi then we'll be

3721
02:38:34,319 --> 02:38:38,369
announcing on our Instagram and things

3722
02:38:35,879 --> 02:38:39,179
like that here pretty soon but thank you

3723
02:38:38,370 --> 02:38:42,360
guys

3724
02:38:39,180 --> 02:38:45,601
are you doing a silent auction yeah

3725
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:47,851
we're looking for items so you know with

3726
02:38:45,601 --> 02:38:49,829
raffle tickets and items it's um you

3727
02:38:47,851 --> 02:38:51,569
know we just need money that can bring

3728
02:38:49,829 --> 02:38:54,149
in dollars so the people can can donate

3729
02:38:51,569 --> 02:38:55,619
so if you own a business anybody owns a

3730
02:38:54,149 --> 02:38:58,049
business or has things they want to

3731
02:38:55,620 --> 02:39:00,030
donate you know other [ __ ] nonprofits

3732
02:38:58,049 --> 02:39:01,859
they have the ability to get tax

3733
02:39:00,030 --> 02:39:03,960
exemptions right we deal with cannabis

3734
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:05,670
we're not allowed to offer the tax

3735
02:39:03,959 --> 02:39:08,039
exemption so we have all you know I

3736
02:39:05,670 --> 02:39:09,899
often say it's like all the altruism all

3737
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:12,240
the hearts and none of the benefits you

3738
02:39:09,899 --> 02:39:14,520
know so it's very difficult we can't get

3739
02:39:12,239 --> 02:39:17,399
cars donated because they're not able to

3740
02:39:14,521 --> 02:39:19,890
write them off so we really lean even

3741
02:39:17,399 --> 02:39:22,109
more heavily on just someone saying hey

3742
02:39:19,889 --> 02:39:23,909
I'm not gonna give it right off for this

3743
02:39:22,110 --> 02:39:25,920
but you know this is a cause that we

3744
02:39:23,909 --> 02:39:27,659
need to support and you know those days

3745
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:29,549
are coming well we'll be able to acts

3746
02:39:27,659 --> 02:39:31,649
like a charity in a non-profit but for

3747
02:39:29,549 --> 02:39:34,319
now we got a scrimp and scrap and fight

3748
02:39:31,649 --> 02:39:36,359
for every nickel that we have so we can

3749
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:39,090
open the door to more families so well

3750
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:40,290
I'll donate some products to be raffled

3751
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:42,389
off and I'm sure I could hit up my

3752
02:39:40,290 --> 02:39:44,760
social media people are offering me [ __ ]

3753
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:47,639
all the time to shout out their

3754
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:49,500
companies and whatnot on my account and

3755
02:39:47,639 --> 02:39:51,359
it's like I'll just I'll put I'll put it

3756
02:39:49,500 --> 02:39:54,209
all on them that maybe they should make

3757
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:56,130
a donation to you know not necessarily a

3758
02:39:54,209 --> 02:39:59,219
shout out but to just something that's

3759
02:39:56,129 --> 02:40:01,560
actually really good yeah that would be

3760
02:39:59,219 --> 02:40:03,869
great I'll shout out I'll shout out

3761
02:40:01,560 --> 02:40:06,090
anyone who needs one of course I don't

3762
02:40:03,870 --> 02:40:07,950
have the audience you to but you know if

3763
02:40:06,090 --> 02:40:11,521
you're doing good work you deserve to be

3764
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:14,940
told that you're doing good work so yeah

3765
02:40:11,521 --> 02:40:16,409
every every cent goes back into the

3766
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:18,870
project because again we're all

3767
02:40:16,409 --> 02:40:21,510
volunteers it's not like it's my salary

3768
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:23,250
that gets the cut first this is a

3769
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:25,340
volunteer organization so you know that

3770
02:40:23,250 --> 02:40:27,450
it's going where it needs to go so

3771
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:30,120
appreciated man thanks and that any

3772
02:40:27,450 --> 02:40:33,650
plugs would be great well Lois Lane just

3773
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:37,890
kicked down 50 large hold the camera

3774
02:40:33,649 --> 02:40:41,921
yeah I'm not sure if that's sterling or

3775
02:40:37,889 --> 02:40:48,640
if that's euro

3776
02:40:41,921 --> 02:40:49,501
I think its hero pretty cool uh yeah I

3777
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:52,540
guess

3778
02:40:49,501 --> 02:40:54,220
maybe another 20 minutes rockin on this

3779
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:56,560
hash Church we could go till noon

3780
02:40:54,220 --> 02:40:59,921
possibly if there's anything in any

3781
02:40:56,560 --> 02:41:02,290
particular specific things you guys want

3782
02:40:59,921 --> 02:41:04,001
to hit and talk about I've been super

3783
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:05,670
stoked on the vapor tail today I haven't

3784
02:41:04,001 --> 02:41:08,261
pulled it out in a while in honor of

3785
02:41:05,671 --> 02:41:10,511
Sabo coming in which he had to splint

3786
02:41:08,261 --> 02:41:12,881
and never made it back but I can't

3787
02:41:10,511 --> 02:41:15,190
believe the profile and the taste on how

3788
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:18,130
good it is with this unit it is totally

3789
02:41:15,190 --> 02:41:19,721
it's convection conduction basically the

3790
02:41:18,130 --> 02:41:21,820
difference between putting something

3791
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:24,130
right on a pan that's very hot and

3792
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:27,190
vaporizing your material versus putting

3793
02:41:24,130 --> 02:41:29,530
your material into a quartz rod which

3794
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:31,751
then goes into a glass tube which has

3795
02:41:29,531 --> 02:41:33,521
been heated from the outside so it's

3796
02:41:31,751 --> 02:41:36,220
kind of like the glass tube heats up the

3797
02:41:33,521 --> 02:41:38,591
air inside which then heats up the

3798
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:40,841
quartz and there's a preservation that's

3799
02:41:38,591 --> 02:41:42,490
going on I'm wondering the importance I

3800
02:41:40,841 --> 02:41:46,650
know I'm coming at this just from a

3801
02:41:42,490 --> 02:41:49,421
strictly you know personal enjoyment

3802
02:41:46,650 --> 02:41:51,161
place not necessarily oh it you know

3803
02:41:49,421 --> 02:41:53,320
makes my back pain stop hurting or

3804
02:41:51,161 --> 02:41:54,820
whatnot but just the pure enjoyment of

3805
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:56,921
the flavor and I'm wondering how much

3806
02:41:54,820 --> 02:42:01,591
that will also play a part in the future

3807
02:41:56,921 --> 02:42:04,541
of developing methods of you know

3808
02:42:01,591 --> 02:42:07,810
receiving these cannabinoids through

3809
02:42:04,540 --> 02:42:10,750
specific materials that retain heat

3810
02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:12,940
differently and therefore preserve the

3811
02:42:10,751 --> 02:42:14,800
profile of the terpenes differently

3812
02:42:12,940 --> 02:42:17,171
because you just get a more accurate in

3813
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:23,171
my opinion it's my opinion obviously you

3814
02:42:17,171 --> 02:42:25,961
get a more exact I don't even know how

3815
02:42:23,171 --> 02:42:27,911
to say it the flavor profile is just so

3816
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:30,070
much more on point when it's preserved

3817
02:42:27,911 --> 02:42:32,620
there's just this more enjoyment that's

3818
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:34,570
had from it compared to blowing

3819
02:42:32,620 --> 02:42:36,189
something up and you know the in in my

3820
02:42:34,570 --> 02:42:38,229
opinion one of the worst experience is

3821
02:42:36,190 --> 02:42:41,081
taking a really hot dab like at eight or

3822
02:42:38,229 --> 02:42:43,210
nine hundred plus degrees just blasting

3823
02:42:41,081 --> 02:42:45,341
it off of the quartz of the titanium and

3824
02:42:43,210 --> 02:42:47,050
it's just just burning someone's throat

3825
02:42:45,341 --> 02:42:49,240
it's really like the worst way to turn

3826
02:42:47,050 --> 02:42:51,430
someone on to cannabinoids in my opinion

3827
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:54,251
giving them that kind of hot tab and

3828
02:42:51,431 --> 02:42:55,750
looking for that negative association

3829
02:42:54,251 --> 02:42:57,790
with taking a DAB versus

3830
02:42:55,750 --> 02:42:59,979
offering someone the tastiest most

3831
02:42:57,790 --> 02:43:02,950
preserved AB at the proper temperature

3832
02:42:59,979 --> 02:43:04,270
in an in a normal amount that to me is

3833
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:06,460
an important part of cannabis

3834
02:43:04,270 --> 02:43:09,220
normalization not killing the people

3835
02:43:06,459 --> 02:43:11,979
that you're trying to turn on yeah I I

3836
02:43:09,219 --> 02:43:13,719
have a vape exhale from way back in the

3837
02:43:11,979 --> 02:43:14,709
day it's funny because I saw Sabo coming

3838
02:43:13,719 --> 02:43:16,869
on and said you know I haven't talked to

3839
02:43:14,709 --> 02:43:18,519
this guy in three years but we had one

3840
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:20,440
of their original models when I was

3841
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:22,360
working at massroots a long time ago and

3842
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:24,370
it ended up in my hands after things

3843
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:26,470
kind of went belly-up and you know I do

3844
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:27,850
not work for a vapor tail I have no

3845
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:29,319
affiliation with them I don't get

3846
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:31,870
anything for saying this but you know

3847
02:43:29,319 --> 02:43:32,949
that it is a great product when I dab at

3848
02:43:31,870 --> 02:43:35,200
home that's definitely the one that I

3849
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:36,730
use and I would agree with bubbleman

3850
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:38,650
that you know there's a lot of ways to

3851
02:43:36,729 --> 02:43:40,119
skin a cat on this and a hot dab will

3852
02:43:38,649 --> 02:43:42,850
make somebody never take it to have

3853
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:44,560
again in their life potentially but I'm

3854
02:43:42,850 --> 02:43:46,360
a fan of the vape exhale as well they're

3855
02:43:44,559 --> 02:43:50,109
pretty spendy but you know if you're

3856
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:54,700
dabbing semi-regularly they're they're

3857
02:43:50,110 --> 02:43:56,730
super nice yep I'm packing mine right

3858
02:43:54,700 --> 02:43:56,730
now

3859
02:44:00,569 --> 02:44:10,629
yes dee 420k I agree a bong ripp is an

3860
02:44:05,979 --> 02:44:12,969
order you know I got a chance to try you

3861
02:44:10,629 --> 02:44:15,459
know some of the live rosin extracts and

3862
02:44:12,969 --> 02:44:18,189
that bubbleman and whatever I remembered

3863
02:44:15,459 --> 02:44:20,169
it was called Marcus the the vape pen

3864
02:44:18,190 --> 02:44:26,440
that I think you and Toni worked on

3865
02:44:20,170 --> 02:44:28,989
together Gary Gary developed it it was

3866
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:31,360
that nothing was was incredible

3867
02:44:28,989 --> 02:44:33,639
you know I'm not I know I don't smoke a

3868
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:35,980
lot of you know cannabis because I can't

3869
02:44:33,639 --> 02:44:37,989
deal with the the THC just I got too

3870
02:44:35,979 --> 02:44:39,819
much to do right but you start

3871
02:44:37,989 --> 02:44:41,920
introducing the terpene levels of that

3872
02:44:39,819 --> 02:44:44,020
the the cleanliness of it and it was I

3873
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:48,370
don't know how anyone could ever go back

3874
02:44:44,020 --> 02:44:50,200
to a lower quality product at that point

3875
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:52,829
it wasn't just that it tasted great but

3876
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:57,940
when it was able to maintain such high

3877
02:44:52,829 --> 02:44:59,979
levels of things it the effective it was

3878
02:44:57,940 --> 02:45:03,460
it was completely different and it was

3879
02:44:59,979 --> 02:45:04,959
all the good you know it mitigated all

3880
02:45:03,459 --> 02:45:09,220
the negatives that are traditionally

3881
02:45:04,959 --> 02:45:13,149
associated with with too much THC and

3882
02:45:09,220 --> 02:45:17,171
yeah I miss that thing we'll have to get

3883
02:45:13,149 --> 02:45:19,450
you another one it's great absolutely

3884
02:45:17,171 --> 02:45:22,899
yeah well there's something to be said

3885
02:45:19,450 --> 02:45:25,359
for for the enjoyment of it strictly for

3886
02:45:22,899 --> 02:45:26,739
the enjoyment cuz that's one of the you

3887
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:28,871
know one of the main reasons so many

3888
02:45:26,739 --> 02:45:31,239
people kept the plant for so many years

3889
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:35,319
before a lot of people a lot of us knew

3890
02:45:31,239 --> 02:45:37,511
the actual depth of the medicinal values

3891
02:45:35,319 --> 02:45:39,279
of cannabis we always kind of knew it

3892
02:45:37,511 --> 02:45:41,501
but then you know like I'll never forget

3893
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:43,480
being like oh well it's not gonna you

3894
02:45:41,501 --> 02:45:44,710
know it's not gonna shrink your cancer

3895
02:45:43,479 --> 02:45:46,390
out of existence but you could

3896
02:45:44,710 --> 02:45:48,220
definitely maintain a higher quality of

3897
02:45:46,390 --> 02:45:50,710
life by dealing with the nausea from the

3898
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:52,479
chemo and the radiation fast forward 10

3899
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:55,359
years Christina Sanchez at the

3900
02:45:52,479 --> 02:45:59,130
University of Madrid actually THC does

3901
02:45:55,360 --> 02:46:01,661
cause apoptosis in cancerous cells and

3902
02:45:59,130 --> 02:46:03,489
you know the mind was blown and it just

3903
02:46:01,661 --> 02:46:06,310
keeps getting more and more blown as we

3904
02:46:03,489 --> 02:46:08,431
learn about this important system the

3905
02:46:06,310 --> 02:46:11,290
endocannabinoid system that seems to

3906
02:46:08,431 --> 02:46:14,230
regulate all biological functions and

3907
02:46:11,290 --> 02:46:17,939
being done through you know taking in

3908
02:46:14,229 --> 02:46:20,921
whether consuming inhaling vaporizing

3909
02:46:17,940 --> 02:46:22,810
cannabinoids is pretty incredible it

3910
02:46:20,921 --> 02:46:24,161
gets to the point where and I didn't say

3911
02:46:22,810 --> 02:46:27,370
it earlier I didn't want to take things

3912
02:46:24,161 --> 02:46:29,351
into too esoteric of an area but I just

3913
02:46:27,370 --> 02:46:32,319
feel like and a big part of why this

3914
02:46:29,351 --> 02:46:34,211
hasn't moved is fast forward as it may

3915
02:46:32,319 --> 02:46:35,950
have is because the amount of

3916
02:46:34,210 --> 02:46:38,470
politicians you have to go through to

3917
02:46:35,950 --> 02:46:40,720
get to that top layer where literally

3918
02:46:38,470 --> 02:46:44,380
maybe those top three and four layers

3919
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:46,870
are housed almost exclusively by

3920
02:46:44,380 --> 02:46:48,609
borderline sociopaths if not complete

3921
02:46:46,870 --> 02:46:49,960
sociopaths people that don't feel

3922
02:46:48,610 --> 02:46:52,121
empathy people that don't have

3923
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:53,890
compassion people they can just watch

3924
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:55,569
your child sees right in front of you

3925
02:46:53,890 --> 02:46:57,069
and then go in and sign the bill that

3926
02:46:55,569 --> 02:46:59,770
says no no we're gonna keep this stuff

3927
02:46:57,069 --> 02:47:01,720
out of existence it seems like there's

3928
02:46:59,771 --> 02:47:03,761
enough caring politicians that are in

3929
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:06,279
the bottom levels and this is just maybe

3930
02:47:03,761 --> 02:47:08,081
my own crazy opinion that you can kind

3931
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:10,181
of get through but as you get higher and

3932
02:47:08,081 --> 02:47:12,521
higher there are these they're just

3933
02:47:10,181 --> 02:47:14,860
seemingly like sociopaths that it

3934
02:47:12,521 --> 02:47:17,411
wouldn't just be instantaneous like what

3935
02:47:14,860 --> 02:47:19,780
else could be clogging it up and slowing

3936
02:47:17,411 --> 02:47:22,189
it down except someone that has no

3937
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:24,979
ability to feel empathy or compassion

3938
02:47:22,189 --> 02:47:27,068
or to feel someone's pain what else

3939
02:47:24,978 --> 02:47:29,179
could it be

3940
02:47:27,068 --> 02:47:40,068
yeah that's a great question you know

3941
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:42,050
with just walking into it we were told

3942
02:47:40,068 --> 02:47:44,180
that the Republicans were voting no or

3943
02:47:42,049 --> 02:47:45,498
abstaining just on party line and that's

3944
02:47:44,180 --> 02:47:47,238
where it's a that's why the two-thirds

3945
02:47:45,498 --> 02:47:49,309
votes gonna be so hard in the States

3946
02:47:47,238 --> 02:47:51,648
right now getting a two-thirds vote on

3947
02:47:49,309 --> 02:47:54,139
anything that's just about 51 or 49 is

3948
02:47:51,648 --> 02:47:57,708
almost impossible with how toxic some of

3949
02:47:54,139 --> 02:48:01,578
the politics are here right now and we

3950
02:47:57,709 --> 02:48:04,249
had you know we started a group working

3951
02:48:01,578 --> 02:48:06,639
with with some other organizations and

3952
02:48:04,248 --> 02:48:09,369
we had you know so we had vets

3953
02:48:06,639 --> 02:48:11,448
organizations there we have lamb

3954
02:48:09,369 --> 02:48:13,010
aluminum in Alliance for medical

3955
02:48:11,449 --> 02:48:15,350
marijuana it's for the oldest the oldest

3956
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:19,430
in California there so we had all these

3957
02:48:15,350 --> 02:48:21,380
different demographics and we had the

3958
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:23,930
Republicans who showed up so six out of

3959
02:48:21,379 --> 02:48:25,578
ten of the the Senators showed up the

3960
02:48:23,930 --> 02:48:29,600
two Republicans had showed up went from

3961
02:48:25,578 --> 02:48:31,068
no votes in flipped and voted yes they

3962
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:32,988
didn't even abstain which was going to

3963
02:48:31,068 --> 02:48:36,019
be their neutral and I thought that was

3964
02:48:32,988 --> 02:48:37,368
really a good sign that we on this level

3965
02:48:36,020 --> 02:48:40,279
at least we're still seeing some of that

3966
02:48:37,369 --> 02:48:41,840
benefit but and the other committees

3967
02:48:40,279 --> 02:48:44,090
that wasn't the case and in all of them

3968
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:45,260
that didn't show up just voted no like

3969
02:48:44,090 --> 02:48:47,930
they just you know they don't they don't

3970
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:51,770
even read it and in vote no it's it's

3971
02:48:47,930 --> 02:48:54,170
really I have a hard time wrapping my

3972
02:48:51,770 --> 02:48:56,090
brain around it you know well how you

3973
02:48:54,170 --> 02:48:58,609
can be in any position of control and

3974
02:48:56,090 --> 02:49:01,488
see the scientific mountain of evidence

3975
02:48:58,609 --> 02:49:04,850
the people coming in young old and

3976
02:49:01,488 --> 02:49:08,090
otherwise saying this is benefiting our

3977
02:49:04,850 --> 02:49:10,220
life and it's almost impossible to

3978
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:12,078
really give credible demonstrations of

3979
02:49:10,219 --> 02:49:14,448
harm of how it's harming anybody and

3980
02:49:12,078 --> 02:49:15,978
just have people really not giving any

3981
02:49:14,449 --> 02:49:17,989
thought to it at all just so I'm sorry

3982
02:49:15,978 --> 02:49:22,818
you know but we're not gonna allow it

3983
02:49:17,988 --> 02:49:25,068
it's um it's mind-boggling to me I don't

3984
02:49:22,818 --> 02:49:26,448
understand it at all that's what we'll

3985
02:49:25,068 --> 02:49:28,189
say in it that there doesn't seem to be

3986
02:49:26,449 --> 02:49:31,189
many options other than the fact that

3987
02:49:28,189 --> 02:49:32,630
potential sociopaths are at the top you

3988
02:49:31,189 --> 02:49:35,818
know like how else could a plant like

3989
02:49:32,629 --> 02:49:38,219
this be kept illegal for so long and not

3990
02:49:35,818 --> 02:49:40,528
he kept illegal but to such a serious

3991
02:49:38,219 --> 02:49:42,269
level that kicking doors down taking

3992
02:49:40,529 --> 02:49:44,399
children away from families putting

3993
02:49:42,270 --> 02:49:46,979
people in jail for well look at Rick

3994
02:49:44,398 --> 02:49:49,408
Gadol II sees father in jail for 98

3995
02:49:46,978 --> 02:49:53,338
years he's I think he served 31 plus

3996
02:49:49,408 --> 02:49:56,668
years and Alec that is insane to do that

3997
02:49:53,338 --> 02:49:58,498
for there's got to be some reason you

3998
02:49:56,668 --> 02:50:00,930
know you have to be so worried about the

3999
02:49:58,498 --> 02:50:03,299
way this plant affects people the way

4000
02:50:00,930 --> 02:50:05,699
this plant gives access to healing the

4001
02:50:03,299 --> 02:50:08,038
way this plant changes the way people

4002
02:50:05,699 --> 02:50:11,039
think versus the way maybe potentially

4003
02:50:08,039 --> 02:50:13,350
they want you to think it definitely

4004
02:50:11,039 --> 02:50:15,539
I've questioned it for a very long time

4005
02:50:13,350 --> 02:50:17,279
I've just always tried to understand

4006
02:50:15,539 --> 02:50:20,010
like there's something more going on

4007
02:50:17,279 --> 02:50:22,050
that's not being discussed and it's it

4008
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:23,850
goes deep and it's borderline

4009
02:50:22,049 --> 02:50:25,948
frightening and you almost don't want to

4010
02:50:23,850 --> 02:50:28,498
face it but there's something else going

4011
02:50:25,949 --> 02:50:30,209
on when they can just allow so much

4012
02:50:28,498 --> 02:50:33,029
suffering and we all know that they've

4013
02:50:30,209 --> 02:50:34,770
had patents on this since the 70s that

4014
02:50:33,029 --> 02:50:37,248
they understand the profound healing

4015
02:50:34,770 --> 02:50:40,289
nature of cannabinoids whether they may

4016
02:50:37,248 --> 02:50:44,779
allow us to realize or not they

4017
02:50:40,289 --> 02:50:44,779
definitely I mean come on they do

4018
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:52,908
absolutely absolutely so playing

4019
02:50:49,588 --> 02:50:55,559
ignorant makes it even more scary

4020
02:50:52,908 --> 02:50:58,219
propaganda works I mean that's that's

4021
02:50:55,559 --> 02:51:01,528
the bottom line you can convince whole

4022
02:50:58,219 --> 02:51:03,538
communities of people that the reality

4023
02:51:01,529 --> 02:51:06,359
around them is something other than what

4024
02:51:03,539 --> 02:51:09,149
it really is and you know I've met so

4025
02:51:06,359 --> 02:51:11,850
many people who just know that cannabis

4026
02:51:09,148 --> 02:51:14,809
is dangerous they just it's written into

4027
02:51:11,850 --> 02:51:17,818
their worldview and their paradigm but

4028
02:51:14,809 --> 02:51:19,378
it's hard you know this is where we get

4029
02:51:17,818 --> 02:51:21,719
into kind of psychology a little bit

4030
02:51:19,379 --> 02:51:23,279
right but this pertains to a whole bunch

4031
02:51:21,719 --> 02:51:24,358
of other subjects you know we see the

4032
02:51:23,279 --> 02:51:26,668
world for what it is

4033
02:51:24,359 --> 02:51:29,248
there are subconscious mechanisms that

4034
02:51:26,668 --> 02:51:31,588
want to protect that worldview right

4035
02:51:29,248 --> 02:51:34,469
that the influencing of that paradigm is

4036
02:51:31,588 --> 02:51:36,328
seen as a risk and they want to protect

4037
02:51:34,469 --> 02:51:37,918
that worldview they want to fit into the

4038
02:51:36,328 --> 02:51:39,779
community that they're in who shares

4039
02:51:37,918 --> 02:51:42,959
that worldview whether it's real or not

4040
02:51:39,779 --> 02:51:44,640
real fantasy or reality and you know

4041
02:51:42,959 --> 02:51:47,729
that's kind of what we're up against it

4042
02:51:44,639 --> 02:51:48,309
says is people some of it is they're

4043
02:51:47,728 --> 02:51:49,868
just cold

4044
02:51:48,309 --> 02:51:51,639
Callison don't want to they don't have

4045
02:51:49,869 --> 02:51:53,409
time or the interest to learn about it

4046
02:51:51,639 --> 02:51:57,608
but the others you know they just want

4047
02:51:53,408 --> 02:51:59,709
to be able to keep control in their

4048
02:51:57,609 --> 02:52:01,600
communities or or they believe to their

4049
02:51:59,709 --> 02:52:03,818
core that what they think is real

4050
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:05,738
without ever taking the time to self

4051
02:52:03,818 --> 02:52:08,590
evaluate why do I believe what I believe

4052
02:52:05,738 --> 02:52:10,719
and this obviously is part of the human

4053
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:12,639
the human condition and we should do

4054
02:52:10,719 --> 02:52:15,849
that on all subjects not just cannabis

4055
02:52:12,639 --> 02:52:17,799
but the the real problem is people feel

4056
02:52:15,850 --> 02:52:20,260
that they have facts in the belief

4057
02:52:17,799 --> 02:52:22,478
systems that are based in fact that have

4058
02:52:20,260 --> 02:52:25,238
been really based out of propaganda and

4059
02:52:22,478 --> 02:52:26,559
disinformation for for decades and

4060
02:52:25,238 --> 02:52:28,568
that's you know that's gonna take some

4061
02:52:26,559 --> 02:52:31,959
time to change because people

4062
02:52:28,568 --> 02:52:33,368
consciously or not they resist against

4063
02:52:31,959 --> 02:52:35,799
that you know they don't want that

4064
02:52:33,369 --> 02:52:38,020
worldview change and that's why trauma

4065
02:52:35,799 --> 02:52:43,328
is such a great educator that's why

4066
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:46,479
seeing people suffer ain't seen seizures

4067
02:52:43,328 --> 02:52:48,340
seeing adults with wasting syndrome and

4068
02:52:46,478 --> 02:52:50,078
it's traumatic when you see it it

4069
02:52:48,340 --> 02:52:52,148
influences your brain differently and it

4070
02:52:50,078 --> 02:52:53,738
allows for paradigm shifts because the

4071
02:52:52,148 --> 02:52:56,439
brain associates it starts to see the

4072
02:52:53,738 --> 02:52:58,180
risk and and when you're able to see the

4073
02:52:56,439 --> 02:52:59,559
risk your your brain responds

4074
02:52:58,180 --> 02:53:00,939
differently than if you just have to

4075
02:52:59,559 --> 02:53:03,340
imagine what that's like

4076
02:53:00,939 --> 02:53:05,199
and that's why it's such a useful tool

4077
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:07,270
and that's why you know families like

4078
02:53:05,199 --> 02:53:09,550
Colton and others who were able to put

4079
02:53:07,270 --> 02:53:11,319
in adults who are able to put their

4080
02:53:09,549 --> 02:53:13,840
suffering out there as embarrassing as

4081
02:53:11,318 --> 02:53:18,818
that is have such a dramatic impact

4082
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:21,639
because people are able to change their

4083
02:53:18,818 --> 02:53:22,629
thought process in different ways that

4084
02:53:21,639 --> 02:53:24,219
if they're just trying to have to

4085
02:53:22,629 --> 02:53:32,019
imagine that someone says this is good

4086
02:53:24,219 --> 02:53:34,118
you know that's a really good way of

4087
02:53:32,020 --> 02:53:36,460
putting it forest in the way you're

4088
02:53:34,119 --> 02:53:38,979
talking about the paradigm shift of your

4089
02:53:36,459 --> 02:53:40,448
thought patterns and the way you see and

4090
02:53:38,978 --> 02:53:42,760
process information when watching

4091
02:53:40,449 --> 02:53:45,460
someone go through those things it

4092
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:48,880
definitely is something that could

4093
02:53:45,459 --> 02:53:50,559
kickstart just opening up the way you

4094
02:53:48,879 --> 02:53:55,269
think about things rather than just

4095
02:53:50,559 --> 02:53:58,389
believing them yeah the human brain is

4096
02:53:55,270 --> 02:54:00,939
wired to learn from kind of fear and

4097
02:53:58,389 --> 02:54:01,789
trauma right it's that evolved need to

4098
02:54:00,939 --> 02:54:04,940
protect it so

4099
02:54:01,790 --> 02:54:07,880
you know that's why you know it's easier

4100
02:54:04,940 --> 02:54:10,310
to you know spank your kids than to

4101
02:54:07,879 --> 02:54:12,349
teach them overtime lessons to have them

4102
02:54:10,309 --> 02:54:13,760
ingrained because they'll learn quickly

4103
02:54:12,350 --> 02:54:15,380
through fear because the brain is

4104
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:17,840
designed to not put yourself in a

4105
02:54:15,379 --> 02:54:20,539
situation where harm can come again it

4106
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:22,159
takes a lot longer to integrate new

4107
02:54:20,540 --> 02:54:24,740
thought processes and make them a part

4108
02:54:22,159 --> 02:54:27,049
of one's being to other methods because

4109
02:54:24,739 --> 02:54:28,521
we didn't evolve that way and you know

4110
02:54:27,049 --> 02:54:31,039
that's a whole nother conversation but

4111
02:54:28,521 --> 02:54:33,320
it is you know it does help to really

4112
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:35,810
understand why it could is this going to

4113
02:54:33,319 --> 02:54:38,299
be a long process right we can't go in

4114
02:54:35,809 --> 02:54:40,279
there and in traumatize people every day

4115
02:54:38,299 --> 02:54:42,920
to give them the really kind of what

4116
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:44,810
snap out of that paradigm and see it and

4117
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:47,659
it's it's going to take continued

4118
02:54:44,809 --> 02:54:50,149
interaction continued experiences in

4119
02:54:47,659 --> 02:54:52,489
their lives that's why everybody who is

4120
02:54:50,149 --> 02:54:55,010
having you know benefits in their

4121
02:54:52,489 --> 02:54:57,199
community sharing that with with your

4122
02:54:55,010 --> 02:54:59,180
community and if they write you off the

4123
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:01,070
first time realize that that's has

4124
02:54:59,180 --> 02:55:02,569
nothing to do necessarily with you I

4125
02:55:01,069 --> 02:55:04,670
mean it might if you're not going to

4126
02:55:02,569 --> 02:55:06,350
communicate in your message but you know

4127
02:55:04,670 --> 02:55:07,879
a lot of times that's just that's what

4128
02:55:06,350 --> 02:55:09,590
happens the first time you're bumping

4129
02:55:07,879 --> 02:55:11,750
into that back protection of their

4130
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:13,430
worldview and you just needs it takes

4131
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:15,079
more interaction and it takes to get it

4132
02:55:13,430 --> 02:55:17,690
out there more often and building those

4133
02:55:15,079 --> 02:55:19,280
relationships and that's what some of

4134
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:21,140
the most amazing things I've seen happen

4135
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:23,989
through a lot of this cannabis activism

4136
02:55:21,139 --> 02:55:26,209
in the last ten years is because we've

4137
02:55:23,989 --> 02:55:28,670
had some laws change and we've been able

4138
02:55:26,209 --> 02:55:31,669
to get into more and into the community

4139
02:55:28,670 --> 02:55:33,530
more and more and it's been really

4140
02:55:31,670 --> 02:55:36,319
really exciting to see some of those

4141
02:55:33,530 --> 02:55:38,239
shifts happening in communities and you

4142
02:55:36,319 --> 02:55:39,739
know I'm really excited to see where

4143
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:41,271
we're gonna be in ten years so I mean I

4144
02:55:39,739 --> 02:55:42,889
think this conversation is gonna look

4145
02:55:41,271 --> 02:55:45,320
completely different not only what the

4146
02:55:42,889 --> 02:55:47,349
industry looks like but but what our

4147
02:55:45,319 --> 02:55:50,690
communities look like and how it's been

4148
02:55:47,350 --> 02:55:54,319
integrated you know well look at Billy

4149
02:55:50,690 --> 02:55:56,569
Cal called well in the UK I mean they

4150
02:55:54,319 --> 02:55:58,100
you know he was he had his medicine

4151
02:55:56,569 --> 02:55:59,809
taken at the border they were like no

4152
02:55:58,100 --> 02:56:01,489
we're keeping this medicine and in a

4153
02:55:59,809 --> 02:56:03,770
very short period of time they were like

4154
02:56:01,489 --> 02:56:06,440
they wrote something up that allowed him

4155
02:56:03,771 --> 02:56:08,360
to get that medicine and it was it's not

4156
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:10,399
something I thought I'd see the UK do

4157
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:12,200
anytime soon they seem to be so staunch

4158
02:56:10,399 --> 02:56:14,329
and strict when it comes to medical

4159
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:15,710
cannabis while you know GW

4160
02:56:14,329 --> 02:56:19,250
Pharmaceuticals export

4161
02:56:15,709 --> 02:56:23,269
tons annually from the country it's

4162
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:25,069
pretty wild to see that it's slowly but

4163
02:56:23,270 --> 02:56:26,510
surely it's starting to happen even in

4164
02:56:25,069 --> 02:56:30,319
the most hardened two places I mean

4165
02:56:26,510 --> 02:56:33,739
Wendy mentioned Oklahoma Oklahoma gave

4166
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:36,350
will foster 96 years like less than what

4167
02:56:33,739 --> 02:56:39,739
was that 15 or 20 years ago maximum and

4168
02:56:36,350 --> 02:56:41,930
now they're implementing a medical bill

4169
02:56:39,739 --> 02:56:45,590
so that's pretty huge when it happens in

4170
02:56:41,930 --> 02:56:49,489
places like Texas and Oklahoma and the

4171
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:53,389
UK you can definitely feel that you've

4172
02:56:49,489 --> 02:56:55,280
been making headway and then you're in

4173
02:56:53,389 --> 02:56:58,969
California for so that's like kind of

4174
02:56:55,280 --> 02:57:01,909
like the the sort of epicenter of the

4175
02:56:58,969 --> 02:57:04,369
cannabis world where so much of that

4176
02:57:01,909 --> 02:57:06,440
inspiration came out of cannabis once

4177
02:57:04,370 --> 02:57:11,120
again the exporting of the culture right

4178
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:14,750
it's definitely it is it is I try to

4179
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:17,750
people who don't live here or work with

4180
02:57:14,750 --> 02:57:19,579
like rare patient groups you know weird

4181
02:57:17,750 --> 02:57:21,409
if we're not out of the woods and I mean

4182
02:57:19,579 --> 02:57:23,030
here in California it's actually harder

4183
02:57:21,409 --> 02:57:28,639
now than it's been in the last 20 years

4184
02:57:23,030 --> 02:57:31,159
to continue to treat our ourselves and

4185
02:57:28,639 --> 02:57:37,519
our in the families that we work with we

4186
02:57:31,159 --> 02:57:40,728
don't really have those virtual

4187
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:43,640
activities and we've then we've now made

4188
02:57:40,728 --> 02:57:45,049
it inherently illegal and people will

4189
02:57:43,639 --> 02:57:46,699
lose their license and their livelihood

4190
02:57:45,049 --> 02:57:48,829
if they interact with people outside of

4191
02:57:46,700 --> 02:57:50,060
that Network well that's us so all the

4192
02:57:48,829 --> 02:57:51,709
good people who are working with that

4193
02:57:50,059 --> 02:57:53,629
sir okay sorry we'd love to donate this

4194
02:57:51,709 --> 02:57:55,728
you'd love to do these extractions but

4195
02:57:53,629 --> 02:57:58,969
we're not allowed to so you know there's

4196
02:57:55,728 --> 02:58:01,609
just a lot of again we've kind of taken

4197
02:57:58,969 --> 02:58:04,549
cannabis we've locked it in a basement

4198
02:58:01,610 --> 02:58:06,710
for you know 70 years or whatnot and now

4199
02:58:04,549 --> 02:58:07,939
we're trying to just let it out of the

4200
02:58:06,709 --> 02:58:09,649
basement and say okay now we're gonna

4201
02:58:07,940 --> 02:58:11,149
make that legal as if that's what

4202
02:58:09,649 --> 02:58:12,709
cannabis in the community in the

4203
02:58:11,149 --> 02:58:14,869
industry would have looked like without

4204
02:58:12,709 --> 02:58:18,369
prohibition you know and I think are

4205
02:58:14,870 --> 02:58:20,660
where the fight is is not allowing

4206
02:58:18,370 --> 02:58:22,160
prohibition and what it did the cannabis

4207
02:58:20,659 --> 02:58:24,950
to define what it's going to look like

4208
02:58:22,159 --> 02:58:27,440
out of outside and in the real world I

4209
02:58:24,950 --> 02:58:29,030
think there are ways that we don't even

4210
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:30,620
understand the cannabis would have been

4211
02:58:29,030 --> 02:58:32,931
rated into our communities into our

4212
02:58:30,620 --> 02:58:35,181
households if prohibition had never

4213
02:58:32,931 --> 02:58:37,640
happened and one of the things that I

4214
02:58:35,181 --> 02:58:41,149
want to continue to do is not say what

4215
02:58:37,640 --> 02:58:43,670
will they allow us to do but help craft

4216
02:58:41,149 --> 02:58:45,739
and form the future of what do we want

4217
02:58:43,670 --> 02:58:50,149
canvas integration to look like in our

4218
02:58:45,739 --> 02:58:51,799
society and just by for and I think it's

4219
02:58:50,149 --> 02:58:53,959
very different than just only having

4220
02:58:51,799 --> 02:58:56,959
shops with glass countertops you know

4221
02:58:53,959 --> 02:58:58,819
there is a lot bigger future out there

4222
02:58:56,959 --> 02:59:00,229
if we look at the big picture of the

4223
02:58:58,819 --> 02:59:02,779
good that we can do the type of

4224
02:59:00,229 --> 02:59:05,420
businesses we can create if we just kind

4225
02:59:02,780 --> 02:59:08,120
of step out of that paradigm right if

4226
02:59:05,420 --> 02:59:09,530
this is what cannabis is and look at all

4227
02:59:08,120 --> 02:59:11,450
the different with this we can integrate

4228
02:59:09,530 --> 02:59:14,391
it into our society and so we really

4229
02:59:11,450 --> 02:59:16,221
want it to be and that's some of the

4230
02:59:14,390 --> 02:59:17,959
fight that we have going on here in

4231
02:59:16,220 --> 02:59:19,789
California and it's great to see

4232
02:59:17,959 --> 02:59:22,189
Oklahoma in Texas like you said it's

4233
02:59:19,790 --> 02:59:23,870
moving forward but I want them to know

4234
02:59:22,190 --> 02:59:25,819
that if they if they understand that

4235
02:59:23,870 --> 02:59:27,681
just that legalizing specific commercial

4236
02:59:25,819 --> 02:59:30,560
activity is by no means the end of the

4237
02:59:27,681 --> 02:59:32,659
road they can start to really craft that

4238
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:34,699
from day one and start to fight those

4239
02:59:32,659 --> 02:59:35,840
fights now because we've you know we're

4240
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:37,400
learning some of them the hard way it's

4241
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:40,450
taking us a long time to get here and

4242
02:59:37,399 --> 02:59:43,431
it's unfortunate that after 20 years

4243
02:59:40,450 --> 02:59:45,261
patient groups and and charitable groups

4244
02:59:43,431 --> 02:59:47,480
and and those sort of things are in a

4245
02:59:45,261 --> 02:59:50,420
worse position than they've been ever

4246
02:59:47,479 --> 02:59:53,479
here in California so we're gonna make

4247
02:59:50,420 --> 02:59:56,479
sure that changes again SB 829 for those

4248
02:59:53,479 --> 02:59:58,250
of you around here but yeah with

4249
02:59:56,479 --> 02:59:59,959
programs like this with the ending and

4250
02:59:58,250 --> 03:00:01,790
continuing the fight all good people

4251
02:59:59,959 --> 03:00:04,760
here on the panel we're gonna we're

4252
03:00:01,790 --> 03:00:06,650
gonna see cannabis thrive in all sorts

4253
03:00:04,761 --> 03:00:10,729
of different ways it's not one flower

4254
03:00:06,649 --> 03:00:13,459
it's a garden and it's really exciting

4255
03:00:10,729 --> 03:00:16,029
to see all these different aspects of

4256
03:00:13,459 --> 03:00:18,859
cannabis now come into the conversation

4257

4258
03:00:18,860 --> 03:00:23,090
diverse applications that we're gonna

4259

03:04:20,750 --> 03:04:29,770
touch with you Wade thank you Mark yeah

4339
03:04:30,279 --> 03:04:39,500
probably the easiest way to reach me is

4340
03:04:33,488 --> 03:04:41,448
Wade at House of Harlequin org I have an

4341
03:04:39,500 --> 03:04:42,260
Instagram thing but I'm still learning

4342
03:04:41,449 --> 03:04:46,790
how it works

4343
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:54,439
so I'm not very adept in the internet

4344
03:04:46,790 --> 03:04:58,880
world and yeah you can find a link to

4345
03:04:54,439 --> 03:05:04,040
that at Qila Darius network org as well

4346
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:05,629
I really can't overemphasize how to me

4347
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:07,399
one of the things that's really

4348
03:05:05,629 --> 03:05:08,869
beautiful about forests and the work

4349
03:05:07,398 --> 03:05:09,469
that he's doing with the khalad rias

4350
03:05:08,870 --> 03:05:12,380
Network

4351
03:05:09,469 --> 03:05:15,228
it's really capturing the essence of

4352
03:05:12,379 --> 03:05:19,809
what is the intention about your work

4353
03:05:15,228 --> 03:05:23,090
with cannabis and at one extreme is

4354
03:05:19,809 --> 03:05:25,760
compassionate use and need and at the

4355
03:05:23,090 --> 03:05:27,710
end another extreme and and neither is

4356
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:32,329
good or bad or right or wrong it's just

4357
03:05:27,709 --> 03:05:34,219
an observation is the opportunity to

4358
03:05:32,329 --> 03:05:38,930
support yourself and your family in your

4359
03:05:34,219 --> 03:05:40,789
life and one of the ways that that

4360
03:05:38,930 --> 03:05:49,279
dichotomy I think can be brought

4361
03:05:40,790 --> 03:05:50,390
together is well I'm stoned as well so

4362
03:05:49,279 --> 03:05:54,590
I'm gonna stop there

4363
03:05:50,389 --> 03:05:56,659
I just intention is really I think an

4364
03:05:54,590 --> 03:06:01,760
essential part of working with cannabis

4365
03:05:56,659 --> 03:06:05,619
and both over-the-counter versions of

4366
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:07,068
cannabis as medicine and pharmaceutical

4367
03:06:05,620 --> 03:06:10,370
prescription-grade

4368
03:06:07,068 --> 03:06:14,139
not from a drugstore but from someone

4369
03:06:10,370 --> 03:06:16,729
you know or someone in your own family

4370
03:06:14,139 --> 03:06:19,459
there's medical benefit with the plant

4371
03:06:16,728 --> 03:06:22,789
it's the real milk miracle here is the

4372
03:06:19,459 --> 03:06:25,369
plant itself and thank you Marcus and

4373
03:06:22,790 --> 03:06:29,060
all of you who sit in on this event

4374
03:06:25,370 --> 03:06:32,060
that happens for bringing yourself and

4375
03:06:29,059 --> 03:06:34,100
your expertise and your heart to what

4376
03:06:32,059 --> 03:06:36,199
we're talking about here because the

4377
03:06:34,100 --> 03:06:39,079
plant is the miracle but we are bringing

4378
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:42,680
it out of that basement of prohibition

4379
03:06:39,079 --> 03:06:45,139
into the light the true nature of how it

4380
03:06:42,680 --> 03:06:47,420
is as a plant and as a healing part of

4381
03:06:45,139 --> 03:06:49,670
our lives so that's the end of my stone

4382
03:06:47,420 --> 03:06:52,219
drab for today thank you Marcus for hash

forr ESD at khalad resent work toward

4529
03:13:20,220 --> 03:13:25,369
but you know what i would just say that

4530
03:13:22,140 --> 03:13:28,800
the collagenase network is one of many

4531
03:13:25,370 --> 03:13:30,870
grassroots organizations that are trying

4532
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:32,970
to do good in their community I know

4533
03:13:30,870 --> 03:13:35,280
that Etienne and the veterans

4534
03:13:32,970 --> 03:13:36,960
organizations are working hard I know

4535
03:13:35,280 --> 03:13:40,021
that there's organizations that are

4536
03:13:36,960 --> 03:13:41,970
working with adult cancer patients AIDS

4537
03:13:40,021 --> 03:13:44,341
wasting patients I would just encourage

4538
03:13:41,970 --> 03:13:46,350
everybody you know hey you want to help

4539
03:13:44,341 --> 03:13:48,931
the clad race Network we need it

4540
03:13:46,351 --> 03:13:51,181
and we would be grateful but there are

4541
03:13:48,931 --> 03:13:51,989
likely people in your own community that

4542
03:13:51,181 --> 03:13:54,748
are just

4543
03:13:51,988 --> 03:13:56,698
desperate and just as good of a cause

4544
03:13:54,748 --> 03:13:58,588
and I would just encourage everybody out

4545
03:13:56,699 --> 03:14:01,020
there just take a time and look at

4546
03:13:58,588 --> 03:14:04,680
what's around and get involved with them

4547
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:06,479
because not only is it a good cause but

4548
03:14:04,680 --> 03:14:08,970
it can add a level of fulfillment to

4549
03:14:06,478 --> 03:14:13,168
your work with cannabis that could

4550
03:14:08,969 --> 03:14:15,538
really be a game-changer and in your own

4551
03:14:13,168 --> 03:14:17,668
daily life it's amazing what working for

4552
03:14:15,539 --> 03:14:22,049
others who have it worse than you do can

4553
03:14:17,668 --> 03:14:26,398
do to yourself and and your meaning in

4554
03:14:22,049 --> 03:14:28,680
life so reach out to us or find someone

4555
03:14:26,398 --> 03:14:30,658
your community that needs it can't thank

4556
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:34,770
you guys enough and if you're in

4557
03:14:30,658 --> 03:14:37,498
California remember SB 829 one of in my

4558
03:14:34,770 --> 03:14:39,869
opinion the most critical roles for just

4559
03:14:37,498 --> 03:14:41,969
doing what is right as it pertains to

4560
03:14:39,869 --> 03:14:43,709
cannabis in our communities or the most

4561
03:14:41,969 --> 03:14:46,228
critical bills that's up and if we get

4562
03:14:43,709 --> 03:14:47,729
it passed in California it's a domino

4563
03:14:46,228 --> 03:14:51,028
that could tip to the rest of the

4564
03:14:47,728 --> 03:14:52,858
country so so please all of your support

4565
