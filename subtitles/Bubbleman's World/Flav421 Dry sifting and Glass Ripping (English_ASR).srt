about what Flav is here for but in the

40
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,798
meantime I'm going to uh I'm going to

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,640
rip up a bowl of some of this dry sip

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,439
that's in the house little Afghani from

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,879
the great Gardener very does that look

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,839
just like cream it does actually

45
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,798
yeah I'll take a triple triple of that I

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,840
think you should have a triple triple of

47
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,840
that I'm uh

48
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:10,280
all right get you the there no worries

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,719
doer Shan we get it away from the

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,560
screen not that I doubt your heating

51
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,680
abilities whatsoever but wow wouldn't

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
that make for a great video go to dry

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,439
sift and the screens have a giant hole

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,319
in

55
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,280
them so yeah that that patties well

56
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:26,560
pattied out very well full Melt from the

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,840
great Gardener we're going to make some

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,439
full melt ourselves FL brought a couple

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,519
hundred G of the Renee a real oldtime

60
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,479
favorite strain of mine that is just now

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,800
wreaking up my entire house in the most

62
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:46,359
beautiful of ways so no complaints on

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,360
that all right close her up boom

64
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,359
that was an eye

65
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,759
closer what an incredible

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,040
hit I mean uh it's always a pleasure

67
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,479
hanging out with you Flav because

68
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,120
obviously I've always enjoyed glass art

69
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:19,598
and the he glass pipes MH but I have

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,039
become much more obsessed with the resin

71
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,798
and with the quality of the resin and

72
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,679
with that you know I I'm I'm quite happy

73
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,840
with my production glass my little

74
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
Hitman baby cakes and my you know

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Mothership not that those are low

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,319
quality

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,719
production pieces no but it's so nice to

78
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:39,479
hit a piece of this caliber with hash of

79
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,959
this caliber yes you know it's just

80
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,798
really um it is a treat no it's a it's a

81
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,280
it's sort of a symbiotic relationship

82
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,879
would you say with the the concentrates

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,079
and the the the hey glass

84
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:56,598
and yeah yeah both need each other they

85
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,360
sure do oh yeah so we are you should get

86
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,959
yourself a hit of that

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,439
Afghani well I'm discussing what's next

88
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,039
up to bat um Flav has not yet seen the

89
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,479
little dry sift trick that actually most

90
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,959
of you haven't even seen because the

91
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,199
video that John and I filmed yesterday

92
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,079
is still uploading onto YouTube right

93
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,759
now but here I am about to film it again

94
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,959
and we're going to show flab this cool

95
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,120
little trick uh this is once again from

96
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,478
uh a Facebook post by a guy by the name

97
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,319
of Dry Wizard not too many shout outs I

98
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,439
will give him the fact that he told me

99
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,599
this technique other than that he's he's

100
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,319
a he's a fairly negative guy and I hope

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,680
that he can potentially be more positive

102
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,120
uh on the outset of all things but if

103
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,439
not it is a cool idea and we're going to

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,199
share it with you here

105
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,199
today one second

106
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,560
yep uh the torch the easier the

107
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:56,560
one-hander yes there you go that's a big

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,120
one for the little guy hey yeah with

109
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,519
Dome or without uh with Dome be pretty

110
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,399
hard to hit that

111
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,359
yeah but I want to have this uh there's

112
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,478
such a small amount of water and this

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,199
hash is so [ __ ] tasty I want to have

114
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:13,959
almost no filtration M all right that's

115
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,680
a nice little piece

116
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,560
mhm so cool so yeah we've got the four

117
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,560
screens here we've got the two that I've

118
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,680
been using for years the um uh 150

119
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,639
Micron and the 70 Micron which are known

120
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,120
as 100 LPI and 200 LPI

121
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,840
and then we've got the new screens the

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,439
ones that you've never seen before no

123
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,959
this is the first and this is a 60 LPI

124
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:42,000
and a 90 LPI so these sizes are larger

125
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:47,000
than what we're used to this top screen

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,079
is a 250 and the bottom screen is a 180

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,120
so basically the lower the

128
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:56,879
LPI the higher exactly you exactly

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,038
although they meet in the middle okay

130
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,478
you know what I'm saying when you get to

131
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:04,159
around 120 lines per in it's close to

132
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:08,839
120 they they meet and then they cross

133
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,960
and go it's strange okay so let's drop

134
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,079
some Renee buds on here yeah and Crush

135
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:16,120
her up yeah I mean at first we're going

136
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,120
to be real gentle we won't be crushing

137
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,360
these ones up on this screen this is a

138
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,800
more of a gentle process where we

139
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,520
literally um just gently

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,879
bounce and try to keep all the herb on

141
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,918
the inside

142
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,639
although it wants to bounce around was

143
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,159
it's definitely easier when you're using

144
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:40,199
powder these are full bone dry

145
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,520
nuggets and so the purpose of this

146
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,879
process is because the holes are so big

147
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,758
tons falls through on the second screen

148
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,079
the majority of the contaminant somehow

149
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,080
gets caught up in the second screen

150
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,478
either by piercing it or literally just

151
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,439
laying flat it seems like the balls

152
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,519
falling this short little distance seem

153
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,839
to make it through whereas not a lot

154
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:07,120
else does H interesting yeah so we'll

155
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:10,638
see what Renee is saying here we'll try

156
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,079
it with the buds and if we see a nice

157
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,000
return we'll do it a few more times so

158
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,079
it's really not that much of a process

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,720
like that literally what I did just

160
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,719
there yeah it should be

161
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,198
enough down gently

162
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,120
and then you can

163
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:37,439
see all the contaminant just sitting on

164
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,439
top

165
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,598
there that little

166
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,598
back just that gu

167
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:57,360
Perfect all right

168

[Music]

169
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,520
now no but a little rip and guaranteed

170
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,519
it'll be pure

171
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,120
heads so yeah let's try it again and

172
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,120
we'll break the herb

173
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,120
up

174
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,199
more let see what we can

175
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:27,918
find all

176
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,918
right um thinking maybe

177
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,718
go in at her well I like I want to grind

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,839
the herb up the right way uh grinder is

179
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,519
ideal yeah let's do that we'll be back

180
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,519
all right so we have ground about half

181
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,600
of that half of it still in Bud and the

182
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,600
other half we've ground up pretty good

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,800
mhm might as well give it a little oh

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,639
God does it smell great hey oh

185
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:56,278
yeah just give it a

186
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,278
little shot of

187
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,800
that don't have any glass so going bare

188
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,240
hands one of the things I was just

189
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:09,278
noticing to flab was that the the bud

190
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,919
although it felt so so dry when uh when

191
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,958
we first touched it and you can it

192
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,199
breaks up quite nice there's still

193
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,319
moisture inside the Nuggets when you

194
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,000
break them up so um with a strain like

195
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,959
Renee which is no slouch for Tarin it's

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,679
not going to be losing any extra Tarpin

197
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:29,199
you could let this literally sit out

198
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,399
like this in powder overnight right out

199
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,000
and yeah dry it out that little extra

200
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,559
bit and uh I think you would have a much

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,600
easier time sifting with it it's all

202
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:44,399
about getting your material to the

203
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,920
perfect texture the perfect place and

204
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,958
dry sifting is definitely not a misnomer

205
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,039
it is to be done

206
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,719
dry that's one of the reasons I don't

207
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,879
really support the dry ice method

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,320
they're using fresh material and that

209
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,320
wax membrane is just a little too fresh

210
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,078
all right

211
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,360
so let's see what we've

212
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:30,079

253
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,879
a rip each time you do that little 10 to

254
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,560
15 second trip I think next up we're

going to get rid of the little screens

256
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:23,239

all right so we've got

261
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,750
the

262

[Music]

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,240
Renee powdered

264
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,240
up still a little bit of in nug form

265
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,079
here I think a good idea when you're

266
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,800
working with herb that has a tiny little

267
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,479
bit of moisture in it and your real key

268
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:01,039
is that you're trying to dry

269
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,039
sift is to spread it out thin on the

270
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:08,799
screen and go puff

271
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,920
bowls for about a half an hour or so

272
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,799
which we will happily do yeah that's

273
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,719
what we're going to do right now while

274
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:20,399
this sits here mhm and gets

275
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,120
dry got these fingers in here it is dry

276
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,440
don't get me wrong just the center of

277
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,879
the nugs cuz Renee also is a very tight

278
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,199
strain the flowers do grow very dense

279
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,639
yeah it sure does yeah it's like a

280
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,599
little tiny ball of wetness on how many

281
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,440
weeks did you go with this um these ones

282
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:42,040
went eight oh okay yeah so and my friend

283
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,920
always took Renee 9 to 10 oh yeah yeah

284
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:47,759
oh [ __ ] I've even cut it down in seven

285
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,078
sometimes think there might be some

286
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,800
throwing Hermes well that's why people

287
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,159
cut it down and the thing about Renee is

288
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:58,039
it always Hermes always but it never

289
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:00,198
seeds but people cut it thinking when it

290
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,039
Hermes that they can and keep the seaing

291
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,278
from

292
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,838
happening and I swear you should do the

293
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,519
experiment next time grow The Strain a

294
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:11,279
couple more weeks really yeah

295
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,120
really so don't worry about the hermit

296
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,639
no they won't produce seeds they're not

297
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,879
viable hermies I've never seen like ever

298

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,919
these he and even since it's really

390
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,079
pretty it's the same screen size same

391
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,679
method same everything

392
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,879
so the I love the caramel cream look of

393
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,280
that Afghani yeah scy has the crazy

394
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,799
color oh yeah it's like cremma on the

395
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,399
top of an espresso it's

396
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,960
crazy yeah it really is it really is

397
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,880
it's funny how it's so much more

398
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,679
appealing than the almost greenish

399
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,799
tinges of the hom and the Barb mhm

400
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,679
although they're full melt beautiful

401
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,599
tasty delicious resin tot that color

402
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,798
just adds a

403
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,038
certain it makes all the other ones

404
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:59,158
really I mean if I took these away if I

405
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:01,679
took this away these would look less

406
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,159
green but you put that next to any of

407
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,200
them yeah no like even these ones down

408
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,320
here look more green with that

409
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,640
absolutely sitting there yeah yeah it's

410
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,319
true that's crazy uh interesting all the

411
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,960
differences of the uh hashes I'm pretty

412
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:19,000
sure that the colors are the essential

413
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,798
oils the tpin and terpenoids MH at

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,159
different um Cycles in their life

415
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:27,759
whether they're new or old or mature uh

416
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,200
they tend to get darker they tend to

417
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:33,440
create different use different colors

418
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,120
and it's definitely um it's definitely

419
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,840
interesting thing I've found over the

420
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,079
years uh particularly photographing with

421
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,240

422
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:45,678
L wow this has a great texture to it

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,960
here a little

430
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,720
press and then a finger people often ask

437
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:31,558
here she still holds her own even

438
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,558
amongst the

439
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:56,599
professionals

440
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,599
yum yeah

441
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,440
get back in there

442
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
you

443
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:11,240
veryable I find the

444
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:13,519
smaller a piece is MHM somehow the more

445
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,720
enjoyable it

446
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,759
is for hash sming device oh I for me I

447
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,519
mean with everything it's about the

448
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,240
certain hit the perk the amount of water

449
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,119
the amount of filtration that's coming

450
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,319
but I I always like

451
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,599
a faster sharper hit less water

452
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:33,519
filtration mhm yeah well all these

453
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,759
pieces are quite small in that sense

454
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,000
yeah there's I mean in this one there's

455
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,879
next to no water at all there's like

456
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,720
literally

457
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,039
drops that one's also you know there's

458
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,400
like less than an ounce of liquid in

459
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:47,440
there y same same with this one too

460
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,480
actually oh yeah that looks like a shot

461
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,880
yeah shot proba just yeah they probably

462
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,919
just like an ounce in there give a nice

463
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,799
little push down on there s

464
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:02,759
here

465
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:02,759
yeah puffing Wild the herb is a

466
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:10,240
drying been loving this dry sifting

467
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,120
lately uh soon I'm going to be getting

468
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,759
real heavy back

469
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,599
into wet washing nice I've got these

470
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,679
different levels of bubble bags out

471
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,719
right now and I'm really sort of gearing

472
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,440
up to I've been gearing up all winter

473
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,919
actually to get out to the ice caps to

474
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,558
do this ice

475
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,679
cave bubble session yep and I'm hoping

476
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:36,079
that will be the beginning of a good you

477
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:39,159
know intense spring and

478
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,319
summer uh you know mad bubble washing

479
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,960
lots of wet washing will you go up to

480
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:46,200
the ice caps all all through the summer

481
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,360
time um you know I I'm looking forward

482
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,798
just for that really being a sort of an

483
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:54,199
event a a twod day one night you know

484
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,918
where we stay overnight film the whole

485
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,558
thing make a bunch of bubs I'm not sure

486
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,919
I'll be going back too many times I

487
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,839
guess it it's it'll depend on how Beyond

488
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,038
blown away and inspired we are by The

489
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,480
Experience cuz you got to admit it

490
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,839
sounds like a pretty good experience

491
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,480
going to a you know milliony old ice

492
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,959
cave on a glacier that you have to go

493
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,038
for 45 minutes on a snowmobile just to

494
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,159
get to yes it's uh sounds like an

495
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:22,919
amazing experience yeah exactly so I'm

496
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,159
really looking forward to that and I've

497
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,759
just uh yeah I've got a lot of friends

498
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,679
with a lot of herb that needs washing

499
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,519
and um it seems like a good thing to get

500
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,360
the bags out and

501
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,440
reestablish with

502
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:42,038
people just some the basics you know so

503
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,919
many people have been experimenting and

504
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:45,359
coming up with different ideas and I

505
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,278
think it's important to go back to the

506
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,359
foundation that will assure Purity mhm

507
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,720
will assure a full melt product if you

508
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,599
have the quality Y and then from there

509
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,759
go off and experiment and as long as

510
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,719
your quality you know doesn't go down

511
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,519
all sor not your quality but your I

512
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,319
guess quantity really it's all about

513
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,839
purity at that point you can't make the

514
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,678
bubble any better than it is uh with the

515
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:11,119
bags but you can make sure that you're

516
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,120
getting the right you know Purity Y and

517
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,959
the right yields

518
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,759
yep all

519
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,919
right one more rip for Flav cuz we

520
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,240
haven't just been taking 20 rips each

521
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:23,240
off

522
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:31,599
camera all right so

523
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,359
we balance that around a little bit not

524
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,678
too much just

525
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,918
basically gently kind of doing this sort

526
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,360
of

527
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,278
thing much like what a tumbler would do

528
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,839
to it as it was tumbling

529
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:48,119
around you don't want to grind it into

530
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:48,119
the screen really too

531
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,159
hard dropping is always a

532
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:56,158
nice nice way to get it done

533
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,919
and

534
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,960
I'd always suggest too when you're done

535
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,840
dry sifting like this um to clean your

536
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,919
screen don't let it sit around

537
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,639
dirty um whether you have a brush or um

538
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,038
you can just take them outside and kind

539
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,480
of drop them bang them on the side and

540
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,359
they they will release but um it's

541
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,919
definitely a good idea to do something

542
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,599
rather than to just leave it with uh

543
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:03,320
resin on it like this uh you're asking

544
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:03,319
for trouble hold on so put this one

545
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,079
here

546
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:16,798
okay a fresh card over there sir

547
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,798
Flav all right let's see what we got

548
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,519
here it's fluffy

549
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,879
we get some this

yeah you are aren't

556
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,200
you so we do a little bit caring with

557
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,200
this resin

little pieces the

561
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,120
side so yeah generally will'll card this

562
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,240
up for a little bit it's not a ton

563
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,839
there's maybe a half a gram to 3/4 of a

564
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,079
gram here but we'll card it up and we'll

565
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:46,798
clean it into a nice little pile of full

566
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:48,639
pure heads 99% anyway and we'll dab it

567
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,319
up and then we'll smoke it and then

568
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,919
we'll smoke it and possibly do it all

569
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,798
over again so hope you learned a few

570
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,759
