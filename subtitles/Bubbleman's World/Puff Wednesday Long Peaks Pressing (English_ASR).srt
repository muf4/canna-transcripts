00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,650

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,990

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,820
those of you wondering oh is it better

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,210
than this is it better than that it's

29
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,889
very specifically perfect for commercial

30
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,750
production it's not something that

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,189
you're gonna squish you know a quarter

32
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,049
ounce here and a quarter ounce there

33
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:35,489
we're not but taking it on sweida

34
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,590
squishing it oh we're gonna add squish

35
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,298
that in one shot

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,430
absolutely one shot will do the ounce of

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,890
weed I've got they sent me wonderful

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,549
tools they got big scraper tools here

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,849
specific bags fit inside their plates

40
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,549
they've got these molds here that you

41
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,530
can do pre pressing with if it's real

42
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,540
nice and then of course it's got a

43
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,599
magnetic bottom that pops up cuz it just

44
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,939
a

45
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,039
this is not not to make Roz and

46
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:04,959
obviously this is to pre-press your bag

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,700
sometimes they're big and fluffy and

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,679
they sit better if you can just give it

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,729
a nice little pre-press so I've got the

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,229
two boy 2 by 9 and the 2.5 by 9

51
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:17,379
pre-press which we'll do on camera in a

52
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:19,899
little bit we've got the bags that they

53
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,310
send and the cool little tool here first

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,680
I was like what the hell is this but

55
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,680
very simply put you get your bag on

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,500
there you push that through it flips the

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,870
bag inside out and it puts the seam on

58
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,239
the inside of the bag so it's not gonna

59
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,189
carry and hold the oil when you press it

60
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,009
out of the machine this is very simple

61
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:41,680
but a very very cool little addition I

62
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:44,620
also use it for if you want to pass me

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
that funnel when I get the funnel going

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,489
you can keep that one when I get the

65
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,349
funnel going and you'll see this on

66
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,629
camera in a little bit as well I kind of

67
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,969
I load like this I scooped up the bud

68
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:56,799
and then I use this will just push the

69
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:58,629
body through to fall into the bottom of

70
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,969
the bag and we'll do that ounce in like

71
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,829
seconds so not like with me when I just

72
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:05,349
grab a bud and tighten it up and squish

73
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,629
it very different very different that's

74
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,699
why I was just so kind of like I had to

75
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:12,579
check this out because a for one I like

76
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,619
pressing everyday but yeah sometimes

77
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,299
pressing everyday it's like you get out

78
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,069
it's kind of like cleaning that banger I

79
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,170
think you like 15 minutes you gotta get

80
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,239
a going on prep everything absolutely I

81
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:24,909
press the pound of flour yesterday I got

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,950
ninety four point eight grand return of

83
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:29,530
rosin and I know guys that have blown

84
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:34,108
with butane they get like ninety nine

85
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,500
hundred 496 so what we're saying is

86
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:37,719
don't do it

87
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,979
well yeah you don't unless you really

88
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,959
want to and then that's your prerogative

89
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,959
you know what it works but I'm here to

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,840
do always say oh you don't get as much

91
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,120
when you press yes you do with the

92
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,799
proper equipment exactly and that's the

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,340
problem is all the time we've been kind

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,050
of but

95
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,200
things together not actually having this

96
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,200
proper equipment and it looks like we're

97
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,738
starting to see that happen now yep

98
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,389
excited for that

99
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,780
he's got the timer going which is

100
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:06,369
awesome and this is like the dual

101
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,469
Wallbanger so it's a banger kind of like

102
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,870
inside of a banger and a banger banger

103
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:12,639
the banger and at first I was kind of

104
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,569
like kind of like it's yawning how it

105
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,930
was working the stuff but I'm happy with

106
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:21,639
it it's not just like everything else

107
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,019
you do have a future as bangers old

108
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,490
today you were telling me your chest

109
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,500

110
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,460

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,279
people can't afford $4,000 mothership

166
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:49,620
and for them buying a cheap glass pipe

167
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,879
from some how that's gonna where they're

168
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,560
gonna break it they can't afford

169
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,449
anything else it is what it is you know

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,220
at the same time I like to support glass

171
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,159
artists I love to support guys like

172
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,350
slinger and other artists that I've

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,780
superstone appreciate yours learn about

174
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,610
a few different things and talk to her

175
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,529
and be able to purchase them what I

176
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,439
would say is like piece of history mmm

177
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:12,750
should I look at it because like Dave

178
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,689
would say I got gas glass addicted

179
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,699
syndrome right Dave definitely does have

180
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:19,728
that and he goes how that you know just

181
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,430
being around the glass for

182
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:24,680
to see the the difference in each

183
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,478
individual and just seeing the work that

184
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,418
they do you really start really

185
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,889
appreciating the individual one

186
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:33,019
whatever's going to really see the art

187
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,478
and learning about it I mean I'm just

188
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:40,818
fascinated to find all of this great

189
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:44,120
little products like sinchai strips 25

190
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:46,069
do let the thing right come on that was

191
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,598
the conversation that began the whole

192
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,098
like we're gonna be cool if there were

193
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,870
machines that you could do this with so

194
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:52,338
we are going to press some rosin today

195
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,728
we're gonna press an ounce of Johnny's

196
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,288
buds

197
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,668
we might even press an ounce of my buds

198
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:58,519
afterwards just to do a couple of

199
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:59,990
presses the stuff I have is a solid 20

200
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,740
percent yield err we'll see how this

201
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,418
compares in regards to that and we'll

202
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,588
take you through the flow of the peer

203
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,649
pressure we'll take you through the

204
00:08:06,588 --> 00:08:10,908
recipe and how you set up the machine

205
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:13,309
doing the pre pressing filling the

206
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:15,110
screens and it's really all pretty quick

207
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:17,779
what I do generally is a quick one

208
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,939
single press a couple minutes once I've

209
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:23,120
done that I'll do a second press of the

210
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:24,770
bag for two three minutes and I usually

211
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,588
get like another little bit you know

212
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:32,149
like from 20 grams 25 grams I was

213
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:34,068
getting 4 to 4.5 grams of my first run

214
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,788
then I'd do a second run and get almost

215
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:38,838
a gram

216
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:42,139
thanks like five point four grams of out

217
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,569
of one press so five sounds of it I'm

218
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,698
going to beat I'm shooting for seven

219
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:50,838
times there's 30 grams here I'm hoping

220
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:53,719
for 7.1 grams see what happens I think

221
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,660
it'd be pretty cool wouldn't be bad it

222
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,480
wouldn't be good of you but but it I was

223
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:02,240
just gonna be shooting so 20 second heat

224
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,709
up minute and five second call down that

225
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,709
was perfect it's a perfect

226
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:13,370
one thing I like about it is it's just

227
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:16,810
gonna hit that again yes I figured you

228
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,948
would let me clean it up for you later

229
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:21,018
I've learned is it just have these

230
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:22,429
little bad-mouths um and protecting your

231
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,078
but these little key things and making

232
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,278
sure when you do have a nice pipe you

233
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:36,318
make sure you keep it for the rest of

234
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:38,240
your life you need the scar some

I know what we've been well we have just

311
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:22,460

00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,370
know

327
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,720
it's all gonna be in reality yeah I

328
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,169
guess the stock goes how president

329
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,509
Harmon

330
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:03,009
absolutely I can just see certain the

331
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,588
way I prepare it in the kind of this is

332
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,179
just like I pull this out of a bag of

333
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:12,279
weed I had a quarter pound of the sweet

334
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:17,349
actually like diagrams and I weighed out

335
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:22,570
30 grams because I'm dying to see the

336
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:25,500
difference what we're gonna squish one

337
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,240
squish is all it'll take Johnny

338
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,860
so I got these two tools right here this

339
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,750
is my workflow right here we should be

340
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,129
good I got this one piece in your hair

341
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,980
well there you go you're gonna eat it

342
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:39,070
that's tasty so I get it in the funnel

343
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,659
they're just a matter of poking it

344
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,028
through oops

345
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:47,549
grab that one trying to be like I want

346
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:50,259
to press that a little overzealous there

347
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:53,349
but generally turn it around show them

348
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:56,889
not show them what's going on see see

349
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:02,440
this I'm gonna be feeding now why don't

350
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:04,240
you keep the debug this Sophie got like

351
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,570
this isn't gonna pack the bag a little

352
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:13,419
bit I'll just get it's good stuff all

353
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:15,970
right so I'm not a big presser

354
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:19,000
I always just squished the button that's

355
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:22,570
me yeah yeah I'm never gonna use the

356
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,879
bags I'm really not I have to say this

357
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,680
is much easier in a sense my workflow

358
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,049
really is like this okay fine

359
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:31,269
there's two or three I think it was good

360
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:33,338
but then as we both dropped buds now I

361
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,549
thought you know what I'm not even gonna

362
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:38,709
get this [ __ ] though but like I was

363
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,819
saying I don't really use a bag and

364
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,129
that's only because I'm only bleeding

365
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,850
pressing a couple Grammys named Revlon

366
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:46,250
for

367
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,950
years four years a couple years it's

368
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,539
mean that one who knows finally are

369
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,370
using it on your hair as well they're

370
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:54,049
dumb I'll be straightening this side

371
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,519
I'll be definite the haircut that's

372
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:57,769
Justine all kinds of weird things I was

373
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,480
going for that Justin Bua oh nice nice

374
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:03,039
what I'm kidding

375
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,629
alright go the last little bit in there

376
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:09,529
looking me for so I'd be space like

377
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:11,059
sitting out yeah like 30 to 35 grams I

378
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:14,179
think so perfect

379
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:15,289
guessing over mfab geez big nose yeah I

380
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:17,569
was glad to eat it

381
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:19,159
no I said 30 G's really different just

382
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:23,090
like to me it's that's what it's worth

383
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:26,750
because it's well it is 30 G's 30 grams

384
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:29,780
geez geez sound cheesy buzzing man

385
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,919
probably both cord definitely got this

386
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:36,350
bag stuck to the max so yeah I've never

387
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,939
had the pleasures of squishing anything

388
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,060
really more than they don't probably

389
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:46,610
like helps a weave I just kind of like

390
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:50,389
squishing of course and we've used a 73

391
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:54,980
micron bag 73 micro yeah this one's a 73

392
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:57,100
so then we're gonna go into our pressure

393
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,080
here this is basically what this does

394
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:04,640
let me just drop that in there check

395
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,769
this out yep it's right in there and

396
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:18,820
then I generally just give it one of

397
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:18,819
these it's just nice and pre-pressed

398
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:29,150
prepared I like and now I would always

399
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:30,860
fold these ends over you just well you

400
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,080
can fold it over all you want and it's

401
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:35,149
just gonna pop back over so when we fold

402
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,549
it over is when we put it in the press

403
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,769
we'll bring the plates down we'll slide

404
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,480
this in always leave it up top so you

405
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:43,129
have something to grab the bag out of

406
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,179
it's really a bit more difficult

407
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,330
otherwise you don't want to have it

408
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:51,170
upside down that was a tip that I got

409
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:52,939
from the Sasquatch Ross guys nice so

410
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,769
they do that all the time and I like to

411
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,029
keep it out so it's not like you know

412
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:58,789
when it goes down I don't want that

413
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:00,109
piece of screen over so I'll kind of

414
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:02,029
push it in and make sure that it's

415
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:04,279
really on top of the bag and not at the

416
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:07,549
edge if anything that's at the edge it's

417
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:13,730
gonna absorb Raza okay yeah so I think

418
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:15,678
we should go press this president okay

419
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:28,250
we are here in the bubble man's office

420
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:31,880
aka hash Church central we got the long

421
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,380
press turned on we're going to I'm going

422
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,360
to take John through this really quick

423
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,830
I've turned the plates on here a lot of

424
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,250
people are gonna say that's too hot I

425
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:42,558
press a to xx + 1 50 30 so well they

426
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,759
trust me it's gonna be fine we'll give

427
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,379
it a good check out we have proper

428
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,289
moisture content in our buds and I think

429
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,150
some people are dealing with some very

430
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,859
dried out herb in which case this is way

431
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,380
too hot of a temperature there you go so

432
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:56,779
we're gonna go to recipes and we're

433
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,730
gonna go to the chocolate push which is

434
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:01,490
what I was doing recently we're gonna

435
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,769
change the weight cuz it's 30 grams so

436
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,910
how bad in there we've got the fact that

437
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,849
it's flour material

438
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,880
Keith's hash not available back to flour

439
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:15,049
we've got the bag size set at 2.5 x 9

440
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,530
the micron set is actually 72 microns on

441
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,839
this one

442
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,549
slow tempo the 50% humidity it's

443
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,178
probably even higher isn't a sixty four

444
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:27,049
sixty three sixty three sixty percent

445
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:29,269
okay 62% 62% humidity our heaters are

446
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,210
both on we've got three stages right now

447
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,730
a minute

448
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,309
in a minute but we'll see how the flow

449
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,430
is okay if the flow is over we'll just

450
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:40,859
stop it at stage two so we can go save

451
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:45,360
and run now it's ready to press as you

452
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:49,289
see up here and generally get that set

453
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,899
up so I'm gonna show you a little bit of

454
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:55,680
my workflow I've got my pure Frankie

455
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,350
rosin bags here so here we go right here

456
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,259
here's the bag this bag goes in very

457
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:03,659
nicely right into here I take the top

458
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,549
and I put it into a magnet ice and I put

459
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,110
the bottom right here into the little

460
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:13,109
clip and we've got our bag so what we

461
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:16,979
will do here actually get up to this

462
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:18,539
part will show you that here's our

463
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,640
toggle switch over here that's gonna

464
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,680
give us our pressure we are sitting at a

465
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,990
hundred and forty so we should be good

466
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:29,539
for maximum pressure I'm gonna push both

467
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:32,370
of these five four three two one zero

468
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,109
now it's starting up the fact of how

469
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:36,419
everything comes in together where it's

470
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:44,029
actually showing the micron size to the

471
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:44,029
amount of weight to - that's right now

472
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,390
so now I'm releasing the pressure it's

473
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:52,799
not a hash so you can actually pretty

474
00:20:51,390 --> 00:21:03,900
much release the majority of the

475
00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:05,309
pressure instantaneously so you can see

476
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,160
it coming out right away within 30

477
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,210
seconds is generally when you see it

478
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,410
just lift it up cuz I think we're gonna

479
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:21,870
have some nice flow

480
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:24,240
oh I'm excited yeah nice to squish it's

481
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:25,649
falling you're gonna fall

482
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,390
yeah we're getting a nice flow so this

483
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,570
looks like a solid 15 to 20 percent

484
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:34,200
yield although there's a little bit more

485
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:36,029
flour than I've been squishing make sure

486
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,590
that it's not gonna go off the end of

487
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:40,649
the paper I'll let you be in charge of

488
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:43,500
that actually should be fine lift it up

489
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:47,180
a tiny bit and it'll stuff low will will

490
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:52,950
thicken up and cease very nice thick

491
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:54,660
spots don't seem you have a cell phone

492
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,720
the timer there and everything so just

493
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:07,430
yeah it's done in a minute so far in 45

494
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:09,900
seconds leave it up you have to do this

495
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:13,170
so if you do that there's no way it can

496
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,000
flow but that's a good problem to have

497
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,300
sometimes I'll pull way more of the

498
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,390
paper out as well I kind of there's a

499
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:23,399
couple of ways that I do it sometimes so

500
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:33,210
well this is super exciting because a

501
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:35,400
for one for five days exactly so oh yeah

502
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,319
I guess we could probably stop that soon

503
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,030
the flow looks pretty good

504
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,490
maybe for twos I got a good buddy that

505
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,619
owns one of these that's a thumbs up

506
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,170
it's dripping in the back - this is a

507
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,729
real good producer dude I said this is a

508
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,230
killer producer so I wanted to bring it

509
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,990
here alright so let's check it out we're

510
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,509
gonna stop the press yeah yeah I think

511
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,900
it's pretty good I guess we could leave

512
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:58,539
it

513
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,740
let it finish off whoa yeah and telling

514
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:02,710
you dude there's a bathroom

515
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,930
we have many pack trips whoa many many

516
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,329
back trips that's pretty cool yeah

517
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,230
you'll get lots of chances to take this

518
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:10,230
thing that's cool

519
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:28,480
mmm perfect so we'll stop the press got

520
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:34,329

523
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,730
that would be squish I like the back

524
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,609

528
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,640

529
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:55,899
first all right we're gonna collect I

530
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,060
just collect with a small little

531
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:01,500
highly-educated tool and I'll give you a

532
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:01,500
quick show on how I do that

533
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,129
[Music]

534
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,609
yeah we're about to put this on the

535
00:24:50,808 --> 00:25:00,859
scale to give you guys an idea of what

536
00:24:52,609 --> 00:25:01,849
we got it's great 6 grams from 30 I'm 30

537
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:06,740
that's great

538
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:10,759
oh yeah that's like a solid 20% 2 grams

539
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:13,519
per 10 20 20 20 so it's the same yield I

540
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,829
was getting off the chocolate cush 30 30

541
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,720
20 percent return my straw which is

542
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:19,399
great and you know what generally I

543
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,230
would do a second press just to see

544
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:27,169
what's left well I don't mean we'll do

545
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:28,579
that let's do it 6 grams a solid 20%

546
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:30,500
return and we haven't even done the

547
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:31,789
second press yet we are running out of

548
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,470
the battery on the camera so we're gonna

549
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:34,639
do the second press off the camera but

550
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,289
at the end of the video I'll let you

551
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,809
know if anything came out of that and

552
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,039
I'll photograph it and yeah it looks

553
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:46,039
good actually the last thing I want to

554
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:52,369
do is this I want to get this here for

555
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:54,079
Johnny B come on

556
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:56,119
I saw it sticking too right on the end

557
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,119
right on this end where I was gonna open

558
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:01,299
it there's that's where it's sticking

559
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:03,709
that's awesome

560
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,419
that last little bit off there we don't

561
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,420
need to be leaving resin behind on

562
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,000
parchment paper just ends up being lost

563
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:16,460

564
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:23,660

piece of parchment that you saw fall in

573
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,559

580
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,069
