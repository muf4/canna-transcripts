00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:18,509
yes the episode will start with me

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,970

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,268
doing things a little bit differently

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,900
today as we have a whole new panel of

10
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:34,079
people that I have never invited in so

11
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:38,399
let's start admitting them into the room

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,160
what do you say boys boom boom boom look

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,960

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,328
having you guys sitting in the waiting

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,980
room and all I have to do is click admit

16
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,390
oh let's admit the og of OG shall we you

17
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:59,209

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:01:05,099
man Sam skunk man Sam in the his a

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:07,950
what's going on Sam nothin much I just

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,649
saw that note from you but 10 minutes

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,750
ago so here I am beautiful well thank

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,600
you man today we're gonna sort of focus

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,030
on hash production for the early part of

24
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,379
the show probably mostly bubble but

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,909
we'll talk about some traditional

26
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,859
methods and some mechanical screen

27
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,618
separations and whatnot maybe even a

28
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,959
little bit of hand rub and whatnot I

29
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,250
figured you'd be a great sort of OG to

30
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,379
be in the room because I actually

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,118
invited a whole new fresh panel of

32
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,759
people it will get to introducing them

33
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,368
here in about a minute and and they all

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,188
came from Instagram so there's sort of

35
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:43,618
all up and coming and some are fairly

36
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,179
already substantiate it they have brands

37
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,659
they're doing you know they're they're

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,329
well on their never been on Instagram I

39
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,520
know you haven't which is unbelievably

40
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,879
awesome but you don't need to go on

41
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,578
Instagram Sam your yeah I had to show

42
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,618
you look clone that's also pretty

43
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,599
tripped out that's that's very tripped

44
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,478
out so let's introduce some of our

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,359
panelists here today we've got what

46
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,219
we'll start with with Goldilocks he's at

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,140
the top of the actually let me see if

48
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,500
that's correct yes you are you are at

49
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,409
the

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,840
the queue here bro we know each other

51
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,879
from Instagram briefly having some

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,030
conversations and you were one of our

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,849
customers at Whistler technology for a

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,340
WT 300 getting into a little bit more of

55
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,689
the commercial aspect of water hash and

56
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,030
I want to have that discussion as well

57
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,560
once you kind of you know introduce

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,099
yourself what not I want to get into

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,979
that talk of is there a way the same way

60
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:44,370
you know I guess the argument is can we

61
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:47,340
grow cannabis large-scale and still keep

62
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,009
the quality there skunkman sam says yes

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,870
only because he's done it before so now

64
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,509
the next question is can we still keep

65
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,340
the quality there with hash if we bump

66
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:58,379
up our amounts and we're no longer doing

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,129
little hands third batches but we're

68
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:06,379
rocking 50 60 70 80 kilos of biomass at

69
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:10,560
a time so introduce yourself brother I'm

70
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:13,079
here in Sacramento been making hash for

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,270
a good amount of years now we're kind of

72
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,560
more so focused on rosin now just

73
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,230
because we've been doing such a large

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,509
batch but like you said we are doing

75
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:25,169
large batches with the new whisper check

76
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:27,030
equipment I agree with Sam that we can

77
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,729
do a large batch and keep the quality

78
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,729
just the same as it was with small batch

79
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:36,329
so I think it's just a matter of using

80
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:38,699
the right equipment having the right the

81
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,320
right people running it really yeah well

82
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,238
you guys aren't just you guys are right

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,780
go ahead Sam and the right priorities

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,969
quality always has to come over quality

85
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,979
period absolutely well the I definitely

86
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:57,090
grew that whatever material we're using

87
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:59,189
is definitely the number one factor try

88
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,299
to only use stuff that's are gonna come

89
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:05,909
out good and as long as we're doing that

90
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,819
I have no no issues with our actually

91
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,709
but haven't come out yeah the SOPs are

92
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,319
important to and it's why I've always

93
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,290
found that the the most amazing hash

94
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,139
makers that I've met over the years have

95
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,010
had a background in cooking and as a

96
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,709
chef

97
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,418
chefs really understand the SOPs of a

98
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,769
kitchen there's food safe you know you

99
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,810
don't want to cut with this knife with

100
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,370
the chicken and then cut a

101
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,259
we're here with the fruit and these

102
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,110
simple very simple little things seem to

103
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:35,750
get the mind of a chef prepared for

104
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,120
following steps and not missing those

105
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,279
steps and I find that you know to quote

106
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,360
Sam which is a hilarious quote because I

107
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,819
certainly don't think of them as a

108
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,000
religious man cleanliness is godliness

109
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,589
and it's great if you're using the great

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,209
material and you're doing everything

111
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:52,099
kind of you know you've got the good

112
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:55,430
tools but if there's someone in there

113
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,100
you know throwing that SOP off by not

114
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,900
following simple simple little rules I

115
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,060
mean one that blew me away was back in

116
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,769
the day when the when alec from Essie

117
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,990
labs told me that the oil cos oil

118
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:09,168
company had failed their shatter failed

119
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:12,259
ecoli testing and that's like basically

120
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:14,629
that's some guy who's made the hash and

121
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,969
gone and taken a [ __ ] and not washed his

122
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:19,129
hands properly and come back and dealt

123
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,840
with the product and it's just I mean

124
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:22,939
that's disgusting right off the bat as

125
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,668
generally we are as human beings and

126
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:28,250
that's why the SOPs these standard

127
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:30,949
operating procedures become so very very

128
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,610
important and I'm sure you noticed when

129
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:37,360
you picked up a 300 WT 300 it came with

130
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,129
SOPs out the yin-yang like that thing

131
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,439
yeah I think it did I don't I don't

132
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,000
think we right I don't think I used any

133
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,699
of this refusal big I think we just kind

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,319
of the Whistler guys came down we ran it

135
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,969
once with them and I think we just kind

136
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,680
of winged it from there you know kind of

137
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,660
figured out what worked both for us but

138
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,879
I will say the best hash guys that I

139
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,919
have right now on the crew do have

140
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,560
kitchen experience they all the ones

141
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,478
that made it through like the and we're

142
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,009
still working there are all kitchen have

143
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,168
kitchen experience and they they

144
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:08,709
definitely I think would be right about

145
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:13,459
that that definitely helps that's

146
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:17,719
actually untouched by human hands and I

147
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:20,209
have monkeys doing it here yeah never

148
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,780
past tagged never touched hash tag never

149
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:25,189
touched for sure so thanks Goldilocks in

150
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:28,909
the house I think we're gonna move on

151
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:30,800
over to Bryan for 10 I'm gonna get him

152
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,380
to introduce himself let him let us know

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,900
where he's coming from

154
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,589
can you hear me I can hear you brother

155
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:40,038
okay cool

156
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:40,638
well my name is Bryan I own best friend

157
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,050
farms

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,090
and I'm coming out of me in these days

159
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,249
the last few years

160
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:49,938
feedback from over a decade in the

161
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:55,129
Emerald triangle and I've actually focus

162
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:57,979
on classic cat form so I'm thinking that

163
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,389
we get you know doing some fresh seat or

164
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:00,800
some fresh frozen into sea but

165
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,218
ultimately anything stick you were

166
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,499
balling up very strict regiment with

167
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:10,490
living soil organics that's I'm really

168
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:13,159
flower first and just really enjoying

169
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,400
the beautiful campus flower and it all

170
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:18,348
comes from that it's really about the

171
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,929
flower the new hash platform in the

172
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:22,878
classic technique or way I'm approaching

173
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,990
it is really about personal appreciation

174
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,520
for that type of that form of hash from

175
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,439
geez my dad was making hash for

176
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,329
Christmas parties back in the 70s

177
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,439
starting in Maine so I guess it's kind

178
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:39,978
of like second gen and I aware of the

179
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,370
other processes I pressed for I had an

180
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:45,649
extra rosin Pro younger guy named have

181
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,658
hash that was pressing some really

182
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:49,278
high-end rosin probably five four to

183
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:52,550
five years ago but I've shifted back to

184
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:54,620
the classic form and I don't know just

185
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,000
attention paid to the resin more than

186
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,639
the tax so I guess it's a little

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,408
different and and I'm looking forward to

188
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,500
the new tech coming but I've just really

189
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:05,718
we started with dry resin Stephen first

190
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,360
so the the hash maker who's only a year

191
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:13,819
in under me painting which is it was a

192
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,620
chef that's a new day to click up I that

193
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,838
in him he's like an art as a graphic

194
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,338
artist chef yeah and we'll just call him

195
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:21,110
Tom and he's really just paid the

196
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:24,379
closest attention and then learning the

197
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,139
resin quality through me helping him to

198
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,770
see it we breed half the string and try

199
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:33,349
to feature her company's work as well

200
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:35,448
new strains so yeah I don't know I'm

201
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,430
also I mentioned that I kind of want to

202
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,228
pay attention to the 40-plus crowd not

203
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:42,500
to exclude the younger folks but I'm

204
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,000
pretty this year myself and it's funny

205
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,309
because the younger folks are turning a

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,350
real eye almost sometimes more so on the

207
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:51,198
classic hash form with really wanting to

208
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,300
learn about it as far as temple ball as

209
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,539
far as even some we press some blonde

210
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:58,649
but again

211
00:08:54,539 --> 00:09:01,500
really focus on full mil and the bubble

212
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:05,159
hashing just really turned things for us

213
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,559
and going with it keeping it raw and

214
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,828
trying to just just keep the resin as

215
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,219
good as we can and anyway that's where

216
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:13,379
I'm at

217
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,930
well I love that you're focusing on the

218
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,480
living soil and the flower first I mean

219
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:22,708
we a lot of you won't know this but I

220
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,409
had from the original hash Church 3.0

221
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:27,778
photo I posted on Instagram about three

222
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:29,909
weeks ago I had already planned the show

223
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,350
but in the post I mentioned hey and if

224
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:33,600
you know any great hash makers here on

225
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,069
Instagram I'd love to have you guys

226
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,019
tag those names and that's where

227
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:38,639
everyone who's going to be on the show

228
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,429
today came from they all got tagged

229
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,940
there was actually 48 to 49 people who

230
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:48,629
got tagged and I ended up doing a free

231
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,069
video with about 20 plus of you which

232
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,500
was a really great video and you'll

233
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:55,318
probably notice today as we go through

234
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,720
this that you will hear a lot of people

235
00:09:55,318 --> 00:10:00,208
say exactly what Brian just said in

236
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,970
regards to the soils the living soil

237
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:06,028
that's sort of the bacteria you know

238
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,399
living microbials and and just that

239
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:10,379
living biome in the soil to produce a

240
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,448
resident well yeah to allow that plant

241
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,549
to express itself in a way that that

242
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:16,799
maybe it won't express itself being

243
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:18,599
grown with salt newts so we're

244
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,370
definitely not you know we're not gonna

245
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,560
spend the show shooting on a salt and

246
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,019
you'd grow but I'd definitely always you

247
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,568
know put it put another gold star behind

248
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,789
each person's name as a hash maker and a

249
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:31,828
hash smoker if I know that that person

250
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:33,838
is focused on living soils and they're

251
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:35,429
actually you know focused on proper

252
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,040
cultivars that are that are going to be

253
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:39,299
producing hashish in a way that's a

254
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,698
little bit more special than your

255
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,769
average you know like I said another

256
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:45,419
extra little gold star right there so

257
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,459
thanks for sharing brother all the way

258
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,198
oh I do all the way out in Maine we're

259
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,899
gonna get back to you for sure

260
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:54,359
true hash your hash company bro is in

261
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,139
the house how you doing up I'm good are

262
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,789
you can you hear me

263
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:01,589
we can hear you great man you sound

264
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:03,899
perfect sweet my name is Dakota owner of

265
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:07,920
true hash Co we are based out of Agra

266
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:11,250
California you know we mainly focus on

267
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,979
just selecting cultivars that are resin

268
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,730
rich cultivars you know I'm not much of

269
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,220
a rosin boy you know I've always

270
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,000
preferred smoking melt you know over the

271
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,528
years and mugs you know the way of the

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,828
roots these days and you know we just

273
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:30,539
try and stay true to what we know and

274
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:32,519
what we've learned from you know

275
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,929
sometimes it doesn't always work out you

276
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,528
know you have your strains that you know

277
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:39,269
make more of a full spectrum run or pull

278
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:41,338
and certain microns that aren't as melty

279
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,769
as others and we just really try and

280
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,870
focus on cultivars that pull heavy and

281
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,000
you know you're 90 to 120 range and

282
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,419
there's really that was like our main

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,948
goal this season was just finding very

284
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:59,039
resin rich cultivars just a lot of less

285
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:01,620
work and the whole go around makes life

286
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:06,778
a lot easier especially we can predict

287
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,610
produce a very quality know ya know it's

288
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:11,070
a very important journey but a lot of

289
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,589
people you know there's two schools of

290
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,820
people and I want to be very careful

291
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,190
because I certainly don't want to get

292
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,500
into offending anyone but there and I

293
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,810
said it when when bubble hash first came

294
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,578
out people were blown away by it they

295
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,919
didn't it was so new they thought it was

296
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,828
fake they thought it was a scam and the

297
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,719
only people who saw the magic in it

298
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:34,559
where the people who just happened to

299
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,410
have super high quality hash producing

300
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,729
cultivars that they didn't even know

301
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:40,139
everyone thinks they have great herb but

302
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,050
I'm telling you back in the day I would

303
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,639
sell bags to everyone and super randos

304
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:47,039
would hit me back up from like the

305
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,600
middle of Texas or whatever and send me

306
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,610
a picture of like full melt and be like

307
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,379
is this good like why does it look wet

308
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,019
like I'm not sure if I did it right and

309
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,379
I was just like yeah you did it right

310
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,240
bro and so there's these two schools of

311
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,948
thought the person who made six star

312
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,649
bubble hash the first time they ever

313
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:06,689
made bubble hash generally those guys

314
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,578
are hash makers they're not looking to

315
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,040
create a cultivar that they're gonna

316
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,559
make into hash so that they can take it

317
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,379
and squish it into rosin I don't want to

318
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,909
offend people whose trip is making rosin

319
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,879
rosin is an amazing product that it's

320
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:21,528
awesome I've always just questioned look

321
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,409
if you

322
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:27,828
and get down this pathway and find that

323
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:29,419
six star you may be happy with just that

324
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,099
now there's an enormous amount of cool

325
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:33,099
things we're gonna talk about with rosin

326
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,720
that it that goes beyond and above just

327
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,100
extractions with Rackham's and covert

328
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,959
extracts you're gonna get in here later

329
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,909
records is in the room right now

330
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,619
and talk about you know there THCA

331
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:43,938
separations and they're they're Terps

332
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,470
slurries and they're you know all of

333
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:47,028
these different fractions and how they

334
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,240
can be done and that's awesome and

335
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:52,129
amazing but for myself I won't lie I

336
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,620
have a special place in my heart as well

337
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:57,050
I'm a hash smoker I smoked it for so

338
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,799
many years straight I haven't smoked a

339
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:02,748
joint in 19 years if you can imagine I

340
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,958
haven't smoked a joint of cannabis in 19

341
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:05,449
years

342
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,508
and so that was hash that basically

343
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:10,729
ruined joints for for me I'm gonna move

344
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:13,009
on and we're gonna talk to taste of

345
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,220
Cascadia Scott is in the house how you

346
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:19,039
doing brother man thanks for having me

347
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,569
on absolutely we're happy to have you

348
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,948
once you give everyone a little

349
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,659
background again we're kind of doing a

350
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:25,969
similar thing that we did in the

351
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:28,370
preacher CH video you know just a 3 a 5

352
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,839
a 5 minute or a little more as no

353
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,240
problem we'll go through the list and

354
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:38,019
then oh damn it Bobby's waiting to get

355
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:43,399
in Bobby Bobby damn it Bobby

356
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:46,039
late as usual so yeah I started out

357
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,558
probably like mid-2000s just watching

358
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,219
hashes with homies out in the hills of

359
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,500
Portland

360
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,259
or the country of Portland I should say

361
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,600
and you know we were back then we were

362
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,550
drying on cardboard that was the tech

363
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,540
because it was a desiccant not her

364
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:06,409
natural desiccant you know been washing

365
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:09,198
year or four years everything from you

366
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:13,610
know old ball getting a little feedback

367
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:16,909
from Bobby cool there we go

368
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:20,178
yeah used to manage a big garden a big

369
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:22,399
old OMP garden and used to process all

370
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:24,740
their trim so you know was processing

371
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,610
probably like 10 to 20 pounds of dry

372
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:31,808
trim back in the day and really

373
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,680
developed everything from dry trim to

374
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:37,539
fresh frozen

375
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,729
yeah most recently been doing everything

376
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:42,219
single source like Dakota was saying

377
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:46,180
basically searching out those good

378
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:48,550
cultivars that only do good for six star

379
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:52,809
they crush everything out for both melt

380
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:54,399
flavor too high the yield and finish

381
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,638
time so that's another good thing is if

382
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,169
it's done in 56 or around 56 days it

383
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,310
definitely helps out because you know

384
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:05,708
time is money yeah most recently I also

385
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:09,039
started a six star society a clothing

386
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:11,739
company to kind of focus on gear to wear

387
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,480
while washing so you know stuff it

388
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,649
doesn't pill up stuff that doesn't hold

389
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,920
on to dog hair

390
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,809
yeah and just focusing on that lifestyle

391
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,448
that's what I love I love like you said

392
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:24,939
I love smoking hash and it's my passion

393
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:26,528
I love the plant I love that Scott I

394
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,560
love that you're doing a clothing line

395
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:32,350
called 6 star that's that's great and I

396
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,929
love the idea of of just producing you

397
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,310
know it's and it should go for growers

398
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:38,409
as well you know I have a hard time

399
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:40,388
watching people go into grow rooms and

400
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:42,309
and finger-fuck their plants and sees

401
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,198
the plants and then and walk by them

402
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:46,119
with cotton shirts and I'm a macro

403
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,219
photographer so I'm going into that

404
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,379
plant in a way that nobody can possibly

405
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,470
imagine and when I see all their heads

406
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:55,448
gone like just all it is is stalks like

407
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,490
this like in the plan there's no heads

408
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:59,649
left because they brush the plant so

409
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:02,560
many times or the heads are all broken

410
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:05,349
or worse there's just like large fibers

411
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:09,609
cotton in like synthetic rayon and I'm

412
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,219
just like out of the hash that's what

413
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:13,808
that's not even taking us into

414
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,669
beneficial bugs which consume all the

415
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:19,269
bad bugs and then turn them into [ __ ]

416
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:22,089
balls on your plants so yeah well even

417
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:25,000
fans I mean extra agitation from fans

418
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:28,149
that can create more degradation or more

419
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,210
need for the trichome to produce a waxy

420
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,860
head less melty you know so yeah and and

421
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,110
Eric nug shots is a good buddy of mine

422
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:36,939
so it's always been helpful to reference

423
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:38,319
talk to him like hey have you seen what

424
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,200
have you seen you know blah blah blah

425
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:43,808
just just chat pastor and chat trichomes

426
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,940
with him because it's super awesome to

427
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:47,250
be able to see his his work and to see

428
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,970
that try come on

429
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:54,359
a macro level and understand it on on

430
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:57,059
its level and it's you know on like math

431
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,219
like super small level yeah super big

432
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:02,549
shout-out to Eric for sure taking it to

433
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,339
the next level as a hash maker being a

434
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,230
macro photographer for me was essential

435
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:09,689
learning about all these things I mean I

436
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,460
did have an advantage of having Sam in

437
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,190
my corner and being able to ask him

438
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,289
questions and and be a mentor to me but

439
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,019
at the same time when I started taking

440
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:21,389
photographs and seeing you know a cystal

441
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:23,279
of hair or a capitate stock trichome or

442
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,110
a bulbous trichome or all these other

443
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,629
sort of anomalies that exist in the

444
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:30,779
plant i really started looking at the

445
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,880
plant quite differently and yeah it's

446
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,490
helped shape my perspective as a hash

447
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,950
maker just from being a photographer so

448
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,930
yeah good point on that and good to have

449
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,990
someone like Eric who's really at the

450
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:45,120
top of the game right now taking some of

451
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,250
the most beautiful macro photographs

452
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,179
that's amazing have ever really been

453
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,799
seen so shout out to Eric thanks Scott

454
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,210
let's get to our sideways boys who

455
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,609
aren't sideways anymore they were

456
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,170
sideways they came in like this and it

457
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:00,389
was kind of fun I was like all right

458
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,509
cool those guys are so cool they could

459
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,830
come in upside-down for all I care

460
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:07,049
there's two of us I was trying to get it

461
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:08,429
horizontal you know I totally feel I

462
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,589
knew exactly where you were coming from

463
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,720
dude but thank you that heavy ice and

464
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:15,539
great lake grease in the house these

465
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,660
guys are a big inspiration to me I love

466
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,759
what they're doing we went into more

467
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,040
personal stories last time which was

468
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,019
really we might get into that a little

469
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,569
bit later that sort of was the you know

470
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,670
you get the profound aspect of well how

471
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:33,509
are these guys so passionate like what

472
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,400
led them to to have to find the best and

473
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:37,049
to you know want to grow all their own

474
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,730
inputs and want to start producing their

475
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,369
own food so why don't you guys do a

476
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:47,089
little introduction heavy ice and great

477
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:54,139
lake grease in the house first well we

478
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:58,019
we focus on natural growing and we like

479
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:00,690
we like to think of going beyond just

480
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:05,069
the term organics

481
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:10,700
because it's kind of such a broad term

482
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:14,669
nowadays if you can imagine you know

483
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,980
what what exactly does organic mean and

484
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,220
with the amount of products that are

485
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:26,549
labeled organic nowadays and things like

486
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:33,809
that it's hard to really it's hard to

487
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:36,720
compare that to using the things that we

488
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:40,919
have around us outside in nature the the

489
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:44,610
local herbs the local the local plants

490
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,400
the local mushrooms and we can we can

491
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:52,949
use these things to to feed the plants

492
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:55,259
and feed the soil and it's really hard

493
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,130
to compare the two so we really like to

494
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:05,009
just we really focus on beyond organics

495
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:08,060
and we have definitely found with our

496
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:10,680
resin and the few people that we know

497
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,210
and there's a lot of other people that

498
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,779
we don't know out there that are growing

499
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:19,430
this way that it really produces amazing

500
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:24,240
amazing resin an amazing amazing hash

501
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:26,460
and we we love sun-grown

502
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,920
resin that's another thing that we've

503
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:37,259
noticed in it just seems like the

504
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:42,350
sun-grown resin is comparatively from

505
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,349
from my experience like tur pure and

506
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,220
like I would usually I've gotten like

507
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,619
really transparent hash we've gotten

508
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,960
transparent hash from indoor resin but a

509
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:56,699
lot of times when I was washing into our

510
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,990
resin it was it was it was melt it was

511
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,190
coming out clean but it wasn't

512
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:04,140
necessarily coming out fully transparent

513
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,630
so that that's one way so just just

514
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:10,560
certain things we love about sun-grown

515
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:12,780
resin and we love hash

516
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,638
we will Rosen the stuff that don't melt

517
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:17,058
but

518
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:20,028
we weave that's our focus is on the

519
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:21,828
resin I think for both of us Erin will

520
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:25,578
probably mention this that our our

521
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:28,999
passion for growing actually really

522
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:31,338
started on wanting to produce really

523
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:34,459
really good hash and we couldn't really

524
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:36,648
find it and couldn't find material that

525
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:40,999
produced like really really good hash so

526
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:43,038
it's like you got a got to grow it where

527
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:45,139
did you guys get exposed to really good

528
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,700
hash was it an Instagram thing where you

529
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:49,338
would go online and see or were you

530
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:53,838
prior to that like on a website or

531
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:58,368
something well I saw I mean in in my

532
00:22:53,838 --> 00:23:03,408
high school days I'm I mean I'm half his

533
00:22:58,368 --> 00:23:07,658
age but in my high school days I you

534
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:10,789
know I I was I got hash and it was

535
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:13,369
bubble hash but at what you know it was

536
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:15,888
it was brick hash and it was you know it

537
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:21,168
would clear dome but it was not melts

538
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:23,718
you know and I always loved it and I

539
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:25,879
always got the High Times magazines so I

540
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:29,149
was always really passionate about resin

541
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:31,638
and we would grope like hide plants in

542
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:33,978
my backyard and stuff like that and like

543
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:40,248
I was always really passionate about the

544
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:43,308
resin and the the cannabis plant and it

545
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:45,709
was it was it was definitely Instagram

546
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:49,969
and your YouTube channel and a few other

547
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:55,190
YouTube channels that exposed me to full

548
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:58,099
melt I can't remember specifically the

549
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:02,690
first the first you know thing that I

550
00:23:58,098 --> 00:24:06,288
saw but in my case I think it was your

551
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:09,558
YouTube channel I was already a medical

552
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:11,450
patient and I had smoked way more flour

553
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,819
than I ever wanted to smoke in my entire

554
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,700
life trying to get the dose I needed and

555
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:18,229
I had you know the BHO when it showed up

556
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,969
and I did a little bit of that for a

557
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:21,889
while and like the bigger dose but

558
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:27,590
didn't like the side effects of poorly

559
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:30,079
made petrochemical extracts and

560
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:32,389
a heavy thing weren't you during this

561
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,099
time Aaron like wasn't this during your

562
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,380
getting off Pharma and losing all your

563
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:38,178
weight and literally switching your life

564
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,520
like a hundred and eighty degrees yeah

565
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:42,559
it was a complete turnaround at the time

566
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,750
with everything my diet and you know

567
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,908
getting out and exercising more and the

568
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,548
cannabis and everything almost looking

569
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:52,820
for opiate effects from from cannabis

570
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:55,190
right I mean that's why the extracts

571
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:57,230
were so appealing initially because you

572
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,960
know they hit a lot harder than you know

573
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,909
taking ten minutes to smoke a joint or

574
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,590
something like that but yeah it was just

575
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:05,870
uh it was really watching your YouTube

576
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:08,269
channel while I was buying all the

577
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:10,759
flowers in the BHO and I had a caregiver

578
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:13,009
at the time too that never even gave me

579
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,629
one trichome of material but I was I

580
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:17,179
kept telling him yeah I want to make

581
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,399
hash like you can I can buy an ounce of

582
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:23,210
flowers from you but I'm not really

583
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:25,099
gonna do me any good so just just from

584
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,528
watching you and I I knew that I had to

585
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:30,288
grow in order to make hash cuz nobody

586
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:32,329
was gonna give me material and I I even

587
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:34,849
tried to buy material trim and things

588
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:37,428
like that and everybody was charging me

589
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:41,329
way too much so I finally had to grown

590
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:42,890
this well I'll tell you if you guys

591
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:44,389
aren't following them already as it

592
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,980
should follow all of these guys will

593
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,288
drop all the instagram names at one

594
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,630
point in time but I've been watching a

595
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,819
heavy eyesore for some time it's just

596
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,340
been a joy to watch him like literally

597
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:57,918
like just go from the sort of non

598
00:25:55,339 --> 00:26:01,730
heaviest person you could possibly be

599
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:06,860
like to like the head he went from like

600
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:10,579
a 25 micron know melt sulfur thing to of

601
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:12,379
living soil 90 microns full melt clear

602
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:15,379
dome watching the reflection of himself

603
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,909
while he puffs it in the ball I like it

604
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,010
dude I like your story and I think you

605
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,778
should yeah and it's been like what like

606
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:23,210
how many years has it been it doesn't

607
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:26,058
seem like it's been that long no I think

608
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:30,590
I think my first grow was like 2014 or

609
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:32,418
20 2014 I think maybe 2013 we will get

610
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,099
into a little bit more of what Great

611
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,809
Lakes was talking about at one point in

612
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,178
time once we've introduced everyone and

613
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:38,308
that's

614
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:40,320
regards to this beyond organics and of

615
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:41,970
course with our regular panelists

616
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,220
dragonfly earth medicine that's that's

617
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,139
their whole trip is to produce your

618
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,850
inputs because for people that are kind

619
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:51,240
of wondering well what what is Beyond

620
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:53,368
Organic Beyond Organic is not opening up

621
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,649
an organic farm and then draining the

622
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:57,148
aquifers for the entire surrounding

623
00:26:55,648 --> 00:27:00,118
neighborhood because you didn't plan to

624
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:02,908
catch water the winter before producing

625
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:05,398
your inputs on your farm so you have to

626
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:07,860
put less in to get more out is what

627
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:10,888
organic living soil is all about and big

628
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:13,769
AG is all about putting more inputs from

629
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:15,928
outside of your farm on each year and

630
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:17,940
getting less out each year so these are

631
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:19,950
the sort of things that were that we're

632
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,840
discussing and of course with with Sam

633
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,139
in the room we all know Sam's history

634
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,759
he's probably you know grown a lot more

635
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:28,979
cannabis than all of us combined

636
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,950
probably even just for one or two of his

637
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,628
his years of his life he has grown an

638
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,569
enormous amount of cannabis and I think

639
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:38,609
as a hash maker if you can have that

640
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:40,859
relationship where you understand how to

641
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:43,788
grow cannabis and how to choose vinos

642
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:46,199
and how to start sort of looking for

643
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:48,028
things that you know like Sam didn't

644
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,399
just take cultivars and start making

645
00:27:48,028 --> 00:27:53,669
hash and looking for one that works

646
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:56,699
Sam was breeding cannabis to make a

647
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:59,220
product that works in in the end product

648
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,990
like hash so that's that is also you

649
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,169
know I look up to that a great deal

650
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:06,210
I grew but I've been you know I never

651
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:09,840
really grew on the level that I was able

652
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,669
to make an effect in you know producing

653
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,109
hash producing cultivars which I also

654
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:16,169
want to talk about at one point in time

655
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:18,178
I want us all to share our favorite hash

656
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:20,129
producing cultivars very important

657
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,990
information for everyone and I know

658
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:24,118
people want to hold on to their tips and

659
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,308
little things like this as this industry

660
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:28,558
becomes more more and more real but

661
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:30,480
sharing is caring and not not telling

662
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,668
someone a cultivar that produces hash

663
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,669
because you are greedy and a douchebag

664
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,230
as well greedy and douchebaggery so we

665
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:38,269
won't be doing that today on hash Church

666
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,319
we'll be sharing our information

667
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:42,210
especially when it comes to cultivars

668
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,339
and we're gonna move over to two other

669
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,970
awesome dudes will sauce winery and

670
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:49,569
resin ranch extraction welcome gentlemen

671
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,120
welcome welcome

672
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:54,639
you guys are muted so I need that button

673
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:57,009
and one him go first this time yeah no

674
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,520
problem dude good to see you look thanks

675
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,129
for having us

676
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,349
how's it going it's going great man this

677
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,900
is the hash episode of hash Church and

678
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:09,189
we're talking about hash so I'm pretty

679
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,800
happy yeah so uh ya know I got my start

680
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:16,390
in Seattle and we're kind of learn to

681
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:20,049
grow and make hash up there about seven

682
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:22,570
eight years ago now and it's been rockin

683
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:26,500
my own kind of single source hash for a

684
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:29,439
while and moved down to California about

685
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,269
two years ago and started a prop 64

686
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,360
recreational brand under fully melted

687
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:39,519
and been running big 30 kilo runs of

688
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:43,419
material through a proprietary machine

689
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,490
we've made totally like bagless system

690
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,470
and running that for the past couple

691
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,750
months and been and they're calling

692
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,339
clean melt out of it yeah like that I

693
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,470
want to hear more about that for sure

694
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:55,089
you know we've been we've been trying

695
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,610
our hardest definitely to produce you

696
00:29:55,089 --> 00:30:00,490
know good melt we entered some Melton in

697
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:03,819
Emerald cup and been putting some melt

698
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:08,710
out on the market as well as good job

699
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:11,379
better dry we do all fresh frozen so

700
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,559
luckily I have a cultivation partner up

701
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:17,650
in southern Humboldt and we grow all

702
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:19,809
greenhouse in two different places and

703
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,140
like braceland and kind of salmon Creek

704
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:25,569
area and then we put all the greenhouse

705
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,450
whole plant fresh frozen all toward our

706
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:32,769
ash material for fully melted beautiful

707
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,420
that's what's up I want to hear more

708
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,180
about your machine as well down the road

709
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,550
I'm sure that's another conversation

710
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:42,039
yeah yeah absolutely well you know what

711
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:45,009
he's got going on yeah I keep it pretty

712
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,440
low-key just we've been you know doing a

713
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:50,289
lot of testing and a lot of you know

714
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,120
just other things to kind of push the

715
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,420
hash game other than just a big machine

716
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:56,769
washing a lot like post-production

717
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,570
changes and how we just treat the hatch

718
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:00,849
and stuff like that so it's been

719
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:02,139
interesting beautiful well like I said

720
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:03,219
we definitely will have a conversation

721
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,870
about that because

722
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,850
this is this is where we're at right now

723
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:08,408
we're at the innovation part and you

724
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,649
know there has not been an enormous

725
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:13,330
amount of innovation in water extraction

726
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:16,019
almost since the beginning it's still

727
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:19,089
very much like water and ice and and

728
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,529
cannabis and filtering it through you

729
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:22,720
know something whether you're using

730
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:25,058
gravity like Reinhardt Delft use back in

731
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,240
the 90s or whether you you know or Saudi

732
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:30,190
Sands water extraction secret from back

733
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,319
in the day or whether you're using a bag

734
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,240
system or whether you're using a you

735
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,269
know like a delta separation frenchie

736
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,159
unit or even a Whistler Tek WT 300

737
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:41,230
there's been a few other people who have

738
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,820
I'm very in a very unique position in

739
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,558
all of this because generally if someone

740
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,339
creates a machine or invents a new way

741
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,200
of doing it

742
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:49,480
I'd say nine out of ten of those people

743
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,860
email me and we're gonna have and want

744
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,900
to have a discussion about it and I'm

745
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:55,178
always super down in sign NDA's and

746
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:59,080
whatnot and just I'm really excited

747
00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:03,460
about maintaining the melt aspect of

748
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:05,139
hash while running commercial amounts

749
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,480
you know being able to get to a point

750
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:11,890
where there should be no reason why we

751
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,980
can't scale this up to a point where the

752
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:17,080
integrity of the wash is not affected I

753
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,538
mean it's not it's not rocket science

754
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:21,339
you know resin glands sink in water due

755
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:24,069
to their due to their being affected by

756
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:26,889
gravity because your biggest factor that

757
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:29,200
I see in I've seen and I think he can

758
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,169
attest to is the cleanliness of the

759
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,009
material going in is kind of the biggest

760
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:38,700
factor and worked up and humbled Mendo

761
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:42,250
with a lot of outdoor farms that can be

762
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,710
very difficult definitely a struggle and

763
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,390
yeah I mean coming from comma education

764
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,220
background as an economics

765
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:51,640
I've always been focused on like how can

766
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,679
we make bubble hash like more reach the

767
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,440
economies of scale so that we can get

768
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,720
you know most of the market hopefully

769
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,730
smoking like good clean solvent less

770
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,190
residue or at least get them access to

771
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,990
it so if they want to choose it it's

772
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,620
there for them yeah it's not an

773
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:14,019
exorbitant price like you know $180 a

774
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:16,058
gram or Belle you know after taxes that

775
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:17,048
hits home that was before tax week with

776
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:19,269
Johnny B and I on

777
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:23,200
last putt two puffs when did Wednesdays

778
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:25,058
ago we bought a gram of rosin it was it

779
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,548
was organically grown from Whistler and

780
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:31,538
turned into bubble hash in the WT 300

781
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:36,009
and then pressed into rosin but 180

782
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:38,440
dollars a gram and [ __ ] was hurtin I

783
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:40,839
mean my god I was bummed out with the

784
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,639
black market prices prohibition and that

785
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:45,788
was generally created based on someone

786
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,258
doing 10 years in prison so I'm not

787
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:49,419
quite sure how these prices are

788
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:51,429
according to the legal market but

789
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:53,139
hopefully they they you know they they

790
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,109
figure it out and I'm sure with people

791
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:57,339
like yourself and with with our our own

792
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:59,769
company Entwistle technologies and

793
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:03,308
others working on getting this scale

794
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:05,079
problem fixed so you can still pull that

795
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:06,278
quality that purity because that's

796
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:08,588
really what it's about it's not about

797
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:10,449
quality about purity when you make water

798
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,969
hash the purity has already been

799
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:15,730
produced the the grower and the genetics

800
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:19,000
did that we don't make pure our quality

801
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:20,889
we just purify it we unveil what is or

802
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,989
isn't there and that's what we do is

803
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,789
hash makers and that's why for me I've

804
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:27,279
always appreciated the humble hash maker

805
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:29,558
the one that understands his his or her

806
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,419
place is that you know sure yeah I have

807
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:34,960
some skills and I'm doing a good job but

808
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:37,239
my the timeline of me making hash is

809
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,338
very short compared to the timeline of

810
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,759
someone growing a three-month crop in a

811
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:45,128
greenhouse oh my god can you imagine

812
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,960
that the the [ __ ] that the grower had to

813
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:49,449
deal with over three months and then I

814
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,039
come in and I process it all and I post

815
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:55,118
it on Instagram and everyone's like oh

816
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:57,849
yeah man yeah see what he did wow what

817
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,798
an amazing it's like come on as hash

818
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:01,809
makers we got to stay humble I feel like

819
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:04,088
all hash makers gotta at least try their

820
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:07,450
hand at growing to so they know they

821
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:09,659
know the the realities of what that

822
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:12,759
means and also I think it really

823
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:16,118
enlightens kind of your whole aspect of

824
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,000
how to treat material and you know how

825
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:22,180
to process better how to not you're far

826
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,190
more better on what to do I had a same

827
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:26,259
idea for people who drove I thought

828
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,568
everyone who drove a car should be

829
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,190
forced to drive a moped or a motorcycle

830
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:31,480
for the first year of their license so

831
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,360
they can be expose

832
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,740
to the dangers of driving a car

833
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,660
cluelessly you know because when you're

834
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:39,129
in a car you feel this protection and

835
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:41,139
when someone's just giving you your trim

836
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,910
in your bud you're protected it's like

837
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,769
oh yeah like I got all this coming in

838
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:48,009
over here you know the whole reason

839
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:49,960
bubbleman became a name was not only

840
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,210
because I had access to make water hash

841
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,480
before most people but because I had

842
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:58,000
access to incredible quality flour had I

843
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,769
not had that access people would not

844
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,289
have thought what they thought about me

845
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:03,610
and and I noticed often it was oh yeah

846
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:05,230
he's got the quality he's got the

847
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,450
quality it's like well yeah so I have a

848
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,159
good nose I'm able to find quality that

849
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:10,989
certainly doesn't mean my [ __ ] doesn't

850
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,029
stink and it certainly doesn't mean that

851
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:14,859
I'm better at this than anyone else and

852
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,870
the whole purpose of teaching people how

853
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,120
to make water hash over the years was

854
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:22,750
that anyone could do it as well as

855
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,519
anyone now there is no special oh you're

856
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,650
mat you're a magician you know no one

857
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,840
can make it as well as you can man the

858
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:31,450
first couple of years into making water

859
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,160
hash my mum who was like worked for the

860
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:34,269
police at the time came over to my house

861
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,670
and I was like I want you to make a

862
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:38,800
batch of bubble hash and she like mixed

863
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,000
it up and did a five gallon batch I gave

864
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,760
her the material and we called it

865
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,269
Pauly's melt because he came out six

866
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,910
star

867
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:47,860
my mom made six star the first time she

868
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:52,480
ever made hash and she was like the

869
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:55,960
Straight ease of the straight e it's in

870
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,809
the genes exactly the plant genomes my

871
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,579
little spiel since I have a completely

872
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:03,460
different come up story than this guy we

873
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:05,710
just live close together become good

874
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,530
friends over the last few years do some

875
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,599
work together but uh I kind of started

876
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,420
out just doing little little girls in

877
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,610
Wisconsin in my basement and I was open

878
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,820
blast and stuff and watching phone to

879
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:21,309
you on YouTube and it was like [ __ ] you

880
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:24,309
can dab water hash and dry sift like

881
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:27,519
what's this you know and actually the

882
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:30,250
first hash that I ever dabbed that was

883
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,500
melty was dry sift forgot to mention

884
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,389
that last time I got my come up actually

885
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,400
as a dry sniff guy

886
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:38,889
Kuban gave me a shout-out here on hash

887
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,769
Church few years back after I gave him

888
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:43,809
some dry sifted emerald cup 2015 and

889
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:44,719
that's kind of really what opened the

890
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:48,320
doors for me

891
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,389
and you know one to emerald cups the

892
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,240
next year and we had a little problem

893
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:55,940
with coming up dirty after and got those

894
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:58,368
taken away but it was all just a big

895
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,019
learning lesson because year after that

896
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:03,800
at the Mendo hideout we ended up getting

897
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:06,650
DM DM certification so he completely

898
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,599
turned things around at that spot not

899
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,579
that we were really being dirty we were

900
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,580
only spraying organic at the time which

901
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:16,098
you know everybody was there's no shame

902
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:18,650
in learning and I appreciate being

903
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:22,369
honest because people are so fake and

904
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:24,889
shallow these days they want to post the

905
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:27,289
fake beautiful Instagram photo with none

906
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:29,170
of the reality being lost over a third

907
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:32,090
of our crop to russet lights that year

908
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,220
refreshing to hear you be honest men you

909
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:35,900
know and I kind of the naturals

910
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:40,098
transition I had been making water hash

911
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:42,920
too and running a big a big farm dry

912
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:45,140
sieve just kind of was a lot harder to

913
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,760
scale up and kind of keep up with so I

914
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:48,829
kind of just transitioned over to the

915
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,280
water hash and then naturally fell into

916
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:54,679
the rosin as a byproduct of our runs

917
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,690
that weren't full melt well the first

918
00:38:54,679 --> 00:39:00,379
the first the first melt I ever smoked

919
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:03,108
funny enough was also sift and it was in

920
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,838
1995 and Amsterdam my first cannabis cup

921
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:08,210
and someone somehow I ended up smoking a

922
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,759
little bowl of skunkman sands dry sift

923
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:13,400
and I'll never forget Rob Clark standing

924
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,930
on the stairs of this Thai restaurant

925
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,570
that we were at do you remember the Thai

926
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:25,549
restaurant Sam with all the lady boys as

927
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:27,440
waitresses it's no it's not it's not but

928
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,660
this was this was a very strange

929
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,929
Thai food restaurant that had all lady

930
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:34,759
boys as as the as the waitresses and it

931
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:37,429
was just a place you could smoke hash in

932
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,839
Amsterdam and thought people are cool we

933
00:39:37,429 --> 00:39:40,879
don't give a [ __ ] with people choose

934
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:43,009
with with their lifestyles and it was

935
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,079
great food and so I'm hitting this bowl

936
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:48,349
on the stairs of this restaurant and I

937
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,659
hear Rob say if it don't bubble it ain't

938
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:53,240
worth the trouble and I watched the hash

939
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:56,420
melt through the screen and drip down

940
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:58,309
the stem of the pipe making me cry a

941
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,670
little bit because I was like knowing I

942
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,230
wasn't

943
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,760
gonna be smoking that hash that made it

944
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:05,659
all the way down to the to the Ruhr

945
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,840
downstem for for over three years almost

946
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:10,909
four years it was three I tried to

947
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,800
recreate that and I tried to make that

948
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:15,889
and it wasn't until getting turned on to

949
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,960
water extraction that I actually made my

950
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:20,929
own product that melted and bubbled into

951
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,659
a liquid and when I first posted my

952
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:26,359
company bubble bags fresh headies and

953
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:28,609
the and I and I chose to use the logo or

954
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,599
the the motto if it don't bubble it

955
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,180
ain't worth the trouble and that's

956
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,989
really I had seen Sam and bumped into

957
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:38,629
him and in particular back there and he

958
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:40,099
was very very strong-willed in mind it

959
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,380
he was almost like a professor that was

960
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:43,880
just so above it's like if you were the

961
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,349
best kid in the class maybe the

962
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,610
professor's gonna talk to you but if you

963
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:48,799
were like the middle kid in the class

964
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:52,130
the professor wasn't talking to you so

965
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,930
with me running into Cuban I had my like

966
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,789
oh this is Cuban he's the tricep guy I

967
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:58,399
got out you know gift him some hash and

968
00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:01,309
see what he thinks and they have him

969
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,019
then chase me down and be like bro do

970
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:05,299
you have any idea what you even have

971
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:08,690
here you know and I honestly had no clue

972
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:15,650
I know my well imagine Sam's been

973
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:18,110
smoking that for about 35 to 40 guy but

974
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:20,480
now we're all noobs yeah we're all work

975
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,570
what what's really gonna change the

976
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,329
industry across the board I mean once

977
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:29,030
you've got great quality of genetics

978
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:31,719
that makes hash easy gives a good yield

979
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:35,500
and you're growing it organically or

980
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:39,459
biodynamically or super or whatever way

981
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:42,110
then what's going to change the field is

982
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,990
automated processing so you'll be able

983
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:47,329
to make the highest-quality

984
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:50,989
continuous operation so no fun for

985
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:53,420
batches you just produce it by the ton a

986
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:56,750
day and now Sam you'd be the guy to ask

987
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,970
because you know I'm not I'm I would I

988
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,869
would say from what I've seen I'm

989
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:04,369
probably the closest to Cubans

990
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:06,920
cleanliness of dry sift is you're gonna

991
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:12,409
get without being Cuban do you think

992
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:15,798
that that is scalable to that point oh I

993
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:18,440
it's capable by cleanliness I presume

994
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:23,838
you're talking about where the resin

995
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:27,798
heads is 99.9 ever you know we get you

996
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:31,659
know it's a 99.9 you know it's like he

997
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:31,659
truly it's just resin heads

998
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:37,569
[Music]

999
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:44,989
I hope he's called it 99.999% on Sam's

1000
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:46,909
and keep in mind like no one had seen

1001
00:42:44,989 --> 00:42:49,308
this product until I photographed a

1002
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:52,219
product you wouldn't tell me you gotta

1003
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:53,960
you gotta try Sam's dry oh just me it

1004
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:55,548
was the strongest thing I've ever tried

1005
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,889
in my life and because there's a

1006
00:42:55,548 --> 00:42:59,960
difference Kuban makes incredible drive

1007
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:02,088
shaft and he's got a great breeder Sam's

1008
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,130
unique because he lived in all the house

1009
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:06,108
she's producing countries he collected

1010
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,269
seeds he bred those seeds in the hash

1011
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:11,119
producing cultivars he grew those seeds

1012
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:13,068
he made hash that's the [ __ ] Holy

1013
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:20,000
Grail right there if you're doing that

1014
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:24,079
you are gold enough a lot of varieties

1015
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,969
which didn't really pan out because they

1016
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:31,880
yielded poor you know was it not started

1017
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:33,798
what can I say I say I say I'm the first

1018
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,460
guy to say that I kind of got lucky in

1019
00:43:33,798 --> 00:43:39,920
the sense that the first thing I ever

1020
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,960
tried sifting was an incredible dry sift

1021
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,170
strain I'll still say that five six

1022
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,150
years later so I I don't think I would

1023
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,119
have gotten to where I got if I hadn't

1024
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:51,789
got kind of lucky that first try

1025
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,670
everybody should contribute the

1026
00:43:51,789 --> 00:44:00,049
varieties but they make incredible

1027
00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:03,579
drysuit because that's a resource that

1028
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:09,469
the whole world could actually use also

1029
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:14,000
number one DNA Sleestak and actually a

1030
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:15,768
DNA strain it was a training day yeah it

1031
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,679
was a training day I can't remember what

1032
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:20,750
the cross is on that and uh yeah I grew

1033
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:23,268
up about 20 seeds and found one that I

1034
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,969
liked and it just worked and I ended up

1035
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:29,439
losing that but

1036
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:34,389
III like dry sip from plants with you

1037
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,159
drop I sure and then get the res no you

1038
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:38,409
just look at it funny and they fall off

1039
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,899
yeah pretty much

1040
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:43,929
you touch it and you're done you're also

1041
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,670
growing all biodynamic organics living

1042
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:49,889
soil so yeah keep them doing that

1043
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:52,360
forever yeah yeah I've uh you know

1044
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:54,429
that's pretty much myself to I'm trying

1045
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,930
to do as much single source as I can

1046
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:58,599
there's I have like two or three other

1047
00:44:55,929 --> 00:45:01,449
farms that I'll wash for and they they

1048
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:06,269
all are KNF you know it's closed loop as

1049
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:11,109
they can kind of style not getting

1050
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:14,800
noticed that bigger plant so the same

1051
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:18,730
clone but grown twelve feet tall has

1052
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:23,620
bigger residents on it then that same

1053
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:24,969
plant you know six inches tall yeah I

1054
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:26,949
don't know how many people have actually

1055
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:29,259
grown twelve footers on this panel raise

1056
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:31,929
your hand well I will say this Sam yes

1057
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,940
and no I have noticed that in certain

1058
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:34,509
cultivars in like Europe and North

1059
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,690
America

1060
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,130
however I've seen quite the opposite on

1061
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:42,820
cultivars like the Mullen B&amp;B madness

1062
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:44,829
grown in Australia grown 12 to 18 feet

1063
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,350
you know twelve feet tall and 18 feet

1064
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:51,219
wide from the mall a madman and all the

1065
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:53,650
best heads were in the 25 to 45 micron

1066
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:55,179
range which was more healed son yeah I

1067
00:45:53,650 --> 00:46:01,389
couldn't wrap my head around it it was

1068
00:45:55,179 --> 00:46:04,359
just like Markus's that be if they grow

1069
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:06,460
that same plant six inches tall the

1070
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:12,610
resolute heads will be a little bit

1071
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:14,740
smaller because you know when we were

1072
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:17,530
doing huge plants up at the hideout my

1073
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:19,359
my upper bag pulled like the 150s and

1074
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,810
stuff I had really never pulled a 150

1075
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,539
bag

1076
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:24,250
they had hash in it until we we got up

1077
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:27,909
there and it was you know my the

1078
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:30,070
majority of my ash was 115-120 always

1079
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:31,719
was up there growing those huge plants

1080
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:36,400
well when I first went to visit breeder

1081
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:38,619
Steve in Lugano around 2000 2001

1082
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,510
and I've made hash with his material it

1083
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:42,069
was they worth 12 foot tall but they

1084
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,750
were pretty big plants that he was

1085
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,750
growing in his hoop houses some of them

1086
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:49,719
were definitely like 7 and 8 feet those

1087
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:52,300
plants I produced melt from the 190 bag

1088
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:56,379
all the way to the 25 micron bag every

1089
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,450
single grade melted into a liquid and I

1090
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,950
photographed it while it was wet I just

1091
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:02,049
that they were all wet on a piece of

1092
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:05,349
paper and I kind of wrote each micron

1093
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:09,610
and that photo was published in redeye

1094
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:12,069
magazine in 2002 I believe so that blew

1095
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,590
my mind I've seen it since but not a lot

1096
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,990
that's another you know thing that I

1097
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,910
like how do we grow cultivars cuz look

1098
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:20,889
we're all looking for the melt well

1099
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:23,199
sometimes we can grow melt between the

1100
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:25,239
90 and the 120 but we don't see it above

1101
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:28,119
the 120 and we don't see it may be below

1102
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:31,149
the 73 you know big yields come in on

1103
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,969
those 45 micron bags and it always has

1104
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:37,030
that very oily very specific taste like

1105
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:39,189
a 45 micron I swear I could pick out on

1106
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:42,490
and I've done it like many many times

1107
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:44,650
from any cultivar made by any hash maker

1108
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:47,769
you put them in front of me the 45 is

1109
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,000
just so specific and if you ever back in

1110
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:51,400
the day when we were puffing with a

1111
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,199
flame or a lighter just gently soif ting

1112
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,660
what I notice about the 45 is that it

1113
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,369
would take flame it would light on fire

1114
00:47:55,659 --> 00:48:00,099
when you were smoking a bowl of it I

1115
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:02,019
haven't jeez I haven't smoked any hash

1116
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:03,849
in a long time I don't think we've been

1117
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:05,460
puffing too many bowls even I saw ganja

1118
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:07,779
Gill puffs and bulls maybe I'll join

1119
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,510
join the panel and puffs and bowls we're

1120
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,030
gonna introduce at that spliff that kind

1121
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,280
of got the handshaking a little nice

1122
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,140
well we're gonna introduce a Simpson is

1123
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,810
in the house he's next up to give us a

1124
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:22,469
little background on who he is and what

1125
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:25,630
he's been doing with uh with bubble hash

1126
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:27,539
howdy y'all can you hear me welcome dude

1127
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,800
we can hear you perfect all right on

1128
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:31,630
awesome there was so much talked about I

1129
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:36,490
wanted to jump in but I didn't want to

1130
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:39,640
be rude yeah so my name is Adam I am

1131
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:41,669
just a hash maker I'm stoked beyond here

1132
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:45,969
get let's get weird with some hash talk

1133
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:49,059
I am in I'm in Arcadia California

1134
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:50,969
I should probably shout out but the

1135
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:54,869
gardener that I work with

1136
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:59,579
in her nature on Instagram that's in dot

1137
00:48:54,869 --> 00:49:01,679
her dot nature and yeah so I mean you're

1138
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:04,110
talking about it earlier it's always

1139
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:09,960
good to give the gardener the the credit

1140
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:14,309
that they also deserve um yeah I have so

1141
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,760
much to talk about yeah what do you want

1142
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:19,679
to talk about let's do it

1143
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,700
just tell us kind of how you got into it

1144
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,079
what's your you know what your

1145
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:24,449
techniques are what you're kind of doing

1146
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,299
just a little kind of bio on on you and

1147
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:28,949
and yeah but from there what we're gonna

1148
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,050
do is we've got so many good points that

1149
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:32,969
everyone's brought up from like I want

1150
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,860
to talk about pre-washing material I

1151
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:36,449
want to talk about drying desiccants

1152
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,490
versus freeze dryer so we're gonna get

1153
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:40,349
into it deep but just give a little bio

1154
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:42,479
we've still got Bobby and Gil and

1155
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:44,789
Rakim's to go through it's almost 10

1156
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,429
o'clock we probably got until 10:30 11

1157
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:48,929
before I switch it over into the rosin

1158
00:49:47,429 --> 00:49:51,419
talk so yeah just just a little

1159
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:54,329
introduction Brown was good well I mean

1160
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,889
first of all like back in 2009 ish

1161
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:59,969
probably it was the first time I ever

1162
00:49:55,889 --> 00:50:01,889
made hash 2008/2009 ish and to think to

1163
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:05,730
be on a panel with a bunch of folks and

1164
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:11,730
that that I can learn from so easily

1165
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:14,429
is amazing I I don't know I'll always

1166
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:16,920
give rosin makers [ __ ] even though I

1167
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,239
love rosin but I think that I should

1168
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,340
bring that up like a lot of people

1169
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:24,649
haven't experienced the days of buying

1170
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:27,510
moldy hash and dispensed in stores or

1171
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,820
just having really really wet hash and

1172
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:35,190
not knowing why or how how to dry it

1173
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:37,640
properly and yeah I don't know

1174
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,599
go on take I take full responsibility

1175
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:43,319
because when I first started making

1176
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,299
water hash bubble hash I was like taking

1177
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,400
wet bubble and like rolling it into

1178
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:51,050
these Frenchie cannoli balls and people

1179
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:55,619
loved it they loved it it was like

1180
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:58,560
shimmering beautiful you know but I was

1181
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:01,349
doing it all wet I only did it for a

1182
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,750
couple years before I realized the

1183
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,380
massive mistake that I had made and I

1184
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,298
feel like I

1185
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:12,210
spent the next 10 to 15 years trying to

1186
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:14,369
tell people not to do that and seeing so

1187
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:16,619
much beautiful hash it was such a shame

1188
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:19,230
to see someone who had great herb who

1189
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:21,358
ran it perfectly and then took it and

1190
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,349
rat and rolled it up all wet and of

1191
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:24,598
course we're gonna get into the

1192
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:25,950
importance of breaking water hash up

1193
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:29,670
whether you're sieving it or whether

1194
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:32,608
you're micro planing it or whether

1195
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,079
you're freeze drying it you need to get

1196
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:35,578
the moisture out of your hash this is

1197
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,740
fairly important and of course if you're

1198
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:39,809
doing fresh frozen there is a moisture

1199
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:41,608
percentage that holds in the wax

1200
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:42,960
membrane and if you're a macro

1201
00:51:41,608 --> 00:51:44,909
photography you understand that because

1202
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,670
those balls those glands look so

1203
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:49,739
beautiful like a like a water balloon

1204
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:52,920
stretched to its maximum when it's fresh

1205
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:55,500
and when it's dry they tend to dry out

1206
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:59,130
and create ripples like a like a raisin

1207
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,960
and so these are the sort of differences

1208
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:03,088
you know dry that's why they say dry

1209
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,579
sifting is not a misnomer it's ideal to

1210
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:07,500
have your material dry sure you can do

1211
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:10,710
it with fresh frozen and some sort of

1212
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,659
like dry ice material but to me that is

1213
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,909
like the way to produce the most

1214
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:16,889
contaminated low-grade hash that you

1215
00:52:14,909 --> 00:52:18,480
could possibly make I think a lot of

1216
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:20,219
people don't realize that the water is

1217
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,500
very important in water hash and as

1218
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:24,000
water hash makers it's really one of the

1219
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,278
things that make us look like we're

1220
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,489
doing a really great job because of that

1221
00:52:26,278 --> 00:52:31,858
purity 99.9 percent if you think it's

1222
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:33,778
easy try to do it without the water it's

1223
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:36,449
there's a very few percentage of people

1224
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:39,659
who can really you know in the numbers

1225
00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:42,689
in in the amount still produce that kind

1226
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:46,230
of that kind of product so why don't we

1227
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:47,940
introduce dammit Bobby into the room

1228
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:49,380
he's gonna he's on mute right now he'll

1229
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,720
share a little bit with us and then

1230
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,920
we'll go through ganja Gil and Rackham

1231
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,048
and then we'll just have a nice little

1232
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,180
maybe a 45 minute to an hour long

1233
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:58,858
conversation about all these little

1234
00:52:57,179 --> 00:53:00,778
points that different people made up so

1235
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:02,639
try not to lose your your your your

1236
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:04,409
point if you've if you've heard someone

1237
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,929
say something sometimes it's a good idea

1238
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:09,449
to write a little note but okay Bobby

1239
00:53:06,929 --> 00:53:13,798
and we just jump in if for some reason

1240
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:17,009
it feels like like talking yeah once Gil

1241
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:18,059
and Rackham and Bobby have introduced

1242
00:53:17,009 --> 00:53:20,909
themselves it's going to

1243
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:22,829
free-for-all jump in conversation so at

1244
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:25,019
least three introduced go ahead Bobby

1245
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:27,980
I've got a couple seconds left here

1246
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:30,000
before I take a dub give me a moment

1247
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:33,030
well I guess we all better take a DAB

1248
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:38,639
then as my good brethren D 420k would

1249
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:41,310
say bong ripped mother lovers Bobby just

1250
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:52,440
telling us to hang on guys I gotta take

1251
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:53,940

house give thanks brother

1253
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,179

1254
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:59,179
those strawberry-banana

1255
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:09,269
so good right my name is Chris I go by

1256
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:11,940
damn it Bobby on Instagram I'm a hash

1257
00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:13,530
maker originally from Texas I live in

1258
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,280
Portland Oregon Vancouver Washington

1259
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:19,170
area now originally started making hash

1260
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,290
in battleground Washington for a little

1261
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:24,720
company got in 502 here and then

1262
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:27,269
switched to working for archive down in

1263
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,649
Portland Oregon and selling all of our

1264
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:32,070
stuff through the dispensary their

1265
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:35,639
archives so everything is is hands

1266
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:37,380
stirred it's all single source you know

1267
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:40,199
we use all our water they're all our Oh

1268
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:43,410
ice it's a it's a cold environment that

1269
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:45,929
we're working in they're full

1270
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:50,369
you know I run ice extract bag so bag

1271
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:53,309
stack everything from 45 to 220 in there

1272
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:56,369
the 70 to 90 the 120 everything to

1273
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:58,049
isolate and then we mix back for rosin

1274
00:54:56,369 --> 00:55:00,599
grades if we need to and separate

1275
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:02,490
everything for full melt to do to do

1276
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:07,769
full melt drops here you know along the

1277
00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:09,179
road that's what's up we mentioned you

1278
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:11,789
mentioned that in the day in the chat

1279
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:14,460
the other day definitely in a very good

1280
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:17,489
position if you are washing for archive

1281
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,559
a good friend of mine Fletch he's been

1282
00:55:17,489 --> 00:55:21,269
doing this a long time he really knows

1283
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:24,150
how to grow and he really knows how to

1284
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:28,199
find those fee knows everything he grows

1285
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:30,750
is just [ __ ] fire yeah submission I

1286
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:33,569
wash at Burnside collective Garden Inn

1287
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:35,159
organ so that's the farm where it all

1288
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,200
goes down and then all the material the

1289
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:38,759
flour the hash the seeds everything gets

1290
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,469
sold it archived in Portland the

1291
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,300
dispensary

1292
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:44,039
yeah and Fletcher is you know he's a big

1293
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,560
part of everything he's done tons of

1294
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,329
breeding the limb until he said to talk

1295
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,570
about strains that you really like to

1296
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:54,389
wash that that's one of the posts and

1297
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:56,039
all aliases linen peel it washes

1298
00:55:54,389 --> 00:56:00,000
extremely well you don't really ever

1299
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:02,130
find that's hurting profile the wash is

1300
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,170
really well it does you know five

1301
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:08,070
percent and three and a half of that

1302
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:09,840
sits in the 90 through 119 so you're

1303
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,690
collecting a lot of full Mel let me wash

1304
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,400
that one I did was twenty thousand in

1305
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,670
some change like twenty thousand and 85

1306
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,579
grams hand stir between a few buckets

1307
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:23,639
and the thing dumps you know 598 raised

1308
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:24,929
for us and you know everything you're

1309
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:26,969
looking at about a eighteen percent

1310
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:29,489
yield on that material what is that five

1311
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:31,199
percent fresh frozen yeah it's close to

1312
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:32,939
eighteen to twenty there it always

1313
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,769
depends this is the second time I've run

1314
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,179
this material here and of course the

1315
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:37,800
materials tends to get better and better

1316
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:41,339
every time as you try and get better

1317
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,660
when you grow the people know but for

1318
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,160
those that don't because it might be a

1319
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:45,960
place where you get confused fresh

1320
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,750
frozen weighs about one quarter to one

1321
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,179
fifth of the same material dry there are

1322
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:53,039
cultivars that tend to go towards the

1323
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:55,079
one fifth and there are cultivars that

1324
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,000
tend to go to the one fourth is would

1325
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,829
that be accurate for it for you Sam that

1326
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:10,860
you've seen over the years a quarter to

1327
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:13,319
a fifth of weight I'm not sure what

1328
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,300
exactly you're asking me well I'm just

1329
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,220
like from a hash making perspective if

1330
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:20,610
we take a thousand grams of fresh frozen

1331
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:25,049
it's going to be between 200 and 250

1332
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:27,450
grams dried [ __ ] oh I do you know I

1333
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:31,830
don't have a lot of experience making

1334
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:35,939
fresh frozen because the resin that I

1335
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:36,900
like the best is actually dried for a

1336
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,070
couple weeks

1337
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:44,480
turd for a couple of months and then

1338
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:48,740
then I would stick it in a walking for

1339
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:53,179
and use a centrifugal brush machine on

1340
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:57,379
it to make traditional drives so I I

1341
00:57:53,179 --> 00:58:00,319
didn't really have French products that

1342
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,900
were frozen and I don't think I really

1343
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,460
have the experience right well thank you

1344
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,960
for your honesty I appreciate it all the

1345
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,630
other hash makers were going like this

1346
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,519
so I know I'm on point for that so it's

1347
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,260
it and that's what he was saying 5%

1348
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:14,750
fresh frozen you're gonna end right

1349
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:17,660
applying that by about four maybe a

1350
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:20,329
little bit fresh frozen material we take

1351
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:22,190
a lot of time to buck the material down

1352
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:24,890
you know without touching the material

1353
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:27,619
you know and putting it into very small

1354
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:29,809
freezer bags and freezing you know tons

1355
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:31,519
of these little freezer bags to make

1356
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:33,920
sure that there's no pressure on the

1357
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:37,030
material at all that you know that it's

1358
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,200
sitting there with as you know as little

1359
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:40,849
pressure at all you know to keep the

1360
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,159
heads intact so whenever we do go to

1361
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:45,588
wash them you don't fill out one huge

1362
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:46,868
freezer bag full of material that's got

1363
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:49,130
a ton of weight you know you're

1364
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:51,769
offloading a bunch of really small bags

1365
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:56,960
so that between 500 and maybe a thousand

1366
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:58,219
grams great thank you for sharing that

1367
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,079
sorry I've been trying to figure out

1368
00:58:58,219 --> 00:59:02,419
getting the dank Duchess in here I think

1369
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,300
she's trying to connect now and she's

1370
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:06,740
into I know I can fit like 40 people in

1371
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,880
here at a time it's just kind of a new

1372
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:10,479
one that I haven't done a ton of

1373
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,858
churches with so I'm not the best at

1374
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,389
doing troubleshooting especially while

1375
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:16,369
I'm trying to moderate the church but

1376
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:18,739
hopefully she'll make it in on her audio

1377
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:20,720
at least and we'll move forward from

1378
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:23,659
down over there she is good you made it

1379
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,219
man she'd been trying for an hour one

1380
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:27,980

1387
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:42,108

1388
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:43,880
sort of leach into our rosin

1389
00:59:42,108 --> 00:59:47,059

little bit so i tried to move closer to

1402
01:00:12,139 --> 01:00:18,109
my router so hopefully this is smooth

1403
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:24,199
but rather in the forest is that where

1404
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:26,180
your router is a delight router you know

1405
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:28,369
Trinity County style you know how it

1406
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:31,460

be with you all right now and yeah just

1411
01:00:38,829 --> 01:00:45,079
my journeys kind of a spiritual journey

1412
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:47,840
once I met gondya I was captivated by it

1413
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:49,819
and I just couldn't get enough of it I

1414
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,490
mean I just followed it everywhere it's

1415
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:55,400
led me know to the ends of the earth the

1416
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:57,319
other side of the country or whatever I

1417
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,579
took you know that's that's what I did I

1418
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,289
called it blimey

1419
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:02,360
I like to consider myself a gun to

1420
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:04,880
Shepherd you know taking care of the

1421
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,390
plant for the people well it's a deeper

1422
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,430
meaning for me personally you know and

1423
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:12,559
when all the licensing and all the

1424
01:01:10,429 --> 01:01:14,119
permitting went on you know I'm no

1425
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:17,329
triangle I should say that I'm up in

1426
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:18,980
Humboldt County Trinity County area it's

1427
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:21,739
ganja country up there you know the

1428
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:23,210
baker the candlestick maker their

1429
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:25,250
mothers their grandmothers their

1430
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:28,010
children everyone's involved in ganja

1431
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:30,679
here and when the licensing and the

1432
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:32,840
permanent aim really rocked the culture

1433
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:35,929
it was it was kind of devastating for

1434
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,700
most and I was always a small-time guy

1435
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:39,349
doing my small-time thing but I was just

1436
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:42,529
watching my community kind of fall apart

1437
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:44,719
and go to shambles and watching people

1438
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,990
put all their money on the line and you

1439
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:51,169
know dough was kind of troubling times

1440
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:51,979
and I kind of asked Don you're like what

1441
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,380
do I do

1442
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,599
what do I want out of it you know and I

1443
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,280
just told me to focus on myself as I

1444
01:01:56,599 --> 01:01:59,929
always had and kind of just do my own

1445
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:02,930
thing you know that's always what's the

1446
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:05,359
meaningful for me personally so that's

1447
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:08,690
what led me to living soil and

1448
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:10,460
cultivating outside all this awesome

1449
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:11,030
connections I made you know I stopped

1450
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,369
growing

1451
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,960
doors for personal reasons not knocking

1452
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:17,539
the indoor growers seeing my best

1453
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,150
friends are indoor growers but for me

1454
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:23,449
personally I got into resin farming

1455
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:26,900
which led to Sun grown cannabis which

1456
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:30,379
led to living soil you know the idea of

1457
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:33,590
bringing dirt from outside into your

1458
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:35,420
indoor grow was like always oxymoronic

1459
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:37,700
to me it's like we always tried to keep

1460
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:39,860
everything so clean and so sterile in an

1461
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:41,839
indoor environment so it just didn't

1462
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:44,450
make sense to me you know I was reading

1463
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,010
all teeming with microbes and all those

1464
01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:47,689
books and I was like you know I just

1465
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:51,620
need to be outside I need to be growing

1466
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:54,050
outside so I got a little spot started

1467
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:56,599
build soil started going out and good

1468
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:58,940
luck the national forest and grabbing

1469
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:00,860
stuff that was there for me that was a

1470
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,889
big issue as well is just keeping the

1471
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:06,019
overall cost down you know my time to me

1472
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:08,059
is just my time so if it doesn't cost me

1473
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:09,800
anything to go to a cannabis I'm like I

1474
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:11,210
don't feel like you could ever lose you

1475
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,450
know there's just so much to be gained

1476
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:17,030
it's always worth the gamble so I got

1477
01:03:14,449 --> 01:03:19,399
really into living soil and found the

1478
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:21,890
teachings of the lane doctor relating

1479
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,780
them and kind of got into the microscope

1480
01:03:21,889 --> 01:03:25,909
thing for a little bit like it's really

1481
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,680
not my thing but it was just cool to

1482
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:30,739
like kind of learn it and have it as a

1483
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:33,469
tool and then I kind of found josh and

1484
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:35,750
kelly from DraganFlyer medicine shout

1485
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:39,829
out to them so much love for them big

1486
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:41,900
time yeah deep love and gratitude for

1487
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:44,779
them I really do consider them family

1488
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,910
and uh you know I just kind of met them

1489
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,410
right at a really good pivotal point and

1490
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:50,809
like everything just started to kind of

1491
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:53,899
line up and then I kind of asked the

1492
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:56,449
universe for more I was like I just want

1493
01:03:53,900 --> 01:04:00,019
to keep doing my ganja thing and I want

1494
01:03:56,449 --> 01:04:02,929
it to like be enough for me what do I do

1495
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:05,900
and I don't know everyone was buying

1496
01:04:02,929 --> 01:04:08,690
freeze dryers and I was never into the

1497
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:10,760
BHO everyone was doing that up here and

1498
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:12,679
it just never really like interested me

1499
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:16,130
personally so thankfully I never went

1500
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:18,259
down that route but uh I got a freeze

1501
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:19,970
dryer and got back into ash making you

1502
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:22,130
know I no longer had to microplane and

1503
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:25,038
air dry so I could step up production

1504
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:28,548
and it just went really

1505
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:32,719
well you know washing really great resin

1506
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:35,119
strains that under the full Sun um in

1507
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:38,929
living soil I've been building for over

1508
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:41,239
six years and my yields were great the

1509
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:43,699
Terps were great it was just super

1510
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:45,918
fulfilling you know it really truly was

1511
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:49,459
like I was able to do it all myself

1512
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:51,798
completely from seed to harvest to

1513
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:54,498
processing I do it all entirely myself

1514
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:57,889
packaging all of it I stuffed much

1515
01:04:54,498 --> 01:05:00,409
freezers myself I washed it all myself

1516
01:04:57,889 --> 01:05:04,838
press it all myself I do it all because

1517
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:08,389
to me I really truly love the process

1518
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:10,548
every step of it I often think about

1519
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:14,058
hiring help I need help my back is

1520
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:17,449
broken but then I'd often go back to I

1521
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:19,519
only grow so much and every barrel that

1522
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:22,400
I let someone else wash is one less

1523
01:05:19,518 --> 01:05:25,578
barrel that I can wash and I really

1524
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,858
truly just cherish the time that I get

1525
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:28,419
to spend with the animals every moment

1526
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:32,179
of it

1527
01:05:28,418 --> 01:05:36,588
teaches me so much about myself teaches

1528
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:39,499
me a lot about makes sense I'd like for

1529
01:05:36,588 --> 01:05:42,409
me personally know the world's a crazy

1530
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:44,389
place it's scary once you leave your

1531
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:47,509
house you leave your property you go out

1532
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:49,938
there you know it's tough it's tough on

1533
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:52,099
a person like me so being able to stay

1534
01:05:49,938 --> 01:05:54,498
home and my god your sanctuary with my

1535
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:57,199
lady and just work with the point and

1536
01:05:54,498 --> 01:06:00,379
spend intimate time with the plant

1537
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:04,130
it's beyond valuable to me it's just

1538
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:08,358
like it's priceless and to me this this

1539
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:11,059
way of life sadly is kind of ending and

1540
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:13,818
maybe this we will be the last

1541
01:06:11,059 --> 01:06:15,798
generation you know and I'm clinging to

1542
01:06:13,818 --> 01:06:17,478
that personally I'm holding on to that

1543
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:19,369
[ __ ] for dear life I'm not trying to let

1544
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:21,018
go we're all you're making me want to

1545
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:27,798
move back to the hill really bad right

1546
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:30,498
now I love love the passion man I love

1547
01:06:27,798 --> 01:06:32,688
the passion and the honesty and the

1548
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:34,968
truth in your voice I you know for me

1549
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:37,009
cannabis is also a guiding light I

1550
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:39,409
almost feel like it's been my shepherd

1551
01:06:37,009 --> 01:06:43,039
you know leading leading me

1552
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:45,049
for the last 25 to 30 years and what a

1553
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:49,369
what a what a beautiful thing to be a

1554
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:51,200
part of the last 30 almost 20 23 years

1555
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:52,819
now of just sharing how to make hash

1556
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,589
with people my favorite thing back in

1557
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,080
the day was to travel anywhere and

1558
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:59,059
everywhere and show people this hash

1559
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:01,579
making and watch for their eyebrows

1560
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:03,889
because when I lifted that 73 bag the

1561
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:06,619
eyebrows always went up I called it the

1562
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:08,329
eyebrow raise so here comes the 73 bag

1563
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:10,429
this was during a time when no one had

1564
01:07:08,329 --> 01:07:14,090
had I had seen this and didn't no one

1565
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:16,009
understood this this was like 1999 you

1566
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:17,750
know where that it's just it was so new

1567
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:21,230
and such an amazing thing to be a part

1568
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:23,090
of and I definitely am very happy for

1569
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:25,610
the people that came before me that got

1570
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:28,400
me to be able to be in the place that I

1571
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:30,829
was at the time that I was to sort of

1572
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,809
just be able to be you know one of the

1573
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:34,190
steps in the ladder of this incredible

1574
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:35,929
hashed journey I'll tell you something

1575
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:38,690
dude and I'll let you know when we did a

1576
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:41,029
legends of hash years ago we celebrated

1577
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,710
the legend when we do a legends of hash

1578
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:44,600
you have to understand Sam and I when we

1579
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:47,869
started these parties it wasn't to

1580
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:50,839
celebrate ourselves we don't see

1581
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:52,429
ourselves as legends obviously Sam's a

1582
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,190
legend but that's a different story we

1583
01:07:52,429 --> 01:07:57,889
were celebrating true legends so one

1584
01:07:55,190 --> 01:08:00,860
year we celebrated the garden of khufu

1585
01:07:57,889 --> 01:08:02,539
and in the garden of couture man that

1586
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:06,200
was the spot let me see if I have it

1587
01:08:02,539 --> 01:08:07,969
here I think I do know that was the

1588
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:09,919
figure of fun let's see what we got here

1589
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:11,269
is this garden of couture here we go

1590
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,430
look at that just happen to have it

1591
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:15,289
right here and I did not organize that

1592
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:17,539
this is literally just sitting in the

1593
01:08:15,289 --> 01:08:19,220
left drawer of my office and so we

1594
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:21,409
celebrated the garden of the floor in

1595
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:23,390
the 12th century Cairo the favorite

1596
01:08:21,409 --> 01:08:25,689
meeting place for hashish connoisseurs

1597
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:28,400
was the legendary gardens of Khufu

1598
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:30,529
Islamic law forbade the drinking of wine

1599
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,539
but many Muslims especially the Sufis

1600
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:35,358
were great proponents of hashish eating

1601
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:37,579
and its legality was hotly debated by

1602
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,530
Islamic courts by the 14th century

1603
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:41,510
conservative Muslim leaders won out and

1604
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:44,000
came down hard by destroying Kapoor's

1605
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:46,609
gardens burning surrounding hash fields

1606
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,560
and starving out the farmers shops and

1607
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:50,359
cafes selling hashish were closed and

1608
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,370
the owners hunted down and killed

1609
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,590
but how sheesh use can

1610
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:55,369
you'd hope I see a smile on your face

1611
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:59,659
there guilt

1612
01:08:55,369 --> 01:09:01,399
hashish use continued in 1378 the

1613
01:08:59,659 --> 01:09:03,800
frustrated Cairo government forced all

1614
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:06,500
known hashish shooters users into the

1615
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,930
main square where soldiers wrenched out

1616
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:12,439
their teeth with pliers a decade later

1617
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:15,350
hashish eating still thrived in Egypt as

1618
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:18,769
it had become too much a part of the

1619
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:20,720
Arab way of life to be forsaken may the

1620
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:24,230
gardens of Khufu serve as an ancient

1621
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:28,000
reminder that cannabis prohibition never

1622
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:31,839
succeed we're not going anywhere Gil

1623
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,880
trust me I love that thanks for sharing

1624
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,590
anyway it's gonna manifest and change

1625
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,619
and alter and as long as you're in your

1626
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:42,739
little spot you know steering your

1627
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:45,380
vehicle it's not gonna change we're in

1628
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:47,269
charge of this okay not then we have

1629
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:49,010
been for a long time since before the

1630
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:50,570
gardens of before and when they're

1631
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:52,400
killing us and they're wrenching out our

1632
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:57,949
teeth and we're still here

1633
01:09:52,399 --> 01:10:01,099
that says a lot to me three men agreed

1634
01:09:57,949 --> 01:10:03,439
the plant creates so much passion you

1635
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:06,590
know what I mean it just like I don't

1636
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:09,289
know it just exudes it you know I just

1637
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:12,380
feel like there is fortunately really

1638
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:14,119
great people surrounding it and it's

1639
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,090
just weird times right now where

1640
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:19,579
babylons got it scripts on it so it's

1641
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:22,310
just some things going down but like you

1642
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:25,220
said you just gotta persevere hold on to

1643
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:27,380
it and you know not much has changed man

1644
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:29,600
my life's only gotten better I'll tell

1645
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:32,270
everyone that man every year is my best

1646
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:35,930
year including this year you know every

1647
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:42,530
year and you know you just love Ganju I

1648
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:45,170
love you back then it's okay for it to

1649
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:46,819
change and alter how it looks you know

1650
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:48,649
we just have to make sure we don't fall

1651
01:10:46,819 --> 01:10:51,019
for the illusion because from my

1652
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:53,089
perspective you know I'm never gonna

1653
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,070
fight against access and there's all

1654
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:56,720
this access that's now coming into play

1655
01:10:55,069 --> 01:10:59,119
that a lot of us aren't really overly

1656
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:01,190
stoked on but then I know people that

1657
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:03,079
are so it's like we continue with our

1658
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:05,299
civil disobedience we continue to push

1659
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:07,988
the envelope and get exactly what we

1660
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:10,400
and how we want it and we do that by

1661
01:11:07,988 --> 01:11:13,069
growing great cannabis by learning about

1662
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,750
biodynamic organic you know regenerative

1663
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:16,609
sustainable growing by learning about

1664
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:18,649
you know these different solvent was

1665
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:20,689
techniques for extracting the resins and

1666
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:22,368
creating these wonderfully pure products

1667
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:26,109
and if we just keep doing that

1668
01:11:22,368 --> 01:11:29,420
it's it'll work itself out it's you know

1669
01:11:26,109 --> 01:11:33,198
in California legalization is cut off

1670
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:36,408
access though to a large number of

1671
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:38,359
people unfortunately well that's why the

1672
01:11:36,408 --> 01:11:40,339
civil disobedience will be required

1673
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:42,738
there now right now it's civil do some

1674
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:45,440
disobedience again is exactly right yeah

1675
01:11:42,738 --> 01:11:47,779
that's how we got what we wanted I'll

1676
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:49,549
stop to my horn right now and say I kind

1677
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:52,399
of gave them the finger it's handed the

1678
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:53,929
permit back and we're just still rocking

1679
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:58,158
it out the way we have in the past

1680
01:11:53,929 --> 01:11:59,840
civil disobedience I tell big companies

1681
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:02,000
all the time you know don't harsh out on

1682
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,770
civil disobedience it's literally what

1683
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,229
made it possible for you to be in

1684
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:08,030
business right now so you know support

1685
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:09,379
those grassroots you know don't be

1686
01:12:08,029 --> 01:12:12,170
annoyed when you see someone like well

1687
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:15,260
why is that guy doing it illegally if I

1688
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:16,969
have to get a license oh gee frontliner

1689
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:19,099
who's continuing to make things better

1690
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:20,750
for your future licenses and seeing us

1691
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:22,610
you don't want to do it because you want

1692
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:25,010
to protect everything you have over here

1693
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:26,929
you should just shut your face and maybe

1694
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:29,150
give them a little support that's the

1695
01:12:26,929 --> 01:12:32,770
way I see it anyway one good thing in

1696
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:36,769
California is it you can grow six plants

1697
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:38,239
everybody can that's one bit it's a

1698
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:43,250
small thing you can grow more than that

1699
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:45,919
grow way more than people aren't

1700
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:48,078
embracing that six plant thing honestly

1701
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,969
I don't you do I thought I would see

1702
01:12:48,078 --> 01:12:52,729
more people doing their six plants and

1703
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:54,828
they're you listen listen growing

1704
01:12:52,729 --> 01:12:56,928
cannabis takes a lot of work and it's

1705
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:58,789
not easy and if it was so easy you'd see

1706
01:12:56,929 --> 01:13:00,319
everyone growing all their food too and

1707
01:12:58,789 --> 01:13:05,029
making all their clothes and it's like

1708
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:06,859
listen they do yeah it's an endless

1709
01:13:05,029 --> 01:13:09,170
amount of things with cannabis it's kind

1710
01:13:06,859 --> 01:13:11,118
of we've always gotten lost in because

1711
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:13,099
there is this very spiritual connection

1712
01:13:11,118 --> 01:13:15,170
to it you know I agreed with everything

1713
01:13:13,099 --> 01:13:16,489
Gil said earlier and felt very much the

1714
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:18,289
same way about cannabis

1715
01:13:16,489 --> 01:13:20,359
I you know I have a very strong

1716
01:13:18,289 --> 01:13:22,850
connection to it yet at the same time

1717
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:24,289
you know I always hear people will

1718
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:25,850
Johnny be he's a proponent of getting

1719
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:27,710
everyone to grow I'm like John you

1720
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:30,050
understand that not everyone can grow

1721
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:31,819
like it's not possible like I know that

1722
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:34,220
I can't grow right now because the way

1723
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:36,769
I'm busy and work and travel I end up

1724
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:38,900
starting my garden I get it up to veg I

1725
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:41,210
flip the lights and then I'm like bye

1726
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:43,609
sweetie I have to go on a 10-day trip

1727
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:45,230
and now for ten days my poor wife who

1728
01:13:43,609 --> 01:13:47,089
has three children and runs an entire

1729
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:50,239
household is like watering these plants

1730
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:52,970
that are taking more and more and more

1731
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:55,670
like every single day as they as they

1732
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:57,710
fatten up and flour out so I don't have

1733
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:59,359
the time to do it personally as I as I

1734
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:01,460
do what I'm doing I know a lot of people

1735
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,799
who are sick and who are unable to

1736
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:06,140
physically you know take care of a

1737
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,029
garden I love the fact that we can grow

1738
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:10,760
plants in Canada and everyone that can

1739
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:12,859
absolutely should on the flip side of

1740
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,680
that we need to have access available to

1741
01:14:12,859 --> 01:14:17,929
people through shops and dispensaries

1742
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,520
and online where they can also access it

1743
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:25,520
from there and pretty much that's what

1744
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:28,880
we have right now you should be able to

1745
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,280
do this over your freakin smartphone or

1746
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:35,300
wherever you are in the world what's

1747
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:38,179

because let me tell you I am busy that's

1768
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:30,319
not my problem ation well that's that's

1769
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:31,698
my

1770
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:33,710
Automation exactly I like people

1771
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:36,289
Automation I like people a it's giving

1772
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:37,908
them an opportunity and B it's giving

1773
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:39,408
it's giving me an opportunity as well

1774
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:41,149
how fun would it be to be in a

1775
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:42,920
greenhouse full of plants right now for

1776
01:15:41,149 --> 01:15:45,948
hash search right behind my house like

1777
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:48,618
that I have a 99 plant license federal I

1778
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:51,529
have a federal 99 plant license that I

1779
01:15:48,618 --> 01:15:55,219
can grow 99 plants on my property I can

1780
01:15:51,529 --> 01:15:58,340
possess on my property 10 pounds of

1781
01:15:55,219 --> 01:16:00,260
extracts I'm allowed to have 10 pounds

1782
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:02,090
of extracts at my house which is like

1783
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:04,639
I'll tell you sometimes I need a little

1784
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:06,560
bit more so it's a bit rough I'm joking

1785
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:07,849
obviously who the [ __ ] needs 10 pounds

1786
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,550
of extract at their house that's

1787
01:16:07,849 --> 01:16:12,199
ridiculous unless you're like the

1788
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:14,900
Harborside dispensary or something don't

1789
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:16,908
need 10 pounds of foot bubble hat that's

1790
01:16:14,899 --> 01:16:18,170
your house but listen we're gonna

1791
01:16:16,908 --> 01:16:19,969
continue on we're gonna introduce

1792
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:23,389
Rackham's and then we're gonna introduce

1793
01:16:19,969 --> 01:16:28,010
the dank Duchess so Rackham's what's up

1794
01:16:23,389 --> 01:16:30,078
buddy oh [ __ ] hey cuz everybody doing

1795
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:32,750
good man we're doing good how are you

1796
01:16:30,078 --> 01:16:36,439
doing great it's kind of hard to follow

1797
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:40,698
conjugals backstory but nonetheless

1798
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:43,158
my name's Rackham's Nick for short from

1799
01:16:40,698 --> 01:16:44,828
the Northern California area Sierra

1800
01:16:43,158 --> 01:16:46,939
Mountains originally from the Bay Area

1801
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:48,759
but now I reside in the Sierra Mountains

1802
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:53,238
Sur Sierra Foothills

1803
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:54,710
alongside choo-choo hash but um Rackham

1804
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:57,589
started about three two and a half three

1805
01:16:54,710 --> 01:17:00,590
years ago and it won't go into a Long

1806
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:02,389
Beach story essentially it started for

1807
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:05,599
lack of better words is that ode to my

1808
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:09,078
wife's father who recently passed away

1809
01:17:05,599 --> 01:17:11,860
in Indonesia for hashish anti stick I'm

1810
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:13,899
using prison there for 18 plus years I'm

1811
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:18,049
didn't get to see a light of day

1812
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:21,469
essentially but yeah then having not

1813
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:22,940
really a grower I am uh my fiancee wife

1814
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:25,069
is a grower she's been going for ten

1815
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:26,988
plus years we do have single source but

1816
01:17:25,069 --> 01:17:31,399
right now I'm working with clients such

1817
01:17:26,988 --> 01:17:35,448
as Ridge Boys and the real Ridge Boys

1818
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:37,879
and doing my best to isolate as much

1819
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:40,250
tick star as possible if not the best

1820
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:43,309
quality that I could possibly come pie

1821
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:44,149
with whether it's a single source or a

1822
01:17:43,309 --> 01:17:47,119
now

1823
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:49,250
side source and either make that into

1824
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:51,529
the best rosin I can and or the best

1825
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:52,310
hash that can be juice that's pretty

1826
01:17:51,529 --> 01:17:54,349
much about it

1827
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:57,500
beautiful well thank you confirming

1828
01:17:54,350 --> 01:18:00,320
thank you for confirming what I just

1829
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:03,948
said to ganja Gil so 18 years never saw

1830
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:06,319
the light of day died in prison you guys

1831
01:18:03,948 --> 01:18:09,198
did not turn your backs on cannabis you

1832
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:11,840
embraced cannabis and as an ode to him

1833
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:14,269
started the Rackham's account yeah

1834
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:17,150
that's amazing dude that's that's

1835
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:18,890
literally exactly what I was reading in

1836
01:18:17,149 --> 01:18:21,379
the gardens of couture they can rip out

1837
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:23,270
our teeth and they can kill us but

1838
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:24,859
they're not gonna stop us you know hash

1839
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:26,810
hash making used to be these big

1840
01:18:24,859 --> 01:18:29,630
countries that were like a mighty oak

1841
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:32,110
tree but now hash makers have blades of

1842
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:35,900
grass everywhere covering the earth and

1843
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:37,908
good luck mowing us all down definitely

1844
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:39,379
all right cool well we'll finish off

1845
01:18:37,908 --> 01:18:41,179
with dank Dutchess and then we'll get

1846
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,829
into a little conversation she can give

1847
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:44,840
us a little introduction I'm not sure if

1848
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:47,479
she's actually frozen now like if that

1849
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:51,529
was some bad timing but are you there

1850
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:54,079
Duchess oh my goodness imagine if she

1851
01:18:51,529 --> 01:18:55,880
got bumped I feel so bad for her she

1852
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:58,399
took she tried for an hour to get in

1853
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,900
here so she just got bumped I guess

1854
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:02,299
we'll have to come back you are on mute

1855
01:18:59,899 --> 01:19:07,009
so maybe try to unmute that oh she said

1856
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:08,810
her phone died all right well I get that

1857
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:10,520
[ __ ] plugged in you know what when she

1858
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:12,949
gets in here we'll let her introduce

1859
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,590
herself and in the meantime I wanted to

1860
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:19,129
start talking about you know one of the

1861
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:20,869
good things of as a hash maker if you're

1862
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:22,880
looking to really for that cleanliness

1863
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:26,840
is godliness if you're looking for that

1864
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:29,900
chef sop when you get your material get

1865
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,489
to know it dump it out look at it filter

1866
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:33,198
through it you know see what you've got

1867
01:19:31,488 --> 01:19:35,119
that you're working through rather than

1868
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,069
just through the bag and if it's coming

1869
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:39,920
from an outdoor grow it's never a bad

1870
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:42,679
idea even some of the greenhouses to pre

1871
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,170
wash your material just really I do it

1872
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:46,908
in not a very very cold water I do it in

1873
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:48,829
a sort of room-temperature water

1874
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:50,448
I'll put material and I'll have my

1875
01:19:48,829 --> 01:19:53,149
rubber gloves on and I'll gently just

1876
01:19:50,448 --> 01:19:56,409
sort of massage the material releasing

1877
01:19:53,149 --> 01:19:58,449
large little little dusty stones and the

1878
01:19:56,409 --> 01:20:00,039
many pebbles you'd be amazed at what can

1879
01:19:58,449 --> 01:20:02,199
get stuck on the plant from an outdoor

1880
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:04,899
grow giving it that little pre-wash

1881
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:06,760
filtering out those that heavy sediment

1882
01:20:04,899 --> 01:20:09,399
that will just contaminate your hash and

1883
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,170
look like little black dots in your hash

1884
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:14,289
if you if you get the microscope out

1885
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:16,239
afterwards so are you guys doing that on

1886
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:18,069
the regular when you see material come

1887
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:20,409
in that seems dirty and dusty are you

1888
01:20:18,069 --> 01:20:24,699
guys but realize it's really uh pre-wash

1889
01:20:20,409 --> 01:20:27,010
fresh frozen it doesn't really work I've

1890
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:28,569
tried but uh when I was up at the men

1891
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:31,539
that I doubt we were doing ten thousand

1892
01:20:28,569 --> 01:20:35,439
we've done experimented with the

1893
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:38,019
pre-wash great at harvest pre-wash let

1894
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:39,789
it hang drift dry and then into the

1895
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:42,370
freezers and that actually worked pretty

1896
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:43,899
well I can't really say I can't really

1897
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:48,220
say I did enough experimenting with it

1898
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:50,920
to say we got lost any yield or anything

1899
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:55,199
like that was an interesting thing

1900
01:20:50,920 --> 01:21:01,149
ash was still good it was clean we pre

1901
01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:04,300
pre wash all our material when we're

1902
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:07,269
harvesting it and then and then shake it

1903
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:10,720
off and drip dry it and in the drying

1904
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:12,280
rooms and then air dry it you're right I

1905
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,900
just wanted to say that if it's fresh

1906
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:15,849
material you're gonna have a really hard

1907
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:18,219
time knowing the quality of that

1908
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:21,010
material after it's frozen you know so

1909
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:23,590
be there prepping you know try to try to

1910
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:26,140
be able to prep that material for the

1911
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:29,199
gardener or you know work out something

1912
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:30,460
because that's not want to know what's

1913
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:35,170
in the freezer before it's all frozen

1914
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:39,069
together I definitely love the idea of

1915
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:42,640
and we do it every time of like very

1916
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:44,859
carefully observing all the material and

1917
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:47,350
actually this year we've been breaking

1918
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:53,170
the material right down into the into

1919
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:56,289
the bags but yeah I like you said pretty

1920
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:58,119
much looking at every flower you know a

1921
01:21:56,289 --> 01:22:02,680
piece of flower that goes in there

1922
01:21:58,119 --> 01:22:04,630
before it goes in the bag I like to look

1923
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:06,700
at the material with a jeweler's loupe

1924
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:09,430
first phone if I'm like actually gonna

1925
01:22:06,699 --> 01:22:10,099
wash other people's material beyond that

1926
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:12,470
I

1927
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:14,750
see it look at with like a 30 X or 15 X

1928
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:19,670
see what's really there see the size the

1929
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:22,460
shape how many how dense back in the day

1930
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:24,109
in Vancouver it was so bad you know

1931
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:25,579
living in the Pacific Northwest and

1932
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:27,920
people thinking they can grow Afghan

1933
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:30,409
ease up here and they just they attract

1934
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,930
powdery mildew like like you can't

1935
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:34,579
possibly imagine unless you live in the

1936
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:36,920
PAF Pacific Northwest and then you know

1937
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:39,199
exactly how they attract a powdery

1938
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:41,539
mildew but back in the day I first

1939
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:43,670
started making bubble someone gave me

1940
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:45,199
the most beautiful material and I ran it

1941
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:47,510
through my bags and the hash was just

1942
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:50,539
like white and it was like full mount

1943
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:53,119
six star and I took a small dab of it

1944
01:22:50,539 --> 01:22:56,149
and it was just sulfur like a heads of

1945
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:58,189
matches and that's when I learned about

1946
01:22:56,149 --> 01:23:00,739
defender and all of these sulfur burner

1947
01:22:58,189 --> 01:23:02,719
products and how badly they contaminate

1948
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:04,039
glandular trichomes and then of course

1949
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,579
people would say things to me like oh

1950
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:08,960
well we only do that in flat in fetch it

1951
01:23:07,579 --> 01:23:10,130
doesn't happen in flower and then I'm

1952
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,140
like yeah but you understand like

1953
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:15,109
glandular trichomes of presence on the

1954
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:17,750
plant from the time the first two true

1955
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:20,750
leaves come out of the seedling which is

1956
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:22,220
the called the epicotyl comes in after

1957
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:24,859
the coddle of dawn which are those two

1958
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:27,199
round leaves the first two true leaves

1959
01:23:24,859 --> 01:23:29,049
the epicotyl if you photograph the

1960
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:32,899
leaves they're covered in bulbous photo

1961
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:34,610
bulbous trichomes from like 1 day 2 days

1962
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:38,479
old type of thing so when you hear

1963
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:40,609
someone say I only spray in veg wow you

1964
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:44,929
can just flush the toilet on that right

1965
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:48,500
away I used to know I was just oh go

1966
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:49,909
ahead no no no go on go on Marcus I was

1967
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,649
just gonna say what I would do is I'd

1968
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:53,779
grab the material a little bit a pinch

1969
01:23:51,649 --> 01:23:56,119
out of the bag and I would light it with

1970
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:58,699
a lighter and then I would hold it under

1971
01:23:56,119 --> 01:24:01,220
my nose with my eyes closed and even if

1972
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:03,349
it had the lightest amount of sulphur on

1973
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:05,090
that material that's how I would

1974
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:06,680
discover it right away and that kept me

1975
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:08,659
from ruining a set of bubble bags

1976
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:10,250
because I'm telling you sulfur is like

1977
01:24:08,659 --> 01:24:13,479
the worst you can't get it out of the

1978
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:16,130
oil you can't get it I'll never forget

1979
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:17,839
almost over 20 years ago standing on my

1980
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:21,109
deck which is two doors down from the

1981
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:23,390
property I live on now and Hawking 29

1982
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:26,119
grams of that white foam elk hash

1983
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:27,110
like right into the bush I just I just

1984
01:24:26,119 --> 01:24:28,729
couldn't deal with it

1985
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:30,619
people look cool you could've eaten it

1986
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:33,169
you could I was like listen that hash

1987
01:24:30,619 --> 01:24:36,590
was an abomination and it needed to go

1988
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:38,720
comes through in the edible - we've we

1989
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:41,989
thought I was going to say that the hash

1990
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:43,640
was also free and we're like [ __ ] maybe

1991
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:46,309
we can make some cake pops or something

1992
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:48,590
with know what you can make yeah disc to

1993
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:51,170
throw that's what you know about that's

1994
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:53,239
about it we actually yeah I mean I've

1995
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:56,329
seen like a couple kilos thrown away

1996
01:24:53,239 --> 01:25:00,289
from people spray and sell for too late

1997
01:24:56,329 --> 01:25:05,750
it definitely ya can murder you know for

1998
01:25:00,289 --> 01:25:08,000
weed is actually double weed I can't

1999
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:09,829
handle it at all and you know it's the

2000
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,590
it's it was the worst thing back in the

2001
01:25:09,829 --> 01:25:15,640
day and it was a big thing that people

2002
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:19,909
saw a lot and bubble bags really

2003
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:22,970
affected that whole mutant bags

2004
01:25:19,909 --> 01:25:24,739
oh wow look at that go rack em rack em

2005
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:26,390
with some sieve tech I'm just gonna mute

2006
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:31,849
you while you do that cuz that's loud as

2007
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:33,320
[ __ ] in my ears what was my bag oh don't

2008
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:34,780
know don't worry about it dude at all it

2009
01:25:33,319 --> 01:25:37,519
was I love the fact that you're

2010
01:25:34,779 --> 01:25:40,099
processing hash and getting ready to

2011
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,900
make rosin so yeah smash extract sulfur

2012
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:43,820
is such trash I've seen so much hash

2013
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:45,949
ruined it's just unfortunate but it did

2014
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:47,659
affect the growers because back in the

2015
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:49,939
day I was able to go to the BC

2016
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:51,619
compassion Club and explain to them you

2017
01:25:49,939 --> 01:25:53,389
know this this and this actually has

2018
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:54,890
sulfur on it and that's by teaching them

2019
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:56,600
that small trick for having a little bug

2020
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:59,150
lady and on fire holding it under your

2021
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,860
nose even the people who was were doing

2022
01:25:59,149 --> 01:26:02,569
quality control for the BC compassion

2023
01:26:00,859 --> 01:26:04,969
Club back in the day had no idea and

2024
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:07,369
we're unwittingly buying this material

2025
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:08,930
that had sulfur on it so it goes back to

2026
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:10,519
the you know it goes back to show you

2027
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,920
the people are people and you don't have

2028
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:16,790
to be a big company to be a douche bag

2029
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:18,770
very very like small micro grow like

2030
01:26:16,789 --> 01:26:22,159
let's just grow a batch and make some

2031
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:23,660
hash can also be shitty and I've seen it

2032
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,729
even in amazing places like Jamaica

2033
01:26:23,659 --> 01:26:27,739
where the growers are you know these

2034
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:29,809
conscious Rastafarian guys and it's like

2035
01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:32,630
well guess what when it comes between

2036
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:34,760
you not being able to feed your family

2037
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:37,190
or have any money for the next three

2038
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:39,650
months versus I'm just going to pour

2039
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:41,479
poisonous fungicides that are illegal in

2040
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:43,549
other countries on this material so I

2041
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:45,198
can at least crop out you wouldn't

2042
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:47,779
believe how many people choose the

2043
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:51,289
latter and you don't have to be a big

2044
01:26:47,779 --> 01:26:54,679
evil corporation to do that you you know

2045
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:56,988
a very small farmer small hash makers

2046
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:59,239
have been known to do it as well so for

2047
01:26:56,988 --> 01:27:01,669
me I say we get rid of the trust in our

2048
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:03,889
industry and we move into full testing

2049
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:06,020
for everything and I would love to see

2050
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:08,390
it also affect a lot of people want

2051
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:10,699
cannabis to be less regulated I do in

2052
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:12,410
aspects of it but the regulations of

2053
01:27:10,698 --> 01:27:14,750
spraying chemicals and poisons and

2054
01:27:12,409 --> 01:27:16,969
deadly toxins on the plant I love those

2055
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:18,529
regulations being high I love things

2056
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:20,719
being in place where that can be found

2057
01:27:18,529 --> 01:27:23,329
and those people who perpetrate that can

2058
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:27,020
be caught and I also love the idea of

2059
01:27:23,329 --> 01:27:29,420
that system having an influence on our

2060
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:32,890
food water and air systems that are

2061
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:36,319
currently completely have been you know

2062
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:38,360
exposed to a vast varieties of toxins

2063
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:41,359
and poisons and and whatnot it wouldn't

2064
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:43,099
be a bad thing if if our food kind of

2065
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:44,899
picked up a little bit from the cannabis

2066
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,640
industry and maybe tested things a

2067
01:27:44,899 --> 01:27:49,670
little more and maybe when something's

2068
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:51,680
organic and naturally grown we just call

2069
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:53,600
that food and when something's been

2070
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,789
grown with deadly chemicals you know

2071
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,890
instead of the word organic let's make

2072
01:27:55,789 --> 01:27:59,899
them have a [ __ ] word like Chemex

2073
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:01,940
food or whatever yeah this is Chemex

2074
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:04,009
if you want some Chemex Tomatoes by all

2075
01:28:01,939 --> 01:28:06,710
means they're three cents a pound buy as

2076
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:11,090
many as you like you know that that's

2077
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:12,948
that's my opinion anyway I agree it's

2078
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:14,989
maybe that's a good time to break into

2079
01:28:12,948 --> 01:28:17,869
some of those strain stuff or in terms

2080
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:20,479
of specific strains and to like living

2081
01:28:17,869 --> 01:28:22,159
in Maine coming back out of 11 years and

2082
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:24,669
southern hop from Trinity to southern

2083
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:28,069
Humboldt all around in the Emerald I

2084
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:30,859
definitely brought my breeding with me

2085
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:32,689
out there and then back home to Maine so

2086
01:28:30,859 --> 01:28:34,399
what I noticed is in many places

2087
01:28:32,689 --> 01:28:36,829
Northern California can grow just about

2088
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:39,920
anything other than the polar opposites

2089
01:28:36,829 --> 01:28:41,840
of maybe a hard indica hard sativa back

2090
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,369
into Maine I really enjoy Sun growing

2091
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:45,710
I'm growing and you know greenhouse

2092
01:28:43,369 --> 01:28:48,059
automated like indoor as well all if

2093
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:50,250
it's all organic but I know

2094
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:52,680
Maine has really high humidity problem

2095
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:54,810
and each season is different you get

2096
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:57,329
beautiful Sun depending on location and

2097
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:59,700
the water's pristine which is another

2098
01:28:57,329 --> 01:29:01,409
thing coming from a beautiful water

2099
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:03,149
place to move back for the you know the

2100
01:29:01,409 --> 01:29:06,239
plentiful water was amazing but then I'm

2101
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:08,219
battling with high humidity certain grow

2102
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:10,050
seasons being better than others and

2103
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:11,699
definitely have a lock on some strains

2104
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:15,300
that have done well outside that are

2105
01:29:11,699 --> 01:29:17,819
specific to the region more how early

2106
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:20,760
are you guys having to finish out there

2107
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:22,500
in Maine oh man I have on my Instagram I

2108
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,380
actually have a pineapple fields from

2109
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:27,539
dynasty genetics that road till October

2110
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:30,119
30th right on pre-halloween caught this

2111
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:32,609
year I mean though depending I mean it's

2112
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:34,649
we had a later season this last one but

2113
01:29:32,609 --> 01:29:36,210
the one before was an early cut you know

2114
01:29:34,649 --> 01:29:38,279
it was like really kind of harsh into

2115
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:40,590
October after October first it was

2116
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:43,829
pretty pretty rough you needed to be in

2117
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:45,690
a house it was not the outside potential

2118
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:47,189
is kind of gone you died there early

2119
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:49,199
strains I got a lemon sour banana

2120
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:51,029
sherbert I got a Fino to just pry it off

2121
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:54,869
super early like third week September

2122
01:29:51,029 --> 01:29:58,399
outside stop my favorite strain but it's

2123
01:29:54,869 --> 01:29:58,399
beautiful beautiful work and turn the

2124
01:29:58,699 --> 01:30:03,420
tides locked in on but it's really

2125
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:05,789
taking a lot of work to cycle through

2126
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:07,619
plants that don't do well don't finish

2127
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:10,560
well that are susceptible early to the

2128
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:13,050
mill do they test bad for botrytis so

2129
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,180
working through a lot of populations of

2130
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:18,900
plants with just very few keepers like

2131
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:20,850
under hat 3 3 4 types for the outside in

2132
01:30:18,899 --> 01:30:23,369
the main that I keep on and then

2133
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:25,680
obviously indoor I got a whole bunch of

2134
01:30:23,369 --> 01:30:28,800
them so I can only imagine being from

2135
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:32,100
Wisconsin I never successfully pulled

2136
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,750
off a harvest outside working for me

2137
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,370
first year back in helping he that was

2138
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:37,289
from Wisconsin actually and he was

2139
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:40,199
amazed with the how well it went into

2140
01:30:37,289 --> 01:30:42,659
Maine actually but you know it is sight

2141
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:45,300
dependent there's micro climates per

2142
01:30:42,659 --> 01:30:48,329
site I'm in the foothills at like 625

2143
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:50,789
feet so I'm not too low not too high up

2144
01:30:48,329 --> 01:30:52,859
and in a beautiful area just full Sun

2145
01:30:50,789 --> 01:30:54,600
all day beautiful water so it's

2146
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:56,279
dependent site dependent in May it's not

2147
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,940
everywhere it grows for a cannabis but

2148
01:30:56,279 --> 01:31:00,819
uh I have a list I guess maybe just sure

2149
01:30:59,939 --> 01:31:02,559
real quick and

2150
01:31:00,819 --> 01:31:04,630
about my list of strains that make the

2151
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,920
best hash if you want to hear it oh we

2152
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:07,900
definitely want to hear it let's go

2153
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:11,050
through our list starting with best

2154
01:31:07,899 --> 01:31:12,670
friend farms all right well first off I

2155
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:15,250
thought about it I love my own strains

2156
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:17,078
but there's East Coast our diesel to

2157
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:19,899
that original cut headband that we call

2158
01:31:17,078 --> 01:31:21,789
diesel BAM and it's just it's popping

2159
01:31:19,899 --> 01:31:25,059
off grease just you can't even touch it

2160
01:31:21,789 --> 01:31:28,630
the stuff melts the rhein turns to just

2161
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:30,190
terpene resin sauce by the end of even

2162
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:32,199
like a couple months I have a ball

2163
01:31:30,189 --> 01:31:35,049
that's like five six months old and it's

2164
01:31:32,198 --> 01:31:40,388
just completely blob like moose poop in

2165
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:47,560
a jar you know honestly that variety is

2166
01:31:40,389 --> 01:31:49,449
best for I mean rice and water hash okay

2167
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:52,000
yeah we're just that was from cured

2168
01:31:49,448 --> 01:31:54,969
resin cured flour from Sun growing on

2169
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,828
this run of that particular ball and it

2170
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:58,989
no matter indoor out it just seems to

2171
01:31:56,828 --> 01:32:01,420
throw a turkey and profile percentage

2172
01:31:58,988 --> 01:32:03,908
and a reaction of terpene to the resin

2173
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:05,828
like some strains do they just like for

2174
01:32:03,908 --> 01:32:08,229
a classic hash temple ball style it

2175
01:32:05,828 --> 01:32:10,569
breaks the rind right down and it just

2176
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:12,399
turns to blob whereas other strains will

2177
01:32:10,569 --> 01:32:13,988
trap the what I would call like the

2178
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:17,198
cream I don't know how you'd phrase it

2179
01:32:13,988 --> 01:32:19,000
but the creepy innards within the rind

2180
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:21,129
and really form a sealed Rhine the

2181
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,349
diesel band just completely breaks it

2182
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:25,900
down and I remember from back early days

2183
01:32:23,349 --> 01:32:28,179
of the real East Coast Sour Diesel cut

2184
01:32:25,899 --> 01:32:30,698
that that was doing the same thing too

2185
01:32:28,179 --> 01:32:32,618
so I think it's coming from that notice

2186
01:32:30,698 --> 01:32:35,529
the same thing with sour diesels little

2187
01:32:32,618 --> 01:32:37,899
butter a lot easier as well okay that's

2188
01:32:35,529 --> 01:32:40,448
so that's our diesel right there behind

2189
01:32:37,899 --> 01:32:41,738
me that's from fresh frozen but yeah

2190
01:32:40,448 --> 01:32:43,899
it's definitely I feel like that like

2191
01:32:41,738 --> 01:32:46,718
those og kind of terpenes will butter a

2192
01:32:43,899 --> 01:32:50,828
lot easier quicker oh no does anybody

2193
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:52,448
else have that same kind of ID mode I

2194
01:32:50,828 --> 01:32:54,340
noticed it all the time I run another

2195
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:57,428
one that's I called yeah snatched it's a

2196
01:32:54,340 --> 01:33:00,550
headband by kosher cush man and so I Mac

2197
01:32:57,429 --> 01:33:04,270
one it was a Mac timac nail time but it

2198
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:05,500
was too the great cut of kosher and and

2199
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:09,699
then of course the original head

2200
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:11,800
headband cut and that one's just just

2201
01:33:09,698 --> 01:33:13,839
amazed does the same thing most of the

2202
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,710
strains I'm liking to run for my quality

2203
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,529
mics

2204
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:19,630
- classic - temple bawling or Preston

2205
01:33:17,529 --> 01:33:22,059
I'm finding to be what would be called

2206
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:23,170
maybe gasps your strains you know these

2207
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:25,570
days

2208
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:27,969
I got a coaster Mac what is it a kosher

2209
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:29,920
Mac Trey along with that coach or Mac

2210
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:31,960
head band that are my top three with the

2211
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:35,260
diesel band but underneath diesel band

2212
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:37,719
and then two ended I go 24 karat gold

2213
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:40,710
from DNA does amazing work it's one of

2214
01:33:37,719 --> 01:33:45,090
my favorites to smoke that kosher tangi

2215
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:47,649
yes they enough over here what's that

2216
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:48,850
24k is my all-time favorite over here I

2217
01:33:47,649 --> 01:33:53,829
have a few beautiful

2218
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:56,050
comps and last fruit it dumps down like

2219
01:33:53,829 --> 01:33:57,250
that orange is pretty played out but

2220
01:33:56,050 --> 01:34:00,640
when people get their hands on this one

2221
01:33:57,250 --> 01:34:05,789
they're back into the orange yeah we got

2222
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:08,800
us confused and the growth but the

2223
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:10,930
flower is just people kind of hear it

2224
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,570
and go oh tangi played out a little bit

2225
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:15,369
or kosher it's not like that it stays

2226
01:34:13,569 --> 01:34:17,949
right in my jar on the table with the

2227
01:34:15,369 --> 01:34:20,199
headband diesel bands like thing and

2228
01:34:17,949 --> 01:34:22,869
then tray start from top dog seeds

2229
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:25,988
actually turns out some like really

2230
01:34:22,869 --> 01:34:28,539
fiery really fire you Afghan one two

2231
01:34:25,988 --> 01:34:30,488
there trace our dog or star dog work and

2232
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:33,729
I'm just getting some old like greasy

2233
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:35,439
type looking quality - that you know -

2234
01:34:33,729 --> 01:34:37,718
throw it back I grew up with you know

2235
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:40,089
Moroccan super Keef and a Nepalese

2236
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:43,000
temple ball honestly as being my

2237
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:44,170
favorites to throw back to so that's

2238
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,539
where I'm kind of looking for those

2239
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:48,880
resins that will form for me like that I

2240
01:34:46,539 --> 01:34:53,140
wanted to ask can you force flower

2241
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:56,350
plants out with the Sun in Maine or

2242
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:58,239
light you light it light that's my spine

2243
01:34:56,350 --> 01:35:00,850
that's my backbone I was trained from

2244
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:02,709
okay six or seven

2245
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:04,420
honestly in Northern California and I

2246
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:07,090
just stuck to it someone threw me in the

2247
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:10,210
mix that there you go and I kind of went

2248
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:12,550
whoa and honestly turned oh yeah like

2249
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:14,560
you know a really big turn of really

2250
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:16,180
really good for slaughter and I do I

2251
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,000
stick the light up all the time

2252
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:21,610
I guess my another question would be

2253
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,039
you're using lights in that and they're

2254
01:35:21,609 --> 01:35:25,899
too great I'm not supplementing myself

2255
01:35:24,039 --> 01:35:28,670
okay so no lights in that just just the

2256
01:35:25,899 --> 01:35:30,109
black trick and I just manipulate light

2257
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:31,970
structure which I think for like Maine

2258
01:35:30,109 --> 01:35:33,649
or even into Canada it's kinda can be

2259
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:35,930
crucial you know in terms of getting the

2260
01:35:33,649 --> 01:35:37,729
potential out of your grow season and to

2261
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:40,130
grow types that wouldn't normally grow

2262
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:42,349
outside sun-grown for my Terps in demand

2263
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:50,210
I can pull almost anything you know in

2264
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:55,390
the gap that's awesome we ran a weasel

2265
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:55,390
skunk from nature farm this year

2266
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:04,130
original diesel and skunk eighteen and

2267
01:36:00,369 --> 01:36:06,769
so far I'm absolutely loving it it's

2268
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:11,539
it's really really greasy but it's not

2269
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:23,840
like too hard to work with and yeah it's

2270
01:36:11,539 --> 01:36:26,420
like sorry it looks like yeah I agree

2271
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:29,350
yeah I mean it's just like it's just and

2272
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:33,500
I agree like a lot and also like the the

2273
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:41,840
piney strains I notice will be like

2274
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:45,109
really greasy to brand last year we ran

2275
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:49,789
was escape scapegoat escape boat

2276
01:36:45,109 --> 01:37:02,929
genetics Dale Denton and it's a nom nom

2277
01:36:49,789 --> 01:37:06,769
with no pineapple trainwreck and that

2278
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:09,289
was phenomenal that was one of our

2279
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:11,780
favorites last year and it was that it

2280
01:37:09,289 --> 01:37:15,890
was that total grease to that like apple

2281
01:37:11,779 --> 01:37:17,840
apple jelly type yeah

2282
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:19,610
good relationship between the terpene

2283
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,829
profile and the resins it's interesting

2284
01:37:19,609 --> 01:37:24,710
to see how they react over time and

2285
01:37:21,829 --> 01:37:28,430
curing and it's no doubt yeah cause like

2286
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:32,000
cuz the GMO like one we really love for

2287
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:37,280
hashing it's really like more savory

2288
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:42,050
turps and it's definitely more stable

2289
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:45,739
like it does you give it some heat

2290
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:49,520
definitely grease up with it yeah but

2291
01:37:45,739 --> 01:37:53,179
but it not as much as not as much as

2292
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:55,310
others it it's more it's more stable and

2293
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:57,200
it'll stay stable and warmer

2294
01:37:55,310 --> 01:38:00,650
temperatures more than than other

2295
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:02,599
strains that's interesting I know that

2296
01:38:00,649 --> 01:38:05,119
Super Skunk seems to really pull through

2297
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:07,010
that diesel ban that math super stunk I

2298
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:09,229
believe that's in that lineage and

2299
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:11,900
that's that got that extreme good just

2300
01:38:09,229 --> 01:38:15,639
skunky diesel taste but also the terpene

2301
01:38:11,899 --> 01:38:15,639
resin Pro you know relationship

2302
01:38:16,498 --> 01:38:21,998
awesome good everyone sharing I could

2303
01:38:19,269 --> 01:38:24,239
share like probably a hundred but I'm

2304
01:38:21,998 --> 01:38:26,889
not going to because that's ridiculous

2305
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:29,228
probably one of my all-time favorites

2306
01:38:26,889 --> 01:38:31,328
from back in the day would be the Rene

2307
01:38:29,229 --> 01:38:33,820
and that was really the cultivar that

2308
01:38:31,328 --> 01:38:35,590
started that you know bubble bags as a

2309
01:38:33,819 --> 01:38:38,259
company because it was the first

2310
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:40,449
cultivar that I gained access to in

2311
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:42,550
large amounts that I was able to

2312
01:38:40,448 --> 01:38:44,589
consistently make hash out of that would

2313
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:47,369
you know come out white and eventually

2314
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:49,659
when I would let it air-dry and whatnot

2315
01:38:47,368 --> 01:38:52,268
it would it would turn like stained

2316
01:38:49,658 --> 01:38:53,799
glass window like in a church you know

2317
01:38:52,269 --> 01:38:55,599
would be these different like reds and

2318
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,038
oranges and Amber's and you could just

2319
01:38:55,599 --> 01:38:59,769
like see through it it was a little

2320
01:38:57,038 --> 01:39:02,498
foggy and that was that was that was

2321
01:38:59,769 --> 01:39:04,900
full full amounts like it was that was

2322
01:39:02,498 --> 01:39:06,698
six star hash and one of the things I

2323
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:08,558
loved about it I mean one of the things

2324
01:39:06,698 --> 01:39:10,988
I didn't love about it was the terpene

2325
01:39:08,559 --> 01:39:12,909
profile and I'm sure I got this wrong

2326
01:39:10,988 --> 01:39:15,339
back in the day what we really said and

2327
01:39:12,908 --> 01:39:17,438
we based this on the fact that the water

2328
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:19,748
didn't retain the smell when you ran

2329
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:22,510
Rene instead the smell was retained in

2330
01:39:19,748 --> 01:39:25,658
the resin so I had assumed that somehow

2331
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:27,369
you know they were water soluble the

2332
01:39:25,658 --> 01:39:29,138
ones in the majority of cultivars and

2333
01:39:27,368 --> 01:39:31,299
that the alcohol soluble terpenes

2334
01:39:29,139 --> 01:39:31,840
perhaps were not and did not wash out

2335
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,579
further

2336
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:35,889
for whatever reason I don't know if

2337
01:39:33,578 --> 01:39:37,958
that's correct I'm sure if dr. mark was

2338
01:39:35,889 --> 01:39:40,150
here he'd be like actually this is

2339
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:45,069
what's happening but the bottom line is

2340
01:39:40,149 --> 01:39:48,908
is that yeah those those resins those

2341
01:39:45,069 --> 01:39:50,918
terpenes when you washed Rene were so so

2342
01:39:48,908 --> 01:39:53,288
strong in the hash it still smelt like a

2343
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:56,260
half pound of the bud and in fact the

2344
01:39:53,288 --> 01:39:59,288
cultivar was nicknamed this is a

2345
01:39:56,260 --> 01:40:01,780
terrible nickname plot to get you busted

2346
01:39:59,288 --> 01:40:03,069
it was pot to get you busted I got so

2347
01:40:01,779 --> 01:40:05,800
many friends kicked out of hotel rooms

2348
01:40:03,069 --> 01:40:08,380
my friend got arrested on a bicycle

2349
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:10,869
he had a half pound of it in his

2350
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:13,239
backpack riding his bike in downtown

2351
01:40:10,868 --> 01:40:15,819
Vancouver and some bike cops went by him

2352
01:40:13,238 --> 01:40:19,448
and caught the with this [ __ ] was dank

2353
01:40:15,819 --> 01:40:22,899
it was like if you remember hime down in

2354
01:40:19,448 --> 01:40:25,178
the Pacific Northwest he did a strain

2355
01:40:22,899 --> 01:40:27,368
years ago called the dab the dank ass

2356
01:40:25,179 --> 01:40:28,599
[ __ ] and it had like the Emerald

2357
01:40:27,368 --> 01:40:30,788
triangle fog

2358
01:40:28,599 --> 01:40:32,649
and some other cultivar in it anyway

2359
01:40:30,788 --> 01:40:35,800
there was that was reminiscent of the

2360
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:38,349
Renee the Renee had the funk and the

2361
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:41,019
funk was like you couldn't escape it

2362
01:40:38,349 --> 01:40:43,538
the smallest amount of it would wreak up

2363
01:40:41,019 --> 01:40:46,179
your house in a seriously heat score

2364
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:48,788
manner like I had a butt of it in my

2365
01:40:46,179 --> 01:40:50,828
pocket one time like 10 hours had gone

2366
01:40:48,788 --> 01:40:52,538
by I went Christmas shopping did all the

2367
01:40:50,828 --> 01:40:55,929
stuff went through a roadblock

2368
01:40:52,538 --> 01:40:58,599
the cop was like pull over there the

2369
01:40:55,929 --> 01:41:00,849
expert comes over the RCMP who's who

2370
01:40:58,599 --> 01:41:02,788
says I am an expert in marijuana

2371
01:41:00,849 --> 01:41:05,828
grow-ops I've been in over a hundred

2372
01:41:02,788 --> 01:41:08,918
this is what he said to me and I can

2373
01:41:05,828 --> 01:41:11,498
tell you've just been in a marijuana

2374
01:41:08,918 --> 01:41:13,658
grow up and I said listen man I'm gonna

2375
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:15,788
be super honest with you because a I'm

2376
01:41:13,658 --> 01:41:18,429
sure on your computer it shows that at a

2377
01:41:15,788 --> 01:41:21,009
roadblock just like this not too long

2378
01:41:18,429 --> 01:41:23,708
ago I got busted was 16 and a half pound

2379
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:26,559
a pounds of herb and about six grand

2380
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:29,078
cash and I knew he had seen that and I

2381
01:41:26,559 --> 01:41:30,849
was so confident I and I had presents

2382
01:41:29,078 --> 01:41:33,788
wrapped in the vehicle I was so

2383
01:41:30,849 --> 01:41:35,109
confident I said I promise you I am NOT

2384
01:41:33,788 --> 01:41:37,059
an idiot I

2385
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:39,609
there is no cannabis in my car

2386
01:41:37,059 --> 01:41:42,159
whatsoever and if you smell my pocket I

2387
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:44,349
had a small bud in there about ten hours

2388
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:46,898
ago and he leaned in and smelled my

2389
01:41:44,349 --> 01:41:48,668
pocket and completely believed me and

2390
01:41:46,899 --> 01:41:51,309
let and let me drive away and it was the

2391
01:41:48,668 --> 01:41:52,898
truth so that's my all-time favorite

2392
01:41:51,309 --> 01:41:56,349
hash making cultivar if you've got a

2393
01:41:52,899 --> 01:41:58,959
cultivar where the smell does not stay

2394
01:41:56,349 --> 01:42:01,418
in the water you know the more of that

2395
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:04,418
of those terpenes that can transpire

2396
01:42:01,418 --> 01:42:06,639
into the hash those are the cultivars

2397
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:09,429
that you want for producing full melt

2398
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:12,519
because I'm quite certain it's the

2399
01:42:09,429 --> 01:42:16,269
terpene profile that is most responsible

2400
01:42:12,519 --> 01:42:19,139
for the melt aspect of the hash so

2401
01:42:16,269 --> 01:42:19,139
that's my two cents

2402
01:42:21,779 --> 01:42:27,519
this is really our tops can we talk

2403
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:29,350
about water for a second without going

2404
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:32,530
off all day on water because I know we

2405
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:34,780
could we could do that but do it I just

2406
01:42:32,529 --> 01:42:38,198
wanted to see if everybody really uses

2407
01:42:34,779 --> 01:42:41,109
our Oh and yes I also wanted to say it's

2408
01:42:38,198 --> 01:42:45,339
not necessarily I mean it from for me at

2409
01:42:41,109 --> 01:42:49,029
least that's a lot of water like our Oh

2410
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:51,850
making it's a lot of wasted water it's

2411
01:42:49,029 --> 01:42:53,859
hella wasteful and and you know like if

2412
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:56,469
you have clean water you got a set like

2413
01:42:53,859 --> 01:42:58,420
a bunch of sad filters maybe your carbon

2414
01:42:56,469 --> 01:43:00,158
filter on you know like get some things

2415
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:05,079
going on we're fill it depends on where

2416
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:09,189
you are - I don't want to go you know

2417
01:43:05,079 --> 01:43:11,859
compromise build water a sediment filter

2418
01:43:09,189 --> 01:43:13,599
right off the spring up on the hill is

2419
01:43:11,859 --> 01:43:15,670
some of the best water you can use for

2420
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,449
me that's yeah yeah sentiment and

2421
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:18,158
dechlorinator

2422
01:43:16,448 --> 01:43:19,839
that's all I really use I mean I'm

2423
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:22,000
important so I'm fortunate to have

2424
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:25,600
fantastic water here just through that

2425
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,908
it comes out at 0 ppm so yeah I'm

2426
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,710
gallons per minute we're doing 20

2427
01:43:27,908 --> 01:43:31,569
gallons per minute 22 gallons a minute

2428
01:43:29,710 --> 01:43:33,939
refresh hole in main on my well it's

2429
01:43:31,569 --> 01:43:36,549
like a 350 foot it's well water just

2430
01:43:33,939 --> 01:43:38,500
pristine running through some testing

2431
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:39,940
and just like carbon filtration right

2432
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:42,310
now but looking into even advanced

2433
01:43:39,939 --> 01:43:44,919
filtration for the sediment when such

2434
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:46,929
but you know it's not Babylon water

2435
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:48,908
supply so it's not bleached and

2436
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:50,739
chloramine and chloramine and whatever

2437
01:43:48,908 --> 01:43:52,948
else that you got a strip out which I

2438
01:43:50,738 --> 01:43:56,829
would do if I'm in the environment yeah

2439
01:43:52,948 --> 01:43:58,629
yeah down here in Sebastopol we can't we

2440
01:43:56,829 --> 01:44:01,600
have to run in our off the waters

2441
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:04,060
horrible but living up in northern Mendo

2442
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,610
up on hill man we literally down a

2443
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:11,350
plastic tube from the Springboks through

2444
01:44:06,609 --> 01:44:13,988
a semi the ship like 39 degrees coming

2445
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:16,600
off the hill you know barely had to use

2446
01:44:13,988 --> 01:44:18,279
any ice nothing beats that I had that

2447
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:20,079
for six years when I lived on the water

2448
01:44:18,279 --> 01:44:22,539
we pulled our water out of the creek

2449
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:23,769
that went right into the ocean and it

2450
01:44:22,539 --> 01:44:25,719
was just you know a nice little

2451
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:28,280
filtration system going down to like

2452
01:44:25,719 --> 01:44:31,939
point zero 5 micron or something and

2453
01:44:28,279 --> 01:44:33,229
we had we didn't have to dechlorinate or

2454
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:35,479
anything cuz it was just literally

2455
01:44:33,229 --> 01:44:38,629
coming right off right off the mountain

2456
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:42,288
it was great water I've made wash with

2457
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:44,710
water all over the world and obviously

2458
01:44:42,288 --> 01:44:48,050
when you can control and condition and

2459
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:50,090
you know control all the parameters of

2460
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:52,670
your water perhaps you know I think as

2461
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:54,078
hash makers that more people would do it

2462
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:56,929
and play around with it if they had

2463
01:44:54,078 --> 01:44:59,328
access to really play around with the pH

2464
01:44:56,929 --> 01:45:02,059
of their water and see how the resin

2465
01:44:59,328 --> 01:45:05,599
reacts differently on the alkaline side

2466
01:45:02,059 --> 01:45:08,119
versus the acidic side of your water so

2467
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:10,038
yeah having an RO unit is great and

2468
01:45:08,118 --> 01:45:12,769
having filters depending on where you're

2469
01:45:10,038 --> 01:45:14,719
pulling your water from really it's easy

2470
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:17,869
to find out what you need for your water

2471
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:20,149
filtration system go get your water test

2472
01:45:17,868 --> 01:45:21,679
it when you find out what's in it you

2473
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:23,719
can then find out the methods of

2474
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:25,368
removing each of those things and then

2475
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:27,889
those are the things that you require to

2476
01:45:25,368 --> 01:45:30,139
clean your water and get it ready for

2477
01:45:27,889 --> 01:45:32,659
nice water extraction I remember you

2478
01:45:30,139 --> 01:45:35,000
making a big old ball of some really -

2479
01:45:32,658 --> 01:45:37,819
on a video from way my way back that

2480
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,760
with you Marcus that was actually in

2481
01:45:37,819 --> 01:45:42,469
Jamaica in the in the back you know in

2482
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:44,270
the bushes Jamaica I remember like big

2483
01:45:42,469 --> 01:45:46,880
old barrels and then just coming out

2484
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:49,460
with this like grapefruit sized swirl

2485
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:51,020
eagle acts like that's motivation for me

2486
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:52,550
with those swirly balls that were

2487
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:54,770
falling and stuff just seeing it done

2488
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:57,800
out there do you want to hear motivation

2489
01:45:54,770 --> 01:46:03,050
we walked for an hour and a half with

2490
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:06,320
I'm telling you like it had to be maybe

2491
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:08,719
a hundred pounds of ice I wondered if

2492
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:10,279
you had a generator like no no no dude

2493
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:11,899
we this was in the bush we had nothing

2494
01:46:10,279 --> 01:46:14,328
we walked for an hour and a half and

2495
01:46:11,899 --> 01:46:16,638
everyone took their turn carrying this

2496
01:46:14,328 --> 01:46:17,710
[ __ ] thing of ice on their head it

2497
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:20,359
didn't matter who you were

2498
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:22,038
gypsy Nirvana definitely did it probably

2499
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:24,589
for the shortest amount of time Wally

2500
01:46:22,038 --> 01:46:26,509
the Australian Wally duck if you

2501
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:28,849
remember that guy what an amazing

2502
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:30,679
character he was it was nothing for him

2503
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:33,050
to work and he was a kind of a little

2504
01:46:30,679 --> 01:46:36,078
guy it was nothing for him to work in

2505
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:37,909
like plus 35 degrees or whatever like

2506
01:46:36,078 --> 01:46:40,038
it's 100 degrees in Jamaica like in the

2507
01:46:37,908 --> 01:46:41,728
shape and so we're climbing we're

2508
01:46:40,038 --> 01:46:43,889
carrying this ice I did it as well

2509
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:46,708
it was pretty hardcore and when we got

2510
01:46:43,889 --> 01:46:49,078
there I was like oh so what should i mix

2511
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:51,538
with and he just gave me like a fence

2512
01:46:49,078 --> 01:46:54,179
post that he had like carved to kind of

2513
01:46:51,538 --> 01:46:56,038
like a handle into and I was like all

2514
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:58,288
right so I straight like was doing this

2515
01:46:56,038 --> 01:47:02,340
like with 20 gallon batches they had a

2516
01:46:58,288 --> 01:47:04,559
mountain of herb in that place and the

2517
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:07,679
look on his face and how happy he was

2518
01:47:04,559 --> 01:47:10,050
when I took his you know subpar sort of

2519
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:11,849
mid-grade Jamaican weed and turned it

2520
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:13,708
into a decent for him

2521
01:47:11,849 --> 01:47:16,949
I mean I didn't smoke it I'll be honest

2522
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:19,349
no I went home I went home and actually

2523
01:47:16,948 --> 01:47:21,238
made my own which was what that big ball

2524
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:23,099
that you saw was I didn't make that at

2525
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:24,868
the place that looked like that I went

2526
01:47:23,099 --> 01:47:26,729
and doubled up and went and I was like

2527
01:47:24,868 --> 01:47:28,679
okay now I got to go home and make good

2528
01:47:26,729 --> 01:47:31,829
hash so thanks for setting up that

2529
01:47:28,679 --> 01:47:35,368
meeting gypsy she's a wonderful person

2530
01:47:31,828 --> 01:47:37,828
is awesome yeah yeah good good friend

2531
01:47:35,368 --> 01:47:39,719
with him good good times with gypsy all

2532
01:47:37,828 --> 01:47:42,420
over the world we've had some adventures

2533
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:43,618
so it's a good thing about cannabis it

2534
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:45,958
really pulls you in these different

2535
01:47:43,618 --> 01:47:47,698
directions it can pull you especially

2536
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:49,380
the hash you know like there's hash

2537
01:47:47,698 --> 01:47:51,719
producing countries that every hash

2538
01:47:49,380 --> 01:48:02,998
maker probably at one point in time may

2539
01:47:51,719 --> 01:48:07,139
want to go check out yeah that's gonna

2540
01:48:02,998 --> 01:48:09,538
be my topic ice we've got ice the idea

2541
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:12,690
go ahead before we talk about the ice I

2542
01:48:09,538 --> 01:48:15,198
like the idea of and we're not doing

2543
01:48:12,689 --> 01:48:20,189
this really I'm the on a full-scale yet

2544
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:22,978
but we'd like to like actually like when

2545
01:48:20,189 --> 01:48:28,009
you're done with awash saving that water

2546
01:48:22,979 --> 01:48:28,010
in a reservoir and fermenting it and

2547
01:48:28,309 --> 01:48:33,300
using that to feed back into the garden

2548
01:48:30,569 --> 01:48:36,689
makes because that at least work where

2549
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:38,998
we do it out a seasonal you know

2550
01:48:36,689 --> 01:48:41,969
seasonal scale so we make hash in the

2551
01:48:38,998 --> 01:48:45,389
winter we grow plants in the summer type

2552
01:48:41,969 --> 01:48:47,158
deal so absolutely put anything anything

2553
01:48:45,389 --> 01:48:49,618
you possibly can that came out of the

2554
01:48:47,158 --> 01:48:53,238
garden back into the into the ground

2555
01:48:49,618 --> 01:48:53,238
feed the feed your soil

2556
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:59,920
and make sure your soil is clean because

2557
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:02,920
hemp cannabis it's a fighter immediate

2558
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:06,460
of plants it will literally pull toxic

2559
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:09,309
heavy metals etc out of your soil if

2560
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:12,340
they're present so test your water test

2561
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:15,340
your soil those are great ways to open

2562
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:17,199
the door to well how am I gonna know how

2563
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:19,449
am I gonna know what kind of filters I

2564
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:21,609
need how am I gonna know you know well

2565
01:49:19,448 --> 01:49:23,979
you'll know by testing your soil and

2566
01:49:21,609 --> 01:49:25,779
testing your water pretty good spot to

2567
01:49:23,979 --> 01:49:30,218
start if you want to start down the road

2568
01:49:25,779 --> 01:49:31,658
as of a cannabis grower which is

2569
01:49:30,219 --> 01:49:34,448
definitely the best way if you can

2570
01:49:31,658 --> 01:49:37,359
because you really have to have full

2571
01:49:34,448 --> 01:49:40,598
access and when someone else is growing

2572
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:42,960
your inputs because um you know they'll

2573
01:49:40,599 --> 01:49:45,069
show you everything sometimes except

2574
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,929
maybe something that they shouldn't have

2575
01:49:45,069 --> 01:49:49,859
been spraying or feeding the plants at

2576
01:49:46,929 --> 01:49:52,239
one point in time in its life and that's

2577
01:49:49,859 --> 01:49:55,779
it's a tough one because it's also

2578
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:57,459
connected to a way of life and Oh like

2579
01:49:55,779 --> 01:49:59,050
you've built a family and you're taking

2580
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:00,670
care of this whole group of people and

2581
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:03,279
you have these dependents and now your

2582
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:05,349
crop is about to die and you're in this

2583
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:07,809
position where it's like holy [ __ ] like

2584
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:11,050
we just need to squeeze another couple

2585
01:50:07,809 --> 01:50:14,409
of weeks out of this I get it but it

2586
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:17,409
sucks and it's especially sucks for

2587
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:20,138
people who are the ones that end up on

2588
01:50:17,408 --> 01:50:22,479
the wrong end of that I wish there was a

2589
01:50:20,139 --> 01:50:25,840
better way I wish that cannabis farmers

2590
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:27,368
could be insured you know like how great

2591
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:30,670
would that be it's like not not for

2592
01:50:27,368 --> 01:50:32,889
stupidity but like you know legitimate

2593
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:34,840
like you did everything right and and

2594
01:50:32,889 --> 01:50:37,179
something still kind of found its way

2595
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:38,679
and got in it'd be nice if you could

2596
01:50:37,179 --> 01:50:41,109
probably dream me in a utopian world

2597
01:50:38,679 --> 01:50:42,908
here but hey 25 years ago I thought a

2598
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:44,769
utopian world would be being able to go

2599
01:50:42,908 --> 01:50:49,539
to a store and buy a legal fashion herb

2600
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:52,000
right that's what's up all right so

2601
01:50:49,539 --> 01:50:54,099
we've got almost 11 a.m. what I have to

2602
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,380
figure out is are we just gonna continue

2603
01:50:54,099 --> 01:50:59,260
on with this panel and finish off the

2604
01:50:56,380 --> 01:51:01,659
day and do the rosin panel next week or

2605
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:05,289
are we gonna end this panel and invite

2606
01:51:01,658 --> 01:51:06,488
the rosin panel in at 11 o'clock you go

2607
01:51:05,289 --> 01:51:08,560
what are you guys feeling you guys have

2608
01:51:06,488 --> 01:51:10,449
a couple of how do you feel

2609
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,890
I mean we could probably keep talking we

2610
01:51:10,449 --> 01:51:14,800
could probably talk again but you're the

2611
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:17,800
one that has to sit in here for another

2612
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:20,020
I like well I'd like to be able to talk

2613
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:21,970
more about hash making for sure this is

2614
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:25,180
hashed Church and I'm sure the rosin

2615
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:27,010
folks would understand if we pushed if

2616
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:29,770
we push the rosin episode till next

2617
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:31,390
Sunday because we haven't really we

2618
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:33,840
haven't talked about it a lot you know

2619
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:37,329
even all of us haven't given our

2620
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:39,730
cultivars we've got one two three four

2621
01:51:37,329 --> 01:51:41,890
five six about seven eight cultivars

2622
01:51:39,729 --> 01:51:43,269
that three or four of us have mentioned

2623
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:45,640
but there's still quite a few people in

2624
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:47,260
the room who haven't mentioned their

2625
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:49,750
favorite cultivars I know that'll be a

2626
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:52,150
part people like go back to and rewind

2627
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:54,670
and try to write those cultivars down

2628
01:51:52,149 --> 01:51:58,029
because that's you know we're basically

2629
01:51:54,670 --> 01:52:00,970
giving you a full melt certification of

2630
01:51:58,029 --> 01:52:02,920
cultivars and along with that we will

2631
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:06,369
also let you know how the cannabis was

2632
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:08,079
grown if we know that so that that might

2633
01:52:06,369 --> 01:52:09,880
be helpful because you know maybe you're

2634
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:11,229
doing a hydro grow and this is only

2635
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:14,199
gonna really do that this this

2636
01:52:11,229 --> 01:52:16,059
particular way in dirt or you know vice

2637
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:18,639
versa or something so yeah if anyone

2638
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:21,340
else wants to share some cultivars I'm

2639
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:25,810
sure everyone's listening and we have by

2640
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:28,270
the way 864 people listening which is

2641
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:31,030
the most we've had in a live audience in

2642
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:33,100
2020 so that's really good when hashed

2643
01:52:31,029 --> 01:52:37,210
Church was at its peak we would have

2644
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:41,050
about a thousand people a week watching

2645
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:45,220
live so great job panel for bringing in

2646
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:48,070
bringing in almost 900 people have tell

2647
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:50,440
me a cultivars one of the clips of ours

2648
01:52:48,069 --> 01:52:53,170
I really enjoyed working with this year

2649
01:52:50,439 --> 01:52:55,029
I know Flynn and resin ranch work with

2650
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:57,220
it a lot as well and it's been around

2651
01:52:55,029 --> 01:53:00,279
for a while it was a cookies and cream

2652
01:52:57,220 --> 01:53:03,220
you know it grows very well I've had

2653
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:06,639
success with it indoor/outdoor and in a

2654
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:08,829
debt and did you know it pretty much

2655
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:12,100
does to work for you in the bags as far

2656
01:53:08,829 --> 01:53:14,649
as the 90 to 120 goes and you know it

2657
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:18,250
rosin is great as well dries very nicely

2658
01:53:14,649 --> 01:53:20,739
it's a very stable and easy resin to

2659
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:21,970
work with and it presses very well and

2660
01:53:20,739 --> 01:53:23,800
it's just a

2661
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:26,550
it's all around you know checks all

2662
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:28,329
boxes for me looks appeal yield

2663
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:31,239
presentation that all the way through

2664
01:53:28,329 --> 01:53:33,760
and I even am venturing out into running

2665
01:53:31,239 --> 01:53:35,889
some CNC crosses and other stuff mixed

2666
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:38,560
with it and that's definitely one that

2667
01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:39,970
I'm gonna keep around and keep working

2668
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:43,420
with especially all the different all

2669
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:45,490
the different fee knows we ran the 5 and

2670
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:46,810
the 7 and the 13 this year and they're

2671
01:53:45,489 --> 01:53:49,929
all a little different in their own way

2672
01:53:46,810 --> 01:53:51,990
but they all make super great hash and I

2673
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:54,780
enjoyed working with each one of them

2674
01:53:51,989 --> 01:53:57,550
agreed I've got some concentrated X

2675
01:53:54,779 --> 01:54:00,880
cookies-and-cream right here and it is

2676
01:53:57,550 --> 01:54:03,460
absolute fire fair hash brand that's

2677
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,859
rosin strain I've seen around even four

2678
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:08,890
or five years agos with half hash it was

2679
01:54:05,859 --> 01:54:12,089
dumping just the just milky rosin even

2680
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:14,740
from just cured cured flour don't do

2681
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:16,989
beautiful yeah that in the Kimbo Kush

2682
01:54:14,739 --> 01:54:19,239
the Kimbo Kush you know similar genetic

2683
01:54:16,989 --> 01:54:20,769
line was fantastic I remember the first

2684
01:54:19,239 --> 01:54:22,719
time I washed it it was like oh that's

2685
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:25,570
why Cuban won all those cups like this

2686
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:27,430
[ __ ] dunks and it just is amazing and

2687
01:54:25,569 --> 01:54:30,759
that was from dry material I could only

2688
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:32,680
imagine but if I got fresh frozen but

2689
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:34,480
another one I like to do is my personal

2690
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:38,079
favors OG PI breath that's what I've

2691
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:40,929
been running it's a solid Fino tex all

2692
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:43,000
boxes as well pretty stable I've been

2693
01:54:40,930 --> 01:54:45,310
trying to search through seeds to see

2694
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,930
something new and I just can't find

2695
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:48,670
anything that really has beaten it for

2696
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:50,820
the last five years so I just keep

2697
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:50,819
running

2698
01:54:52,979 --> 01:55:03,698
we ran we watched some peanut-butter

2699
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:06,309
breath from a local grower last year and

2700
01:55:03,698 --> 01:55:09,538
it washed really really well

2701
01:55:06,309 --> 01:55:13,090
and we've been wanting to try growing it

2702
01:55:09,538 --> 01:55:13,599
just thought I'd mention it awesome keep

2703
01:55:13,090 --> 01:55:15,519
them coming

2704
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:18,309
keep them coming I'll throw one down DNA

2705
01:55:15,519 --> 01:55:34,389
genetics strawberry-banana one of the

2706
01:55:18,309 --> 01:55:37,360
best out there in white and everything I

2707
01:55:34,389 --> 01:55:39,400
run their white walk or two even as like

2708
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:42,189
a classic hash strain for a really good

2709
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:44,920
indica temple ball cured resin temple

2710
01:55:42,189 --> 01:55:46,808
ball strain makes a shiny coating on the

2711
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:49,210
outside of the white Walker balls and

2712
01:55:46,809 --> 01:55:51,849
just nice octopi nice free on the inside

2713
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:54,130
but it's one of our indica choices more

2714
01:55:51,849 --> 01:55:56,078
individuals if you scroll through my

2715
01:55:54,130 --> 01:56:00,849
feet on IG you're gonna see a lot of

2716
01:55:56,078 --> 01:56:02,948
banana OG it is very similar to that

2717
01:56:00,849 --> 01:56:04,989
strontium I mean I haven't ran the straw

2718
01:56:02,948 --> 01:56:07,089
Nana Buddha from what would I've heard

2719
01:56:04,988 --> 01:56:09,968
from soil grown and other folks that

2720
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:13,748
have run it very similar you know white

2721
01:56:09,969 --> 01:56:17,649
in every bag very heavy yielding maybe a

2722
01:56:13,748 --> 01:56:21,849
high wax content why it's so Crockett's

2723
01:56:17,649 --> 01:56:23,649
finally and say to me there's different

2724
01:56:21,849 --> 01:56:26,529
cuts floating around there's like that

2725
01:56:23,649 --> 01:56:29,408
straw Nana the 14 is what I hear people

2726
01:56:26,529 --> 01:56:32,380
refer to it as you know to me that's

2727
01:56:29,408 --> 01:56:34,448
really big yields and it's great unto

2728
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:35,980
itself and then there's also this other

2729
01:56:34,448 --> 01:56:38,589
cut going around called strawberry

2730
01:56:35,979 --> 01:56:41,888
banana that's you know to me they're two

2731
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:45,279
different things the strawberry banana

2732
01:56:41,889 --> 01:56:49,359
is more closely related to the banana OG

2733
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:51,488
that I see around the straw man is more

2734
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:54,248
speared out kind of different structure

2735
01:56:51,488 --> 01:56:56,768
but uh that strawberry banana I

2736
01:56:54,248 --> 01:56:59,979
personally prefer over the strong Anna

2737
01:56:56,769 --> 01:57:02,530
fourteener I get like six point three

2738
01:56:59,979 --> 01:57:06,250
five percent melt back on fresh frozen

2739
01:57:02,529 --> 01:57:08,769
material the dumps super chirpy and

2740
01:57:06,250 --> 01:57:09,939
washing it for years but everyone still

2741
01:57:08,770 --> 01:57:12,850
loves it smells like a strawberry

2742
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:13,539
milkshake you know like people can't get

2743
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:17,410
enough of it

2744
01:57:13,539 --> 01:57:19,569
dad banana that you wash goes something

2745
01:57:17,409 --> 01:57:22,119
really fire to that you know that you

2746
01:57:19,569 --> 01:57:24,340
have a super special I get to try some

2747
01:57:22,119 --> 01:57:26,019
of the last time we hung out I really

2748
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:29,470
enjoyed those one my favorite bananas

2749
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:31,750
good try it's just a super awesome

2750
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:33,699
banana og cut that's been up here in the

2751
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:35,800
humbled area for years like again I

2752
01:57:33,699 --> 01:57:37,179
think it's probably a few banana oh geez

2753
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:39,340
out there but that one that you're

2754
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:42,820
talking about it does stand out it's

2755
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:46,119
just super candy banana it's awesome man

2756
01:57:42,819 --> 01:57:47,949

2757
01:57:46,119 --> 01:57:50,019
that comes in pretty hot too with the

2758
01:57:47,949 --> 01:57:53,380
Crockett right behind with DNA project

2759
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:54,850
there on this tangi thrown in on the

2760
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:57,369
strawberry banana had some really good

2761
01:57:54,850 --> 01:57:59,800
phenols of Strawberry Fields five four

2762
01:57:57,369 --> 01:58:01,569
five years ago out there and they've

2763
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:03,730
carried into my genetic program actually

2764
01:58:01,569 --> 01:58:06,059
today I do a Clementine cookies and

2765
01:58:03,729 --> 01:58:09,219
cream actually to my angel food cake and

2766
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:11,440
yeah just really really gives that you

2767
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:13,630
know fruit forward cookie back type

2768
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:16,329
thing for breeding too with those those

2769
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:18,730
fruity Terps on a Jimmy cookie on the

2770
01:58:16,329 --> 01:58:20,680
backend for the look you know and then

2771
01:58:18,729 --> 01:58:23,079
the bread just allowed on the strawberry

2772
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:25,150
banana and throat Angie and it's hard to

2773
01:58:23,079 --> 01:58:28,359
go wrong that might as such of tangi

2774
01:58:25,149 --> 01:58:34,059
type thing yeah I'll throw another one

2775
01:58:28,359 --> 01:58:36,460
out wedding cake nice producer really

2776
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:40,410
nice resin leaves very little residual

2777
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:43,989
and grown properly it's got that hash

2778
01:58:40,409 --> 01:58:48,189
yes we did last year

2779
01:58:43,989 --> 01:58:54,309
did really well really nice vanilla

2780
01:58:48,189 --> 01:58:56,649
vanilla cake flavor how the wedding cake

2781
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:58,060
I usually grow outside it's so greasy I

2782
01:58:56,649 --> 01:59:00,399
ain't gonna lie it's like a [ __ ] to

2783
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:02,890
work with to make awesome melt it's

2784
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:05,409
amazing but like I lose a lot to the

2785
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:08,530
bags that's so [ __ ] sticky personally

2786
01:59:05,409 --> 01:59:11,229
we're not saying I don't love it but

2787
01:59:08,529 --> 01:59:13,689
just as far as working with it that GMO

2788
01:59:11,229 --> 01:59:15,819
that strawberry banana they're just dry

2789
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:17,649
or resins that are easier to handle for

2790
01:59:15,819 --> 01:59:19,389
me personally that's my experience with

2791
01:59:17,649 --> 01:59:20,079
wedding cake but it's an awesome full

2792
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:24,910
melt straight

2793
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:27,340
100% agree great strains man I got a

2794
01:59:24,909 --> 01:59:29,409
nice long list so far I'm gonna I'll do

2795
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:32,770
an Instagram post and post it I love

2796
01:59:29,409 --> 01:59:35,019
that that motorbreath 15 I'm getting

2797
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:37,750
high five percentage yields on fresh

2798
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:40,780
frozen nice dry resin to work with

2799
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:42,369
everyone in California hash brands are

2800
01:59:40,779 --> 01:59:46,000
running with it that motor breath is

2801
01:59:42,369 --> 01:59:47,949
fire key lime pie is an oldie but a

2802
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,979
goodie I've been washing that for years

2803
01:59:47,949 --> 01:59:53,590
makes great great resin it's like upper

2804
01:59:50,979 --> 01:59:55,809
4%

2805
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:59,409
what about the kind of spot would I just

2806
01:59:55,810 --> 02:00:01,780
got that in hell yeah oh yeah I just got

2807
01:59:59,409 --> 02:00:04,389
some crosses from the exotic genetics

2808
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:06,039
where it's all the grease monkeys is the

2809
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:08,110
mail that's a great one too there

2810
02:00:06,039 --> 02:00:10,359
anybody ran the original or washed wash

2811
02:00:08,109 --> 02:00:12,009
the original grease monkey and I just

2812
02:00:10,359 --> 02:00:14,229
got that Pino man so I haven't grown it

2813
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:17,470
yet yeah I like the grease monkey a lot

2814
02:00:14,229 --> 02:00:19,479
did whenever we rented it seemed to grow

2815
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:22,600
fairly well fairly vigorous and it

2816
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:24,669
dumped and did really well for pacchiana

2817
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:27,280
I was in that you know a lot of people

2818
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:30,250
hate on glue but it did but I love I

2819
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:32,469
love them oh yeah if you can find a good

2820
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:34,149
glue hitter it's especially even bet you

2821
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:37,320
know back to the cookies and cream it's

2822
02:00:34,149 --> 02:00:37,319
hard to beat that

2823
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:44,069
we got a Buddha Tahoe I cross for that

2824
02:00:41,130 --> 02:00:46,400
Mak mail or I had my friend sent me some

2825
02:00:44,069 --> 02:00:49,109
of that Mak pollen actually and I hid

2826
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:51,839
the Buddha Tahoe gee and it's turning

2827
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:54,118
out some just amazing resins in terms of

2828
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,860
how they bond and after pressing and

2829
02:00:54,118 --> 02:00:58,618
everything just looking wise and then

2830
02:00:55,859 --> 02:01:01,529
very classic cushy hash smell it's not

2831
02:00:58,618 --> 02:01:03,179
super out front loud I think some of it

2832
02:01:01,529 --> 02:01:04,349
might wash back into the water or

2833
02:01:03,179 --> 02:01:08,399
something as I'm learning

2834
02:01:04,349 --> 02:01:11,429
oh and finding but amazing resins off

2835
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:13,348
the Buddha Tahoe for sure just got

2836
02:01:11,429 --> 02:01:16,078
another cultivar in - it's called

2837
02:01:13,349 --> 02:01:19,710
Twizzlers it's a kosher tangi 24k I

2838
02:01:16,078 --> 02:01:21,779
guess crossed with cherry pie and that's

2839
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:24,359
also a new one to me I had I haven't

2840
02:01:21,779 --> 02:01:26,158
washed or and or pressed those strains

2841
02:01:24,359 --> 02:01:27,658
independently but I'm wondering if any

2842
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:30,029
of you guys on the panel and the

2843
02:01:27,658 --> 02:01:32,578
explorers Cohoes twist

2844
02:01:30,029 --> 02:01:34,920
Twizzlers with kosher kosher tangi

2845
02:01:32,578 --> 02:01:35,840
crossed with cherry pie that sounds

2846
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:39,630
amazing

2847
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:42,000
- new one from the bay i guess both of

2848
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:44,460
those I know I've seen cherry pie do

2849
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:50,429
well obviously I've seen culture can G

2850
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:53,670
do amazing so yeah that sounds I need

2851
02:01:50,429 --> 02:01:56,219
some Twizzlers it's a new strain in the

2852
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:58,590
bay supposedly so starting to pop up in

2853
02:01:56,219 --> 02:02:05,158
sessions and around the area that's

2854
02:01:58,590 --> 02:02:08,038
gonna be so Bob just all hugs I'm not

2855
02:02:05,158 --> 02:02:10,049
even sure who to reader is loving the

2856
02:02:08,038 --> 02:02:15,380
list guys loving the list it's good to

2857
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:19,770
get this list what's up Sam use high CBD

2858
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:22,800
strange and you rosin or whatever you

2859
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:27,380
make out of it this does have a

2860
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:27,380
different texture because when I made my

2861
02:02:27,439 --> 02:02:35,460
CD strained I found it was very dry and

2862
02:02:31,529 --> 02:02:37,319
not very sticky I got super glue out of

2863
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:39,420
my hemp field this year I did one acre

2864
02:02:37,319 --> 02:02:41,849
and I actually turned some sour space

2865
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:44,429
candy into some bubble balls the bubble

2866
02:02:41,849 --> 02:02:45,989
hash temple balls so I'm pressing yam

2867
02:02:44,429 --> 02:02:47,609
ball and some hemp strains just for

2868
02:02:45,988 --> 02:02:50,029
trying it I got a purple orange from

2869
02:02:47,609 --> 02:02:51,920
Dyna femme that's a you like one to one

2870
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:56,329
- the one thing that I'm running that

2871
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:59,140
makes amazing ash but I'm wondering

2872
02:02:56,329 --> 02:03:03,859
about varieties that have little to no

2873
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:06,369
THC yes CB s-- our space candy was

2874
02:03:03,859 --> 02:03:09,349
straight CBD almost not even

2875
02:03:06,369 --> 02:03:12,079
registerable THC at all bearing it very

2876
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:14,840
little and that made like gluey tacky

2877
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:16,970
black type of hash man I mean we were

2878
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:19,489
even impressed it's not melt so we

2879
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:21,320
didn't get a melt off of it but the tack

2880
02:03:19,489 --> 02:03:24,279
on it was like you couldn't pull the

2881
02:03:21,319 --> 02:03:26,989
thing apart you have to you know cut it

2882
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:29,359
heat it up or something to get it to

2883
02:03:26,989 --> 02:03:32,989
even pull apart it was really gluey had

2884
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:42,309
to hide a lot of glue to it from the

2885
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:50,479
bubble cured resin sorry I missed you

2886
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:53,840
cakey dried [ __ ] you cut out some dry

2887
02:03:50,479 --> 02:03:59,000
sift was dry for me on the hemp stuff on

2888
02:03:53,840 --> 02:04:01,699
the CBD very dry exactly what I found

2889
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,310
yeah no resin headed glands that were

2890
02:04:01,699 --> 02:04:05,389
sticky and very little smell it was it

2891
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:09,380
was kind of unpleasant

2892
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:11,980
it was residents with they were dry they

2893
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:14,079
weren't sticky they weren't greasy

2894
02:04:11,979 --> 02:04:17,089
absolutely correct

2895
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:19,729
alright thank you I think it's that

2896
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:22,640
cherry smell to that or people that

2897
02:04:19,729 --> 02:04:26,779
people say is the cherry smell from the

2898
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:30,820
CBD varieties he doesn't have a smell no

2899
02:04:26,779 --> 02:04:34,279
the tree that profile Sam that you know

2900
02:04:30,819 --> 02:04:36,469
I've watched the whole content in foot

2901
02:04:34,279 --> 02:04:38,300
plant of one of those and it was just

2902
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:40,310
not a nightmare you know all that all

2903
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:42,320
that good stuff just washes right down

2904
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:45,850
the drain I actually just I just read it

2905
02:04:42,319 --> 02:04:49,579
I bred at Angie stud or what was it a

2906
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:52,070
taffy stud tangi de la fe and then a

2907
02:04:49,579 --> 02:04:54,500
guava jelly mail also on multiple types

2908
02:04:52,069 --> 02:04:56,809
from Oregon CBD in my home field this

2909
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:58,819
year so I got some turf forward matchups

2910
02:04:56,810 --> 02:05:00,740
coming up for real medicine strains

2911
02:04:58,819 --> 02:05:03,569
hoping to pull some beautiful hash with

2912
02:05:00,739 --> 02:05:05,630
a flavor from it actually

2913
02:05:03,569 --> 02:05:05,630
you

2914
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:11,170
so many hid cultivars we got any left in

2915
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:14,618
the room great pie

2916
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:16,658
I was going to love great pie GMOs all

2917
02:05:14,618 --> 02:05:18,698
the GMO I'm a GMO by cookies-and-cream

2918
02:05:16,658 --> 02:05:26,308
that does really well walk up ours it's

2919
02:05:18,698 --> 02:05:26,308
called Wonka bars they like to try that

2920
02:05:26,368 --> 02:05:30,759
so I'm gonna get cultivars I do kind of

2921
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:32,380
dream of a day where cultivars are like

2922
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:34,119
there's you know that they're accessible

2923
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:35,980
that you could just order them in an

2924
02:05:34,118 --> 02:05:37,960
aseptic box from a tissue culture

2925
02:05:35,979 --> 02:05:40,238
company and they've been initiated and

2926
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:42,189
all of the anything's been like

2927
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:45,698
guaranteed to not be present from a

2928
02:05:42,189 --> 02:05:47,710
virus microbial fungi perspective and

2929
02:05:45,698 --> 02:05:49,748
just have have the advantage of being

2930
02:05:47,710 --> 02:05:51,399
able to choose all of these different

2931
02:05:49,748 --> 02:05:56,019
cultivars and not only choose them

2932
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:59,498
blindly but choose them based on data

2933
02:05:56,019 --> 02:06:01,840
collected from extractors who are

2934
02:05:59,498 --> 02:06:03,488
processing in a variety of ways with all

2935
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:06,819
of these different cultivars and showing

2936
02:06:03,488 --> 02:06:08,709
where these cultivars shine the most in

2937
02:06:06,819 --> 02:06:10,090
their extraction processes so then you

2938
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:12,069
could order your cultivars like oh I

2939
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:13,748
want to do a dry sift you know I just

2940
02:06:12,069 --> 02:06:15,939
want to dry set the whole crop you like

2941
02:06:13,748 --> 02:06:17,948
open the tissue culture menu and see

2942
02:06:15,939 --> 02:06:20,589
like oh look at this the first two pages

2943
02:06:17,948 --> 02:06:21,819
are dry sift cultivars you know these

2944
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:23,710
are the driest of cultivars with

2945
02:06:21,819 --> 02:06:25,929
greenhouses these are the indoor joys of

2946
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:29,019
cultivars you know and have each

2947
02:06:25,929 --> 02:06:31,480
extraction process down the line have

2948
02:06:29,019 --> 02:06:34,900
that available and that would just be a

2949
02:06:31,479 --> 02:06:39,598
really beautiful beautiful thing if that

2950
02:06:34,899 --> 02:06:43,299
were the case you know clean initiated

2951
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:45,748
vigorous genetics ready to ready to

2952
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,748
Express

2953
02:06:47,449 --> 02:06:51,380
so what about those half strains that

2954
02:06:49,819 --> 02:06:54,079
have large heads you were talking about

2955
02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:56,569
that earlier and I've might strain the

2956
02:06:54,079 --> 02:07:01,430
og pie breath has pretty melty heads in

2957
02:06:56,569 --> 02:07:04,159
the 150 and 180 I mean I found that with

2958
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:06,530
lights that have higher UV intensity

2959
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:10,039
that's actually created more of a melt

2960
02:07:06,529 --> 02:07:12,559
in the higher higher micron range is

2961
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:18,350
anybody else seeing that like with CMH

2962
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:21,740
or what's the other one the plaza or LED

2963
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:23,630
I can't really I have first-hand but man

2964
02:07:21,739 --> 02:07:26,149
chibs I don't know probably everybody in

2965
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:31,279
your files trichome heavy he's been

2966
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:33,199
pulling huge 221 81 50 bags and he said

2967
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:36,229
he he can't I've been talking about he

2968
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:38,899
can't really put his finger on why he's

2969
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:40,489
getting big heads from growers that he's

2970
02:07:38,899 --> 02:07:42,829
worked with in the past and he didn't

2971
02:07:40,489 --> 02:07:46,010
you know he said he's getting some on

2972
02:07:42,829 --> 02:07:47,689
salt grouse he's getting it on living

2973
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:49,340
soil grows that he's getting he does

2974
02:07:47,689 --> 02:07:52,309
just thinks that it's just genetics have

2975
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:55,130
gotten better is it fresh frozen or

2976
02:07:52,310 --> 02:08:00,860
dried material works with all fresh

2977
02:07:55,130 --> 02:08:03,220
frozen - me - fresh frozen will be

2978
02:08:00,859 --> 02:08:06,529
bigger heads than dried material

2979
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:11,329
especially dragon cured material that's

2980
02:08:06,529 --> 02:08:13,939
really big though it is I'm not saying

2981
02:08:11,329 --> 02:08:17,449
it's only because of that I'm just

2982
02:08:13,939 --> 02:08:21,019
saying that fresh frozen material has

2983
02:08:17,449 --> 02:08:24,050
bigger heads then dried and cured

2984
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:28,970
material absolutely undeniable presence

2985
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:32,810
starts to raise it up yeah that's the

2986
02:08:28,970 --> 02:08:38,300
truth does anybody mess with the washing

2987
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:41,030
partially dried material I know that's

2988
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:42,170
cruel crisp Bobby didn't use it that's

2989
02:08:41,029 --> 02:08:45,289
what you guys did it

2990
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:47,810
your last job right yeah we ran a lot of

2991
02:08:45,289 --> 02:08:49,970
stuff that was just like harvested hung

2992
02:08:47,810 --> 02:08:52,190
for a couple days and then bucked down

2993
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:57,430
like it would be fresh frozen into

2994
02:08:52,189 --> 02:08:57,429
fraggers and then washed yeah

2995
02:08:59,319 --> 02:09:03,559
like in the freezer Elektra in the hash

2996
02:09:01,579 --> 02:09:07,279
or dry in the material your your

2997
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:11,179
hang-drying uh it was anywhere from like

2998
02:09:07,279 --> 02:09:15,289
five to seven days it's got an exam that

2999
02:09:11,179 --> 02:09:17,000
cold dark controlled environment and

3000
02:09:15,289 --> 02:09:19,130
then the material was handled by you

3001
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,750
know one to two people and it was bucked

3002
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:23,150
down real lightly into the freezer and

3003
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:26,539
then washed that way by hand you know

3004
02:09:23,149 --> 02:09:28,638
and that was just for production we

3005
02:09:26,539 --> 02:09:30,079
weren't making there was no like we're

3006
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:32,179
making sick start here and that's a

3007
02:09:30,079 --> 02:09:34,389
thing it was just they were producing

3008
02:09:32,179 --> 02:09:36,770
bras in there and you know that was that

3009
02:09:34,389 --> 02:09:38,060
what do you prefer now now that you guys

3010
02:09:36,770 --> 02:09:40,330
do your fresh frozen what do you guys

3011
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:45,440
prefer or what do you prefer excuse me

3012
02:09:40,329 --> 02:09:47,090
fresh frozen a hundred percent just the

3013
02:09:45,439 --> 02:09:48,500
you know the full melt that comes from

3014
02:09:47,090 --> 02:09:51,469
you I've made a lot of full melt from

3015
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:53,119
dry material and it's good but you know

3016
02:09:51,469 --> 02:09:54,889
the difference between the terpenes and

3017
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:57,619
the effects is totally different for me

3018
02:09:54,889 --> 02:10:00,289
and when you've got really good material

3019
02:09:57,619 --> 02:10:02,630
the dumbs for fresh frozen it's it's

3020
02:10:00,289 --> 02:10:05,630
such a fun thing to wash that material

3021
02:10:02,630 --> 02:10:07,460
versus doing it dry I don't really like

3022
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:11,239
to smoke dry resident near as much as I

3023
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:12,260
do fresh frozen just because a lot of

3024
02:10:11,238 --> 02:10:14,149
the strains that we've been running over

3025
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:16,429
here don't you know just the same as all

3026
02:10:14,149 --> 02:10:19,189
the dry material did over there like the

3027
02:10:16,429 --> 02:10:22,520
lemon peel for example dirty taxi Kim to

3028
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:25,219
lick him moonbow ninety nine and one

3029
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:27,170
twelve those produced some of the

3030
02:10:25,219 --> 02:10:29,149
craziest resident have ever seen when it

3031
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:30,739
comes down to like full Nell and there

3032
02:10:29,149 --> 02:10:32,809
are a lot bigger heads it all you know

3033
02:10:30,738 --> 02:10:37,899
dumps between the ninety through you

3034
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:42,610
know 179 you're getting full mo you know

3035
02:10:37,899 --> 02:10:46,309
in my experience washing dried material

3036
02:10:42,609 --> 02:10:49,460
all you're really going to gain is a

3037
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:53,480
slight yield increase but you're gonna

3038
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:57,889
sacrifice so much turps that to me it's

3039
02:10:53,479 --> 02:11:00,738
not worth it I just did up dry on some

3040
02:10:57,889 --> 02:11:02,810
Mac you know everyone says oh that one

3041
02:11:00,738 --> 02:11:05,479
isn't a hash strain it's terrible its

3042
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:09,230
turf list blah blah blah I'll say it's

3043
02:11:05,479 --> 02:11:11,689
mild on the Terps but uh I fresh froze a

3044
02:11:09,229 --> 02:11:12,738
lot of it and then I partially dried it

3045
02:11:11,689 --> 02:11:14,328
just for my own

3046
02:11:12,738 --> 02:11:16,098
you know I always do fresh frozen but I

3047
02:11:14,328 --> 02:11:18,710
wanted to know for myself this is

3048
02:11:16,099 --> 02:11:20,779
supposedly not a hash cultivar when I

3049
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:23,029
try washing it fresh frozen and then I'm

3050
02:11:20,779 --> 02:11:27,979
gonna try washing it you know sit was a

3051
02:11:23,029 --> 02:11:29,840
seven-day dry 60 and 60 I'm all grown

3052
02:11:27,979 --> 02:11:32,899
next to each other you know in the same

3053
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:35,840
bed same situation

3054
02:11:32,899 --> 02:11:37,248
it's tough with percentage-wise because

3055
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:40,400
you know I have a percentage based off

3056
02:11:37,248 --> 02:11:44,719
of dry and a percentage based off of wet

3057
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:49,158
but I only got like 15 more grams from a

3058
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:51,380
pound um washing it partially dried felt

3059
02:11:49,158 --> 02:11:53,929
a little stronger on the effects I feel

3060
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:54,828
like a lot of times dried material I

3061
02:11:53,929 --> 02:11:57,380
don't know

3062
02:11:54,828 --> 02:11:58,130
affects me in a way where seemed a

3063
02:11:57,380 --> 02:12:01,730
little stronger

3064
02:11:58,130 --> 02:12:05,239
um but yeah like I said there's usually

3065
02:12:01,729 --> 02:12:08,299
a lack of Terps it's kind of hard to

3066
02:12:05,238 --> 02:12:10,638
tell with melt but when you rosin it

3067
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:15,349
it's pretty obvious the difference in my

3068
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:16,730
experience yeah to the rosin was not as

3069
02:12:15,349 --> 02:12:19,578
Turbie as any of the fresh roses

3070
02:12:16,729 --> 02:12:22,069
material was so I prefer the fresh

3071
02:12:19,578 --> 02:12:24,948
frozen for that reason as well terpene

3072
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:27,198
preservation that's why I brought up the

3073
02:12:24,948 --> 02:12:29,328
partial cure aspect because trying to do

3074
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:31,549
it like seven days is even probably a

3075
02:12:29,328 --> 02:12:35,420
little too much in in my opinion like

3076
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:37,639
the three to four day max at 1660 and

3077
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:40,130
then buff down and frozen and then

3078
02:12:37,639 --> 02:12:42,650
washed I still I still felt like I got

3079
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:44,420
that higher yield but I also kept a lot

3080
02:12:42,649 --> 02:12:46,399
more of the terpenes that I would if I

3081
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:49,819
would have dried it completely but

3082
02:12:46,399 --> 02:12:52,879
obviously obviously for sure definitely

3083
02:12:49,819 --> 02:12:55,248
not as much with fresh frozen but it

3084
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:57,199
kind of got to both but both best of

3085
02:12:55,248 --> 02:12:59,689
both worlds at least a few times that

3086
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:02,598
I've experimented with it that's what

3087
02:12:59,689 --> 02:13:07,879
I'm having it up how about a research

3088
02:13:02,599 --> 02:13:10,369
cure then free to care close up yeah

3089
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:12,380
like freeze because technically I mean

3090
02:13:10,368 --> 02:13:14,748
it's a freezers at low temperature and

3091
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:17,599
very low humidity so if you leave your

3092
02:13:14,748 --> 02:13:19,099
material and therefore say you know like

3093
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:21,920
a month when you had other stuff to

3094
02:13:19,099 --> 02:13:24,279
process aren't you somewhat curing it a

3095
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:24,279
little bit

3096
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:29,200
I got to agree you know I mean so yeah I

3097
02:13:27,670 --> 02:13:34,029
mean you're removing a very tiny amount

3098
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:35,349
of moisture but potentially what's

3099
02:13:34,029 --> 02:13:37,029
everybody's thought I mean help

3100
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:38,740
how long does everybody like to wait for

3101
02:13:37,029 --> 02:13:42,609
fresh frozen before you start washing it

3102
02:13:38,739 --> 02:13:44,529
in the before you know for a year and a

3103
02:13:42,609 --> 02:13:46,389
half before and washed it and it washed

3104
02:13:44,529 --> 02:13:48,399
amazing you know I'm all doing it by

3105
02:13:46,390 --> 02:13:51,100
myself so I've had stuff in my freezer

3106
02:13:48,399 --> 02:13:52,989
for a long time by no means am i

3107
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:55,750
freezing it and processing it right away

3108
02:13:52,989 --> 02:13:58,389
um a lot of times I'm just stuffing

3109
02:13:55,750 --> 02:14:00,939
freezers all season long and then in the

3110
02:13:58,390 --> 02:14:03,520
winter I process it and work seasonally

3111
02:14:00,939 --> 02:14:05,379
so I hear you about a curing in the

3112
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:07,480
freezer but at the same time I feel like

3113
02:14:05,380 --> 02:14:09,279
my material isn't changing all that much

3114
02:14:07,479 --> 02:14:11,529
and it's Jeff's freezer at negative 30

3115
02:14:09,279 --> 02:14:11,979
to negative 50 but again that's just my

3116
02:14:11,529 --> 02:14:14,590
opinion

3117
02:14:11,979 --> 02:14:16,929
well freezers generally preserve you're

3118
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:18,760
not you know of course terpenes is

3119
02:14:16,930 --> 02:14:20,440
extremely volatile and there could be

3120
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:22,600
some things going on there but nothing

3121
02:14:20,439 --> 02:14:25,239
compared to like room temperature even

3122
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:27,930
just the cold temperature of a fridge if

3123
02:14:25,239 --> 02:14:27,929
freezing

3124
02:14:27,989 --> 02:14:35,800
research will change the color of bugs

3125
02:14:31,229 --> 02:14:38,139
for example it will darken well yeah

3126
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:39,610
yeah I was thinking more like moisture

3127
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:41,680
like taking a little not necessary like

3128
02:14:39,609 --> 02:14:42,969
terpenes but more of like taking a

3129
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:44,530
little bit of the moisture out because

3130
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:47,500
isn't that technically what freezer burn

3131
02:14:44,529 --> 02:14:49,179
is is that like all the moistures has

3132
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:52,539
gone out of the chicken from freezing

3133
02:14:49,180 --> 02:14:55,420
yep yep pulled it out I had material in

3134
02:14:52,539 --> 02:14:58,630
my freezer it was dry it was from a grow

3135
02:14:55,420 --> 02:15:00,100
I did like in 2012 and I just pulled it

3136
02:14:58,630 --> 02:15:02,289
out like a couple years ago it was like

3137
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:05,289
old it was like six years old or

3138
02:15:02,289 --> 02:15:06,760
something and I pressed it I was just

3139
02:15:05,289 --> 02:15:08,319
like oh this is just flour I'm just

3140
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:12,190
gonna press it and I just got this like

3141
02:15:08,319 --> 02:15:15,699
baby diaper like yellow [ __ ] that was so

3142
02:15:12,189 --> 02:15:17,379
[ __ ] loud that most of the people I

3143
02:15:15,699 --> 02:15:19,750
showed it to just could not believe that

3144
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:22,119
it was six year old dried bud that I

3145
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:24,399
squished like a day and a half ago like

3146
02:15:22,119 --> 02:15:25,750
I would open it and people like very far

3147
02:15:24,399 --> 02:15:28,989
away would be like do you smell that

3148
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:31,090
like it was really really loud so you

3149
02:15:28,989 --> 02:15:33,460
just never know what kind of

3150
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:35,020
preservation you've got going on but I

3151
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:37,350
wouldn't have guessed it was that

3152
02:15:35,020 --> 02:15:40,540
extreme from this material it was

3153
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:43,870
Harmonie a cut I got from reefer man

3154
02:15:40,539 --> 02:15:46,750
that harmony is no joke if any of you

3155
02:15:43,869 --> 02:15:51,969
have ever bro I guarantee you freeze

3156
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:56,170
pull derisive heads if you freeze it at

3157
02:15:51,969 --> 02:16:01,289
minus 30 yeah kept away from oxygen as

3158
02:15:56,170 --> 02:16:07,390
much as possible that 10-15 years later

3159
02:16:01,289 --> 02:16:09,460
if it's changed it's such a tiny bit I

3160
02:16:07,390 --> 02:16:13,180
can't tell the difference

3161
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:15,250
aye well that old old resin do you

3162
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:17,950
remember the old resin that our friend

3163
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:20,649
Michael had it was like oh yeah I don't

3164
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:22,599
think that was frozen dude for sure or

3165
02:16:20,649 --> 02:16:24,309
not every year that I smoked it and I

3166
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:27,730
can't remember I think I started smoking

3167
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:30,910
it when it was like I don't know 13

3168
02:16:27,729 --> 02:16:33,728
years old or something and then I smoked

3169
02:16:30,909 --> 02:16:38,170
it every year till it was like how old

3170
02:16:33,728 --> 02:16:40,388
did it get like was it like 8 17 or 18

3171
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:42,250
or something years old did you did you

3172
02:16:40,388 --> 02:16:45,218
smoke that til the end I think it came

3173
02:16:42,250 --> 02:16:49,388
to I don't know but I think the piece is

3174
02:16:45,218 --> 02:16:51,369
now getting social security right all I

3175
02:16:49,388 --> 02:16:55,478
know about that piece of hash it was

3176
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:58,210
powder like red dust like crazy dry sift

3177
02:16:55,478 --> 02:17:00,429
that was so pure but it was it was old

3178
02:16:58,209 --> 02:17:11,529
like I don't know what year that [ __ ]

3179
02:17:00,429 --> 02:17:13,960
was from what and I get people wanting

3180
02:17:11,530 --> 02:17:16,150
to like cure hash I have some hash here

3181
02:17:13,959 --> 02:17:18,428
on my table that's 10 that's almost 10

3182
02:17:16,149 --> 02:17:21,489
years old right now it's it's it's like

3183
02:17:18,429 --> 02:17:24,399
glass it's like crack it open and it's

3184
02:17:21,489 --> 02:17:26,019
real shiny but maybe I'll take it to

3185
02:17:24,399 --> 02:17:28,478
that in a bit but it would have been

3186
02:17:26,019 --> 02:17:30,849
nice to preserve it so that it's what

3187
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:32,799
you remember years down the road you've

3188
02:17:30,849 --> 02:17:34,840
kept something for 10 years but instead

3189
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:37,058
of curing it and changing all of it at

3190
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:39,120
least keep some in a preserved manner

3191
02:17:37,058 --> 02:17:43,149
now here's something I want to bring up

3192
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:46,030
four years we cured bud we cured bud

3193
02:17:43,149 --> 02:17:47,679
because it was harsh when it still had

3194
02:17:46,030 --> 02:17:49,929
moisture in it and some of those

3195
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:51,250
monoterpenes were more caustic and just

3196
02:17:49,929 --> 02:17:53,738
sort of sharp

3197
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:56,138
the bouquet of the terpenes that came

3198
02:17:53,738 --> 02:17:59,109
out underneath and revealed themselves

3199
02:17:56,138 --> 02:18:03,159
as that some of those monos evaporated

3200
02:17:59,109 --> 02:18:05,529
out volatize off those that's how we

3201
02:18:03,159 --> 02:18:08,079
always enjoyed flower eventually we got

3202
02:18:05,529 --> 02:18:11,829
into water hash all the first water hash

3203
02:18:08,079 --> 02:18:14,260
I made was from dry material all the

3204
02:18:11,829 --> 02:18:16,750
full melts from Renee was from bone dry

3205
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:18,550
material like it was dry and a produced

3206
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:21,189
foam out so I net you know a lot of

3207
02:18:18,549 --> 02:18:23,018
people couldn't produce and really it

3208
02:18:21,189 --> 02:18:27,130
seemed like the birth of fresh frozen

3209
02:18:23,019 --> 02:18:29,800
was also the birth of faux melt which is

3210
02:18:27,129 --> 02:18:31,509
you know appears to be full melt but

3211
02:18:29,799 --> 02:18:34,358
it's really not it's something a little

3212
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:37,090
bit different and so I wonder in this

3213
02:18:34,359 --> 02:18:40,059
new generation where we've come this

3214
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:41,889
full you know 180 degrees from liking to

3215
02:18:40,058 --> 02:18:44,858
cure things out so it's smooth and I

3216
02:18:41,888 --> 02:18:46,718
remember having some dry sift that I had

3217
02:18:44,859 --> 02:18:48,760
made out of some sweet skunk and it was

3218
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:50,409
like the material had been cured for

3219
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:52,568
months and then I sifted and then the

3220
02:18:50,409 --> 02:18:54,308
sift had been cured for months and when

3221
02:18:52,568 --> 02:18:56,468
you took a dab of it it was just it was

3222
02:18:54,308 --> 02:18:59,699
full mouth but it was just so smooth and

3223
02:18:56,468 --> 02:19:01,988
nice quite different from that sort of

3224
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:04,329
caustic like whoa I just took a dab of

3225
02:19:01,988 --> 02:19:06,879
some really fresh frozen freeze-dried

3226
02:19:04,329 --> 02:19:09,638
like white full melt like it's really

3227
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:11,318
Turkey and I just wonder the differences

3228
02:19:09,638 --> 02:19:13,148
in that that how we've come like you

3229
02:19:11,318 --> 02:19:15,099
know and when I was in Amsterdam it was

3230
02:19:13,148 --> 02:19:17,138
actually Tony from Sega Martha seeds

3231
02:19:15,099 --> 02:19:20,349
that I bumped into Sam and we I can't

3232
02:19:17,138 --> 02:19:21,818
remember we were at like Hanks apartment

3233
02:19:20,349 --> 02:19:24,969
above the Bulldog and the lives of

3234
02:19:21,818 --> 02:19:26,500
playing and I he had been taking some

3235
02:19:24,968 --> 02:19:28,388
dabs he was kind of like oh I don't want

3236
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:31,148
any more and I said oh you know take one

3237
02:19:28,388 --> 02:19:32,829
of these it's really special and he took

3238
02:19:31,148 --> 02:19:34,718
a dab of it and you just blew this dab

3239
02:19:32,829 --> 02:19:36,638
out there was no coughing and it was

3240
02:19:34,718 --> 02:19:38,348
just smooth and I wonder what you guys

3241
02:19:36,638 --> 02:19:40,688
have to say about the difference between

3242
02:19:38,349 --> 02:19:42,728
those two experiences having a hash that

3243
02:19:40,689 --> 02:19:45,309
you you know cure the material out

3244
02:19:42,728 --> 02:19:48,099
before you wash it wash it and tear that

3245
02:19:45,308 --> 02:19:50,438
for a little bit versus let's save every

3246
02:19:48,099 --> 02:19:52,420
single terpene the ones that would have

3247
02:19:50,439 --> 02:19:55,450
normally evaporated off in the drying

3248
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:58,450
process and let's let's contain them all

3249
02:19:55,450 --> 02:20:00,640
and and instead you know breathe all of

3250
02:19:58,450 --> 02:20:02,200
those in for for the dab experience you

3251
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:03,278
know there's a conversation right the

3252
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:04,630
difference between those two things

3253
02:20:03,279 --> 02:20:13,600
surely you guys fix

3254
02:20:04,629 --> 02:20:16,000
since that example is that every year

3255
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:19,870
when I because I used to smoke lots of

3256
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:23,228
Banja III smoke ash for the last 25 30

3257
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:27,450
years before that I broke massive

3258
02:20:23,228 --> 02:20:32,920
amounts of down yeah and I grew up in

3259
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:36,040
Santa Cruz and when I harvested it every

3260
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:39,159
year my voice

3261
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:43,600
I would think laryngitis from smoking

3262
02:20:39,159 --> 02:20:48,219
weed that had dried for two weeks and I

3263
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:51,939
couldn't wait and and it was really

3264
02:20:48,219 --> 02:20:55,599
really potent cannabis it was really

3265
02:20:51,939 --> 02:20:58,360
loud campus like either skunk or haze or

3266
02:20:55,600 --> 02:21:01,689
one of those type things and I guarantee

3267
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:02,200
you every year for five six years in a

3268
02:21:01,689 --> 02:21:05,409
row

3269
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:08,470
I got laryngitis and Thanksgiving when

3270
02:21:05,409 --> 02:21:12,189
it was the new harvest season and I know

3271
02:21:08,469 --> 02:21:15,069
it was because of the Turks but whose it

3272
02:21:12,189 --> 02:21:17,559
could have also been partly from plant

3273
02:21:15,069 --> 02:21:20,648
material itself it was rap rock for me I

3274
02:21:17,559 --> 02:21:25,239
mean barely dry enough but it wasn't

3275
02:21:20,648 --> 02:21:27,849
cured we're definitely smoking a

3276
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:30,398
different profile of terpenes than we

3277
02:21:27,850 --> 02:21:32,260
ever had in our history just freshly in

3278
02:21:30,398 --> 02:21:35,079
this last 20 years starting to do

3279
02:21:32,260 --> 02:21:38,079
extracts different ratios forget about

3280
02:21:35,079 --> 02:21:40,719
the adding of kinetic cannabis extracted

3281
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:44,909
terpenes or the the infamous fruit

3282
02:21:40,719 --> 02:21:47,260
terpenes but we're definitely inhaling

3283
02:21:44,909 --> 02:21:48,819
differently in the last twenty years and

3284
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:50,829
I just wonder how that will affect us

3285
02:21:48,819 --> 02:21:53,739
inhaling and terpene profiles that maybe

3286
02:21:50,829 --> 02:21:56,409
we maybe we haven't been inhaling for

3287
02:21:53,739 --> 02:21:58,478
the last like 40 to 50 years because

3288
02:21:56,409 --> 02:22:00,369
that bug was cured and that you know

3289
02:21:58,478 --> 02:22:02,469
flower was up it was always about being

3290
02:22:00,370 --> 02:22:05,770
cured and now it's really all about

3291
02:22:02,469 --> 02:22:07,299
preservation of the entire profile from

3292
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:09,069
the time you cut the plant down you're

3293
02:22:07,299 --> 02:22:11,978
fraught your flash freezing it you're

3294
02:22:09,069 --> 02:22:14,199
washing it freeze drying that very

3295
02:22:11,978 --> 02:22:16,719
little heat can be exposed to that over

3296
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:18,141
the course of its life and now you have

3297
02:22:16,719 --> 02:22:19,939
this terpene profile the

3298
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:22,699
guarantee you is quite different from

3299
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:26,690
the terpene profile of the same cured

3300
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:29,091
flower or hash what is smoking higher

3301
02:22:26,690 --> 02:22:33,081
terpene concentrations doing to us as

3302
02:22:29,091 --> 02:22:35,871
well I guess terpenes are caustic you

3303
02:22:33,081 --> 02:22:38,181
know and I know not necessarily for hash

3304
02:22:35,870 --> 02:22:41,239
but some of the like BHO sauce they're

3305
02:22:38,181 --> 02:22:43,011
getting crazy high herpe numbers I know

3306
02:22:41,239 --> 02:22:46,880
at least for me when I inhale that stuff

3307
02:22:43,011 --> 02:22:52,060
man it it makes my lungs not super happy

3308
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:54,890
I don't think that's air pit you know

3309
02:22:52,060 --> 02:22:57,739
listen for for Adam do you notice a

3310
02:22:54,890 --> 02:23:00,050
different in a difference in say Terps

3311
02:22:57,739 --> 02:23:03,399
are terpene profiles in the air dried

3312
02:23:00,050 --> 02:23:03,399
versus freeze-dried hush

3313
02:23:06,909 --> 02:23:12,761
I honestly there's a reason why

3314
02:23:11,591 --> 02:23:15,370
everybody's freeze-drying

3315
02:23:12,761 --> 02:23:20,440
you know I think that it's it's super

3316
02:23:15,370 --> 02:23:21,910
rare to get air dried hash I mean like

3317
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:24,101
what year was that whenever the freeze

3318
02:23:21,909 --> 02:23:26,261
dryer just banged everybody over like it

3319
02:23:24,101 --> 02:23:29,171
was just like what everybody has amazing

3320
02:23:26,261 --> 02:23:31,030
perfectly dried resin back to back to

3321
02:23:29,171 --> 02:23:34,329
back to back to back whereas it was like

3322
02:23:31,030 --> 02:23:35,650
a struggle don't we been about two years

3323
02:23:34,329 --> 02:23:44,681
since a free shower came out yeah

3324
02:23:35,649 --> 02:23:49,359
exactly Fletcher really was one of the

3325
02:23:44,681 --> 02:23:51,819
first people just absolutely but but I

3326
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:53,739
mean like when it's spread out I mean

3327
02:23:51,819 --> 02:23:55,750
you know this is just my experience from

3328
02:23:53,739 --> 02:23:58,181
Northern California I'd go to Emerald

3329
02:23:55,750 --> 02:24:01,720
cup and then that's where a lot of

3330
02:23:58,181 --> 02:24:03,909
people obviously travel and seeing all

3331
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:07,149
of that hash all of a sudden from a

3332
02:24:03,909 --> 02:24:10,649
freeze dryer it was just like okay like

3333
02:24:07,149 --> 02:24:14,440
this Adam for me it was like 2015 - like

3334
02:24:10,649 --> 02:24:16,720
2016 I feel like you were I'm a bunch of

3335
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:20,560
hand dried hash entries to the next year

3336
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:22,810
there was like one if that and it was

3337
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:25,360
just everything was freeze-dried hash

3338
02:24:22,810 --> 02:24:28,149
just like yeah I kind of think yeah I

3339
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:29,921
got mine in 2015 after I saw in Michigan

3340
02:24:28,149 --> 02:24:32,709
made melt at it and was like I was gonna

3341
02:24:29,921 --> 02:24:35,110
buy a backup and to do Cuban tech and I

3342
02:24:32,709 --> 02:24:37,959
was like well that's cold that's maybe

3343
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:40,540
what I want to do more so yeah I mean

3344
02:24:37,959 --> 02:24:42,459
keep in mind like I'm I'm you know I'm

3345
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:46,750
just it's a seasonal garden so it's

3346
02:24:42,459 --> 02:24:48,520
seasonal work for me I just don't have

3347
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:50,319
the balls to buy a freeze jar and put

3348
02:24:48,521 --> 02:24:51,940
the the melt through it like that I

3349
02:24:50,319 --> 02:24:54,579
don't want to because I know that it's a

3350
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:57,101
really efficient tool but sometimes it

3351
02:24:54,579 --> 02:24:59,200
can be a little too efficient and like I

3352
02:24:57,101 --> 02:25:00,610
just haven't been able to do that trial

3353
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:02,530
and error yet I'm sure one day I will

3354
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:04,540
you know but um yeah I'm still air

3355
02:25:02,530 --> 02:25:07,210
drying everything by hand with a

3356
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:09,040
microplane because like Marcus was

3357
02:25:07,209 --> 02:25:12,520
bringing up earlier like I think that

3358
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:13,811
sometimes water can leach maybe not

3359
02:25:12,521 --> 02:25:15,311
leach but may

3360
02:25:13,810 --> 02:25:17,079
water can sometimes you'll win that

3361
02:25:15,310 --> 02:25:19,539
trichome and maybe not all trichomes are

3362
02:25:17,079 --> 02:25:21,610
perfect and so I shred them up with a

3363
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:23,170
microplane and like they're not all

3364
02:25:21,610 --> 02:25:24,909
shredded up there some that aren't and

3365
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:26,290
it's like really cool to look at the

3366
02:25:24,909 --> 02:25:28,060
pictures that were it's like well holy

3367
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:29,590
[ __ ] like I took a microplane to this

3368
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:30,909
and this thing should be shredded

3369
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:33,880
straight in half but it's completely

3370
02:25:30,909 --> 02:25:35,619
whole like what's going on so um you

3371
02:25:33,879 --> 02:25:37,449
know there's a there's a finesse and a

3372
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:41,771
sleight-of-hand technique to drying air

3373
02:25:37,450 --> 02:25:44,771
drying and I haven't seen the side to

3374
02:25:41,771 --> 02:25:48,579
side enough to know all I know is that

3375
02:25:44,771 --> 02:25:52,750
freeze drying is is a it changed the

3376
02:25:48,579 --> 02:25:53,351
game and ya know I to answer the

3377
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:55,989
question

3378
02:25:53,351 --> 02:25:58,060
better I haven't seen enough

3379
02:25:55,989 --> 02:26:00,761
side-by-side work especially with myself

3380
02:25:58,060 --> 02:26:03,879
I'm very ignorant when it comes to the

3381
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:05,829
freeze dryer but I've never used one

3382
02:26:03,879 --> 02:26:08,799
personally I've just heard everybody's

3383
02:26:05,829 --> 02:26:10,450
experience and tried to if you want to

3384
02:26:08,799 --> 02:26:14,590
do some research on them you should

3385
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:19,380
google lyophilization so that's like

3386
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:21,790
yeah side by side I think it was about

3387
02:26:19,379 --> 02:26:24,760
2016 when I first got it I was still

3388
02:26:21,790 --> 02:26:26,920
doing most of my first run

3389
02:26:24,761 --> 02:26:28,569
you know melt quote-unquote melt I was

3390
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:31,479
handed still micro planing and hand

3391
02:26:28,569 --> 02:26:32,920
drying and then like my later runs I was

3392
02:26:31,479 --> 02:26:34,659
thrown in the freeze dryer so I could

3393
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:37,299
press them literally the next day you

3394
02:26:34,659 --> 02:26:42,220
know to make rosin and I did it with the

3395
02:26:37,299 --> 02:26:44,680
24k and uh I know I didn't have I guess

3396
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:47,680
the best place to air dry it was on

3397
02:26:44,681 --> 02:26:49,690
racks in an open room no HEPA filter

3398
02:26:47,681 --> 02:26:51,790
kind of thing you know it was pretty

3399
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:52,120
pretty legit situation but it could be

3400
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:54,370
better

3401
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:57,400
and I I honestly preferred the

3402
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:59,681
freeze-dried hash in the end the air

3403
02:26:57,399 --> 02:27:01,420
dried was on the rack seven to ten days

3404
02:26:59,681 --> 02:27:04,300
I notice there's some people get in

3405
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:08,590
there microplane - dried quicker than

3406
02:27:04,299 --> 02:27:10,569
that so we're doing two weeks dry just

3407
02:27:08,590 --> 02:27:12,579
my experience on that you know that one

3408
02:27:10,569 --> 02:27:15,101
cultivar what were you drawing it on did

3409
02:27:12,579 --> 02:27:18,399
you have it on parchment I had it on

3410
02:27:15,101 --> 02:27:20,261
lined yeah parchment lined cookie rock

3411
02:27:18,399 --> 02:27:23,470
sheets right so parchments not a

3412
02:27:20,261 --> 02:27:25,569
desiccant yeah so you created the area

3413
02:27:23,470 --> 02:27:26,068
the surface area for it to draw it but

3414
02:27:25,569 --> 02:27:28,559
you own

3415
02:27:26,068 --> 02:27:31,318
allowed it to air-dry had you used the

3416
02:27:28,559 --> 02:27:33,748
desiccant to pull the water out which

3417
02:27:31,318 --> 02:27:35,488
gravity helps plus it's just water will

3418
02:27:33,748 --> 02:27:36,779
always kind of settle down and if you

3419
02:27:35,488 --> 02:27:40,680
give it something that it can absorb

3420
02:27:36,779 --> 02:27:43,498
into it'll absorb dry absorb dry and it

3421
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:45,720
dries like very differently than than if

3422
02:27:43,498 --> 02:27:48,148
you don't I kind of said that from early

3423
02:27:45,719 --> 02:27:49,708
days you know what happened was when we

3424
02:27:48,148 --> 02:27:53,068
start you know I I ended up showing

3425
02:27:49,709 --> 02:27:54,689
people you know drying on like pizza

3426
02:27:53,068 --> 02:27:56,639
boxes or whatever because I was in the

3427
02:27:54,689 --> 02:27:59,129
Pacific Northwest if you have wanted a

3428
02:27:56,639 --> 02:28:01,469
hope of getting your hash dry especially

3429
02:27:59,129 --> 02:28:03,930
in like November December when it's just

3430
02:28:01,469 --> 02:28:05,519
like pouring you know fifty millimeters

3431
02:28:03,930 --> 02:28:08,550
of rain everyday you can't even believe

3432
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:10,680
how much [ __ ] rain it is you really

3433
02:28:08,549 --> 02:28:13,108
need to have the help of a desiccant and

3434
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:17,129
then nicotine started making hash maybe

3435
02:28:13,109 --> 02:28:19,289
like eight to ten years later and it was

3436
02:28:17,129 --> 02:28:20,789
like he was like ah you don't need to do

3437
02:28:19,289 --> 02:28:22,289
that like you can just do it like this

3438
02:28:20,789 --> 02:28:24,810
and I was just like bro you're in

3439
02:28:22,289 --> 02:28:26,520
Colorado where it's really dry like if

3440
02:28:24,809 --> 02:28:28,708
you tell people in the Pacific Northwest

3441
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:30,418
but they don't need to do that and that

3442
02:28:28,709 --> 02:28:31,829
they can just do this it's not gonna

3443
02:28:30,418 --> 02:28:34,020
work out for them and that really began

3444
02:28:31,828 --> 02:28:36,418
that dialogue in that conversation of

3445
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:38,550
we're not all in the same environments

3446
02:28:36,418 --> 02:28:40,799
our terroirs are different and we have

3447
02:28:38,549 --> 02:28:43,108
to act accordingly to that when we do

3448
02:28:40,799 --> 02:28:45,238
things like drawing hash does a lot of

3449
02:28:43,109 --> 02:28:47,850
polarization oven or a freeze dryer take

3450
02:28:45,238 --> 02:28:50,478
the some of the worry out of that

3451
02:28:47,850 --> 02:28:53,970
absolutely you know especially if you're

3452
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:57,478
selling to a market whether it be rec or

3453
02:28:53,969 --> 02:28:59,639
medical medical for sure freeze dryer is

3454
02:28:57,478 --> 02:29:02,398
going to ensure that not one single

3455
02:28:59,639 --> 02:29:06,418
chunk of your hash was microplaned or

3456
02:29:02,398 --> 02:29:08,788
sieved too large held enough water to

3457
02:29:06,418 --> 02:29:11,760
you know create microbial content and

3458
02:29:08,789 --> 02:29:13,409
you know potentially offer someone

3459
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:14,939
something they didn't need you know

3460
02:29:13,408 --> 02:29:17,248
particularly if they were patients and

3461
02:29:14,939 --> 02:29:20,309
already immune compromised or whatnot so

3462
02:29:17,248 --> 02:29:23,248
freeze dryers do have a purpose I think

3463
02:29:20,309 --> 02:29:25,469
that the harvest rights are kind of like

3464
02:29:23,248 --> 02:29:27,059
cute little toys they're great for the

3465
02:29:25,469 --> 02:29:29,878
beginning of our industry but when you

3466
02:29:27,059 --> 02:29:31,769
get into actual production you're gonna

3467
02:29:29,879 --> 02:29:34,859
get into you know something like a mill

3468
02:29:31,770 --> 02:29:37,319
Rock a large scale unit because here's

3469
02:29:34,859 --> 02:29:39,318
the thing you start making large scale

3470
02:29:37,318 --> 02:29:41,180
water hash you start getting up

3471
02:29:39,318 --> 02:29:44,028
to be able to do really large runs and

3472
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:46,309
make many many many kilos a day your

3473
02:29:44,029 --> 02:29:48,890
limitation won't be in the size of your

3474
02:29:46,309 --> 02:29:50,538
unit or in your biomass or in your ice

3475
02:29:48,889 --> 02:29:53,478
production or in your ability to

3476
02:29:50,539 --> 02:29:56,748
condition your water it will be in your

3477
02:29:53,478 --> 02:29:59,510
freeze dryer rack space that will be

3478
02:29:56,748 --> 02:30:00,978
your limitation and so if you want and

3479
02:29:59,510 --> 02:30:03,020
you know if you feel that you have the

3480
02:30:00,978 --> 02:30:04,760
ability to produce a lot of good hash

3481
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:07,279
that's going to require a freeze drying

3482
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:09,020
because there are other alternatives if

3483
02:30:07,279 --> 02:30:11,149
hash isn't going to be melty here in

3484
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:13,789
Canada what we do with it and my partner

3485
02:30:11,148 --> 02:30:16,969
Daniel at Whistler technologies I'm up

3486
02:30:13,789 --> 02:30:19,520
with this with that with his partner

3487
02:30:16,969 --> 02:30:21,168
Brita and they basically just figured

3488
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:23,449
out quite a while ago that hey why don't

3489
02:30:21,168 --> 02:30:25,549
we if we could get a big and the reason

3490
02:30:23,449 --> 02:30:27,619
they did this was Canada was stuck in a

3491
02:30:25,549 --> 02:30:29,568
place where you couldn't sell hash but

3492
02:30:27,619 --> 02:30:32,390
you could take the hash that you made

3493
02:30:29,568 --> 02:30:35,359
and infuse it into a plant fat and sell

3494
02:30:32,389 --> 02:30:37,458
it in a 30ml vial with a particular you

3495
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:39,709
know it has to be somewhat diluted it's

3496
02:30:37,459 --> 02:30:43,939
very small amount of cannabinoids per ml

3497
02:30:39,709 --> 02:30:46,699
this was Canada for the last four years

3498
02:30:43,939 --> 02:30:49,068
and that's changed now with rec and

3499
02:30:46,699 --> 02:30:52,729
medical kind of opening up bigger but

3500
02:30:49,068 --> 02:30:54,288
that's the way it was at the time don't

3501
02:30:52,728 --> 02:30:56,510
let me lose my train of thought here my

3502
02:30:54,289 --> 02:30:58,520
goodness that robot voice threw me off

3503
02:30:56,510 --> 02:31:00,978
for a bit so what was an optimization

3504
02:30:58,520 --> 02:31:02,748
Latinization ovens right so Daniel and

3505
02:31:00,978 --> 02:31:05,148
amber Sh'ma came up with for Whistler

3506
02:31:02,748 --> 02:31:07,309
technologies to start the company to

3507
02:31:05,148 --> 02:31:08,958
sell a unit to Whistler Medical and for

3508
02:31:07,309 --> 02:31:11,538
them to say listen you can take this

3509
02:31:08,959 --> 02:31:13,100
hash and because you can't dry it and

3510
02:31:11,539 --> 02:31:15,560
sell it as a hash product what you can

3511
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:17,869
do is you can get our Terp reactor which

3512
02:31:15,559 --> 02:31:20,809
is about 200 liters and you can infuse

3513
02:31:17,869 --> 02:31:23,180
plant fats we can infuse bubble fresh

3514
02:31:20,809 --> 02:31:25,068
bubble the bubble never dries and what

3515
02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:26,658
you end up with once you filter the map

3516
02:31:25,068 --> 02:31:28,488
through a membrane and remove all the

3517
02:31:26,658 --> 02:31:31,668
water and the waxes and end up with this

3518
02:31:28,488 --> 02:31:34,788
really beautiful you know hash hash

3519
02:31:31,668 --> 02:31:37,010
infused oil you end up with a terpene

3520
02:31:34,789 --> 02:31:40,970
content that is about two times higher

3521
02:31:37,010 --> 02:31:42,918
than the majority of the companies in

3522
02:31:40,969 --> 02:31:45,260
Canada that are selling these infused

3523
02:31:42,918 --> 02:31:47,809
oils so that's one of the sort of

3524
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:50,449
technologies that Whistler technologies

3525
02:31:47,809 --> 02:31:52,139
helped to make bubble hash a commercial

3526
02:31:50,449 --> 02:31:53,250
thing

3527
02:31:52,139 --> 02:31:55,858
that you know you don't want to

3528
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:57,510
sacrifice your quality if it's there but

3529
02:31:55,859 --> 02:31:59,220
you want your workhorse to be able to

3530
02:31:57,510 --> 02:32:01,020
work and if there's no quality and

3531
02:31:59,219 --> 02:32:04,049
there's some some you know three to four

3532
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:05,850
star hash we can certainly still run it

3533
02:32:04,049 --> 02:32:07,978
and infuse it into plant fats and

3534
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:12,270
produce this really great high terpene

3535
02:32:07,978 --> 02:32:13,709
plant content extraction so that was one

3536
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:15,810
of the things that he did that really

3537
02:32:13,709 --> 02:32:17,608
sort of inspired me about being coming a

3538
02:32:15,809 --> 02:32:19,318
part of the company because it was one

3539
02:32:17,609 --> 02:32:20,818
of the things that kept you know as all

3540
02:32:19,318 --> 02:32:23,579
of you know is hash makers it's very

3541
02:32:20,818 --> 02:32:26,579
hard to sometimes make a business with

3542
02:32:23,579 --> 02:32:28,439
just making you know water hash you know

3543
02:32:26,579 --> 02:32:30,959
because unless you have a really great

3544
02:32:28,439 --> 02:32:32,639
connection you know before rosin came

3545
02:32:30,959 --> 02:32:35,309
into play when you really had to deal

3546
02:32:32,639 --> 02:32:37,260
with the hash that you had you know that

3547
02:32:35,309 --> 02:32:39,930
was an amazing method to just take that

3548
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:42,329
hash very fresh don't dry it infuse it

3549
02:32:39,930 --> 02:32:44,460
into plant fat decarboxylated under a

3550
02:32:42,329 --> 02:32:45,949
vacuum and then filter it through a

3551
02:32:44,459 --> 02:32:48,478
membrane to get all that stuff out

3552
02:32:45,949 --> 02:32:50,579
that's the very medicine that my own

3553
02:32:48,478 --> 02:32:53,129
mother who worked for the police for 30

3554
02:32:50,579 --> 02:32:56,100
plus years as a 911 operator my own

3555
02:32:53,129 --> 02:32:57,959
mother uses that product you know via

3556
02:32:56,100 --> 02:32:59,818
Whistler technologies through Whistler

3557
02:32:57,959 --> 02:33:03,448
medical and just orders it off the

3558
02:32:59,818 --> 02:33:07,469
internet so we've come a long way and we

3559
02:33:03,449 --> 02:33:09,120
have a long way to go 11:33 I'd rock

3560
02:33:07,469 --> 02:33:10,559
this out for another half-hour solid if

3561
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,989
you guys want to twist and change

3562
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:14,639
direction or if you want to keep on this

3563
02:33:12,988 --> 02:33:17,488
direction I think all of this these

3564
02:33:14,639 --> 02:33:19,889
topics are great so great that I'm gonna

3565
02:33:17,488 --> 02:33:22,619
have to make like a once a month water

3566
02:33:19,889 --> 02:33:25,648
hash you know panel where we get like 30

3567
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:28,260
to 40 of us on a list and then whoever

3568
02:33:25,648 --> 02:33:30,148
can make it each month each yeah without

3569
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:33,000
one week a month can kind of put their

3570
02:33:30,148 --> 02:33:36,209
name in the pile because there's a lot

3571
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:38,549
to talk about with with hash making and

3572
02:33:36,209 --> 02:33:42,148
and clearly we're all obsessed and

3573
02:33:38,549 --> 02:33:44,278
geeking out on it so the other thing I

3574
02:33:42,148 --> 02:33:46,799
wanted to see what breeders people were

3575
02:33:44,279 --> 02:33:56,370
like in working with for finding like

3576
02:33:46,799 --> 02:33:56,849
hash specific cultivars been really on

3577
02:33:56,370 --> 02:34:01,260
point

3578
02:33:56,850 --> 02:34:04,140
seems like stable work even and skunk be

3579
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:06,319
a actually for some getting you know gas

3580
02:34:04,139 --> 02:34:09,079
tea here turn

3581
02:34:06,319 --> 02:34:14,029
and Crockett's family under DNA in

3582
02:34:09,079 --> 02:34:15,739
Crockett yeah I did at AC ways from

3583
02:34:14,030 --> 02:34:17,450
Psalm PI's that turned out really good

3584
02:34:15,739 --> 02:34:19,340
it did like five point three percent

3585
02:34:17,450 --> 02:34:21,670
melt so not the best but really nice

3586
02:34:19,340 --> 02:34:25,190
kind of had like a kami GMO flavor

3587
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:26,870
didn't really well the 91 Royale I just

3588
02:34:25,190 --> 02:34:29,840
turned actual it's not my favorite but

3589
02:34:26,870 --> 02:34:32,630
one of two Tino's just was tacky fresh

3590
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:35,809
frozen couldn't couldn't do much with it

3591
02:34:32,629 --> 02:34:39,589
it was like really really really gluey

3592
02:34:35,809 --> 02:34:41,000
even nice problem to have it involves

3593
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:42,521
some trickery especially if you're gonna

3594
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,979
save [ __ ] like that you better leave

3595
02:34:42,521 --> 02:34:47,600
moisture content in your patty don't let

3596
02:34:45,979 --> 02:34:49,159
that [ __ ] wick out on the pressing

3597
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:50,479
scream some paper towels under there

3598
02:34:49,159 --> 02:34:51,860
you'll walk away for two minutes and

3599
02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:54,350
come back and have a [ __ ] piece of

3600
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:57,710
Hubble bubble gum that's pressed itself

3601
02:34:54,350 --> 02:35:01,390
into a gummy sticky mass and now your

3602
02:34:57,709 --> 02:35:01,389
now your micro planing no matter what

3603
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:16,360
anyone else for breeders I got one how

3604
02:35:05,629 --> 02:35:28,569
about stuntman Sam exotic exotic yeah

3605
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:35,150
Oney some papaya cake pony that's good

3606
02:35:28,569 --> 02:35:38,659
archive does really well archive yeah I

3607
02:35:35,149 --> 02:35:40,969
want to get some more seeds of that we

3608
02:35:38,659 --> 02:35:44,149
ran some kings - actually that was fire

3609
02:35:40,969 --> 02:35:45,879
that made really beautiful just won't

3610
02:35:44,149 --> 02:35:50,270
have to be a bunch of that the other day

3611
02:35:45,879 --> 02:35:55,639
in 2005 Pike is Jessie pile cortex

3612
02:35:50,271 --> 02:35:58,100
vortex let's write it down I'm making

3613
02:35:55,639 --> 02:35:59,739
the list checking it twice gonna find

3614
02:35:58,100 --> 02:36:02,790
out who's naughty or nice

3615
02:35:59,739 --> 02:36:02,789
[Music]

3616
02:36:03,049 --> 02:36:10,269
ste junkie that push cake is hidden

3617
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:11,440
pastries those did really well

3618
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:15,530
[Music]

3619
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:18,409
definitely worth washing wedding cakes

3620
02:36:15,530 --> 02:36:20,300
enough I enjoyed all this eat jerky gear

3621
02:36:18,409 --> 02:36:24,648
for sure yeah

3622
02:36:20,299 --> 02:36:28,369
pony pigs in the ponies good exotic dark

3623
02:36:24,648 --> 02:36:30,318
got dark horse as well both ugh pug

3624
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:36,859
vessel life science just texted me he's

3625
02:36:30,318 --> 02:36:43,760
like bugs been killing it so there you

3626
02:36:36,859 --> 02:36:46,909
go vessel I did all I heard was vortex

3627
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:48,710
but we're gonna stay I'll start I'm

3628
02:36:46,909 --> 02:36:50,478
finally yet but I'm gonna start now that

3629
02:36:48,709 --> 02:36:52,250
it's being open up to share strains and

3630
02:36:50,478 --> 02:36:53,989
I'm finding the good cultivars that we

3631
02:36:52,250 --> 02:36:56,239
have in house I'll find some way to

3632
02:36:53,989 --> 02:36:58,100
share them out at least you know what if

3633
02:36:56,239 --> 02:37:01,180
we're folding into adult use at the farm

3634
02:36:58,100 --> 02:37:03,200
in the main this really soon this year

3635
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:06,229
looking for a boat in June but we're

3636
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:09,140
doing medical only right now I would

3637
02:37:06,228 --> 02:37:12,079
love to share some of the hash plan type

3638
02:37:09,139 --> 02:37:13,068
cultivars from us out work and look to

3639
02:37:12,079 --> 02:37:15,950
do that later

3640
02:37:13,068 --> 02:37:18,139
Oh beautiful hairy palms is another

3641
02:37:15,950 --> 02:37:20,240
really good one to mention talking about

3642
02:37:18,139 --> 02:37:22,670
Oni he he's doing his own thing now but

3643
02:37:20,239 --> 02:37:26,869
yeah hairy palms you make some really

3644
02:37:22,670 --> 02:37:28,609
good hash trails I wonder what he was

3645
02:37:26,870 --> 02:37:30,680
thinking when he chose that name like

3646
02:37:28,609 --> 02:37:34,720
I'm gonna be a me I'm a bad reader I'm

3647
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:34,720
gonna rock the hairy palms name like

3648
02:37:35,079 --> 02:37:40,090
that's what's up I wrote him down man

3649
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:49,819
the sourdough bin GMO yeah just like you

3650
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:57,040
today and it did really well don't

3651
02:37:49,818 --> 02:37:58,818
forgot about some old-school doc atomic

3652
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:04,069
spice of life

3653
02:37:58,818 --> 02:38:07,340
DJ short unlike a lot of bodis geared to

3654
02:38:04,068 --> 02:38:10,459
but can't really guy seems like the chem

3655
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:14,590
dog cross with the 88 g 13 hash plant I

3656
02:38:10,459 --> 02:38:17,478
like that a lot sure yeah sure

3657
02:38:14,590 --> 02:38:19,219
greenhouse seeds in the house actually

3658
02:38:17,478 --> 02:38:22,579
from in our gear I got my Clementine

3659
02:38:19,219 --> 02:38:25,358
cookies and cream and what is it super

3660
02:38:22,579 --> 02:38:28,728
Lemon Haze has worked into that that's a

3661
02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:31,390
very super loud on the lemon side not

3662
02:38:28,728 --> 02:38:34,130
the favorite for the turf but very very

3663
02:38:31,389 --> 02:38:37,550
loudest thing around

3664
02:38:34,130 --> 02:38:38,390
super Lemon Haze garden of Greece down

3665
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:40,970
in Southern Oregon

3666
02:38:38,390 --> 02:38:43,820
Trish Kirk that's another you to mention

3667
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:46,189
as well that dude [ __ ] crushes we got

3668
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:48,921
some bull punch here from Brandon

3669
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:50,931
frickin amazing news about this he gave

3670
02:38:48,921 --> 02:38:52,671
me seeds of that we ran it here in the

3671
02:38:50,931 --> 02:38:56,781
in the greenhouse and it did absolutely

Jill and I was lucky enough in with

3702
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:46,040
Brandon with that guy Chris Kirk how to

3703
02:40:43,521 --> 02:40:48,109
make hash it was quite an experience you

3704
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:50,719
know is a crazy thing to get to

3705
02:40:48,109 --> 02:40:53,180
that time with him at his garden you

3706
02:40:50,719 --> 02:40:54,948
know and washing material and seeing how

3707
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:56,988
he lives his life every day and having

3708
02:40:54,949 --> 02:40:59,209
it explained to me you know what the

3709
02:40:56,988 --> 02:41:01,809
plate means to him and it's it's really

3710
02:40:59,209 --> 02:41:03,680
a beautiful thing that process was crazy

3711
02:41:01,809 --> 02:41:05,478
you know I think about it all the time

3712
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:07,158
and how grateful I am to be able to get

3713
02:41:05,478 --> 02:41:08,148
to go in and share that experience with

3714
02:41:07,158 --> 02:41:10,368
him

3715
02:41:08,148 --> 02:41:12,590
it was crazy is truly life-changing for

3716
02:41:10,369 --> 02:41:14,359
sure yeah man let's gonna say that

3717
02:41:12,590 --> 02:41:16,998
visiting his farm we went up there for

3718
02:41:14,359 --> 02:41:19,248
the harvest party this year that [ __ ]

3719
02:41:16,998 --> 02:41:21,529
literally like change my life man Vimeo

3720
02:41:19,248 --> 02:41:24,039
a new breath of life coming out of his

3721
02:41:21,529 --> 02:41:26,418
property yeah we'll live in the dream

3722
02:41:24,039 --> 02:41:28,569
immigrate on thing they have going on up

3723
02:41:26,418 --> 02:41:28,568
there

3724
02:41:29,088 --> 02:41:33,020
that's awesome good to hear well we'll

3725
02:41:31,309 --> 02:41:36,738
definitely get coach Kirk in the house

3726
02:41:33,020 --> 02:41:39,408
one of these days if it works out we'll

3727
02:41:36,738 --> 02:41:41,628
get him yeah anyway anyone else want to

3728
02:41:39,408 --> 02:41:43,668
bring anything up for the last 20

3729
02:41:41,629 --> 02:41:47,659
minutes or so we got 20 more minutes to

3730
02:41:43,668 --> 02:41:49,248
rock and roll on this hash episode go

3731
02:41:47,658 --> 02:41:52,728
ahead say something about the breeding I

3732
02:41:49,248 --> 02:41:54,289
don't I'm not a breeder but I really

3733
02:41:52,728 --> 02:41:59,118
like it whenever people are trying to

3734
02:41:54,289 --> 02:42:04,640
find those cultivars that work well with

3735
02:41:59,119 --> 02:42:06,140
the water hash or just hash making cuz a

3736
02:42:04,639 --> 02:42:09,198
lot of them aren't you know like a lot

3737
02:42:06,139 --> 02:42:11,180
of them that we probably love or the

3738
02:42:09,199 --> 02:42:12,619
smell is amazing it's just gonna wash

3739
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:14,898
right down the disposal you know it'd be

3740
02:42:12,619 --> 02:42:17,748
a total waste to make hash out of it so

3741
02:42:14,898 --> 02:42:21,469
if you can flakes if genetics and try to

3742
02:42:17,748 --> 02:42:23,449
find maybe similar or or maybe it's the

3743
02:42:21,469 --> 02:42:25,818
same profile is the one that's washing

3744
02:42:23,449 --> 02:42:29,479
down the disposal but it's now viable

3745
02:42:25,818 --> 02:42:32,958
and the bag set I mean I know that takes

3746
02:42:29,478 --> 02:42:34,998
a lot of work and I it's really awesome

3747
02:42:32,959 --> 02:42:38,390
what's going on these days actually with

3748
02:42:34,998 --> 02:42:41,180
the hashing to lend back into the better

3749
02:42:38,389 --> 02:42:43,788
strain work in the new poly hybrid day

3750
02:42:41,180 --> 02:42:45,408
that we're in for cannabis really at

3751
02:42:43,789 --> 02:42:47,899
least personally as seeing the resins

3752
02:42:45,408 --> 02:42:51,738
get pulled out this way naturally real

3753
02:42:47,898 --> 02:42:54,139
raw and then you know feeding it back

3754
02:42:51,738 --> 02:42:55,698
into which type of cultivars we're

3755
02:42:54,139 --> 02:42:58,010
looking for what we're trying to produce

3756
02:42:55,699 --> 02:43:01,310
to create those is really teaching me a

3757
02:42:58,010 --> 02:43:03,799
lot as a breeder and cultivator with

3758
02:43:01,309 --> 02:43:06,198
with the bubble hash being made on you

3759
02:43:03,799 --> 02:43:08,930
know without R&amp;D so it's like cirque

3760
02:43:06,199 --> 02:43:12,078
goes back and forth with it also

3761
02:43:08,930 --> 02:43:13,578
breeding for your environment just seems

3762
02:43:12,078 --> 02:43:15,708
totally smart if you have the

3763
02:43:13,578 --> 02:43:17,439
availability or if you're able to do

3764
02:43:15,709 --> 02:43:19,430
such such things

3765
02:43:17,439 --> 02:43:21,398
you're not only setting yourself apart

3766
02:43:19,430 --> 02:43:25,369
from the rest but it seems like India

3767
02:43:21,398 --> 02:43:28,068
just a better model if you have the if

3768
02:43:25,369 --> 02:43:29,748
you're if you at that level yeah I was

3769
02:43:28,068 --> 02:43:32,538
gonna say it's definitely definitely

3770
02:43:29,748 --> 02:43:35,628
important to find cultivars that do well

3771
02:43:32,539 --> 02:43:37,789
in your and like in your climate where

3772
02:43:35,629 --> 02:43:42,140
you're at you know we're in we're in

3773
02:43:37,789 --> 02:43:43,000
Michigan and so you know our GMO went

3774
02:43:42,139 --> 02:43:47,260
through

3775
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:48,829
three three or four Frost's this year

3776
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:53,210
froze solid

3777
02:43:48,829 --> 02:44:02,600
and then sprung back the next day I was

3778
02:43:53,209 --> 02:44:04,639
ready to go baby the real question is

3779
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:11,359
been sitting in the cold room the whole

3780
02:44:04,639 --> 02:44:28,369
time that's what's up yeah this is our

3781
02:44:11,359 --> 02:44:29,239
workroom here two hours yeah yeah three

3782
02:44:28,370 --> 02:44:32,170
hours

3783
02:44:29,239 --> 02:44:35,898
forget about an hour and a half oh three

3784
02:44:32,170 --> 02:44:38,750
hours we've been talking about our love

3785
02:44:35,898 --> 02:44:39,769
of hash cultivars and flavors you know

3786
02:44:38,750 --> 02:44:42,260
one of the things that I've mentioned

3787
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:43,850
this before maybe not super recently but

3788
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:46,760
one of the things my company in art

3789
02:44:43,850 --> 02:44:48,229
health wants to do is in sort of close

3790
02:44:46,760 --> 02:44:51,439
conjunction with the tissue culture

3791
02:44:48,228 --> 02:44:53,629
company like Sega International is to

3792
02:44:51,439 --> 02:44:55,760
collect our data between the two of us

3793
02:44:53,629 --> 02:44:57,829
between the growers who are producing

3794
02:44:55,760 --> 02:45:00,439
the way they're growing get as many data

3795
02:44:57,829 --> 02:45:02,809
inputs as possible when we're making the

3796
02:45:00,439 --> 02:45:05,059
hash when we're making you know there's

3797
02:45:02,809 --> 02:45:06,949
seven varieties of extraction available

3798
02:45:05,059 --> 02:45:09,228
at our facility I'm gonna be running the

3799
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:11,359
solvent list portion of it the dry sift

3800
02:45:09,228 --> 02:45:15,289
and mechanical you know water extraction

3801
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:18,050
and rosin and maybe some terpene

3802
02:45:15,290 --> 02:45:21,050
extractions collecting all of that data

3803
02:45:18,049 --> 02:45:23,029
will really help uncover more of these

3804
02:45:21,049 --> 02:45:25,279
cultivars and really start understanding

3805
02:45:23,030 --> 02:45:28,010
the cultivars not based on someone's

3806
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:29,930
name because it's a specific cut but

3807
02:45:28,010 --> 02:45:31,550
starting to understand them under the

3808
02:45:29,930 --> 02:45:33,889
chemo Varick makeup that they actually

3809
02:45:31,549 --> 02:45:36,108
are which is really what they are to us

3810
02:45:33,889 --> 02:45:37,579
what is the terpene profile what is the

3811
02:45:36,109 --> 02:45:38,180
cannabinoid profile what are they

3812
02:45:37,579 --> 02:45:40,879
together

3813
02:45:38,180 --> 02:45:42,950
because to me that's what that cultivar

3814
02:45:40,879 --> 02:45:44,420
is and with people naming things so many

3815
02:45:42,950 --> 02:45:46,819
different names and having so many

3816
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:49,549
different cuts and making mistakes and

3817
02:45:46,818 --> 02:45:51,850
even just being deceptive it really sort

3818
02:45:49,549 --> 02:45:54,220
of spoils the

3819
02:45:51,851 --> 02:45:55,931
hot and I like the idea of us getting to

3820
02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:57,761
a point where you know something easy

3821
02:45:55,931 --> 02:46:00,251
you know where you can just test and be

3822
02:45:57,761 --> 02:46:01,569
like oh this is this is that this you

3823
02:46:00,251 --> 02:46:03,819
know you can connect it to the name

3824
02:46:01,569 --> 02:46:06,220
still but the name will be secondary

3825
02:46:03,819 --> 02:46:09,399
you know makeup of the plant will be

3826
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:12,069
will be first and foremost what grows it

3827
02:46:09,399 --> 02:46:14,140
makes a huge difference in what what

3828
02:46:12,069 --> 02:46:17,619
your you're gonna find when you go into

3829
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:19,810
the washroom with it I mean I give I 24k

3830
02:46:17,620 --> 02:46:22,660
cut out two or three people I grow it

3831
02:46:19,810 --> 02:46:25,630
outside in Laytonsville which is in

3832
02:46:22,659 --> 02:46:27,909
Mendocino I get a lot of shade we get

3833
02:46:25,630 --> 02:46:29,739
maybe seven full hours and Sunday in the

3834
02:46:27,909 --> 02:46:31,690
middle of summer I've given it to my

3835
02:46:29,739 --> 02:46:33,761
friends who grow it in a different

3836
02:46:31,690 --> 02:46:36,280
microclimate that gets a little warmer

3837
02:46:33,761 --> 02:46:39,101
and they get direct Sun from sunup to

3838
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:40,450
sundown and they're only I'm only

3839
02:46:39,101 --> 02:46:42,671
getting you know they're doing basically

3840
02:46:40,450 --> 02:46:45,551
same soil mix that I am same Feeny

3841
02:46:42,671 --> 02:46:47,291
program I am and the monster Gardens I

3842
02:46:45,550 --> 02:46:49,510
hit about three and a half percent off

3843
02:46:47,290 --> 02:46:51,369
my garden I hit five and a half to six

3844
02:46:49,511 --> 02:46:56,440
percent and that's got me a character

3845
02:46:51,370 --> 02:47:00,341
better probably my my hall around mine's

3846
02:46:56,440 --> 02:47:02,801
better that's part of the data so

3847
02:47:00,341 --> 02:47:05,591
collecting and running a hundred or two

3848
02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:07,630
hundred different growers all of that

3849
02:47:05,591 --> 02:47:09,220
data will be collected how did they grow

3850
02:47:07,630 --> 02:47:12,220
what was their climate what was their

3851
02:47:09,220 --> 02:47:13,810
their their you know was it indoor was

3852
02:47:12,220 --> 02:47:15,520
that outdoor was that organic was it's

3853
02:47:13,810 --> 02:47:17,710
all grown all of these things will feed

3854
02:47:15,521 --> 02:47:19,181
into that data plan because at that

3855
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:21,189
point it'll be like well where are you

3856
02:47:19,181 --> 02:47:22,421
you know because these are cultivars

3857
02:47:21,190 --> 02:47:23,711
that have been grown around you and

3858
02:47:22,421 --> 02:47:26,470
these are cultivars that have been grown

3859
02:47:23,710 --> 02:47:28,119
around you in using the methodologies

3860
02:47:26,470 --> 02:47:29,979
that are similar to what you're growing

3861
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:32,291
there's a lot of data points I'm just

3862
02:47:29,979 --> 02:47:34,300
excited at creating something like a

3863
02:47:32,290 --> 02:47:37,659
digital landscape out of those data

3864
02:47:34,300 --> 02:47:39,729
points that can be navigated to you know

3865
02:47:37,659 --> 02:47:42,190
to give us I totally agree we mean I

3866
02:47:39,729 --> 02:47:44,710
have a stack you know from this year of

3867
02:47:42,190 --> 02:47:47,140
paperwork from you know we just keep

3868
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:48,729
track of our runs what we pull you know

3869
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:50,261
when it was ran all that kind of stuff

3870
02:47:48,729 --> 02:47:51,790
is not as many data points as you're

3871
02:47:50,261 --> 02:47:54,190
talking about but it's fun to be able to

3872
02:47:51,790 --> 02:47:56,260
go back and look at you know the same

3873
02:47:54,190 --> 02:47:58,690
strain grown in different areas or just

3874
02:47:56,261 --> 02:48:01,841
different conditions at your farm say

3875
02:47:58,690 --> 02:48:04,239
the July depth versus you know a late

3876
02:48:01,841 --> 02:48:05,529
season depth or full-term plant and just

3877
02:48:04,239 --> 02:48:08,738
the differences

3878
02:48:05,529 --> 02:48:11,199
it's you know terroir terroir has a big

3879
02:48:08,738 --> 02:48:13,600
play on how things grow and it'll give

3880
02:48:11,199 --> 02:48:16,959
people their unique aspect in this world

3881
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:18,520
cannabis community and industry because

3882
02:48:16,959 --> 02:48:20,979
you know you might live in a terroir

3883
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:23,289
well that just produces something unique

3884
02:48:20,978 --> 02:48:24,658
and different from other terroirs that's

3885
02:48:23,289 --> 02:48:27,459
generally how it works

3886
02:48:24,658 --> 02:48:29,978
you know things find us where they shop

3887
02:48:27,459 --> 02:48:31,720
yeah I think the data points really go

3888
02:48:29,978 --> 02:48:35,139
back to what Sam was sad too beginning

3889
02:48:31,719 --> 02:48:36,698
to with Ava automate things you need to

3890
02:48:35,139 --> 02:48:40,389
have all those data points we would do

3891
02:48:36,699 --> 02:48:42,510
that so I mean even to where some where

3892
02:48:40,389 --> 02:48:44,648
things are grown like different areas

3893
02:48:42,510 --> 02:48:46,180
we've taken a lot of things from a lot

3894
02:48:44,648 --> 02:48:49,328
of different parts of the state and I

3895
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:50,889
see like a lot of different strains come

3896
02:48:49,328 --> 02:48:54,699
out of a lot different in different

3897
02:48:50,889 --> 02:48:56,139
areas of the state so keeping all the

3898
02:48:54,699 --> 02:48:59,918
different data and all that stuff I

3899
02:48:56,139 --> 02:49:01,958
think is goes back to like exactly we

3900
02:48:59,918 --> 02:49:04,898
were saying where you need to keep them

3901
02:49:01,959 --> 02:49:06,668
as as detailed as possible what the soil

3902
02:49:04,898 --> 02:49:08,948
it's grown and if it's all grown if it's

3903
02:49:06,668 --> 02:49:12,459
not like you try to keep all that data

3904
02:49:08,949 --> 02:49:15,119
and I think like you said it's going to

3905
02:49:12,459 --> 02:49:16,829
be what's important at the end

3906
02:49:15,119 --> 02:49:18,569
we'll help us navigate the future that's

3907
02:49:16,828 --> 02:49:20,398
that's a guarantee and it'll help us you

3908
02:49:18,568 --> 02:49:22,198
know like not make silly mistakes like

3909
02:49:20,398 --> 02:49:24,088
an example I use all the time when

3910
02:49:22,199 --> 02:49:26,100
people are like well how how are your

3911
02:49:24,088 --> 02:49:28,020
different modalities of extraction gonna

3912
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:30,179
help any company that's growing and it's

3913
02:49:28,020 --> 02:49:33,569
like well a really basic example would

3914
02:49:30,179 --> 02:49:35,699
be but you know say you were wanting to

3915
02:49:33,568 --> 02:49:38,100
dude rice if then you were a grower and

3916
02:49:35,699 --> 02:49:40,049
you didn't really realize that as a

3917
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:41,248
grower who wants to do dry Safet it's

3918
02:49:40,049 --> 02:49:43,319
probably gonna be best that you get a

3919
02:49:41,248 --> 02:49:46,259
cultivar that produces the majority of

3920
02:49:43,318 --> 02:49:49,468
the trichomes are capitate stock and

3921
02:49:46,259 --> 02:49:51,689
capitate sessile the bulbous heads tend

3922
02:49:49,468 --> 02:49:53,398
to just stick to the leaves and they're

3923
02:49:51,689 --> 02:49:55,439
not as effective at coming off with

3924
02:49:53,398 --> 02:49:57,898
mechanical screen separations or even

3925
02:49:55,439 --> 02:49:59,609
water extraction and I've also often

3926
02:49:57,898 --> 02:50:02,788
noticed because I'd see these oil guys

3927
02:49:59,609 --> 02:50:04,350
go oh yeah yeah we're getting a 25%

3928
02:50:02,789 --> 02:50:06,959
yield and I'm like that's weird because

3929
02:50:04,350 --> 02:50:11,129
like the same water hash same material

3930
02:50:06,959 --> 02:50:13,709
is getting like a 14 percent to 15 and

3931
02:50:11,129 --> 02:50:16,889
that's dry you know that the true return

3932
02:50:13,709 --> 02:50:19,109
and I just wondered why is that

3933
02:50:16,888 --> 02:50:20,698
happening and what I put it together was

3934
02:50:19,109 --> 02:50:22,859
that they're accessing you know what

3935
02:50:20,699 --> 02:50:24,449
they thought back in the day was that

3936
02:50:22,859 --> 02:50:26,939
there were they were accessing resin

3937
02:50:24,449 --> 02:50:29,129
that was inside the plant well from what

3938
02:50:26,939 --> 02:50:30,658
I had learned from science that wasn't

3939
02:50:29,129 --> 02:50:32,129
really something that was happening I

3940
02:50:30,658 --> 02:50:34,588
learned that all the resin was being

3941
02:50:32,129 --> 02:50:36,600
sort of created inside the glandular

3942
02:50:34,588 --> 02:50:39,809
trichomes inside that little sort of

3943
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:42,238
laboratory and so I I figured out with

3944
02:50:39,809 --> 02:50:43,978
my macro photography look these bulbous

3945
02:50:42,238 --> 02:50:46,708
heads are sticking around even after

3946
02:50:43,978 --> 02:50:48,509
they're washed so the cultivars like

3947
02:50:46,709 --> 02:50:51,239
Renee and the ones that really rained

3948
02:50:48,509 --> 02:50:53,818
like hash plants for me were ones that

3949
02:50:51,238 --> 02:50:55,708
had very small percentage of those heads

3950
02:50:53,818 --> 02:50:58,408
I would macro photographs some people's

3951
02:50:55,709 --> 02:51:00,959
plants and I'd swear 50% of the heads on

3952
02:50:58,408 --> 02:51:02,429
the plant were these bulbous heads and I

3953
02:51:00,959 --> 02:51:04,588
thought wow now imagine you're a big

3954
02:51:02,429 --> 02:51:06,629
company you want to make dry sift and

3955
02:51:04,588 --> 02:51:08,818
you roll the dice wrong and you get a

3956
02:51:06,629 --> 02:51:10,829
cultivar that just has 50% of these

3957
02:51:08,818 --> 02:51:12,718
bulbous heads and you put all this

3958
02:51:10,828 --> 02:51:13,978
investment in time and money into it and

3959
02:51:12,718 --> 02:51:15,748
you're trying to you know grow great

3960
02:51:13,978 --> 02:51:16,918
weed and dry it and tear it properly and

3961
02:51:15,748 --> 02:51:18,838
now when you just start doing your

3962
02:51:16,918 --> 02:51:20,968
sifting you're like we're only getting

3963
02:51:18,838 --> 02:51:22,619
like a five or a six percent yield

3964
02:51:20,968 --> 02:51:25,438
that's like yeah you would have been

3965
02:51:22,619 --> 02:51:28,560
getting to 12 to a 15% yield had you

3966
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:28,829
just understood that these different

3967
02:51:28,559 --> 02:51:32,430
types

3968
02:51:28,829 --> 02:51:33,149
of trichomes are accessible in different

3969
02:51:32,430 --> 02:51:35,880
ways

3970
02:51:33,149 --> 02:51:38,000
and so I'm excited to sort of create

3971
02:51:35,879 --> 02:51:40,799
those data points as well

3972
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:42,569
um one thing that we hadn't touched on

3973
02:51:40,799 --> 02:51:45,060
much either that I think plays a huge

3974
02:51:42,569 --> 02:51:47,489
part is just harvest and prep and

3975
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:50,010
storage I think that is honestly just as

3976
02:51:47,489 --> 02:51:51,389
big as your whole your whole run

3977
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:54,450
throughout the whole year and your wash

3978
02:51:51,389 --> 02:51:56,549
and your dry - just because I know I've

3979
02:51:54,450 --> 02:51:59,311
noticed a lot of differences in the

3980
02:51:56,549 --> 02:52:01,379
gardens and not only yield in quality

3981
02:51:59,310 --> 02:52:03,420
but even just at the time I harvested a

3982
02:52:01,379 --> 02:52:05,339
plant you know I like to harvest plants

3983
02:52:03,420 --> 02:52:08,010
later in the afternoon and at nighttime

3984
02:52:05,340 --> 02:52:10,170
and you know try and harvest and the

3985
02:52:08,010 --> 02:52:12,120
colder hours just cuz I've noticed you

3986
02:52:10,170 --> 02:52:13,739
know when I pulled stuff in the daytime

3987
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:16,290
or early mornings and it just starts to

3988
02:52:13,739 --> 02:52:18,299
get hot while you're working and fresh

3989
02:52:16,290 --> 02:52:20,970
frozen that stuff just starts to get

3990
02:52:18,299 --> 02:52:22,379
sticky and almost grease in the bags and

3991
02:52:20,969 --> 02:52:24,029
it just makes it a lot harder to work

3992
02:52:22,379 --> 02:52:26,369
with when you know you put it in water

3993
02:52:24,030 --> 02:52:28,460
and ice and it's tough it's just one of

3994
02:52:26,370 --> 02:52:31,561
the things I've noticed you know with

3995
02:52:28,459 --> 02:52:34,079
outdoor resin in full Sun resin what

3996
02:52:31,560 --> 02:52:36,659
goes back to that chef SOP you know you

3997
02:52:34,079 --> 02:52:37,950
want to make sure your grower is doing

3998
02:52:36,659 --> 02:52:40,350
that through and through because we've

3999
02:52:37,950 --> 02:52:43,110
all seen Triple A or quads or whatever

4000
02:52:40,350 --> 02:52:46,530
they're calling it now 10 is in a row or

4001
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:49,079
whatever the highest-quality herb can

4002
02:52:46,530 --> 02:52:52,050
really be deteriorated by multiple great

4003
02:52:49,079 --> 02:52:54,500
points by being improperly cured and

4004
02:52:52,049 --> 02:52:56,629
improperly stored so that's sort of

4005
02:52:54,500 --> 02:52:59,280
post-processing that you know

4006
02:52:56,629 --> 02:53:02,520
pre-processing what getting it ready and

4007
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:04,110
preparing it I think the grower in the

4008
02:53:02,521 --> 02:53:06,210
hash maker really have to have a line of

4009
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:09,841
communication there

4010
02:53:06,209 --> 02:53:11,579
yeah the prep work is huge going from

4011
02:53:09,841 --> 02:53:13,620
two facilities that are on there are on

4012
02:53:11,579 --> 02:53:16,289
the REC market and seen two different

4013
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:18,061
ways of prepping material it makes a

4014
02:53:16,290 --> 02:53:20,101
huge difference you know versus putting

4015
02:53:18,060 --> 02:53:21,869
into it all trays stacking it up real

4016
02:53:20,101 --> 02:53:24,120
high and letting the resin sit on each

4017
02:53:21,870 --> 02:53:25,980
other versus harvesting straight off the

4018
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:28,230
plant in a cold room in a cold grow room

4019
02:53:25,979 --> 02:53:29,819
it's dark straight into small freezer

4020
02:53:28,229 --> 02:53:32,699
bags that go right into the freezer

4021
02:53:29,819 --> 02:53:34,739
that's the method that we really prefer

4022
02:53:32,700 --> 02:53:37,200
to do it's the same people the same few

4023
02:53:34,739 --> 02:53:39,060
people doing it every time so and it is

4024
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:41,040
all in-house so the lab that I wash it

4025
02:53:39,060 --> 02:53:42,720
is you know feet away from where

4026
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:45,570
although the resin is being thrown all

4027
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:47,970
the material so it's easy to be able to

4028
02:53:45,569 --> 02:53:50,489
see the plant see the materials see how

4029
02:53:47,970 --> 02:53:52,500
it's being handled you know and it takes

4030
02:53:50,489 --> 02:53:54,810
multiple freezers to do that to store

4031
02:53:52,500 --> 02:53:56,880
you know a hundred thousand grams of

4032
02:53:54,810 --> 02:53:59,159
fresh frozen takes a couple large

4033
02:53:56,880 --> 02:54:01,949
freezers you know to keep it in small

4034
02:53:59,159 --> 02:54:03,360
bags spread out so you're not putting a

4035
02:54:01,950 --> 02:54:05,790
bunch of it's few on top of each other

4036
02:54:03,360 --> 02:54:07,409
and compromising the material it's

4037
02:54:05,790 --> 02:54:09,601
really important if you are trying to

4038
02:54:07,409 --> 02:54:12,780
make full melt and not just a rose and

4039
02:54:09,601 --> 02:54:15,181
great production you know ash if there's

4040
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:16,980
a big difference for that Bobby I've

4041
02:54:15,181 --> 02:54:19,110
seen a hundred thousand grams slammed

4042
02:54:16,979 --> 02:54:23,511
into one freezer and I could tell you

4043
02:54:19,110 --> 02:54:23,511
that [ __ ] was kind of a nightmare

4044
02:54:25,431 --> 02:54:29,971
yeah I like a [ __ ] ice can we had to

4045
02:54:27,841 --> 02:54:33,649
do the longest soak on it just to get

4046
02:54:29,970 --> 02:54:36,091
those brick is a bit more you know yeah

4047
02:54:33,649 --> 02:54:38,880
there was no pulling melt off this stuff

4048
02:54:36,091 --> 02:54:40,649
we just we got rid of the 90 and 120 bag

4049
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:45,300
caught it on the seven depressed at all

4050
02:54:40,649 --> 02:54:46,681
yeah it were it was like yeah dude for

4051
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:48,079
sure you don't want to be over pack in

4052
02:54:46,681 --> 02:54:50,280
those bags you don't want to be doing

4053
02:54:48,079 --> 02:54:52,739
bags that are too heavy

4054
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:57,540
like you can leave it all the day

4055
02:54:52,739 --> 02:55:00,239
outdoors fresh frozen like yeah now the

4056
02:54:57,540 --> 02:55:02,190
Terps getting cooked off can see the

4057
02:55:00,239 --> 02:55:09,449
resin just smearing all over everything

4058
02:55:02,190 --> 02:55:11,310
just flying everywhere to prepare your

4059
02:55:09,450 --> 02:55:13,980
plant matter properly and make sure that

4060
02:55:11,310 --> 02:55:15,360
people aren't doing stupid [ __ ] with it

4061
02:55:13,979 --> 02:55:17,220
if you're not this if you're not the

4062
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:17,800
source of your plant matter definitely

4063
02:55:17,220 --> 02:55:20,228
have

4064
02:55:17,799 --> 02:55:22,509
says to the grow yeah I'd want to be

4065
02:55:20,228 --> 02:55:24,489
going and having full access to be able

4066
02:55:22,510 --> 02:55:26,559
to test anything I wanted to to be able

4067
02:55:24,489 --> 02:55:29,739
to look at anything I wanted to open any

4068
02:55:26,559 --> 02:55:32,439
door drawer I want to I want to just

4069
02:55:29,739 --> 02:55:35,949
know that the cannabis is is being

4070
02:55:32,439 --> 02:55:38,829
properly grown and if it hasn't or

4071
02:55:35,950 --> 02:55:41,050
wasn't that's okay too because those are

4072
02:55:38,829 --> 02:55:43,120
really important lessons where you can

4073
02:55:41,049 --> 02:55:46,019
kind of learn it's okay if you're doing

4074
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:48,579
it wrong because doing it wrong is

4075
02:55:46,020 --> 02:55:51,790
literally how you learn how to do it

4076
02:55:48,579 --> 02:55:54,489
right if that isn't the craziest [ __ ]

4077
02:55:51,790 --> 02:55:56,410
ever so don't feel bad if you are doing

4078
02:55:54,489 --> 02:55:58,719
it wrong out there there's a lot of good

4079
02:55:56,409 --> 02:56:02,020
points that people have dropped today in

4080
02:55:58,719 --> 02:56:04,898
regards to genetics and breeders and

4081
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:08,859
little tips and tricks and pre pro press

4082
02:56:04,898 --> 02:56:15,099
pre pro pressing and processing posts

4083
02:56:08,859 --> 02:56:17,140
with sieving and micro planing I was

4084
02:56:15,100 --> 02:56:18,250
kind of space on the micro planning so

4085
02:56:17,139 --> 02:56:19,568
yeah they're very different things

4086
02:56:18,250 --> 02:56:21,068
there's lots of different big

4087
02:56:19,568 --> 02:56:23,590
information that's been dropped today

4088
02:56:21,068 --> 02:56:26,379
definitely want to come back to do more

means more to me too I think that's one

4117
02:57:36,959 --> 02:57:41,909
of the reasons you know it takes me down

4118
02:57:40,199 --> 02:57:45,420
many different avenues but the source

4119
02:57:41,909 --> 02:57:48,539
has always been that it means more to me

4120
02:57:45,420 --> 02:57:50,549
as well and that's why I give it a great

4121
