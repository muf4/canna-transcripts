2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,359
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:26,960
happy to have you here with me on this

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,320
beautiful almost fall morning it's uh

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,719
really sort of Switched here in British

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,079
Columbia in the last couple of days and

7
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:35,799
we went from our epic beautiful weather

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,878
to bur cold weather but that's cool um

9
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:40,759
this morning I wanted to tell you about

10
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:43,159
a cool product called grung off now

11
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,238
grung off is a friend of mine's company

12
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:48,799
Richard uh he owns this down in

13
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:51,038
California and uh it is quite a cleaning

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,319
technology um options for cleaning our

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,960
bongs our dirty bongs we know that we

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,039
after smoking for a little while

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,399
especially with the D Nails you get this

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,439
reclaim melting down the stem it's it

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,399
can be quite difficult to get off you

20
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,000
get quite a bit of uh I mean this is

21
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,040
just a hash bong so it's not going to

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,640
look as dirty as some of the herb bongs

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,719
that you guys might be used to

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,040
seeing so what I've done is I've taken

25
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,719
the mother ship and I've soaked it in

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,640
the grunge off okay when you first buy

27
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,599
grung off it's going to be a much Golder

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,280
color one of the great things of Oak

29
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,039
grung off is that you can use it uh for

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,560
a multitude of uses you don't need to

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,439
just use it once or twice but you can

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,240
use it literally like a 100 or 500 times

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,639
and so this particular grung off that

34
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,158
I've been using uh it's been used quite

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,200
often and it's there therefore the color

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,880
of the resin has mixed into the grung

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,640
off so from what I know about grung off

38
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:49,118
it is a enzyme uh from a soybean

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,840
something extracted from the soybean I

40
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,519
know that you can purchase this product

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,439
at Home Depot or or um some of those

42
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,560
type of shops uh it's a cleaning oil so

43
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,718
what Richard's done is he's taken it and

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,719
he's um marketed it to the Cannabis

45
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:09,000
world made it real easy nice small box

46
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,878
uh uh bottles nice small bottle that you

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,598
get you buy them in I bought it in a

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,439
case personally so I'll give you an idea

49
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,199
here I'm going to clean out this

50
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,519
particular unit and I'm going to pour it

51
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,318
into this unit you never got to see how

52
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,519
dirty this one was so what I figured I

53
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,679
would do is we would pour grung off into

54
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,680
this one I would let it settle for a

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,840
while the the cool thing about grunge

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,519
off is it doesn't doesn't clean like ISO

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,479
and rock salt where you want it clean

58
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,439
and you're going to shake shake shake

59
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,318
shake shake and get it real clean it's

60
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,359
more like an end of the night thing you

61
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,359
fill your bong with the grunge off you

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,959
wake up the next morning and

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,040
simply let's see what we got here we'll

64
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,400
pour this into

65
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:56,439
this from the mother ship to the Swiss

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,239
perk being very gentle when touching all

67
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,120
right so that's just coming right out a

68
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,080
lot more

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,158
room in the Mother Ship than in the

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,280
Swiss and then we'll just rinse this

71
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,679
little guy you can see he's still got

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,560
darkness and there's still spots where

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,599
he's been dirty now we're just going to

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,598
rinse him with some warm

75
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,318
water rinse off that too one thing you

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,519
notice when you start playing with the

77
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:26,759
grunge off is is that it's very slippery

78
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,680
stuff so please hold on to your pipe uh

79
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,280
I would hate to hear a story that

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,799
someone was grung off their piece and uh

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,799
lost it to the sink

82
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:43,318
Gods I give it a tiny little bit of a

83
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,719
shape but not much for the most part the

84
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:46,878
majority of the work's going to have

85
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,400
been done over

86
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,000
night and then I use nice hot water as

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,920
well when I'm doing this

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,079
part you can see right off the bat and

89
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,158
it's 90% cleaned there's a little bit

90
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,680
more resin in the stem that I'll

91
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,560
probably be be able to take off with a

92
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,719
sharp Skillet tool but if you clean it

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,878
often if you clean your pipe often you

94
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,560
won't have

95
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,679
to um do secondary and and third

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,439
tertiary cleans because literally the

97
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,439
first one will do the

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,639
job all right

99
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,600
so give you a little wipy and show you

100
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,439
what we got

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,160
here just tiny little bit of specks

102
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:36,079
still in the in the can I can see and a

103
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,840
few nice

104
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:43,560
marks of resin right where the nail sits

105
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,119
but for the most part that's a pretty

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,918
good clean right

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,800
there that Grunge off so normally now

108
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,879
what I would do is I would either um

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,000
using a toothpick or using a small piece

110
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,759
I would pick away uh these little pieces

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,319
these are only here because I waited so

112
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,000
long to clean my piece I certainly

113
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,038
didn't didn't have to wait uh the 3 days

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,360
that I waited usually one day is enough

115
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,439
but uh yeah just getting the toothpick

116
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,319
out and you can see once the bong is

117
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,000
real nice and warm and you've grunged

118
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,759
off the majority of it that resin just

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,560
comes off real easy on a

120
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,520
toothpick which it'll almost never just

121
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,439
rinse off with water so this little bit

122
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:30,038
of help is going to be key if you want

123
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,399
to get those last little drops of res

124
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:36,519
off off of the

125
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,519
pipe can see that I'm working

126
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,400
that and turned a multitude of times to

127
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,639
get that last little bit of

128
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:52,638
resin out of the

129
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,478
pipe boom Oh got quite a bit of it you

130
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
can tell there's see there's just the

131
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,120
tiniest little bit left here so

132
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,800
depending on how OCD you want your bong

133
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,000
it's just just a matter of uh giving it

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
a little bit more rinse I also noticed

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,360
that from my bong putting it down

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,839
there's a lot of hash on the outside

137
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,919
here so will also give that a little bit

138
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,560
of a

139
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:15,198
clean which

140
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,478
uh yeah nice big base on this Mothership

141
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
it catches hash sometimes that's that

142
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,038
doesn't make it into the bowl or other

143
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,240
times it's just hash that's on the

144
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:27,560
ground either way there's a nice clean

145
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,120
Mothership I'm going to get back to you

146
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,918
guys I'm going to let this guy sit for

147
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,478
about maybe an hour or two which isn't

148
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,399
quite the amount of time I like to let

149
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,800
it sit overnight is great but I'm going

150
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,799
to let it sit for an hour or two and

151

00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,560
have a TV or a radio or any music

166
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,840
playing because we are streaming live uh

167
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,240
but we'd love to hear from you we'd love

168
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,079
to see you okay so I let the grunge off

169
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
soak for a couple of hours not as long

170
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,318
as I normally would but uh I think it's

171
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,639
safe to say we can take this grunge off

172
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,639
and place it back into the

173
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
bottle

174
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,158
do a quick Water

[Music]

176
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,879
Rinse all right

177
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,680
so that was just a 2hour

178
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,599
soak and we pretty much got everything

179
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,840
from a distance it probably looks like a

180
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:14,319
fairly nice clean

181
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,959
piece up close you can see there's still

182
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
some marks where the water was and

183
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,918
there's still a little reclaim in the

184
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,000
down stem and a little piece of hash

185
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,959
that I have stuck on the outside here

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,199
but not a bad job for the grunge off if

187
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,638
I would have left it overnight it would

188
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,158
be even better and once again I to clean

189
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,799
off that easy enough with a toothpick

190
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:38,278
particularly after I've already uh

191
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,519
heated it up and and used the uh grunge

192
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,519
off as well it just softens it up real

193
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:47,159
good it still has stick so you have to

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,159
actually physically remove it

195
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,519
but anyway there you go grunge

196
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
off

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,720
