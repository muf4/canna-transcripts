[Music]

2
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,240
Nation welcome to B man's world we're

3
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,118
here with Marcel Brun a well-known glass

4
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,038
blower from the community if any of you

5
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:31,678
have been collecting glass for any

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,960
amount of time you've definitely heard

7
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,839
the name Marcel Bron and we're also here

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,878
with Matt the The House of the great

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,000
Gardener so uh today Marcel is here

10
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,359
telling us about a new project that he's

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,238
working on and it's a little more

12
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,439
complicated than just blowing a sick

13
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,238
piece of glass so I'm going to kind of

14
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,000
let him Matt just came in literally

15
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:52,759
minutes ago to drop me off the tripod

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the camera is sitting on right now cuz I

17
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:58,000
spaced it last time I was over there

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,960
left it on the island puffing bowls um

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
so he Marcel was just about to expl

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,879
explain to Matt what this project is all

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,640
about which involves this box right here

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,600
and I'll pass it over to you Marcel you

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,400
can sort of tell them about it awesome

24
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,280
yeah the project is called project 33

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,159
and it's a it's a project designed to

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,280
build community um and it centers around

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,680
uh creating awareness about currency and

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,680
the different ways that it's used to

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,118
battle the building of community and

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,640
keep people imprisoned um so last last

31
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,078
year I made the uh the idea is to create

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,079
a community- based currency uh so

33
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,359
imagine like somewhere between a

34
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,599
festival and a workshop where

35
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:46,000
people you know spaceship comes to town

36
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,959
builds a dome around itself throws the

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,879
party gates open people come in and

38
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:55,039
essentially the cost of admission is

39
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:58,199
being exposed to the images and

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,520
information that we have to share about

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,439
currency and permaculture and

42
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:08,519
survivalism and just general um human

43
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:12,519
values that are important and uh part of

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,680
the activity is the local Glass artists

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,599
and local musicians will be showcased on

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,879
our stages and during the midst of that

47
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,199
there will be creation of currency so

48
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,120
part of the activity is a as a

49
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:30,119
participant is you'll be one of the

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,759
people like polishing or slicing or St

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,280
in or on the team pulling the Millies

52
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,479
for the currency which are like these

53
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,239
coins I have here right so you familiar

54
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,560
with Millies I'm not familiar with

55
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,158
mellies it's like a cane of glass that's

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,680
been sliced and Polished that has an

57
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,039
image on it yeah so like a long cane and

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,800
it's got the image he can show you one

59
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,120
cane it has the image on the end of the

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,680
co at the when it's sliced right like

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,200
slicing it just like a a Lo so you build

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,239
it you build it but the idea is that the

63
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:04,560
community will be enlisted in order to

64
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,759
um create this these uh these coins and

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
the way that it works is there'll be

66
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,359
even like glass presses so we have a

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,719
line of people handing down hot glass

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,200
and pressing the currency and what

69
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,080
happens is the currency will be able to

70
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,598
be pre-ordered by people who are in the

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,400
know to like have the working assets and

72
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,959
resources for the project to launch and

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,799
to get to each location and then as the

74
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,759
currency is produced it's distributed to

75
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,438
to cover all those costs and the things

76
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,280
that are needed for it to go to its next

77
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,158
location and then all the excess is

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,360
given to the people who have attended so

79
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,598
everyone leaves with a currency exchange

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,040
and they're exchanging their time for

81
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,238
the currency and the the idea isn't that

82
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,798
we're going to back the currency per se

83
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,759
we'll have plenty of activities where we

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,400
will back the currency like at the thing

85
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,000
you might be able to do a metal coin

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,680
press and go get a thing of fries but

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,639
the idea is more that people take the

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,519
currency out and use it to sell the idea

89
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,719
to the outer world so each person that

90
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,599
has it tries to get what they can with

91
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,919
it outside and then the idea grows that

92
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:16,519
you know we're prisoners of our

93
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:19,319
dollars so very wild concept very cool

94
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,879
and these are the coins heck yeah that

95
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,839
you have brought with you today so

96
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,600
they're all exactly the same yeah

97
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,959
they're all from the same cane but I

98
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,240
guess he's got they're not exactly the

99
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,319
same they have different sizes to them

100
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,680
oh I didn't even see the other

101
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,319
but we've been looking at the big ones

102
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,759
oh yeah I didn't realize they were

103
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,800
Stacks

104
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,600
High I've been hitting some great

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,520
Gardener resin all day so very cool

106
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,479
that's

107
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:49,959
cool sweet and so how can uh how can

108
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,519
people uh get involved with this how can

109
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,918
they you know right away if someone was

110
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,198
watching and they were like well I I

111
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,198
want to I want to be a part of this how

112
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,038
do I how do I be a part of this how do I

113
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,439
acquire one of those

114
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,360
coins oh

115
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm not sure how to acquire one of these

116
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,199
coins these particular coins are just

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,240
kind of the the

118
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,000
beginning exactly they were created at

119
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,879
uh project 33

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,079
2013 and you know that was they were

121
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,159
meant to be the bank for the first

122
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:22,719
project they were exchanged to sell the

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,400
glass that we created and uh their

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,919
intention is that they're the seed to

125
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:30,159
have the resources to take the first

126
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,000
role with the with

127
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,319
Hardware interesting and no do you have

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,560
a plan on putting these out as that like

129
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,400
getting you know auctioning them off or

130
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,839
getting people involved to to invest in

131
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:49,239
these coins in order to get the project

132
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:52,279
started or um I do in the sense that I

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,160
would like to exchange them for money um

134
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,839
you know and it's just open to up to now

135
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,039
I've primarily given them away uh to

136
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,799
people that I felt great gratitude for

137
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,159
MH um you know and they've

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,000
been I don't know if useful is the right

139
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,680
word for that but certainly something

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that's uh made me feel good from time to

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,280
time yeah

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
absolutely well for sure I can see that

143
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,519
because I mean for my perspective just

144
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,439
from hearing about this I I mean I just

145
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,279
you're a humble guy I I know for a fact

146
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,319
if I photographed these and put the idea

147
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,079
on the website or on on the internet put

148
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,000
it out in the world it would be very

149
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,279
short time before people were emailing

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,279
me and being like like how can

151
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,160
I yeah at the original project 33 they

152
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,839
were $1,000 coins

153
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,319
so but so at that project someone could

154
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:50,198
come in and do some work acquire a coin

155
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,639
and then at that Festival they could go

156
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,720
and buy a snack with that coin that sort

157
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,000
of what you're suggesting not so much

158
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,960
when you say they would do some work uh

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,839
they would do an exchange yes so at the

160
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,198
festival we would set up at like yeah

161
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,399
exactly so take the example of we bring

162
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
project 33 to a festival it would be

163
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,399
like

164
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,399
a

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,720
um it would be like a side stage

166
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,360
basically where people would be able to

167
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,120
come and uh I remember when I was at

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,800
Coachella once and they had a one of the

169
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,038
whole stages at Coachella was run on

170
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,960
human power and they had all the

171
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:32,000
batteries set up and they had like rows

172
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,758
and rows of like bicycles and they had

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,199
like these hand cranks and the the

174
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,400
entire weekend that DJ stage and behind

175
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,560
the DJ stage they had like a giant

176
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,318
hamster wheel there someone was like

177
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,319
running on the wheel all the time and

178
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,280
they had huge storage batteries and they

179
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,919
ran that stage for the whole festival

180
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,478
just off of the human power powering it

181
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,279
it was cool cuz you'd go at like 4 in

182
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,000
the morning and You' see that guy on

183
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,119
just like when I first heard of this

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,478
project I I was I was more confused I

185
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,560
thought it was something like okay so

186
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,318
you buy these coins you get entry into

187
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
this project that you create this

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,960
incredible piece of art and then that

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,598
art is auctioned off and it raises more

190
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:17,079
money and it creates another project

191
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:20,878
that's what I very similar to the

192
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,680
concept yes um very cool yeah well it's

193
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,000
definitely neat and it's it's out of the

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,120
box and it's definitely right up your

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,120
alley you know you're always uh sort of

196
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,759
pioneering new ways of of doing things

197
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,360
which is great cuz not that the old way

198
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,240
of doing things isn't great either but

199
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,879
it's just nice to have new choices yeah

200
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,320
you know I'm telling you it's kind of

201
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,000
like what I was saying to Matt recently

202
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,640
about why I was like man your strains

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,958
are all so amazing and great and he's

204
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,439
like it's like he took his own ego out

205
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,079
of it instead of thinking that he was

206
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,959
going to be the one to choose all the

207
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,759
best strains for like thousands of

208
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,559
people who use it medically he used all

209
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,159
those thousands of people to pick the

210
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,518
strains he got them to tell him what you

211
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:06,159
know that was a huge that was a

212
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,360
huge with the H strain we we asked the

213
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,559
members to choose like the top three

214
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,000
phenotypes and it was completely

215
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,119
different from the one that I liked

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,839
right right so at that point it was like

217
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,039
it was like a light it was like holy cow

218
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,560
I have no I I have no you know I've

219
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,240
learned making these decisions I've

220
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,719
learned it as a photographer the picture

221
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,919
I think is the best people don't

222
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,959
generally

223
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,919
agree you know and I'll do the

224
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,559
experiment I'll be like I'm going to

225
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,679
post this one I don't to like it I'm

226
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,319
going to post this one instead of this

227
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,639
one the odd time when it's perfect it's

228
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,959
perfect and you know it's going to be

229
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:43,838
the one but many many times I'm it's

230
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,399
just neat to get over your own ego and

231
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,800
involve other people I really liked when

232
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,240
you were talking about doing that uh I

233
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,838
guess like a class where you're kind of

234
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,240
teaching people how to do the um rello

235
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,200
the rello that's that's very cool so you

236
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,560
would like C could you could like custom

237
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,519
make these for whatever Festival so the

238
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,759
festival organized ERS came to you and

239
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,200
said we want to implement this into our

240
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,480
Festival

241
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,759
somehow uh yes so be a custom custom

242
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,039
thing at be yeah major collectible I

243
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,799
mean I'm just I just know and I'm not

244
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,559
sure if you understand this Matt in the

245
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,278
glass world like people collect Millies

246
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,278
and not even ones that big yeah and I'm

247
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,519
not sure cuz I'm kind of even out of the

248
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,399
loop Lev where I'm not sure if they're

249
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,839
collecting them to put them on future

250
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,639
pieces or they just want to keep them

251
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,200
just as Millies in like cases right well

252
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,278
I'm getting the thumbs up from the big

253
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,120
glass collector that's in the house he

254
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,200
saying yeah one thumbs up they do they

255
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,159
do collect them just for mes yes no they

256
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,560
which which means without even as a

257
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,719
currency this is a currency because it's

258
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:52,719
marel who made them it's a colle yeah

259
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,720
it's just wild man it really does get

260
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,000
you thinking about currency absolutely

261
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,680
and anytime you can make an exchange

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,679
where you're not

263
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,958
okay so

264
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:08,000
currency currency evaluation evaluation

265
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,679
when you when you originally print it

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,639
whoever prints it gets the entire value

267
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,479
of its worth and then as soon as there's

268
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,399
a pile of currency sitting it gets

269
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,560
interest charged on it and people start

270
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,600
charging the [ __ ] interest and it's

271
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:26,278
like the money is supposed to represent

272
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,399
the work that we all do as humans our

273
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,958
blood our sweat our tears our planet's

274
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,958
ability to SU Ain life and these people

275
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,319
say they have all of it and then they

276
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,919
water it down by 50% it's like pouring

277
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,800
water into your dad's vodka bottle like

278
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,919
the every time the interest gets added

279
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,319
on and so they're just like well because

280
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,278
the bottle's full again and we have half

281
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,040
of it your half is now this half and

282
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,480
it's a water down half and it keeps

283
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,360
happening and it's happened so many

284
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,959
times that they've just basically Tak an

285
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,039
ownership of everything uh it's a great

286
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,559
trick

287
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,439
you know so any time that that can be

288
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,559
avoided where exchange can happen

289
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,000
outside of the currency it's like it's

290
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:13,359
at least taking that one that one

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,078
interaction away from the pile of

292
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,959
interactions that's holding everyone

293
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:19,519
down as a community yeah trade trade do

294
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,439
more trades well it's interesting you

295
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
know you have the uh herb and the glass

296
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,600
and the hash guy sitting here and those

297
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
are all things that have you know not

298
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
always just glass but glass pipes in

299
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,560
particular have had a found in the herb

300
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,720
Community obviously people are mostly

301
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,919
smoking cannabis with them whether we

302
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,000
want to pretend that they're smoking

303
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,559
tobacco or not the majority of them are

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,278
smoking cannabis and it's part of the

305
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,359
inspiration and the beauty of the art to

306
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,399
me I always saw them so intricately

307
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,199
connected that it it was true like GL

308
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,958
you didn't really back in the day go buy

309
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:54,120
glass in like a store or a gallery you

310
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,879
bought it from like a blower if you were

311
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,519
lucky enough to know them or on like a

312
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,360
lot you know right dead lot or fish lot

313
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,198
that's where you could see pipes guys

314
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,839
had pipes for sale and it was and they

315
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,120
were very eager to trade what I noticed

316
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,800
is that people started to collect and we

317
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,320
all love trade absolutely and you know

318
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:17,039
as a maker I noticed that people tend to

319
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,000
collect multiple Pieces by me because

320
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,000
they're in a sense investing in me as a

321
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,240
maker um and so you know when you buy a

322
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,839
piece for me then I get to make more

323
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,120
pieces and they get better makes you

324
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,399
want another piece and that whole Evol

325
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,679
ution of you know support like a

326
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,039
philanthropic sort of a Vibe is

327
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,278
something that I think is really

328
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,078
beneficial on both sides of the equation

329
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,278
both for collectors and for others

330
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,679
toally totally you get to see you get to

331
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:46,838
see the sort of development you can sort

332
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,359
of tell where you were by that certain

333
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,720
piece oh yeah I was Lear working on that

334
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,480
technique and exactly and share

335
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,040
ownership in that and be like you know I

336
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,959
helped you get there you know cuz it's

337
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,958
like as an artist you're always looking

338
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:03,078
to have that extra support to take your

339
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:05,159
ideas to the next level for sure well

340
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,519
this is definitely a cool concept and an

341
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,319
idea and I I can see it at its birth

342
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,839
right now but um we'll see what it grows

343

378
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,440
concept we talked about it a little bit

379
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:45,278
before

380
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,040
and we're probably going to have a

381
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,639
discussion about it now so we thought

382
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,439
slap on the camcorder let everyone

383
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,839
listen in super beautiful day in British

384

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,039
like geez it's been a while was good so

392
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,599
but yeah this is uh this is a whole

393
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:21,599
whole new level of really thinking this

394
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,319
is really cool and I mean um really

395
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,759
getting to know about what you're doing

396
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,639
here is uh quite amazing and you know

397
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,120
and actually more talking about it since

398
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,600
since Matt left was uh really realizing

399
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,600
the whole concept behind of uh this uh

400
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,839
this new currency we were saying yeah

401
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,680
yeah you guys have been in a deep

402
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,160
conversation for the last half hour plus

403
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,919
while we were setting all this up and uh

404
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,480
so you you've uh you've got a little bit

405
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,039
of a better grasp on it John how do you

406
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,120
see it now what do you oh it's a short

407
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:53,278
explanation short explanation it's um

408
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,240
well it it's about joining community and

409
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,039
building trade and and getting back to

410
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,120
being real and and to getting away from

411
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:04,000
paper and and and this is more about

412
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,558
you're investing into say I get a I get

413
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,798
one of the the the Starbucks Starbucks

414
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,359
Starbucks I get a Starbuck and you know

415
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,240
let's just say this particular one here

416
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,318
I paid $1,000 for

417
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,439
it but I mean you know now that I have

418
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,720
the Starbuck is the value of it is what

419
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,919
I see value with what say someone like

420
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,279
like flave Dave he's got uh he's got a

421
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,720
cool pipe that he really

422
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,160
wants but he really wants one of these

423
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,558
and we're not talking about value

424
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,519
anymore we're just talking about what we

425
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:37,918
feel is what it's worth and so I we wind

426
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:42,400
up trading and I trade him for my

427
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,640
Starbuck and he gives me a nice moreel B

428
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,440
and it's really cool I got that thing

429
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,960
for for a little while now and and and

430
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,798
and now someone wants to maybe uh trade

431
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,279
that and and and and it's interesting is

432
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,319
is where I'm getting the concept from is

433
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:02,440
is it's really it's about the value is

434
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,759
the way you see the value in right and

435
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,038
it's not really the value of it's the

436
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,960
individual who sets the value on it that

437
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,919
value could be at any any price and that

438
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,159
value go up as that coin is traded more

439
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,919
and more right so it gains value by what

440
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,400
it

441
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,640
represents exactly the energy people put

442
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,600
into it and that's really what you know

443
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
I'm always asked what backs the currency

444
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,798
and they're like well Marcel are you

445
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,678
going to back the currency can I just

446
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,918
buy any piece from you with your

447
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,519
currency and you know the answer is that

448
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,559
it's it's backed by the community and uh

449
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,879
the platform that I'm trying to build or

450
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:39,200
that I am

451
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,720
building excuse me the platform that we

452
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:47,840
are building is uh designed to enlist

453
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,519
the community in actual creation so uh

454
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,319
you know when the show comes to town

455
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,798
it's a cross between a glass blowing

456
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:58,038
workshop and a music festival fairly

457
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:02,279
small intense environment and people are

458
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:05,599
exposed to to uh information about uh

459
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,798
currency and exactly how

460
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,079
directly uh using a currency is holding

461
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:14,599
us prisoner as a as a

462
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:16,599
population and in the attendance of that

463
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,519
everyone is enlisted to actually stamp

464
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:24,480
the coins and create the currency itself

465
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:26,558
so what happens is there's pre-support

466
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,839
where people are knowing about the

467
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:31,558
currency and they advance the materials

468
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,279
and supplies and fundage that's

469
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:37,000
necessary for the show to be created but

470
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:40,879
each creation as these were created at

471
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,159
project 33 in 2013 By a community of

472
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,559
artists who came together

473
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:49,960
freely as these were

474
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:54,079
created um you know they're now going to

475
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,400
support uh the creation of the project

476
00:19:54,079 --> 00:20:00,439
um directly but when people

477
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,880
come even even if it's not make AE they

478
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,640
could just be part of a line of people

479
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,799
who are working to move glass rods down

480
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,640
get them hot and smash them with a press

481
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,319
and make pressed coins for lower

482
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,640
denominations like we're talking about

483
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:18,240
these as $1,000 coins because they're

484
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,840
marked with 100 star bucks so with the

485
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,240
100 on it you know 10 to one whatever

486
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,038
but we could make a Millie with a

487
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
smaller denomination but for a very

488
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,960
small denomination we have glass pressed

489
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,279
coins and I also have Penny p where

490
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,038
you'd actually use like a vending

491
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:37,918
machine type format and be able to put

492
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:40,400
in US currency and a penny and turn the

493
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,080
crank and it presses out like the lowest

494
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,519
denomination so as a participant in this

495
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,519
show no matter what your skill level no

496
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,038
no matter what your ability to

497
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,158
participate in the art making process is

498
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,558
we have an option and you can be part of

499
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:59,080
a team and if you're if you're on the

500
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:02,519
team and you come to this event you've

501
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:05,839
invested your time and you've uh offered

502
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,639
your time to be exposed to these ideas

503
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,158
and when the coins are done at the end

504
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,159
of the event all of the excess is

505
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:18,360
distributed back to the people who are

506
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,200
attended so we have our plans of what we

507
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,639
what we as an event need in order to get

508
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,640
to the different shows and make it to

509
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,200
the next shows and the Planned expansion

510
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,038
but the excess is beyond that are

511
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,919
designed to be distributed so that

512
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:36,200
everyone who comes to these shows then

513
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,038
has the icons they have a start book

514
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,319
when they can take it back to their

515
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:43,200
community and and share the idea ex

516
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:46,798
share the

517
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,640
idea it's very cool idea so many

518
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,240
different ways it can be done too even

519
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,679
as you're explaining it to me my own

520
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,519
mind is coming out like is just coming

521
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,840
up with these other Concepts and ideas

522
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,879
based on this idea exactly that's what

523
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,558
it's doing you picture you picture are

524
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,320
like people often like a more simplified

525
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,359
version cuz this is the this is the top

526
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:07,119
like fullon like the information

527
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,240
knowledge drops with the permaculture

528
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,678
and all that that goes beyond just like

529
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,720
glass collecting and trading but to

530
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,600
bring a concept like this back to Glass

531
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,480
collecting and trading you know for a

532
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,519
blower who might be low on funds and

533
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,880
unable to acquire like the right amount

534
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,359
of uh glass rods or oxygen or whatever

535
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,400
you know a blower that people stand

536
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,839
behind and believe in they could put out

537
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,679
their own kind of unique coin you know

538
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,639
and and and say you know this is a

539
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,038
collector's edition I'm selling them for

540
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,080
$200 a piece or whatever and you know if

541
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:44,278
you want a piece later on in life for me

542
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,839
I will actually take that at as $300

543
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,679
only me the glass door only I will give

544
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,319
you $300 off it's just a it's like a

545
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,759
trade currency it's like a personal

546
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:58,000
currency of just you know I'm you as a

547
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,400
collector you're supporting the

548
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,519
integrity of an artist and sometimes

549
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,559
that uh an an artist who's having

550
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,599
Integrity may not be

551
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,558
supported fully because of some of the

552
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,038
choices that come along with that oh

553
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:16,480
yeah high integrity low profits right

554
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,640
exactly each event is is is going to

555
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,839
create its own unique coin and only so

556
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,240
what we're talking about let just say at

557
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,519
the last blowing uh competition that

558
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,839
actually turns into that weekend turns

559
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,200
into creating a bank and that whole

560
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,319
weekend the all get together and they

561
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,360
create so many bit you know they they

562
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,319
create these coins and they create a

563
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,240
bank over the weekend where then over

564
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,839
the weekend you have the seminars and

565
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,798
it's the whole event and people are

566
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:46,038
learning and they can use these to learn

567
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,679
more things stuff and we can have the

568
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:50,480
different uh you know there's so many

569
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,480
ways the system is going to actually

570
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,079
generate money you know because it's

571
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,558
modeled off of the system that's holding

572
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,038
us down so effectively it's going to

573
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,480
generate resource in all all different

574
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,519
ways just it's going to encourage people

575
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,759
to share their resources with each other

576
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,440
but as a community skills and stuff

577
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,278
right and so you know he's talking about

578
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,880
the glass blower that might not have

579
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,079
enough glass you know it's also I was

580
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,679
thinking of the permaculture farm that

581
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,558
needs a tractor totally you know and

582
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,960
some of these things to like back up

583
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:24,000
these ideas with you know to create

584
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,679
because we're a community of bringing

585
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,599
the community together instead of

586
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,440
trading on this you're trading Us in

587
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,000
resources or

588
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,798
right and improving the spaces that we

589
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,599
that we are at well it sure does you

590
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,599
want to

591
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,480
trade you know it's like here we'll

592
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,639
trade but I wonder how many coins that's

593
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,759
worth but but at that exactly what's it

594
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,320
worth to the person that has the coin

595
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,079
maybe you can trade CU that might be for

596
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,519
me a great trade oh that's awesome

597
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,678
because with this I'm going to be able

598
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,599
to trade uh I'm going to be able to

599
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,960
trade the the the next couple bales of

600
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,959
dirt that I need to grow my next crop in

601
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,600
order to do this or whatever it all

602
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,159
depends what you see the value you want

603
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,359
and one Co it's it's just with that one

604
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,640
coin but it just keeps filtering all

605
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,599
it's not money we're trading back and

606
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,759
forth understand we're taking money

607
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,798
concept out of it and it becomes part of

608
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:19,519
a b

609
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:21,000
to who we are well part of the assertion

610
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,278
with the money and the reason to go

611
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,240
after the currency is the active

612
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,919
interest is constantly watering the

613
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,120
money supply down so every time somebody

614
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,480
like you or I put our actual human

615
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,038
effort and time into creating

616
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,720
value and then put the money in the bank

617
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:40,759
to create security for ourselves or our

618
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,640
families like that starts generating

619
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:45,158
interest and the actual generation of

620
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,120
the interest no matter who it's paid for

621
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,080
Waters down the effectiveness of the

622
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,038
labor that's been done by every single

623
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:54,199
human being on the planet that generated

624
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,879
real value so that's how the scam works

625
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,640
just because of inflation and we all

626
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,960
like we know this on an intellectual

627
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,440
level but

628
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,640
the illusion of what you said earlier

629
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,000
the true cost of objects right you know

630
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,159
the cost to our ability to survive on

631
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,440
the planet I mean what's the the air

632
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,120
conditioners they were running off of

633
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,960
Fukushima in Japan were you know Chang

634
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:20,798
people's lives and made them much more

635
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,798
comfortable you know and now our ocean

636
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:28,398
ISRO right they all tie in together they

637
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:32,840
all tell you MH want to grab that little

638
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:36,239
last one I'm not much the nail yeah car

639
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,558
we are society today it's it's

640
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,960
um it's about giving back it's about

641
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,079
helping one another and educating and

642
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,919
and trading and really finding the

643
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:48,759
genuine people that you deal with them

644
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,320
this brings not only the glass floors

645
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,558
but the community together as in the

646
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,038
Comm cannabis Community is is is I know

647
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,278
the community that I link with so much

648
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,640
and and we're all different part of the

649
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:01,398
community but this this is just creating

650
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,240
another economy

651
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:06,558
for the Next Generation right you know

652
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,159
what I mean it's it's it's creates an

653
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,759
economy that draws people together as as

654
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,480
opposed to an economy and a currency

655
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,079
base that keeps people apart like the

656
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,159
current one the current one creates

657
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:19,720
divisions inherently within itself for

658
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,559
the people because of the amount of lack

659
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,600
of I should say diversification within

660
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,639
the individual wealth levels perfect

661
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,199
example we're on a way to to Spain for

662
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,520
tomorrow it's going to be awesome trip

663
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,399
and I had to go get some currency

664
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,038
exchange and that currency is worth a

665
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:36,798
lot more than our currency where this

666
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:39,599
currency value was set

667
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,240
on what the individual and what we have

668
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,639
to work with one another as so doesn't

669
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,640
leave you feeling very good does it when

670
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,000
you trade a currency and and it's just

671
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,720
like yeah you get like this much it's

672
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,599
just like like exactly but with this you

673
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,440
you get rewarded with the currency that

674
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,439
you're trading this is a reward you know

675
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,919
what I mean I know that's what I'm kind

676
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,399
of feeling you know when people say to

677
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,360
you are you going to back this currency

678
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:06,959
your answer every time should be who you

679
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:08,798
are that's what's going to make it real

680
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,159
exactly you know there it is right in

681
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,278
the nutshell that's the that's the sound

682
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:15,159
bite right there that's it like yeah

683
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,359
you're the one using individual make

684
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,440
back this that's why money is unreal

685
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,319
yeah we don't need Banks to tell us to

686
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
back this we don't need governments we

687
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,678
need ourselves we need ourselves and

688
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,880
that's what we're talking about this is

689
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,200
bringing us we need our individual

690
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,600
skills and if you don't understand what

691
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
that means understand understand that

692
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,158
money didn't say build the deck that

693
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,480
we're sitting on right now but people

694
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,480
built this deck for the illusion of

695
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,720
money y so it was their labor that built

696
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,159
this deck the illusion of money that

697
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,399
demanded that they require payment

698
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,679
absolutely of monetary terms such as the

699
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,959
American green back before money people

700
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,080
just traded in Nepal half the country 12

701
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,278
million people still just trade they

702
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,918
have trade books and if you help me with

703
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:57,720
my fence I come over and I help you and

704
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,240
dig your well if I help you dig your

705
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,360
well might help me and move some rocks

706
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,278
out of my yard to another area like they

707
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,199
they they live in a jungle and 12 A2

708
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:08,640
million people in Nepal absolutely don't

709
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,480
use currency but I mean at the same time

710
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,640
it's beautiful thing it's a beautiful

711
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:18,759
thing it's they're only poor when they

712
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,320
try to use currency yeah otherwise they

713
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,119
the poorest people in the world are the

714
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,319
happiest people that I see cuz it's not

715
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,000
about money it's about their

716
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,879
surroundings and they once again trade

717
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,919
and we give back and helping one another

718
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,760
this is a great concept too because

719
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,519
right now so many people are putting so

720
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:40,759
much money into glass

721
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,960
pieces it's a great concept that puts

722
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,319
money into glass borrow and the

723
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,720
community but expands it and allows it

724
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,278
to like he was saying earlier like buy a

725
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,519
tractor for a permaculture farmer you

726
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:56,960
know or even you know something next

727
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,200
level like helping you know someone with

728
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,480
with a pro a medication or something

729
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,360
that b cannabis for your medicine see

730
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,839
this the Synergy that we're having right

731
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,199
here you guys are talking about all

732
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,558
these ideas that can happen like this is

733
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,840
what the goal of the project is is

734
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:18,558
to bring people together have the people

735
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,959
themselves do the labor to create a body

736
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,720
of currency and distribute that currency

737
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,120
and move

738
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,240
forward uh with linking up and

739
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:29,839
networking from being at the event like

740
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,839
you guys are both at the event the

741
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,158
permaculture guy and the glass blower

742
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,278
guys and they've got it's not about the

743
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,519
currency like when people come and

744
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:40,480
realize what a sham the currency is and

745
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,399
then turn to the person next to them and

746
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,679
say what do you do like that's the aha

747
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:49,398
moment for this project and that's where

748
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,919
when we make that happen we're executing

749
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:54,398
the vision right I like that it's um

750
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,200
there's a there's a quote that that just

751
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,119
reminds I'm just saying if you come to

752
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,798
an educational seminar with man and John

753
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,439
V and and at the end of the you use a

754
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,759
coin to get in and at the end of the

755
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,639
seminar you actually get two two coins

756
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,960
when you leave right so you can take you

757
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:13,519
can go to the next level seminar and

758
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,720
bring somebody with you so it's like a

759
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,519
propagation of knowledge that

760
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,679
multiplies right so now we're it's it's

761
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,240
and and you'll find more value in that

762
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,038
because of what you're giving and

763
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,558
receiving and even though it's not worth

764
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:29,000
money but it's still worth the knowledge

765
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:30,558
and Ed education that you're getting so

766
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,038
in reality it's worth a lot more than

767
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:36,319
money mhm I mean you have I got I got I

768
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:38,480
got a coin from our educational weekend

769
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,839
seminar with with with learning how to

770
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,720
make bubble whatever you know what I

771
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,519
mean have a bubble man addition or

772
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,240
whatever it's it's it's about yeah I I'm

773
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,880
really totally that's exactly it it's

774
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,038
like on a full Festival level you'd have

775
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,880
all your different activities and you'd

776
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,359
have people that if you sat and you did

777
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,000
the course then you would receive

778
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,240
gratitude icons it's basically the

779
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,359
thanks from the people with the

780
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,519
knowledge for taking the time to learn

781
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:07,839
from them and propagate the knowledge

782
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,720
further so it's not for some reason lost

783
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:13,079
and as you go around this event you'd be

784
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,399
getting two coins so you could keep one

785
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:19,038
or you could bring a buddy to your each

786
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:21,558
of your next you know next levels of of

787
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,839
education is one way that we had uh

788
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:25,759
visualized it that's one it was just

789
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,558
another C St because that's what um I

790
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,720
really like doing is the educational

791
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:31,519
part on what my concept is and stuff

792
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,159
like seems like what we're moving into

793
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,558
naturally in this last year everybody no

794
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,320
well just you and I in particular and

795
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:39,440
the education thing like all of our

796
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,200
YouTube videos are basically educational

797
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,278
videos people need to hear it and that's

798
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,600
what people like and so this this is

799
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,319
also an educational video this this is

800
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,879
it's an educational experience where

801
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,319
people are coming together and part of

802
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,200
the entertainment you know is we have a

803
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,759
music stage but we really we have a

804
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,360
glass blowing stage you know and so the

805
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,359
the local glass blowers are going to

806
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,678
come together together and make work at

807
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,359
each of these events where everyone's

808
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,399
making the currency and stuff and so

809
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,519
that's that's going to be the star

810
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,678
pulling everything not just making the

811
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,679
currency but even like a side project

812
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,880
that we can market with the currency as

813
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,639
part of a way to get people to exchange

814
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,399
to use it to people who want to collect

815
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:20,278
not only will people want to collect the

816
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,119
collector edition currency but they'll

817
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:24,880
also want to support the project but in

818
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:26,599
order to to support the project you have

819
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,159
to collect the currency but it to get

820
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:29,798
the things that are made from the

821
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,600
project you have to give up the Curr

822
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:34,240
give up the currency so it's kind of a

823
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,759
way it's kind of like giving back yeah

824
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,880
you you laugh too I liked it too it's

825
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,278
kind of like it's kind of like well if

826
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,240
you want do here and the funny thing is

827
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,240
to the to the organization to project 33

828
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,120
the coins are always going to be face

829
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,000
value so you know there may be an

830
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:52,879
exchange that happens with the uh what

831
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,880
they're worth but as we deal with them

832
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,240
as people buy into currencies so say it

833
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,559
comes down the road and there's a really

834
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,880
beautiful project 33 piece that's been

835
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:05,599
made and it was like you know 2,000

836
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,559
start bucks is what the cost is and so

837
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,960
you have to figure out how to get 2,000

838
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:14,000
startbucks so one way might be

839
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,800
to exchange directly with project 33

840
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,320
which you know you would be P paying

841
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,280
face value but you don't know which

842
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,159
coins you would necessarily get back

843
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,359
because we're it would be like kind of a

844
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,760
functioning Bank like we' be constantly

845
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,799
taking coins back in order to give

846
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,399
pieces back but then sending coins out

847
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:35,039
out in order to show gratitude for the

848
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:37,679
raw Supply and cost of moving

849
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,800
theing regionally what artists are there

850
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,720
it'll be a different coin and so you

851
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,119
could give in say like hypothetically

852
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,519
speaking like two Brandon Martin lead

853
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,440
coins and get back at the end of the day

854
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,480
when you trade back in you could get

855
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,119
back a Jason Lee lead coin or something

856
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:59,240
like right and as the um as the market

857
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,000
evolves [ __ ]

858
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:03,319
you got a good thought there I I do I'm

859
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,760
trying to express the thought okay so

860
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,400
the idea basically is as the coins are

861
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,320
collected and people are like this is

862
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,639
now part of my collection and I'm not

863
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,559
going to negotiate with it that's going

864
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,920
to be what backs the currency that's

865
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:20,320
exactly like what the government gets

866
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,838
when we all put our money in the bank

867
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
totally all of a sudden they have all

868
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,400
this money to work with and so when

869
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
these are collected and we're forced to

870
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,320
just keep printing more and more and

871
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,760
more of them and create more of them and

872
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,119
they keep getting collected that allows

873
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,040
the war chest for our idea to propagate

874
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,440
itself to get bigger and thicker and

875
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,239
more powerful and so that's really

876
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,440
what's backing when it comes back to

877
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,000
what's backing the coin you're backing

878
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,039
the coin you know and how you back that

879
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,838
coin is by collecting it and what

880
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,599
happens when you collect it well this

881
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:55,199
organization which

882
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,920
is this this it's not an organization

883
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,480
it's an artistic idea it's a cry still

884
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,800
being that's being birthed that you

885
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,639
know it's joining here joining people

886
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,599
it's it's going to yeah it's going to be

887
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:14,318
a beautiful thing um and uh you know and

888
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,640
I I'm eternally grateful for being able

889
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:19,838
to play a part in bringing this idea uh

890
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,078
to

891
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:25,920
us but anyhow it's I would just add the

892
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,240
filter for people that aren't quite at a

893
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,159
point in their life where they're really

894
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,318
ready to hear what Marcel just said and

895
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,639
by hear I mean kind of understand it and

896
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:37,480
be inspired by it Marcel's not crazy

897
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,920
he's actually just like well ahead of

898
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,240
his time like he is he's ahead of his

899
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,639
time I've known this dude for like

900
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,399
almost 20 years and he's just always

901
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:48,440
been ahead of his time which is awesome

902
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,960
because his time has been catching up to

903
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,599
him he's not like a hundred years ahead

904
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,880
of his time he's just he's about 5 to 10

905
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,480
years ahead of some of what you who are

906
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,160
listening right now and I don't mean

907
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,880
that in an insult of way I just mean

908
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,279
like truly the dude is like even I'm

909
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,519
listening to him and earlier FL was like

910
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,800
what do you think of this idea like what

911
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,599
do you think of it and I'm just like

912
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,400
well dude it's Marcel so like right now

913
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,880
I think that he's struggling to voice

914
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,720
into

915
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,119
language what he really sees and he's

916
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:20,879
just able to squirt out little bits to

917
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,880
us and so clab was like oh yeah yeah

918
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,119
you're right you're right and I was

919
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,280
that's the way I see it like he's I have

920
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,440
faith in Marcel that if he has a project

921
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:34,480
in mind that it'll only have done good

922
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,240
in the end I never hear oh yeah that

923
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,760
that thing flopped large for Marcel that

924
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:42,318
was a huge flop so what I'm saying as

925
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,760
bubble man to you guys who are listening

926
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:45,480
this would be something that if you hear

927
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,319
more about or you have a way of hearing

928
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,199
more about it you should definitely look

929
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:50,519
into it it's going to be it's going to

930
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,559
be something you're going to hear more

931
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,679
about whether you like it or not just

932
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,559
it's just going to be up to you whether

933
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:59,279
you want to be a part of it there no

934
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,000
than a Bitcoin it's no different

935
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,280
conceptually it's just something that

936
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,760
from the heart and the Soul you want to

937
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,680
back a little better from the glass

938
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,640
community and you can hold it I think

939
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,480
exactly it's pretty pretty beautiful

940
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,199
actually I think I think it's uh it's

941
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,199
it's just something real and it's made

942
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:18,519
by real people and your for real intent

943
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:21,879
and real knowledge and and being able to

944
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:21,880
actually I mean

945
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,078
it's a pretty cool it's a pretty cool

946
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,599
concept is when you when when you really

947
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,119
start thinking about it and actually

948
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,680
talking with yourself for the last

949
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,599
basically hour about really getting in

950
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,199
depth about it and stuff like that is is

951
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:38,559
the whole concept behind this is is

952
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,159
about connecting communities and

953
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,799
connecting people and being able to

954
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,519
really join us as a whole and

955
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,200
understanding it isn't about money it's

956
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:50,960
it's it's really it's here it's it's

957
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,118
really it's about trying to like learn

958
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,559
to trust the Integrity of the people

959
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,440
around you to do the right thing and

960
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,440
pass the resources on that they need

961
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,440
need to get down the road to do whatever

962
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,358
it is that they're trying to do and how

963
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,039
about explaining to people who are who

964
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,838
are watching that really have little

965
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:09,838
concept of the glass world and the glass

966
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,358
community and the collect collective

967
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,159
value and whatnot but the simple

968
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,598
explanation of like what these coins are

969
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,679
and how they're made can you give that

970
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,000
to us just a quick couple of minutes you

971
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,199
know because I mean I know what A Millie

972
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,760
is and everyone here does but some

973
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,159
people watching might be like what are

974
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,440
those that he's holding this is a a Mila

975
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,719
fiori it's a cane has a picture in the

976
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,400
crosssection so it's built up from the

977
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,959
center outward uh to have a picture in

978
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,039
it yep you kind of stripe them on

979
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,720
there's several methods and then it's

980
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:42,440
pulled from a large piece down to a

981
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,719
smaller piece and it's sliced and

982
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,679
Polished yeah so he's like pull the cane

983
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,039
into a tube almost and then it's like

984
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,719
you just slice it into pieces so all of

985
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,318
these were part of one long cane and so

986
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,039
that's why we have all different sizes

987
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:57,838
because part of the cane was thicker and

988
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:01,639
part of the cane get smaller

989
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:05,358
right as you were pulling it so kind of

990
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:07,318
like pulling something apart we get the

991
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,719
smaller ones and you get a lot of them

992
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:11,639
are the same size but you can see the

993
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,959
different dimensions and it's uh well

994
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,279
you know it's it's very unique and at

995
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,720
the same time it's

996
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,079
uh I don't know I think it's rewarding

997
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,559
when you when when you get something

998
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,119
this is not like a a dollar that you get

999
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,639
from the you know I mean bank machine

1000
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,039
this is it's got more it's more real to

1001
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,679
it you know what I mean and even more so

1002
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,000
for the people that were actually like

1003
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,639
if you could actually be a part of

1004
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,159
creating that's that's what that's where

1005
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,358
it becomes more real to it you become a

1006
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,159
part we're going to become a part of

1007
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,199
creating one oh yeah I can see it

1008
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,239
already for our educational seminars

1009
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:44,759
yeah there you go our cross country

1010
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:48,159
educational seminars will be brought to

1011
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,599
you by no I'm just joking to you soon

1012
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:54,358
borrow coins no no but I

1013
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,440
mean it's it's a it's a way of if really

1014
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:58,960
um and then the more festivals and the

1015
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,838
more that you have bringing together the

1016
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,119
more people are wanting to demand them

1017
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,639
because it's creating more people bring

1018
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,440
your out together so the first one

1019
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,838
starts and then the talk get going you

1020
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,159
have to do a second and then the funding

1021
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,119
comes for the third because we keep

1022
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,598
creating the bank and every time you

1023
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,000
have a festival you create a bank of

1024
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,800
people come to create that and then

1025
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,199
those people and and you'll see it over

1026
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,519
time growing that everybody's going to

1027
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,879
want to come to the festival and all of

1028
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,639
a sudden we're going to well okay we

1029
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,079
only got enough people to here we got to

1030
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,279
stop here we got too many people

1031
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,480
involved in this going to be

1032
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,680
with that'll be you know part of the

1033
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,960
challenge of maintaining like full

1034
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:37,799
accessibility of you know how do we make

1035
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,440
this uh throughput process where like as

1036
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,119
many people are able to like participate

1037
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,720
as possible CU currently it's exactly

1038
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,960
the opposite they're trying to make as

1039
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:49,759
few people participate as possible in

1040
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,000
the creation of the system where we

1041
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,599
track everything and really we need as

1042
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,559
many people as possible to create uh to

1043
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:01,519
participate in that system so that the

1044
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:04,920
focus becomes focused and we can focus

1045
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:09,358
on fixing things like the planet and you

1046
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:12,599
know just basic Sur basic survivability

1047
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:16,318
things I mean if there could be any

1048
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:18,760
one any one thing that makes me uh

1049
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:21,079
really upset it's the wealth gap between

1050
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,319
the very rich and the very poor you know

1051
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,680
I mean couldn't we just like close it

1052
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:29,679
like 50% from each Direction and call it

1053
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:30,879
a day like that would be you know a huge

1054
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,799
Improvement and there would still be

1055
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,200
huge amounts of wealth on that original

1056
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,280
side anyway I mean it's not like you're

1057
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:40,838
going to be 12 it does seem a little it

1058
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,720
does seem ridiculous when you9 billion

1059
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,119
yeah like when you got 99% of everything

1060
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:48,558
to give up like 30% of 99 and be left

1061
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,920
with that like oh well I mean seriously

1062
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,800
maybe it's just like no one needs a

1063
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,599
billion dollars maybe if we just had

1064
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,880
millionaires that the wealth would be

1065
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,720
more evenly

1066
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,880
distributed well and I think that's one

1067
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,959
of the you know one of the things that's

1068
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,640
most important with a gift economy is

1069
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,679
that you don't hoard resource so if you

1070
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:09,118
make a big uh come up you make

1071
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:10,879
$100,000 like in the gift economy you

1072
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,280
would immediately redistribute that

1073
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,559
wealth and the way that you would see

1074
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,599
benefit in your life would be that okay

1075
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,800
I just had 100 Grand handed to me on a

1076
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,640
silver plate and I gave 30 grand to

1077
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,318
three friends and they all three went

1078
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,759
out and started businesses you don't

1079
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,119
think that your life is going to get a

1080
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,040
little bit more fun when you're three

1081
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,599
three best friends now also have boats

1082
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:35,000
and you're on the lake having a great

1083
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,599
time and you all have the ability to

1084
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,480
like interact like so by rather than

1085
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,599
saving that you've incre you've tripled

1086
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,599
your security because now if something

1087
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:49,559
happens to you you have two friends who

1088
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,280
have got your back 110% as well so it's

1089
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,640
almost better than putting that money in

1090
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,880
the bank which in the bank it's being

1091
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:57,879
used against all of us loaned out to

1092
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,960
people so they can pay three times the

1093
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,838
value of the negotiation they made for

1094
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,559
their piece of real estate you know fake

1095
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:07,239
piece of paper right and we all have to

1096
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,880
go through banks to buy real estate and

1097
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:13,558
we all have like family and friends and

1098
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,920
resources that are in the banks and

1099
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,119
that's why the banks have the money to

1100
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,079
loan us so we can give them all that

1101
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:24,880
money you know so the concept of keeping

1102
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,839
energy in play uh is really is really

1103
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,280
core to the gift economy and how it can

1104
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:31,119
work work to where people just don't

1105
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,519
have to work as hard cuz you're making a

1106
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:37,000
more efficient system we're creating a

1107
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,480
reong hole pretty damn

1108
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,119
cool yeah yeah it's it's it's really

1109
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,440
cool I don't think the government's

1110
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,760
going to like us but you know what we

1111
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,280
already know they don't right now so

1112
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,880
it's okay and it seems like times are

1113
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,079
right for change doesn't it um we that's

1114
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,680
that's the whole thing the change and

1115
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,599
what's going on I mean this this this

1116
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:58,639
beautiful plant's making change and and

1117
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:01,519
people make change and and this is

1118
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:03,358
another change and this is about about

1119
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:07,000
working with another and being real you

1120
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:09,759
know it's the concept is is is just so

1121
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,639
crazy CU it it just it's so organic and

1122
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,559
how it's going to grow right and and

1123
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,558
that's that's another thing of all it's

1124
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,400
organic and it's the it's the people

1125
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,000
behind it that create it and it's us

1126
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,680
that make it real I mean I believe as

1127
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,440
easily as a handful of people could ruin

1128
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:29,199
the whole planet we can all simply wake

1129
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,960
up and change it and change it and make

1130
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:35,838
that impossible you know there's there

1131
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:39,679
is no need for

1132
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:42,239
apocalyptic interventions it's it's as

1133
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:45,199
simple as people making simple

1134
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:48,078
choices all at once taking a conscious

1135
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,118
leap into the new paradigm just

1136
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,160
believing in each other

1137
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,318
100% there is a conscious shift

1138
00:45:54,159 --> 00:46:00,719
building it is difficult man I have just

1139
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:03,358
like gone through a week of not having

1140
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,719
that totally centered in my heart and it

1141
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,960
was not you know the most beneficial to

1142
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:12,318
My Life um

1143
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,480
but you know it's difficult I mean it's

1144
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:17,318
not like it's not easy to be happy all

1145
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,679
the time to be positive and support

1146
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:22,400
yourself in the in the right ways and uh

1147
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:26,159
and always make yourself available for

1148
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,680
others in positive manners to help them

1149
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,719
all the time

1150
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,759
but if if isn't it true that hash makes

1151
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:33,358
all that so much a little bit easier

1152
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,680
hash always makes that easier that is

1153
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:37,519
with question there is no question about

1154
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,679

the coin a Starship in every garage you

1194
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:24,318
know and that's really the the backing

1195
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:27,599
slogan of the whole thing and when I

1196

find myself wondering I come back to the

1197
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,720
to the basic slogan which is a Starship

1198
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:33,558
in every garage God that you can it's

1199
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:36,480
pretty insane that you can make pictures

1200
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:36,480
like that and then like

1201
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,279

00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:46,480
