1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,359
some I it was a really interesting

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:07,639
discussion uh just so our audience knows

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,800
because I'm not sure everybody is tuned

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,080
in on this tell them what EC is and why

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,080
it's

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,800
important yeah so EC it's the electrical

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,600
conductivity that it it's the measure

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,519
that reflects the the the amount or the

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,599
concentration of nutrients in in a in a

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,518
sample or at the at the root Zone

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,200
depending how how you how you're reading

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:35,839
from which stample is starting so the

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,960
the E is the con in simple words it's

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,680
just the concentration of nutrients here

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,840
giving to the plant or at the root at

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:47,159
the root Zone and that that has a direct

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,320
impact on your on the on the osmotic

18
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,558
pressure at the root Zone and so which

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,159
and the osmotic pressure has a direct

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:59,078
correlation with water absorbance and

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,000
water uh movement within the within the

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,359
plant and and so obviously a direct

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,280
impact on the growth on the yield and

24
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:11,840
and the other point as I mentioned

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:14,359
earlier is with our uh uh goal to to to

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,280
maximize the water stress to obtain more

27
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,359
cannabinoids and Turpin that comes with

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,320
some secondary effects like uh the Dr

29
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,400
the huge dryb backs we are aiming for uh

30
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:29,239
they result in in uh higher ACS which

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,960
means Building Salt building within the

32
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:35,879
uh the roots Zone and so that's why we

33
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:38,280
have to use balanced recipes uh and make

34
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,199
sure all what we are delivering to the

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,239
plant is uptaken and not just uh

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,200
building within the road

37
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:49,199
Zone yeah abely that's great you know I

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,399
mean as a

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,000
chemist and and you know as a scientist

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,560
I I I love this connection right because

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,078
um uh certainly like if you think about

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,519
uh you know you think about electrical

43
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,399
conductivity in plants or in soil what

44
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,878
the H you know that that's like some

45
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,439
electrical measurement that you should

46
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,280
be making on a a phone or a device or

47
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,959
something right it doesn't necessarily

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,560
compute with some people on why

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,640
electrical conductivity is important in

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,519
living systems but I think you explained

51
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,719
it

52
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,560
beautifully and um you you know that we

53
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,400
do have we we do we do have these at the

54
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,199
beginning where we we where we just

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,599
started we were using the runoff uh and

56
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,759
then with some probes we do the EC

57
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:38,839
readings in the runoff but as Marcus

58
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:41,878
mentioned sometimes we have these high

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,598
values of EC in the runoff but at this

60
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,158
at the end we we started using some

61
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,439
probes to read the EC within the the

62
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,120
root Zone and we found that there is a

63
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,598
gap so the the reference of using the in

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,120
rock and I know in soil with the pull

65
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,878
through me method it works in soil you

66
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,439
should look at the run up in Coco as

67
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:02,239
well but in rock I think it's better to

68
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,199
to make it's more accurate to make the

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,439
readings at the RO at the root Zone uh

70
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,119
to have a to make better

71
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,680
decisions super and it's not specific

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,239
for any any one salt right it just

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,319
basically gives you an overall level of

74
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,480
how much ionic material you have down

75
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,919
there right so it's not specific for

76
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,280
like a nitrate or a sulfate or anything

77
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,479
like that right that's the leaf analysis

78
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,400
so the EC would give you just how spicy

79
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,919
you are in the in the in the in the in

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,799
your recipe at the root Zone but it's

81
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,798
the leaf analysis that we give you in

82
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,560
details how much nitrogen you have how

83
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,040
much calcium magnesium and it's it's in

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,039
there
