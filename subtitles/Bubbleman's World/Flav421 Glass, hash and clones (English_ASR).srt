00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,759
learning who has literally learned one

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,479
technique from a friend and you're just

52
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,318
kind of copying that technique over and

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,359
over and over again that potential

54
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:33,759
copying that experience will lead you to

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,879
mistakes will lead you to um Revelations

56
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,840
and will lead you potentially to create

57
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,359
something like this um I'm going to hit

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
the the NES or the

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,640
Arian the Arian

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,039
Haze I believe I'm not sure what number

61
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,318
this was but aran's number three I was

62
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,719
in this grow when he had all the mothers

63
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,479
and I think there's four or five of them

64
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,400
um the number three was uh had a

65
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,238
Neville's cut in it it had the super

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,760
silver hair ha which was um uh worked on

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,360
by Shany Baba and then it had another

68
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:12,439
some other create a la sativa so really

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,480
quite a beautiful selection of genetics

70
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,479
to put

71
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,679

rarely request pieces but when he asked

89
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,800
me in my head I pictured this piece and

90
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,720

pipe like this and fill it with anything

99
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:52,000
