me from different companies and this

12
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,519
particular product got sent to

13
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:53,079

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,160
check these guys out at DC glass . CA so

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,159
that's

18
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,159
dcg

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,159
a.ca uh the owner is Mick and I've dealt

20
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,560
with him for some years when he was

21
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,439
representing a ariser or aiter from uh

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,759
the Solo vaporizer and those different

23
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,639
units I I sold I I traded a bunch

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
through him and did a little bit of

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,079
business and that's how I got to know

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,040
him and recently he called me up and he

27
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,959
said I want to get I want to send you a

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,960
couple of these uh quartz bangers and

29
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,438
they're very much like the quav bangers

30
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,239
they look almost identical to it from

31
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,000
where I sit and I said to him that I I

32
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,599
was excited that he wanted to send me a

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,799
couple but right off the bat I said you

34
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,078
know what send me send me two because

35
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,159
I'm going to send one to the guys at

36
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,319
denail I don't know much about quartz I

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,640
know that there are different levels uh

38
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,118
of qualities of quarts and I know that

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,280
those guys seem to pay the most

40
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:59,078
attention to such thing I know that they

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,680
don't offer cheap quarts at denail the

42
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,319
nails are too $2 to $300 just for a

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,719
single quartz nail so he was very

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,359
excited that I wanted to do that he said

45
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,919
oh great great great cuz this is German

46
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,598
quartz it's super high quality etc etc

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,479
etc

48
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,238
so shows up in a nice little case kind

49
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,759
of give you the show there lean

50
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,840
in and then we got that little

51
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,519
Banger little

52
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,319
Banger so I guess really the only way to

53
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,519
try such a

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,759
[Music]

55
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,759
thing is to

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,680
prepare some

57
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:42,039
dabs and Heat this little butter up so

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,000
I've got my Swiss perk for the job I

59
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,199
figur this will be a great little angle

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,039
it's a 90° uh perk and this is at a 45°

61
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:54,439
angle so it's actually quite nice got my

62
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,318
torch right here for heating it up now

63
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,878
it's just really a

64
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,799
matter of getting a little bowl of hash

65
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,199
together

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,200
have some gummier hash

67
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,598
here need to just press it up into a dab

68
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:14,039
of course you guys been paying attention

69
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:16,798
to the internet all the rage these days

70
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:19,239
is to grab the little uh mini hair

71
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,080
straightener and use some uh I wouldn't

72
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,439
personally use just parchment but what

73
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,400
Tony was using um in Amsterdam which was

74
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:31,000
the oil slick parchment I guess it's a

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,799
Teflon uh level of of parchment so

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,400
let's see what we got here we got a nice

77
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,799
dab of some varieties of hash that I

78
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,000
just squeezed

79
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:45,200
together get it onto the Dabber

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,199
there our little torch turned

81
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:54,519
on so I'm not a huge torch guy but I got

82
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:57,679
to say I do love the idea of the shape

83
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:02,039
and the color of this quartz I haven't

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:05,159
used many um quav bangers but uh it's a

85
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,759
great it's easy to use it's accessible

86
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:07,959
you can see it if you're filming or

87
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,399
you're watching and you want to watch

88
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,239
your product bubble and melt I got to

89
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,680
say I like

90
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,040
it now it's just a matter of getting the

91
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,918
quartz hot

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,919
enough so I can take a nice

93
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,960
rip that is a thick GL torch thick

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,560
quartz Bowl I'll tell you my little mini

95
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,758
torch is barely getting the job

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,319
done I got another thing that was sent

97
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,400
to me recently as well by another

98
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:43,199
company that will go uh over right after

99
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,679
this I think it's got to be hot even

100
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,360
though it's really not showing any signs

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,120
of orange the way it normally

102
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,120
does let's give it a

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
shot

104
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,120
well great taste I can tell you the

105
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,758
thickness on this quartz is unbelievable

106
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,800
I barely it never got orange which I was

107
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,479
waiting for it to do and it never did I

108
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
could tell that it was hot as [ __ ] and

109
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:37,240
it still took a beautiful hit condensed

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,639
a little bit of of of uh oil off of the

111
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,840
hash onto the uh inside of the quartz

112
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,680
but I got to say that's a real nice

113
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,198
quartz Banger not too shabby Dark

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,879
Crystal glass now you see a ton of these

115
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,800
on the internet don't be fooled by the

116
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,478
glass ones they explode they don't work

117
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,160
properly they're not really the safest

118
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:01,079
bet to be torching and Cooling and

119
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,919
torching and cooling um quartz is much

120
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,120
better for such things this is a nice

121
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,719
thick Looking Glass quartz and uh you

122
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,598
know what I'll give it a shot I'll smoke

123
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,000
it for the next few days The Taste was

124
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:13,719
there it tasted great I'm not sure on

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,959
the cost on these but I would guess if

126
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,000
they're the quality that uh he said they

127
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,159
were when he sent them they're not going

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,560
to be 20 or $50 they're going to

129
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,160
probably be hundred plus dollars but

130
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,160
check the website uh www.dc

131
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,360
tell them bubble man sent you you might

132
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,038
even get a little discount I don't know

133
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,680
thank you um thank you Mick for sending

134
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,000
this out by the way I really appreciate

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,079
that and uh you'll see me hitting it

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,720
more uh more every day so let's get on

137
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,560
to our second package

138
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,410
here so I have this haven't pulled this

139
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,439
guy out

140
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:59,879
[Music]

141
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,918
yet okay so this is stuck to the bottom

142
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,919
of this one I

143
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:04,918
see

144
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,399
okay got to make some room I'm

145
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,879
surrounded in hashish here as you

146
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,399
probably already have

147
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,120
noticed oh

148
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:19,478
trippy now this is a really nice package

149
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,759
to see this package comes from amelo and

150
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,959
the good people at trippy sticks now a

151
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
lot of you guys have been asking me do

152
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,318
you still use trippy sticks do you still

153
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,959
use trippy sticks I absolutely still use

154
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
trippy sticks um I find that the Trippy

155
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,719
Stick

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,038
is perfect for certain situations um

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,960
recently when we were at the um Hobbit

158
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,360
part three of The Hobbit we were trippy

159
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,560
sticking down the congales like crazy

160
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,598
and it was very very enjoyable so let's

161
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,319
see what Mr amelo has sent in this

162
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,800
little package it looks like an exciting

163
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,439
package right off the bat he sent he's

164
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,478
got these bags of trippy wipes these are

165
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,000
just basically alcohol wipes but it's

166
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,719
nice to have a big swack of them this is

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,639
a great idea I think that he's smart for

168
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,639
this one good call amelo with the trippy

169
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,560
wipes and then we've got let's see else

170
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,560
what else we've got

171
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,478
here oh he sent me a variety of things

172
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,478
here we've

173
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:26,399
got really cool tricolored green gray

174
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,399
and blue uh Trippy Stick

175
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:35,440
2.0 must be one of the newest units oh

176
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:38,000
look at that that's pretty damn nice so

177
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,519
I guess what he's done here is on the

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,240
smaller um half units these little ones

179
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,000
here which oh yeah these are much higher

180
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,720
quality so in the crack you can see when

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,679
you crack them open that it's a much

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,320
deeper bigger dish it's got a larger um

183
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,838
deeper ceramic dish and a a lot more um

184
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,720
of the titanium wire so I guess that's

185
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,480
how he's changed that up that might even

186
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,278
be a Trippy 3.0 I'm not too sure and

187
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,519
then we've

188
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:12,480
got the cookies we got the mini I guess

189
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,240
him and burner went and did a combo a

190
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,240
collab on the little Tri uh the cloud

191
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,039
type style pen but no this is totally

192
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,200
different oh no no it is I'm sorry wow

193
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,439
did that ever look cool though it looked

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,600
like they were really really thin so

195
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
this is the original Trippy Stick and

196
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,120
then cloud and many other companies came

197
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,000
out with this similar style and I loved

198
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
my Trippy Stick of this style I still

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,759
have my gold Trippy Stick of this style

200
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,000
uh both of these say cookies so you get

201
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,879
a red one and a white one and they both

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,480
say cookies they've got their

203
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:52,879
mouthpieces and one single um charger

204
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,800
pretty cool not too bad amelo not too

205
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,200
bad amelo and burner putting it out

206
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,559
there with the cookies well we all know

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,440
the cookies are pretty much one of the

208
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,879
most popular the strains going right now

209
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,839
especially down in Cali even in

210
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,000
Amsterdam people were were all up and

211
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,959
and down about cookies so um he also

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,399
sent some tools some Trippy Stick tools

213
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:18,799
which I was excited to see so he's got

214
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,839
these um all lined together you want to

215
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,519
see those there you can see that he's

216
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,040
got one for pushing it down he's got one

217
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,078
that's a little more gentle it's so got

218
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,639
a rubber rubber tip on the end of it and

219
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,159
and then one for

220
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,600
scooping so that's a great idea that's

221
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:38,519
something that these guys were

222
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,560
definitely smart to do I uh I've been

223
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,000
waiting for them and then he's got them

224
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,919
in the other color too so he's got them

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,278
in the dark black and in Gold so two

226
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,799
little colors

227
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:53,799
there very very cool and I got to say I

228
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,679
saved what I think is the best for last

229
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:59,078
I've been pretty excited about this

230
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,278
particular um Trippy Stick uh I watch

231
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,239
watched him post about it a few times

232
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,399
and then it wasn't very much longer that

233
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,919
he was contacting me and saying hey

234
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:13,519
man when can I send you one of these uh

235
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:15,679
units so that is the herbal unit listen

236
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
I'm excited about this I haven't even

237
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,399
seen these in real in real life yet I've

238
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,160
only seen pictures of

239
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:26,320
them look at that that is a pretty nice

240
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,639
looking Unit H uh amelo holy [ __ ] look

241
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,959

242
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,480
cuber big Cube unit nice and lightweight

243
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,479
in the hand and I got to tell you when

244
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:40,720
you open it up just like everything

245
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,680
amelo does the guy's got style he really

246
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,680

247
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,359
love his colors I love that he really

248
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,239
represents and respects people's Styles

249
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,720
and how people want to be different and

250
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,360
have styles and that's kind of one of

251
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,519
the things that I've really uh seen that

252
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,480
I've liked from uh from the Trippy Stick

253
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,519
crew so it's it's got a USB or a a

254
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,480
little plug on the bottom for for play

255
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,839
to record

256
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,959
it top pops off right nice and easy the

257
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,399
top I'm going to come show you

258
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,838
guys the top

259
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,440
has a little screen right on top of the

260
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,959
mouthpiece and then inside you've got

261
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,360
your chamber that actually fits a decent

262
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,879
amount of

263
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,959
herb

264
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,519
so

265
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,399
and let's see I've never used this a

266
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,919
single time so this is me using it for

267
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,000
the first time amelo never told me how

268
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:41,838
to use it he says uh he's got a little

269
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,078
brush for cleaning it he's got a micro

270
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,720
USB cord into USB outlet for charging it

271
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:49,159
um tips are a slow and steady inhale

272
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,240
puff will produce the best results

273
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:56,360
That's a classic um vaporizer tip in my

274
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,839
opinion hauling on it like it just cools

275
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,480
the elements down and it gives you less

276
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,440
of a hit so they're talking about really

277
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,159
taking this slow draw um they highly

278
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,839
recommend the trippy tools for packing

279
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,360
and removing herbs from The Vapor bowl

280
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,720
and they've got the list of tools here

281
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,480
and then uh yeah they mention the

282
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,759
temperature so let's see how we can turn

283
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,278
this bad boy

284
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:23,278
on press five times one two three four

285
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,278
five and she goes right

286
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,919
on once unit is on you will see numbers

287
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,919
in the LCD press and hold for 4 seconds

288
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,198
then then release releas the LCD will

289
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,120
light up and the vapor Bowl will start

290
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,159
heating

291
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,320
well I guess I better put a little herb

292
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,639
in the

293
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,199
unit I got some really nice herb

294
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,159
recently given to me it is um star

295
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,679
starbud see if I can give you guys a

296
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,679
little closeup on this little

297
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,519
guy you see the quality on that

298
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,758
nugget that's quality and yes I've got a

299
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,570
little

300
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,079
hair on my thumb I'll get off a little

301
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:09,199
[Music]

302
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,278
fiber so then five times press and hold

303
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,679
for 4 seconds then release and it'll

304
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,320
heat up

305
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,879
interesting okay well I'm excited to see

306
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,199
this uh this little unit work this butt

307
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,360
is perfectly dried for vaporization I'll

308
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:26,919
tell you that

309
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,440
much perfectly dried let me use my

310
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:32,599
trippy tools I guess right off the bat

311
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,079
probably one real good idea is to not

312
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,680
like overpack this thing and press the

313
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:40,359
herbs down as hard as you can probably

314
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,359
not the greatest

315
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,319
idea I'm going to put it down a little

316
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,959
bit all right so put that down so now

317
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,439
the second thing said to hold this for

318
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,439
four for 4 seconds

319
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,198
one

320
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,039
I think I might

321
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,278
have all right so we're back on turned

322
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,799
itself off now I'm going to hold this

323
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,799
for 4

324
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,879
seconds all right so there we go pretty

325
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,240
simple the LED uh lit up I don't know if

326
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,320
you guys can see it but it's it's

327
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,320
heating up to

328
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,320

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,640
through like really strong but but thin

348
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,640
I can taste the flavor of that plant on

349

352
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,798
be a bubble man godsend um you know I

353
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,958
saw amelo and I wasn't overly excited

354
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,440
when I saw just the Instagram photos and

355
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,400
stuff but once again dude you've blown

356
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,200
me away as simple as sending me a unit

357
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,200
and letting me try

358
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,000
it really really

359
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:54,279
nice light Vapor rips from this thing

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,159
and when's the last time I got to really

361
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:59,440
just Vape herb probably the last time I

362
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,039
had my sublimator going

363
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,320
thank you guys from Trippy Stick this is

364
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,679
an A1 product that I can guarantee you

365
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,720
uh you guys are going to have a lot of

366
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,360
copycats because I can just tell it just

367
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,798
feels good in the hand it's small

368
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:16,240
compact this is something that uh that

369
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:16,240
has real

370
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,000
potential holding its temperature

371
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,880
perfectly okay but not burning the herb

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
that's in inside so the element must be

373
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,840
below holding the temperature perfectly

374
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,599
but somehow being kept from heating up

375
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,480
the herb that's right above it because

376
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,918
I'm able to sit and talk this thing's

377
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,960
still at 391

378
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:49,400
91° you know tiny tiny little bit of new

379
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,798
piece taste when I took my first Rip but

380
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,640
the the purity of the vapor was so clean

381
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:57,319
and nice that it really overpowered even

382
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,320
that sort of new taste

383
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,319
smell

384
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,519
wow this means a lot to me because

385
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,558
people offer me cannabis all the time

386
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,000
and in fact Flav gave me this bud just

387
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,519
the other day of the star dog and he was

388
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,440
saying to me oh you know do you have a

389
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,119
vaporizer I'm like well not really and

390
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,240
he said well you know I I'll leave you a

391
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:27,839
butt anyway and then a few days later uh

392
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,359
amelo sends me this so I I got to say

393

401
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,759
thickness of the quartz that he used he

402
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,600
did not skimp on this whatsoever so I'll

403

405
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,039
