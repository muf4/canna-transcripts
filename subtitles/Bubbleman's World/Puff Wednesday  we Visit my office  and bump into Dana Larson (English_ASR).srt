place you've never been so long and I

6
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,659
feel like I haven't spent the last 7

7
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:36,179
days with you so what are we doing today

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,949
we're at my office we've got a couple of

9
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,019
beautiful Luke Brown psychedelic

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,109
visionary art if you want to check him

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:47,550

12
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:52,829
eyes yeah he's got all this psychedelic

13
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:54,899
art you tell me it's insane well nobody

14
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,460
could for sure that was Alex gray and

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,620
he's friends with Alex gray and he's

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,140
he's definitely a visionary psychedelic

17
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,189
artist and I supported them back in the

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,239
day when we used to hang out at the

19
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:08,009
gallery and what we're here today for

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,688
however is John and I are gonna smoke a

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,890
few bowls while we're at my office we

22
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,329
were just down here grabbing a few

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,549
things got some meetings in regards to

24
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:18,868
new ideas new companies new concepts

25
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,820
that we're gonna be working on in the

26
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,430
near future here but I thought this

27
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,669
would be a good opportunity for us to

28
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:28,500
come hit some glass history and so I'm

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,099
gonna bring up the pieces one by one

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,969
we're gonna start with Marcel number 399

31
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,798
now Marcel blew this back in 1999 it was

32
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,920
the third piece of three that he did in

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,930
the year and well let's just say it's

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,480
completely epic

35
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,110
it's got a great pull on it dolphins the

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,109
whole nine yards once we hit Marcel

37
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,030
we're gonna go hit the OG max Poland now

38
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:57,219
I may or may not have bought this for

39
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,460
max in the 90s I can't remember if it

40
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:02,950
was actually in the 2000s that I bought

41
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,589
it but max did this double bubbler this

42
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,960
is quite a nice little piece for max he

43
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,180
does giant pieces now it's got the

44
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,280
crushed opal you know this is a decade

45
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,730
plus before dohsa or any of these guys

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,229
we're crushing the opal just really cool

47
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:20,530
unique double bubbler and we're gonna

48
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:23,229
hit that little piece of Max history and

49
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,000
then finally I'm gonna hit my upright

50
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:27,069
piece I wish this was clean but I got to

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,099
show you this anyway this is a prototype

52
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,109
piece that Jason Lee sent me years ago

53
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,359
this might have been sent to me in 99 or

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,880
2000 I can't remember it's an upright

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,590
doubler it's right when he learned the

56
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,389
seal that allowed him to make those

57
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,009
double bubblers actually I'll show you

58
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:44,259
one real quickly just because we have

59
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:46,149
them this one's a slinger and it's

60
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:48,129
actually a Tripler but if you guys

61
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,900
remember these pipes and when they came

62
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:53,049
on the market we started selling them on

63
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,599
overgrow and stuff that's this seal when

64
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,070
Jason made this seal and showed slinger

65
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,079
and a few other blowers and they started

66
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,699
showing other people that really opened

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,190
the door for this double and triple and

68
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,959
quadruple public concept this bond was

69
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:08,020
one of the first ones and it was an

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,879
upright unit double bubbler chamber up

71
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,909
their secondary chamber here

72
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,489
cool little ziggity you know marble

73
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:18,969
style Jason Lee and just think he's here

74
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,950
a little opal in there and he's actually

75
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:25,359
got a middle ear right on the top of the

76
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:27,789
piece so pretty cool stuff historical in

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,370
my opinion kidding the old glass that

78
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:31,629
the glassblowers you know it was the

79
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,819
beginning of all of this it was the

80
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:37,989
start of all of this so we've got our

81
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,669
three pieces what say we start with well

82
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,700
let's start with Jason he's right there

83
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,579
I just would like to say wow

84
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:48,759
because I never knew yeah that is so

85
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,849
cool I mean we got in class education

86
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:53,729
today absolutely which is John said you

87
00:03:51,848 --> 00:04:00,969
liked it hit some fresh bar of course

88
00:03:53,729 --> 00:04:03,519
awesome we talked about the coming up

89
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:06,060
I'll let you clean that tell me we don't

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,640
put our dirty skillet tools into our

91
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,959
supremely clean dry sifted resins and we

92
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,729
just give it a quick little flash with

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,259
the lighter a white with a rag you

94
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,668
finger some rags good if you use a lot

95
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,709
of that dirty if you're hitting it a lot

96
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,689
though I have to admit like that would

97
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,699
be ridiculous trying to wipe it always

98
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:26,649
with your fingers if you have a rag

99
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,240
you're still a table stay clean all the

100
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:30,370
time if you choose to clean it with your

101
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,620
fingers nine out of ten times when

102
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,269
someone picks it up it'll be dirty and I

103
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,310
say that with my own experience because

104
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:39,339
I was cleaning my with my hand too now I

105
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:44,949
have the rag and man I'm loving it check

106
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:46,750
it out clean skillet tool so what we

107
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,370
notice is what we get this phone cools

108
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,819
dirty is because we're hitting a Dean

109
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,579
now like exactly just solid and then

110
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:57,370
when you pick up nice hash with that

111
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,839
deep with that scooper he end up we

112
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:05,439
ended up getting a little little blobs

113
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:06,069
of contamination inside and this one's

114
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,529
yours buddy

115
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,060
Oh put a smile on my face and when you

116
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,879
get that smile it just means I just

117
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,180
decreased a little bit there's a little

118
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:20,199
carb hole always happy to get Johnny the

119
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,400
first rip of our puffs Wednesday day for

120
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,589
this guy's here you go

121
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:28,599
we're puffing yeah right off the bat

122
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,389
because it's a Jason Lee the thing just

123
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,280
pulls proper he's got wicked talk

124
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,069
chamber action going and the bottom

125
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:40,109
chamber is troubling away nicely that

126
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,110
kid is gone perfect rip

127
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:49,918
that is it smell good just in this

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:52,260
container the perk of that is amazing

129
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,909
and this is old John I mean and that's

130
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,819
amazing because I try to talk about that

131
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,680
with other people that is the frequent

132
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,139
write days how 13 different pipes no

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,680
nothing like this but the perk is

134
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,660
everything it makes it so much

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,668
dysfunctional to me I'm not interested

136
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,229
in a pipe that's extremely artful but

137
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,359
doesn't have the proper function you

138
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:14,219
know we miss the boat okay Jason was

139
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,370
always about his function the bubbling

140
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,630
and everything the seals to be proper no

141
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,430
it's definitely uh well for me it's

142
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:27,959
first time I hit it I hope somebody's

143
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,579
been hitting it solid in the last the

144
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,069
last few years but I'm guarantee was

145
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,329
well used years and years ago I always

146
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,909
loved this is like over your favorite

147
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:41,490
pipe real nice well it's got three front

148
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:44,010
Milly's as well I forgot to mention I

149
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,530
mean imagine this pipe was really more

150
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:50,120
like a fun pipe he wasn't really

151
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:51,388
producing it to sell it as a prototype

152
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,699
alright

153
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,978
so Jason Lee we salute you serve

154
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,870

fabulously so function just a design and

165
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,620
the uniqueness

166
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:31,120
here's amazing it's just it's really

167
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,250
neat it's almost like a cloverleaf in

168
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,860
this side here yeah

169
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:40,300
cat wait these yeah no it's some way to

170
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,259
look at when we look at different art

171
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,720
meetings have someone max max I Oh

172
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,100
what's his name great guy - the great

173
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,199
son of a man

174
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,729
yeah exactly that was the old school you

175
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,370
know about yeah and all those guys if

176
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:57,909
you look at Marcel he's got his sign

177
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:00,310
right in the Martin oh yeah always

178
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,350
signing Lee Bo was more like he would do

179
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,970
his if you look at a million if you look

180
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,560
into Mellie and they're not Billy you

181
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:13,389
won't see it probably but right in the

182
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:15,038
middle is a tiny little J this [ __ ] man

183
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:19,000
that's just like a Picasso or a

184
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:21,759
Rembrandt or or or efficient exactly so

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,098
then maybe Hamilton the works of art

186
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,348
know the beginning of what people

187
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:30,788
started the painting I just never before

188
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:33,269

189
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:36,038
hitchhiking on fish to her before

190
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:39,819

slinger and I met Marcel via marble

193
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,410
slinger as well he would bring these

194
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,420

we're so low excellent yeah it was quite

232
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,320
the list I was looking at today with the

233
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,850
amount of talkers and the booths and the

234

256
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,809
booths booths

257
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:19,700
I like the way to say boo that's

258
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:22,129
actually it sounds like booze booze no

259
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,589
no I can see I can hear it itself I love

260
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,208
the subtle differences of language

261
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,589
particularly accents and different

262
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:30,078
cultures I love traveling to different

263
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,519
places and then you know just of course

264
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,069
either you're trying to learn their

265
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,959
language which of course you'll have a

266
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,339
harsh accent on your end and then if

267
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,039
they're trying to speak English but it's

268
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,200
not an English first speaking country

269
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:44,539
that that language barrier can be

270
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,750
interesting so we have there our

271
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:49,129
Americans here with us next a boot not

272
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,610
that I feel like I've ever said a boot

273
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:55,939
but who maybe idea and they a boot hey

274
00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:00,949

279
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:12,799
appreciated was the Marcel pieces and

280
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,620
and I didn't even know who the gentleman

281
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,500
was or what he was opposed I think he's

282
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,698
amazing he met Marcel can have met them

283
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,610
and the first time I met him mark gave

284
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:27,919
him my first plant of my little pony and

285
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,539
he tried it he never tried Marcel gonna

286
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,819
first so he had a little jar we were at

287
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:33,879
the cup a chat treating yourself and

288
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,310
Marcel came over I know Marcel since

289
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:39,009
1999 he's a whole time friend of mine

290
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:40,448
but I haven't seen

291
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,100
in those last few years because he

292
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:43,929
hadn't come up to the u.s. all right to

293
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,300
the Canada I hadn't gone down to the US

294
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,739
for for quite some time so it was the

295
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,629
first time I'd seen him in a long time I

296
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,250
didn't have anything on me except John's

297
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:53,649
little jar he was standing next to me

298
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,269
and I literally just so exciting me just

299
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:59,759
pulled out a nugget and gave it to

300
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:01,870
Marcel and John was kind of like really

301
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:14,649

307
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,470
the chamber and backlights the dolphin

308

310
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:44,458

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,009
don't have to put too much attention

324
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,448
into it it's not a lot of people want to

325
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:30,759
make it seem like it's very difficult

326
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:33,278
and I will say this we are growing at a

327
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,568
certain level one of the things that I

328
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,399
can tell you that I'm going to help

329
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:39,549
inspire John which will be in the very

330
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,549
near future is producing true organic

331
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:44,029
buds where we produce actual living soil

332
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,679
with ends

333
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,110
the whole nine yards you can't get that

334
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,419
from a food the same way and well yeah

335
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,950
don't test it will just be like a hat we

336
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,209
find it shouldn't feel like I will throw

337
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,440
attention it's not a we're gonna stop

338
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,080
doing what we're doing will have those

339
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,720
tents doing that but I love the idea of

340
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,000
this soil that you just feed water yeah

341
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,460
but you and that we could together mix

342
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,990
up this soil choose our recipes build it

343
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,670
up you know and then and then do the

344
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,649
same thing yeah you know it's a quiver

345
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:14,209
right it's dry sifting wet washing it's

346
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,610
all these different things not everyone

347
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:20,750
wants to buy a food some people love the

348
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,700
idea of of creating living soil and a

349

363
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,070

418
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,180
practice for us for next year when we

419
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,380

421
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,620
this fall as well in late September I'm

422
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,059
gonna try to get two or three hundred

423
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,399
people to come from around the province

424
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,710
a few from each district put on an event

425
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,900
to have some socializing some panelist

426
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm talking and I want to work also as a

427
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,500
group on actually writing the law that

428
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,960
we want to get passed so we have a

429
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,579
specific law federally provincial e-even

430
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,140
municipal bylaws we should be writing

431
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:50,970
those as well as ourselves

432
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,500
the group in the culture so that we have

433
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,269
specific proposals because we leave that

434
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,069
stuff to the people who don't know what

435
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,599
to write they write stupid-ass laws

436
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,250
right so you should be writing you know

437
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,079
what are the right bylaws for a city to

438
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,250
if they Fanny I don't know what we

439
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,539
should be coming up with that stuff so

440
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,039
that's what we're working on anyways and

441
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,230

446
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:16,230
guess the next biggest thing really on

447
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,360
the on the everyone's minds here in

448
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,059
British Columbia is the the return of

449
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:24,329
Marc Emery yeah that'll be awesome yeah

450
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:26,039
he gets out late July then there's gonna

451
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,289
be a period where he's released from

452
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,389
jail but he's back into the immigration

453
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,950
people it's a buffer zone of what's yeah

454
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,210
eight weeks or something well hopefully

455
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,590
less than that I mean it could be as

456
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,630
short as a week or two it could be a

457
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:38,159
couple of months one of marks friends

458
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,870
from prison went in that and he was

459
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,210
there several months but even his

460
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:44,099
paperwork organized and Marc does and

461
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,680
certainly his supporters will be calling

462
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,809
the check on and then amino acid yeah so

463
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,190
I'm hoping it gets out sooner but but we

464
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,899
don't really know it's gonna be at least

465
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,789
a few weeks but by August mark should be

466
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,470
bout and back in Canada they bring him

467
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:57,420
across to Windsor take him across in

468
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,039
Detroit so it's kind of weird so we'll

469
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,019
be flying out to Windsor on short notice

470
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,210
whatever we hear that he gets out and I

471
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,369
wonder what how many people will fly out

472
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,720
for that yeah hopefully a lot and then

473
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,759
mark will be maybe there for a day or

474
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,860
two but come back to BC pretty quick and

475
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:12,450
he's looking forward to getting back to

476
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:14,879
work and getting things going he'll be

477
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,559
at the store working there and he wants

478
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
to do some speaking Marc likes to talk

479
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,210
and a lot to talk about these days so

480
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,950
and I think he's gonna do some touring

481
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,299
around BC and around the country and

482
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,910
then maybe around the world that people

483
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:31,039
can sponsor him to go places he's not

484
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,040
going to be like the rich Prince of pot

485
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,409
a lot of people listening to like the

486
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:42,899
media has always listened to mark the

487
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:44,370
the level of media that will come I mean

488
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,240
he was certainly you know he's been on

489
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,669
the front page of The Wall Street

490
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,500
Journal he's been profiled on CNN he's

491
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,120
been in several other you know

492
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,720
international media kind of things like

493
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,489
that

494
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,890
Tsingtao news and stuff even so yeah

495
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,509
he'll be it'll be a big story and I

496
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,190
think he's just looking forward to

497
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:00,289
trying to

498
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,180
get back and keep being an activist

499
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:03,710
again or enough to get really stopped

500
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,570
being one but being free and being able

501
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,539
to work and talk to people and it's been

502
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:10,339
just enjoy yeah you got a five-year

503
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:12,619
sentence he did did he get time off for

504
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:14,659
good behavior he did some time here

505
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,399
before he laughed he did like a couple

506
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,870
of several months here and that all

507
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,450
counts against so he did about four

508
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:23,689
years in US prison I think it's comes to

509
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,069
just under four years out in there and

510
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,009
then with the time here and got time off

511
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:29,599
and everything else but it's an he's had

512
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:33,650
some rough times you got that it would

513
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,689
sit mmm SRA that lay that virus that was

514
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,519
pretty really kill people and it's quite

515
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,620
common in prisons and hospitals in that

516
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,920
and you know that's something he'll have

517
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:44,329
with them forever and but overall that

518
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,890
was probably the worst thing overall

519
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:49,159
he's been good and he plays bass guitar

520
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:51,470
and I write so wild he'll be the jam

521
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,940
nights I feel like him and Tommy Chong

522
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,130
should get together Tommy Chong do a

523
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,660
lead guitar market on bass guitar a

524
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,630
little bit of accompaniment taking turns

525
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,130
Thomas guitars yeah dude telling stories

526
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,290
and doing jokes and things in between

527
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,430
their music I feel like that I mean I

528
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,599
don't know that I just think that that

529
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,279
will be pretty fun if that were to

530
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,929
happen I think people would love to hear

531
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,759
that they're both funny entertaining

532
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,529
guys in very different kind of ways I

533
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,119
think that it wouldn't be very hard to

534
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:16,129
put together considering marks coming

535
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,869
back and you know Tommy's gonna come up

536
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,550
and visit him yeah for sure and Tommy

537
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,529
Chong was always like he wore that free

538
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,539
market t-shirt on every single agency

539
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:29,420
every single thing you know he really

540
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:31,159
that was huge supporter yeah was good so

541
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,740
that's all been very good so mr will be

542
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,970
great to have mark back and getting him

543
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,620
high and everything will be a lot of fun

544
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,470
I mean he's gonna get pretty baked on

545
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:42,409
his first stop back here he said a long

546
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,700
time to have his tolerance go down so

547
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,440
we're gonna have to work on that when he

548
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,779
gets back well I'm about to work on mine

549
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,390

553
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,419

554
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,509
date of the man said took first place

00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:11,418

journalist Barbara bud exactly exactly

561
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,759
not a lot of people might know that but

562
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,759
it is

563
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:31,099
don't eat her up enough for you oh oh

564

565
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:39,779
everyone Johnny who always Wednesday

566
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:41,549
yeah we went for a nice dinner we would

567
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,509
say having a little bit of a meeting and

568
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:45,450
learn something from that

569
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:46,920
yeah was yourself yeah you got to do

570
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,870
these things well Matt just posted it

571
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,940
recently on his page if you want

572
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:53,729
something done you gotta do it yourself

573
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,230
of course I added but sometimes you need

574
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,789
to ask your friends and I it was kind of

575
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,130
a joke because I cleaned the barber

576
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:03,629
forum that he entered in the Champs but

577
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:08,480
it's true sometimes you do need to just

578
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,480
get it done yourself Oh Johnny

579
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,620
it's pretty incredible to see how far

580
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,450
it's come in the last 20 years isn't it

581
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:20,799
a no like compared to when I first met

582
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,360
you I think I remember you sitting on a

583
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,490
window still you were working on some

584
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:25,839
little computer they di think you might

585
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,308
have had a big beard at the time does

586
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,959
that sound familiar I don't actually

587
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:30,160
have to think about the first time I met

588
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,860
you but those are all things that I

589
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:37,390
would be doing we kind of were like oh

590
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:38,439
mom but it was really like meeting

591
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,300
someone that oh I'll probably never

592
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,590
maybe see that guy again that was just

593
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:43,269
the first time I met you and it was

594
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:45,939
literally back in the day

595
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:47,980
well we haven't changed the law yet but

596
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,029
20 years ago there was no legal hemp

597
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,920
growing in Canada

598
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,599
no it's prolific really there still be

599
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,179
needs to be a lot more butts growing

600
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:57,009
there was no very little medical access

601
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,800
there pretty much none I guess 20 years

602
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:01,509
ago the BC compassion club Society and

603
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:04,539
Ted Smith and if the others would just

604
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:09,099
get just starting to get going yeah 79

605
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:10,329
like 95 you know yeah so around that

606
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,949
time things were getting going

607
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:13,629
wasn't Hillary doing like the driving

608
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,610
around on her bike in 95 or what that

609
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,490
was all still nice that was right in 96

610
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:20,169
yeah that was I moved here in 96 but I

611
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,420
used to come before that as a Manitoba

612
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,660
hemp guy because we got our license to

613
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:28,029
grow hemp between 94 and 95 we used to

614
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,340
bring hemp paper and hemp cloth and

615
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,200
different things to hemp BC and that's

616
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:34,629
how we met Hilary that's how yeah yeah

617
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,029
we were the Manitoba hemp guys you know

618
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:41,320
we show up with the Hays which was

619
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:42,710
knocked over though I did yeah it was

620
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:47,028
from Winnipeg all right

621
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:49,130
yeah didn't they bring all the hemp

622
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:51,798
seeds in a Concorde jet or something was

623
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,080
that the is that you guys the

624
00:25:51,798 --> 00:26:00,079
consolidated growers and process that

625
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:02,089
was you guys right they got the hemp

626
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,398
thing going but that group didn't

627
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:08,298
succeed as an organization helps

628
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:10,219
kickstart going it definitely got

629
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:12,408
everything into the grocery stores and

630
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,028
the food but it really sort of stunted

631
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:15,200
what we thought hemp was gonna be which

632
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:16,880
was the fifty thousand commercial

633
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,590
products and the fiber and the plastics

634
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,760
and the metals and all those you know

635
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:21,829
commercial products that you could

636
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,658
produce it's sort of turned into even

637
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:25,639
the biomass for us the seed originally

638
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:29,210
was more like let's run our cars on this

639
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,340
not let's sell it for $16 a bottle for

640
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,929
healthy food which is great I love that

641
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,898
idea as well but now it's so expensive

642
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:37,909
that biomass isn't there there's no

643
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:39,759
there's no way to use hemp seed oil to

644
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:42,740
run your vehicle on it because it's like

645
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:46,190
like this work that you know sell 10

646
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,159
times the price of gas so it's just it's

647
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,390
just too expensive so yeah it's it is

648
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,789
what it is you know I think it'll move

649
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:56,000
forward I think a lot more people are

650
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:58,669
the infrastructure for 50,000 commercial

651
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,798
products and for hemp is no great feat

652
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:02,690
that are no small feat that is like

653
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,490
billions of dollars of infrastructure it

654
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,899
doesn't just fit into current

655
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,250
infrastructure that's already there no

656
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:08,658
absolutely for the seeds it's easy

657
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,630
because you can process the seeds with

658
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:13,520
very little technology but making fibers

659
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,159
hard and making fuels really hard like

660
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,200
especially biomass fuel it's not hard

661
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,149
but it needs a lot of converters and

662
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,140
local things and not one big Pro that

663
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:23,089
you need to build a lot of little

664
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,830
processing stations for sure ya know

665
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:27,079
it's there's it's no small feat to

666
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:28,490
actually start extracting out all the

667
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,500
different parts of the hemp into

668
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,750
cellulose and fibers and the seed and

669
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,058
how you planted and how you breed it and

670
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,859
grow it those things to me never really

671
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:38,869
happened they just it kind of they let

672
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:42,648
us have it and then we were so happy

673
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:44,689
just to have it we never really did the

674
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:46,158
big commercial push to start getting big

675
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,940
companies to come in and be like look we

676
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,740
need these for

677
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,330
because it's happening on a smaller

678
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,859
level one thing that's got to change

679
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:53,210
is this got to be not Health Canada

680
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:55,519
running it it's got a big recovery

681
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,019
category hundred percent and all the

682
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,190
things they were worried about when it

683
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:59,539
was first legalized they talked about

684
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,250
people growing marijuana in the hip

685
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:02,899
fields we had to watch out for that at

686
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,400
all these worries and it's been a long

687
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,080
time now nothing bad happened not a

688
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,910
single hemp farmer has ever been accused

689
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,139
of anything like that so they should

690
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,310
lighten up the rules now and make it

691
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,200
more accessible and put it under

692
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:14,569
agriculture Canada and get Health Canada

693
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,920
which is bad at all regulating medical

694
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,509
marijuana which should actually kind of

695
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,220
be in their jurisdiction they're

696
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,869
terrible at regulating hemp which has

697
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,029
got nothing to do with Health Canada at

698
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:25,159
all like why are they they're not

699
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,629
they're not it makes no sense it makes

700
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,279
no sense for sure hopefully we

701
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,960
eventually get that happening so Health

702
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,639
Canada just steps away from cannabis

703
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,769
completely I don't see them really

704
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,290
having a position in it it should be

705
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:40,730
provincial and should be regulated

706
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:42,109
differently and in relation to the yeah

707
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,269
it should be well that's what I would

708
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:45,769
think Jeanne the farm to grow corn we

709
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:47,119
should be screwing when you know it's

710
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:48,710
gonna be a lot of stuff moving now in

711
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,169
here but I think that's it we can say

712
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,240
it's fully legalized when farmers can

713
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,430
grow any potency of cannabis they want

714
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,990
in their fields right that to me is kind

715
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:00,759
of the endgame right if we can go to

716
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,759
that point and it can harvest the

717
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,539
trikona medicine people won't buds will

718
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,009
become a niche product for a small

719
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,230
minority of people at that point it'll

720
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:17,990
be about resin and you can make very

721
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,599
pure resin from outdoor crop it's harder

722
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,220
to make perfectly manicured buds

723
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,689
outdoors but who cares but you can make

724
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,910
stuff like that and you can make it for

725
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,640
a buck a gram if it was being grown

726
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:30,110
outdoors that very potent levels you

727
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,940
could do it you can do it well if after

728
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:34,909
whatever could be that's that the bucket

729
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,220
gram was my retail price including taxes

730
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,570
in retail I think the wholesale you do

731
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,640
from with ten cents a gram that's I

732
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:42,799
rubbed you some rough calculations but I

733
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,020
think that level of even if I'm off by a

734
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,430
large amount those are still those kind

735
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:49,849
of thing this is this retails for like

736
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:52,009
fifty to eighty dollars yeah so those

737
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:53,809
things are but like the oils and resins

738
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,849
usually and those are you can make pure

739
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,990
quality products high quality any

740
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:59,449
cannabinoid profile

741
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,950
throw it outdoors incredibly cheap and

742
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,509
then you could use all the other parts

743
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,039
of the plant for all the other aspects

744
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,369
as well harvest the seeds or dopamine

745
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,319
seeds but harvest the stock or whatever

746
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:11,149
you'd be wrong in well you heard it here

747
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,980
guys this is what we talk about this is

748
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,480
what we do on Bubble man's world we bump

749
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,740
into our friends we talk about the

750
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,150
things that we love and we share a

751
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,759
little bit of our passion with you guys

752
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:22,519
so I want to thank John B and Dana
