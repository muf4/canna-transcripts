9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,179
water we're in the most beautiful

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,118
beautiful of places you can see right

11
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:30,118
here the mothership is out on the boat

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:33,329
and it is clean and yes the pump has

13
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:35,280
returned let's get some bubble bags away

14
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,679
what do you guys say you want to get

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,100
some bubble bags away listen these are

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,750
bubble bag lights I'm going to give some

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,399
standards away probably on the 90th

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,509
episode and I might give some originals

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
away on the hundred and twentieth

20
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,349
episode so don't feel I'm trying to

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,000
cheap you out first pair of bubble bags

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,300
that we're gonna give away as a 5 gallon

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,219
8 bag kit and this is the lights so it

24
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,149
doesn't have all the colors like the old

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,520
bags but what it does have is it has the

26
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,739
band around the bottom of the screen is

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,380
the color of that bag so this is the 160

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,520
being the red bag and you can kind of go

29
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,868
through all of them and there's green

30
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,048
and orange and all the different colors

31
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:14,819
so the question is going to be simple in

32
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,270
1999 I came out with the bubble bags

33
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:21,000

34
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:23,399
pressing screen what I want to know from

00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,280

envelope of practicing civil

74
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,719
disobedience until we have everything

98
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:56,430

Scott but you know way to tell everyone

100

102
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,350
alright we're gonna give this one more

103
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,689

give it a nice little blast of the torch

105
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:17,459
real short little blast and that should

106
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:27,000
give us see there we go that should give

107
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:29,789
us another little rip they shouldn't be

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,870

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:32,330
[ __ ] awesome Oh was that delicious

121
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,240
and still low temp to the degree yummy

122
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:40,250
yummy

123
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:43,750
so nice so so nice alright well I've had

124
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:46,490
a rip now it's time to talk to my people

125
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,889
the question was what was the first bag

126
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,350
added to the two bag kit when I first

127
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,839
came out with bubble bags they were very

128
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,820
much almost identical to isolator bags

129
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,109
in the sense that well right off the bat

130
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,579
we came out with a pressing screen

131
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,460
because we thought let's add a little

132
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:03,050
piece of a screen at for people to dry

133
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,629
the hash off of and it was through that

134
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,210
screen that I realized there's a lot of

135
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:11,269
hash going through this this 70 micron

136
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:15,319
screen the 73 micron so we went and

137
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:18,680
added the 25 and from there the 25 ended

138
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:22,459
up adding a 45 then we added the 190 and

139
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,590
the 160 with the 120 being after those

140
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:26,989
two and then the last one that we added

141
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:30,919
was the 90 micron that was the last bag

142
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,290
the one that put bubble bags - exactly

143
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,410
where they belonged which was just with

144
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,810
this bag favorite of everyone you know

145
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,390
everyone loved that bag I didn't even

146
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,120
have to use my DC glass cleaner today I

147
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,490
just noticed that that q-tip cleaned so

148
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,269
beautiful there was there was not a Chaz

149
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:53,980
in sight did the water is

150
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:55,870
bro are you kidding me the thing about

151
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,850
this water that's trippy is that there

152
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,209
are killer whales in this water there

153
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,510
are sea lions there are dolphins there

154
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:07,120
are all sorts of incredible

155
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:09,279
gigantic and epic ocean life that lives

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,709
in this part of the Pacific Ocean I

157
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,049
believe it was one of Jack Cousteau's

158
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:16,689
you know top three or something in the

159
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,610
world it's definitely a beautiful spot

160
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,310
if you're a scuba diver we've got the

161
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,870
Pacific the West Coast Pacific octopus

162
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,579
which I think it's one of the larger

163
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,030
octopuses in the world not that large

164
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:29,919
makes something big but yeah we've seen

165
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:31,779
blue whales we've seen humpback whales

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,670
jump right out of the water crashed down

167
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:36,069
right where my boat is right now I've

168
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,620
seen a pod of killer whales partying

169
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,560
just over by that Island over there

170
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,929
Gambier I've hung out with a pod of 200

171
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,419
oh yeah we swim here absolutely my kids

172
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,829
grew up swimming in this believe it or

173
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,289
not killer whales aren't actively

174
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,270
hunting out people you don't hear about

175
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:53,829
it very often it's the same what rivers

176
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,500
feed into this well let's see the Fraser

177
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,570
River feeds into this all of these

178
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,330
creeks those are the Lions up there you

179
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,610
see the - oh right I got your email

180
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,470
Scott good stuff you can see the two

181
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,930
lions right on the top there let me get

182
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,790
my there we go right there those are

183
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:11,949
called the Lions and the reason that is

184
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:14,679
is why this whole village is called

185
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,440
Lions Bay and if you go to the outside

186
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:20,529
of the Lions you actually end up at the

187
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,720
Lions Gate Bridge and then that's also

188
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,879
where Lions Gate Entertainment comes

189
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,360
from the big production company that

190
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,669
makes movies and stuff so this is the

191
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,289
house sound this is the part of the

192
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:34,419
Georgia Strait which is just right over

193
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:37,539
there feeds into the house sound and

194
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:40,029
we're looking to have a pink run this

195
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:41,799
year of salmon four years ago when the

196
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:45,209
Pink's came here through here there were

197
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:48,729
22 million of them one of the largest

198
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,230
spawns since I think 1918 you guys can

199
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,659
google it though of course if I'm wrong

200
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,509
by all means call me out hard in the

201
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:59,828
comments section say that I'm a horrible

202
00:09:55,509 --> 00:10:02,078
person I deserve to be crucified alive

203
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:03,969
I'm just joking around I'm feeling

204
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,588
really Irie it's like so nice to be out

205
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,660
on the water I can't even tell you it's

206
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,550
a super blessing hey Cass honest I don't

207
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:11,469
take it for granted I didn't grow up

208
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:13,389
here I grew up in the prairies I grew up

209
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,399
in Winnipeg you know I grew up as a

210
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:18,639
little kid with my bat the back lane was

211
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:22,058
where I where I played and stuff so this

212
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,759
is some other completely different level

213
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:25,659
of epicness that you see those mountains

214
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,709
they just go higher and higher and

215
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:34,238
higher now behind me over here is the

216
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:38,018
Sunshine Coast and the top peak which is

217
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:40,778
right here is called Elphinstone

218
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:43,089
National Park just in case you guys want

219
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:46,778
to Google some of this yeah I was born

220
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:49,809
in Winnipeg me too why is there an L in

221
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:52,269
salmon sallman I'm not too sure you know

222
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:56,318
that's a pretty good question maybe it's

223
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:59,678
for the GLA and the GL na ratios of gana

224
00:10:56,318 --> 00:11:01,360
linoleic and gana whatever the essential

225
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:02,708
amino acids maybe that's why they threw

226
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,619
the L in there they're like the shit's

227
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:09,758
rich in GLA and GL na we got to throw a

228
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:12,369
an Ellen R on never did show me around

229
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,990
the old zoo that was before my time and

230
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:16,170
that was one of the few things that I

231
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,629
missed in Ron's life and speaking of Ron

232
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:23,349
the the dream is still alive to produce

233
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:24,278
a beautiful green house nothing major we

234
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,629
don't want to attract the wrong

235
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:28,568
attention we're not gonna produce some

236
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:31,420
giant [ __ ] crop but you know we'll

237
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:32,708
grow like maybe you know 20 or 30 or 40

238
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:34,269
pounds and we'll turn it all into

239
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,828
concentrates and we'll go through the

240
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,769
whole thing showing from start to finish

241
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:42,128
the greenhouse build the grow the

242
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:45,039
harvest the cure the processing right

243
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,659

244
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,610
who knows some dis you know like I

245
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,678

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,020
been a hermit and he's been quiet and

326
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,440
he's been in his own home and I

327
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,149
desperately want to get him out on the

328
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,510
channel every morning on the wake and

329
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,669
bakes every get no bit no wakin bakes

330
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:08,610
for you seriously right go first of all

331
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:10,919
gets it wrong goes out on Lake raw as

332
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,789
drugs alone wrong I was feeding my

333
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:17,039
endocannabinoids system and here's the

334
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:19,409
bottom line you guys don't know that I'm

335
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,629
alone you have no idea if there's

336
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:23,100
another person standing right here you

337
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,500
have no idea that there's another boat

338
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,690
right nearby so try not to make

339
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,419
assumptions when you are watching videos

340
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,580
because the person can manipulate your

341
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:35,009
assumptions by simply not pointing the

342
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,680
camera at things he does not want you to

343
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:39,840
see so I used to get people harshing out

344
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,370
on me when I would have a puff in my

345
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,830
vehicle

346
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:47,339
and then I would split like later but

347
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,320
often I would have a driver or edit like

348
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,100
the hour and a half out where we ate

349
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,260
anyway who won the bags illegal Farmers

350
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,389
of Canada I think was his name doing

351
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:00,960
drugs right PK brewer oh my god

352
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:08,159
ignorance level 11 we're gonna get out

353
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:09,930

the ocean we always make sure we carry a

356
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,500
radio we always make sure we carry a

357
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,470
phone if I'm going out of range I

358
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:24,269
definitely have the air horn I have the

359
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:26,879
paddles I have the flare I have the life

360
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:29,819
jackets I mean it's all law here that

361
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,500
you have to have these things so it's

362
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,980
very important that you make sure that

363
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,110
you do and yeah in the meantime for

364
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,620
those of you that think I may be driving

365
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,620
the boat

366
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:46,009
under the influence of cannabis don't

367
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:49,249
feel too bad I've got my cameraman right

368
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:53,119
off the the view of the camera right

369
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:55,159
here and I think that he has had no

370
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:57,649
puffs and he will be driving the boat

371
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:00,528
and doing just fine hey what's going on

00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,970
to y'all

382
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:36,259
top of the mornin to you my goodness I

383
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,919
just love it

384
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:42,679
ah laggy oh I got a couple of knee

385
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,929
boards man I should pull them out yeah

386
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:47,480
let's do some [ __ ] drugs this is not

387
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:49,070
what this channel is about you know I

388
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,589
don't really want people to think that

389
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm promoting any form of ignorance

390
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,519
because really what I've all else and I

391
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,899
know that sometimes it's hard for people

392
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,058
to wrap their heads around it because

393
00:17:56,898 --> 00:18:00,829
I'm trying desperately to normalize the

394
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:03,230
use of cannabis while I'm helping

395
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:05,178
educate and sharing this information but

396
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,740
the bottom line is this is valuable

397
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,899
information it doesn't matter if you

398
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,028
support cannabis or if cannabis is your

399
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:13,428
thing because the bottom line is you

400
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:17,000
have an endocannabinoid system your body

401
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:20,298
functions better when it is filled with

402
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,950
these compounds and when you deprive

403
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,879
them of these compounds and become

404
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,250
endocannabinoids

405
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,870
deficient you cause yourself much

406
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,970
disease sickness and yeah so listen to

407
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:34,549
your son or daughter at the dinner table

408
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,170
your nephew your niece your spouse

409
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,329
whoever it is that's trying to teach you

410
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,220
about this don't worry about the fact

411
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:42,619
that you yourself are still locked into

412
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,380
the propaganda that was you know to the

413
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:46,250
tune of billions of dollars that was

414
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,430
brainwashing you for the last hundred

415
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,920
years through media through movies

416
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:55,759
through all sorts of different

417
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:58,130
propagandas not the truth you know

418
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,109
that's that may be how you perceive it

419
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,240
but the bottom line is even if you don't

420
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:04,609
like to get high even if you are against

421
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,829
the stereotypes of the cannabis user and

422
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:09,109
that's all they are are stereotypes you

423
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:11,449
can still benefit greatly from cannabis

424
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:14,349
so yeah that's kind of the whole purpose

425
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,539
of this channel to let people know that

426
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:19,939
the information is out there and if you

427
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,529
listen to me just for a little bit talk

428
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,600
on some of these wakes you might hear a

429
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:25,039
couple of terms you might hear some

430
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,129
information that will at least give you

431
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,659
the power to go off and Google and do

432
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,210
your own research be careful out there a

433
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,490
lot of [ __ ] is fake a lot of [ __ ] is not

434
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,769
real so try to find yourself really good

435
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,680

439
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,950
that plankton are probably not a cheese

440
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,679
I would hate to drop the phone in the

441
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,740
ocean my goodness it would sink like a

442
