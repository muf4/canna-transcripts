9
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,920

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,359
going on what's planned how it's going

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,920
to be the dates etc etc and I thought

12
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,439
what better way for Sarah and I to sit

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,559

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,079

17
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,759

18
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,479
out with the sweet skunk cuz what better

19
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,280
way to really get into a conversation

20
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,558
about

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,159
a cannabis Festival is that what we

22
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,118
should call it yes cannabis Festival

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,118
that's exactly it exactly so don't be

24
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,719
limited in your thinking thinking that

25
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,519
the karma cup is just a cup that might

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,319
have been a misnomer in the early days

27
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,840
of naming it but the karma cup is going

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,959
to be much more than um than a than a

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,960
Cannabis Cup not saying that a Cannabis

30
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,399
Cup is is a bad thing it's a wonderful

31
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,158
thing when it's done properly it can be

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,118
an exciting uh experience to to be a

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,680
part of I've been going to them for 25 5

34
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,799
years myself but in this day and age

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,799
it's nice to see the sort of educational

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,399
factor and and more factors being taken

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
into play rather than just let's get a

38
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,960
bunch of people that love pot get him

39
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,078
into a small room judging give some

40
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,280
trophies away yeah yeah we're taking on

41
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:49,158
all the aspects of cannabis culture and

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,478
celebrating them that's awesome well I'm

43
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,840
really kind of looking forward to this

44
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,078
it's uh it's going to be on October it's

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,840
October 22nd and 23rd in Toronto which

46
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,599
is the weekend before Halloween sort of

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,359
Harvest Festival time everybody can

48
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,640
bring the goods oh yeah that's good

49
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,319
timing actually on that sense yes more

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,718
people should pay attention to that it's

51
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,280
also there's less going on so it's just

52
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,079
like a perfect time to get a crowd and

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
we haven't had a smoke out in months and

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,400
everybody's looking to have a good time

55
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:18,559
and get together again my God does this

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,280
resin has it ever taken on a nice um

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,439
texture in the in the sun you know it's

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,000
beautiful yeah I feel that we should uh

59
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,120
do ladies first

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,560
ohwe de no no my mom taught me well my

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
mom taught me well actually using this

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,959
as a carb cap okay it fits so perfect y

63
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,719
the only thing you really have to be

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,439
careful of is because there's resin in

65
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,280
there yes it'll melt down it'll melt

66
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,039
down and it was giving me endless rips

67
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,080

68
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,120

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,480
had melted down the sides and it just

73
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,159

89
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,039
tell us a little bit about I guess you

90
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,199
know maybe let's start from the

91
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,840
beginning how the karma cup started cuz

92
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,798
it really was not something that I would

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,239
say happened naturally it seemed like

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,239
you were really like an a force behind

95
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,599
it saying this is happening yes while

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
other people were like I don't think

97
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,798
it's going to happen you're like no you

98
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,919
don't understand this is happening cuz I

99
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,200
remember when how all that happened and

100
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
I did get to be at the first Karma cup

101
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,238
uh it was a bonus cuz I was heading to

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,158
Jamaica anyway I just happened to be in

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,158
town for that timing but yeah like tell

104
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,639
us how it sort of started the the

105
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,479
thought of developing a cup and then how

106
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,719
the cup evolved into a festival and to

107
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,039
kind of lead us up to where we're going

108
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,560
to be in the next couple of months when

109
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:14,719
it happens okay so um my reasoning

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,319
behind creating the festival or well not

111
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,358
even the festival let's start at the cup

112
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,439
with the cup is as a grower I wanted to

113
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,599
get more value out of the competitions I

114
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:27,319
was entering so my thing is um I want to

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,560
give the Growers as much promotion as I

116
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,839
can for their products um so we have

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
like a profile online we we take

118
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,399
professional pictures of the stuff we

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,600
post them online we post them on social

120
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,079
media we give you links we you know you

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,759
can't there's more than just like the

122
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,279
possibility of winning a trophy and

123
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,000
winning some bragging rights you get

124
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,879
some lasting value behind that we

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,439
basically started that Trend I was

126
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,038
always frustrated that I'd find out

127
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,279
about High Times or some cup uh

128
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,360
happening and then you couldn't even

129
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,839
find pictures of any information about

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
the winners you just see a name and it's

131
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,319
like well what how useful is this

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,439
there's all this value there's all this

133
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,360
content that could be created so I we

134
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,800
try to maximize our content and create a

135
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,759
lot of lot of value for everybody

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,160
involved so I'm also um all about

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,319
getting um a good pack of uh contestants

138
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,560
for or good pack yeah pack of

139
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,759
contestants for these judges to um

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,439
evaluate um so I go around to all my

141
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,879
friends and everybody I know that's a

142
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,639
grower or producer has a company and I'm

143
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,719
like twisting their arm behind their

144
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,199
back and saying you have the fire please

145
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,080
bring it right

146
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,720
you know go I know you've got a lot

147
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,279
going on and everything but hey we

148
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,840
really want to smoke your stuff and um

149
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,719
that's worked out really well for a lot

150
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,599
of people they've made made their brands

151
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,240
off of it so I feel like we're giving

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
value to the judges we're giving value

153
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,560
to the competitors everybody gets a good

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,080
time now we're making it bigger we're

155
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,478
making it so that you don't have to just

156
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,079
buy a judge's pack to be able to enjoy

157
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,599
even if you're in a loow income or

158
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,879
disability issue or something like that

159
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,319
yeah which is always an issue for some

160
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,360
for sure well and it should be a

161
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,960
person's choice so now if you want to

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,879
just come in for the weekend it's like

163
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,680
15 bucks it's super cheap really

164
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,598

190
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,878
going to have a large Vapor area in

191
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,160
there um plus six booths that face onto

192

it pretty Prime Booth I would say um and

193
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,160
part of that space is going to be chairs

194
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,240
like about a 100 chairs for our speaker

195
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,120
stage which normal is working with me on

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,038
the speaker stage and we're programming

197
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,959
some interesting panels to actually

198
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,399
really get into issues that are going on

199
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,279
in cannabis and Canada today and our

200
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,000
industry and um broadening and spreading

201
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,959
more information to everybody that might

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,038
be interested um I think that's a big a

203
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,519
big plus and bonus because that's uh

204
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,318
that's what gives the people that

205
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,719
ability to you know they can go and see

206
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,879
all the other stuff but it's like you

207
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,479
can really take something back when you

208
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,039
see someone speak at one of these events

209
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,079
where it's inspirational knowledge you

210
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,560
cannot believe that you're hearing it

211
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,359
and obviously the knowledge I'm talking

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,478
about would be you know any of the

213
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,120
medical sort of uh Miracles that people

214
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,399
call Miracles but are really sort of

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,560
descri Des as simple endoc canabo

216
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:07,079
deficiencies it's really important to

217
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,120
have that aspect of the education for

218
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,839
your audience and I'm definitely glad

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,720
that you're doing doing a speaker stage

220
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,758
yes it's totally important actually we

221
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,319
want to get all the aspects in there you

222
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,240
know we've got the fun we've got some

223
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,919
education we've got various types of fun

224
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,598
various types of Education we've got

225
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,399
some good food trucks coming I'm not

226
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,478
really using that as an income Source

227
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,638
I'm just trying to provide excellent

228
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,519
food for the people that are involved

229
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,680
well what a bonus you know when and I

230
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,718
think that the fact that you're not

231
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,639
coming at this from a from a like oh

232
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,760
I've been in marketing for 15 years and

233
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,639
I always liked herb I thought I would

234
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,958
put the two together I like that you're

235
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,958
coming from the it's like well I'm a

236
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,919
grower cuz that's I met you as a grower

237
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:49,000
that's you know before the karma cup you

238
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,399
were Sarah the grower and so that's your

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,759
perspective that you're coming at it

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,559
from like oh I'd like to see one of

241
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,639
these events like you know give more to

242
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,958
The Growers cuz that's I'm a grower yes

243
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,679
and so instead of like going around and

244
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,239
bitching about how all the other cups

245
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,799
weren't doing that you created your

246
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,120
own from a grower perspective so that's

247
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,879
uh it's very cool I look forward to it

248
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,959
October 22nd and 23rd I'm going to be

249
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,439
there I'm going to be there probably

250
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:17,239
under my bubble man brand and the Blue

251
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,720
River extracts Canada so we're going to

252
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,399
we haven't discussed exactly what's

253
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,839
going to go on but I suspect that there

254
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,519
will be some sort of uh tpine tasting

255
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,959
booth and maybe we'll get some uh

256
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,159
tarpine champagne some tpan made up for

257
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,518
the event but uh it should be pretty fun

258
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,799
I'm definitely looking forward to coming

259
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,519
and seeing it's always nice to see you

260
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,639
know who in that Community is

261
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,879
representing at this particular cuz I I

262
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:44,319
like to go to most of the events whether

263
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,919
it's you know an event for LPS or an

264
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,680
event for doctors or an event for for

265
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,759
for extractors or an event for Growers

266
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,120
or an event that covers many of those

267
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,879
things which I'm I'm really more of a

268
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,600
quiver guy these days I started out it

269
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,480
was like oh all he does is he smokes

270
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,120
bubble has and and I was like well no

271
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,278
that's not really true like I also like

272
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,360
dryft and I also now like rosin and I I

273
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,679
like to expand and have you know the

274
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,079
quiver it's nice to have a bunch of

275
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,759
these in here rather than just one yes

276
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:17,759
you know and I think that for for a

277
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,919
while this is what cops were MH and then

278
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,679
slowly but surely we're seeing you know

279
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:26,719
like man cannabis can bring a lot to the

280
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,319
table so much so that it can dilute you

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,480
in anything that you do if you focus on

282
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,560
too many of the aspects of it right I

283
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,079
have 15 categories this year yes 15

284
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,559
there's unev yeah I've got I added two

285
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,319
more Bud categories so I'm going to try

286
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,319
to list them all off I forget anything

287
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm sorry no no that's cool you did just

288
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,320
take a giant dab of sweet true and

289
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
there's like 15 so it's like it's more

290
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,079
than two hands so it starts becoming

291
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,959
problematic Okay so we've got uh IND so

292
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,559
for the bud we've got indicia sativa

293

hybrid CBD organic we've got um shatter

294
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,958
like the solvent ex ract shatter indicia

295
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,240

296
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:12,239

um vapor pen disposable pen um edible

298

topical and functional glass I got them

299
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,000
all I use three hands so that's pretty

300
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,320
incredible when you think about it yeah

301
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:30,360
and the trophies are all um Handmade by

302

the hillbilly glass blower that lives in

306
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,199
the in the in the in the bush cuz that's

307
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,800
like my style yeah I could

308
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,040
completely live in the bush in a cabin

309
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,599
and be as happy well I kind of do except

310
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,078
my cabin's a little bit bigger it's just

311

312

313
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,519

318
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
don't get that quite amount of wildlife

319

on my I get deer that like to come up

320

and eat my tomatoes out of the garden

321

345
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,519
website again the karmac cup.com really

346
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,959

apply um we go through and basically

348
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:20,439
just make sure that you're um can handle

349
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,518
the capacity and have the ability and uh

350
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,639
experience or we're looking for a broad

351
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,799
range of different types of people but

352
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,720
um especially medical patients people

353
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:33,240
who really consume right cuz it's a

354
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,320
tough job taking like you know the first

355
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,959
year I had 80 entries and the second

356
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,480
year I had 100 um so um oh entering

357
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,000
that's I guess the Third Way you get

358
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,959
involved is if you're a grower producer

359
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,759
Baker um topical maker some type of

360
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,479
cannabis product manufacturer you can

361
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,879
enter this year I'm limiting the C the

362
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,720
number of entries to two per category

363
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,360

page um yeah and for people out there

370
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,639
for a grower that might be watching all

371
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,799
these YouTube videos and seeing all

372
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,799
these different characters you got Remo

373

and all of these different people that

375
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,439
you're looking at you know you can go to

376
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,079
an event like this and the majority of

377
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,320
them could be the people that you're

378
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,278
competing with you know if you want to

379
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
see how well you stand in the in the

380
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,720
game if you want to show people that

381
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,278
you're a great grower and kind of get

382
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,399
that word out cuz everyone believes

383
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,320
they're a great grower but it's

384
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
definitely a little bit nicer when a

385
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,000
whole bunch of other people agree for

386
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,240
you and you get a trophy with yeah and

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,240
you get a little thing and then it's a

388
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,720
recognized thing so it's definitely for

389
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,680
people that are trying to get jobs in

390
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,600
the industry whether they're trying to

391
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,638
get their herb picked up by a dispensary

392
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,199
or they're trying to get a a job with a

393
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,680
dispensary it's not believe it or not

394
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:04,000
going to hurt you to have uh a Karma cup

395
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,799
win on your resume um the I should the

396

totally but uh I would love to do that

487
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,400
if I could I really would you know what

488
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,759
this brings up another Point wouldn't it

489
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,360
be nice to see the the game improved and

490
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:42,319
lab testing in Canada abely like I feel

491
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,839
like I I I went and surveyed the entire

492
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,399
landscape of who was out there to do

493
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,359
this testing and there's not very many

494
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,080
places and most places take a long time

495
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,759
and are fairly expensive well I think

496
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,359
for the fact that considering it was

497
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,200
basically on the law on the books

498
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,199
considered trafficking when you brought

499
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,240
your mm mmpr cannabis or cash or

500
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,679
extracts to the lab and gave it to them

501
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,880
that was trafficking I think because of

502
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,200
that a lot of them stayed out of it but

503
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:13,159
I think now that the government is

504
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,279
allowing for mm mmpr acmpr patients to

505
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,440
um legally have their materials tested

506
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,960
so when they give it to the labs I guess

507
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,720
basically the I don't know if the labs

508
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
are going to be having to acquire a

509
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,400
special license to be able to possess

510
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,360
they they have to get a licensed dealer

511
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,320
right right now so I don't know if that

512
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,279
will change in the future right makes

513
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,558
sense that something along those lines

514
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,879
I'm not really down with all the

515
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:39,480
[ __ ] regulations at the same time um

516
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,440
it seems to be somewhat needed as I've

517
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,360
seen in the non-regulated market

518
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,840
anything goes and of course anything

519
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,399
goes means if you can trick someone into

520
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,759
purchasing something that's not as good

521
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,400
as what you said it was a lot of that is

522
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,158
happening in the dispensary uh and in

523
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,720
the black market industry right now and

524
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,720
un you know it's insane what the LPS

525
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,079
have to jump through but part of that

526
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,279
you know I'd like to take the [ __ ]

527
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,240
out that they're all having to jump

528
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,000
through and just make it real like make

529
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
make the playing field level for

530
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,359
everyone but it's like listen you have

531
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,279
to jump through the I don't care how

532
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,918
much it costs you have to we're doing

533
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,359
pesticidal tests on this we're doing

534
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,280
microbial tests we're making sure at

535
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,199
least for a medicine if it's a

536
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,678
recreational thing well my God they sell

537
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,519
cigarettes is recreational so probably

538
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,280
you don't have to regulate it too hard

539
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,158
you could probably literally make the

540
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,639
Cannabis radioactive and still sell it

541
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,039
legally in a recreational Market but for

542
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,960
a patient Market it has to have a little

543
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:40,200
bit more of a higher driven ethics I

544
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,880
think yes well I mean we have to try

545
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,558
right yeah and that's what we're doing

546
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,039
so I look forward to seeing you in

547
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,639
October for the Cara cup yes uh well you

548
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,000
should have lots of fun people there I

549
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
think Patrick's going to come and blow

550
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,798
glass absolutely and I also talked to um

551
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,359
Crockett the other day and he said he

552
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,400
was going to be trying to make it out

553
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:00,158
not not necessarily to enter he didn't

554
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,798
know that that was a possibility but

555
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,039
definitely just trying to be out there

556
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,000
and connect love that wouldn't that be

557
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:07,879
great yeah I was speaking to him as well

558
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,200
and both he and his wife and they're

559
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,919
lovely people um I've I've uh had some

560
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,440
dealings with them before we've had some

561
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,400
coffee it was good um I think that we're

562
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,400
on the same level and I don't see why it

563
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,679
can't

564
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,320
