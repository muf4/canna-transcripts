79
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:34,959
remember I bought this thing back when

80
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:36,370
Hastert just kicking weekly but I lived

81
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,280
out in the woods and didn't have enough

82
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,849
bandwidth to really take advantage of it

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,830
you know

84
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:46,479

86
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,859
pleasure to see you and hear about what

87
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,600
you've been up to in the world I saw

88
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,580
some crazy video the other day where you

89
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,949
were drifting in your car I guess that

90
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:01,630
one of your passengers was recording the

91
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:04,089
video I was like oh snap human that that

92
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,699
was fun man I mean I try to do as much

93
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,640
as I can to kind of keep my head out of

94
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:10,409
the crazy cannabis industry here in the

95
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,500
States

96
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:17,019
so drifting is one way you know to get

97
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,199
out there and get into zone kind of like

98
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,488
when I make cash I get into zone 2

99
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,969
breeding dogs I feel like that's another

100
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:26,139
thing that's uh it's really been putting

101
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,320
a lot of love in my heart

102
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,419
you know that's awesome dude I could

103
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,909
tell that you're doing things that are

104
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,770
bringing you joy so I mean just keep it

105
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,960
up that's that's generally when people

106
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:40,959
are kind of on this internet thing I see

107
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,909
people looking for people who are really

108
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,739
loving their lives those are that's

109
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,210
that's inspiration to people where

110
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,800
they're just like oh man like I just see

got your hash and your herb and it's

114
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,910
it's it's why people gravitate towards

115
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:00,009
you I can promise you that it's not just

116
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,750
because you've won countless amounts of

117
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,399
awards for your hash but because you

118
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,199
have a passion for living and the things

119
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,449
that you do you do with a spark and

120
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,810
people are always going to be attracted

121
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,769
to that

122
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,610

not yourself not crippled they're just

156
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:58,549
slow this morning but recognizing that

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,580
because I've heard my back it makes a

158
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,620
lot of sense not to sit so I'm gonna ask

159
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:06,288
your forbearance to take our meeting

160
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,158
this morning in bed I got the same

161
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:12,560
enthusiasm to offer opinion but yeah

162
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:14,689
I've got a nice back and the healing is

163
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,500
happening it's just not the quickest

164
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:25,060

168

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,710
little less choppy people are saying I'm

just in case he's getting it there it's

209
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,170
always a little bit of a little bit of

210
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,649
difficulty when we're trying to get

211
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:10,349
things going here at first in the

212
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:13,500
morning limited bandwidth all right

213

yeah maybe send it to him just in case I

221
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,360
think he was he was in the room this

222
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:35,669
morning so I'm sure that he's popping by

223
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,960
I know the dragonfly earth medicine was

224
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:40,729
going to try but they're in the middle

225
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,470
of pulling down their crop right now and

226
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,210
who else who else who else I guess I

227
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,710
invited a bunch of different people this

228
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:58,879
morning there's ham guy what's going on

229
00:10:49,710 --> 00:11:04,320
Sam yeah but your lips aren't moving

230
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,889
that's because I'm oh you're a ventricle

231
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,660
list

232
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:14,279
uh-huh right I get it one of them

233
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:16,919
ventricle lists not sure why my camera's

234
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,169
so like fast and I can't undo MIT but

235
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,179
you know what we're gonna deal with it

236
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:23,639
that's the way it is I hope everyone's

237
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:31,159
doing good I hope things are nice in

238
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:33,990
sort of sunny Amsterdam for you Sam it

239
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,029
yeah here too we just like went the

240
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,180
Pacific Northwest went into winter mode

241
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,069
like 48 hours ago it was just like fire

242
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,169
fire fire fire just so for those of you

243
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:47,160
that don't know my entire province is on

244
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:49,919
fire right now like 600 fires that are

245
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,799
affecting like Washington and effect I

246
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,699
think like Alberta and Saskatchewan and

247
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,409
the smoke is just you know unbelievable

248
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,570
how how many fires there are right now

249
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:02,519
it's it's a little bit disconcerting I

250
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,100
know there's a natural sort of way for

251
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,079
this to go on and things need to burn

252
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,570
and there's sort of a natural cycle in

253
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,070
all of it but it seems a little off

254
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,990
right now I know what happens to Cali

255
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,330
every year to just burn burn burn burn

256
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,820
burn and I'm sure all the way up the

257
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:21,740
west coast but British Columbia is on

258
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,760
fire and if you look at the map this is

259
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,589
unbelievable our fighter map there's

260
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,389
just little fire covering the entire

261
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,370
province there was a couple days ago you

262
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:30,870
couldn't there was really nowhere in the

263
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,429
province that you weren't smoked out it

264
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,429
kind of created these Serengeti like

265
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:40,480
sunsets where the Sun was just super

266
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,610
Orange and the sky was just very very I

267
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,980
wouldn't say cloudy but just super hazy

268
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:49,899
&amp; smokey and definitely affecting

269
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,339
people's you know a bit bility debris

270
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,230
Evon people with sort of breathing

271
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,380
disorders were a little bit more

272
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,240
stressed out about it then than the rest

273
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:00,278
of us but yeah I hope everyone's doing

274
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,180
well out there from the fires from Cali

275
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:05,620
on up to British Columbia it was you

276
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:07,750
know it's a bummer we're gonna end up

277
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,240
with a whole lot of cheap pole to pole a

278
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,000
weed I'm not sure if you guys ever

279
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,129
really recognize that herb that has that

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,929
smoke damage to it that you just kind of

281
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,269
can't seem to wash off I'm sure

282
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:29,949
potentially you could do short paths

283
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:31,870
molecular distance I find it's really

284
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,759
handy to have weed like that because you

285
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,009
don't even have to smoke it it's already

286
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,330
been smoked yeah it's already been

287
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,620
smoked it's kind of like from a hash

288
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,379
makers perspective although I do

289
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,289
appreciate you're sick and sarcastic

290
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:46,750
twisted humor Sam I do love it it hurts

291
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:48,309
my soul like when I see people bring me

292
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,019
a beautiful bond and I'm like aw man

293
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:53,229
that looks so and then I crack it open

294
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:55,929
I'm just like it's the chipotle herb

295
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,879
it's just all I mean this this has to be

296
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:03,819
a major problem in California Eric yeah

297
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,049
yeah its way it's I mean we're not

298
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,670
seeing everybody coming out with the

299
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,019
smoke buds yet all the way but I mean

300
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:10,539
there's smoke everywhere so it's

301
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,659
inevitable for that to happen the labs

302
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:15,730
are talking about what people can do to

303
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,949
you know try to save the stuff or make

304
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,200
it usable in some regards but it really

305
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,470
just depends on where you are and how

306
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,329
long that smoke sits but I mean most of

307
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,950
Northern California for the most part

308
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:31,719
has been really hitting sitting in a

309
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:33,070
really heavy fog of smoke and it's

310
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,790
cleared out a little bit here in the

311
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,399
Grass Valley

312
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:38,199
you know sierra mountains to some degree

313
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,778
where I am but up in Humboldt and the

314
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,339
Emerald triangle and I mean Garberville

315
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:47,639
and all these areas I've been lately

316
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,640
yesterday was pea soup it's pretty bad

317
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,659
yes it's I mean if you just think of how

318
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:54,548
much cannabis that's affecting it's uh

319
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,958
and it seems to have gotten worse in the

320
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:58,178
last few years I don't know if we're at

321
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,798
some sort of a pinnacle in the cycle but

322
00:14:58,178 --> 00:15:02,438
it definitely seems the last two to

323
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:04,239
three years both California and British

324
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:06,639
Columbia are just endless stories of

325
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:07,660
people being you know escorted out of

326
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,869
their neighborhoods neighborhoods

327
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:12,698
burning to the ground and obviously it's

328
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:14,470
terrible when it's trees but when you

329
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:16,599
get into the house fires and you start

330
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,369
burning all these plastics and wires and

331
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,678
all these other things the smoke

332
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:22,359
contains toxicities that are at a

333
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:25,028
completely different level than just

334
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:27,459
smelling like smoke then you get this

335
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:30,519
other thing going on and I'm not sure I

336
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:32,649
mean I guess the scientists would be

337
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,409
able to speak a little bit more on that

338
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,429
but how do you clean that how do you

339
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:39,509
make that available

340
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:44,948
[Music]

341
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:47,499
I mean even even like besides the weed

342
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:49,298
for example yesterday I met up with with

343
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:51,308
a patient that she has she suffers from

344
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:54,489
Lyme disease and she has a very

345
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:56,469
sensitive like like a body overall you

346
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,939
know a lot of things affect her but she

347
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,610
told me she had multiple seizures

348
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:03,188
because of the smoke she lives in Lake

349
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,129
Lake County or so I don't know some

350
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:08,828
Lakeport yeah it's my Mendocino and her

351
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:11,289
dad was showing me a video of like this

352
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:13,149
enormous wall of fire it must not have

353
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:17,259
been like three miles from their city

354
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:20,318
you know it's crazy and yeah I mean just

355
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:22,539
like indirectly without even a a smoking

356
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:25,828
cannabis it can affect you if you have a

357
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:28,178
compromised immune system for sure

358
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:31,418
microbes of the ash that get deep into

359
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:33,100
your lungs if you're affected by the the

360
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:35,639
fires and you're in close proximity to

361
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:40,689
smoke you should wear maybe a mask too

362
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:44,288
sure sorry the fire that you're

363
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:47,139
mentioning is the the biggest fire in

364
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:50,859
California history already and it's only

365
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:54,818
about sixty percent contained it's

366
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:57,850
pretty insane what's going on everybody

367
00:16:54,818 --> 00:17:01,979
needs to grow instead of fire they need

368
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,980
to grow fire extinguish and we

369
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:09,078
yeah or maybe this needs to rain out

370
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,470
here more often I mean I haven't seen

371
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,419
rain since March and it's hot super dry

372
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,850
out here you know supposedly that big

373
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,430
fire in Mendocino the one that you were

374
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:21,799
mentioning it got started by a truck

375
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:25,100
drivers tire blowing out and the rim

376
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,889
creating a spark and igniting like the

377
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:31,339
the countryside to the side of the road

378
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:33,500
or some crazy [ __ ] like that that is

379
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:34,639
like you know what that wouldn't start a

380
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,680
fire anywhere else but in California

381
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,009
when it's dry like that you up and not

382
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:43,460
to mention Canada man Washington is all

383
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:46,250
smoky it's bad out there a good friend

384
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,350
of mine that he has two kids with SMA

385
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,170
hasn't left the house in like five days

386
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:54,799
because the air quality is that bad that

387
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:57,200
could affect his kids negatively so it's

388
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,169
it's a terrible impact well I'll give

389
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,750
you an idea of how bad go ahead Sam if

390
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,779
you want to see rain Cuban come down to

391
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,210
them we'll have it for you for sure

392
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,410
that's for sure that is for sure I'll

393
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,160
tell you how bad it is

394
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:15,350
I SWAT Jodie Emery flew from Toronto to

395
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,779
Vancouver recently and she she was

396
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:19,339
basically like usually I'm so stoked to

397
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:21,799
get to Vancouver and breathe in the air

398
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:24,500
quality from Toronto and she said it was

399
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,309
just the air quality was so much worse

400
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:31,039
than basically our biggest city in

401
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:33,289
Canada so that gives you an idea of just

402
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,420
these fires are like deeply affecting

403
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:37,190
people I feel bad for people with asthma

404
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,500
and emphysema and all these sort of

405
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,140
different lung elements that bronchitis

406
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,569
and whatnot because they just get lit up

407
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,240
when this happens it just makes it like

408
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:49,639
you know 2030 times worse than it than

409
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,500
it was and you get yeah like Cuban was

410
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,070
saying you get these sinus infections

411
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,400
and you get pain behind your eyes and

412
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:59,899
it's just it's no bueno

413
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,519
it makes it hard for summer vacation

414
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,380
with the kids and stuff cuz everybody's

415
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,210
kind of got to be indoors or a limited

416
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,450
amount of play outside and things like

417
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,250
that so I mean it's been tough all the

418
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,420
way around with this smoke and I can't

419
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,130
imagine what the people are going

420
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,000
through that are in the fires and the

421
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,920
people that are fighting the fire

422
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,990
things like that I mean it's been really

423
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,870
hot and those guys wear all kinds of

424
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,089
gear and there's been a lot of lives

425
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,919
lost in these last few fires and then

426
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,449
snow in the Redding one and it's just

427
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,029
surprising how like you were saying

428
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,610
earlier it's not just forest fires it's

429
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:35,670
neighborhood fires and wiping out little

430
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:37,500
areas and things that are completely new

431
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,420
to all of us and how to deal with it

432
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,420
really and how do we prepare for fire

433
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,700
living in these fire stricken areas I

434
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,200
guess you could say and so it's I've

435
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,059
been with a lot of people lately and

436
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,590
it's all like you know get a trailer

437
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,629
park it out in front of your house fill

438
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,220
it with all the valuables in case

439
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,290
there's a fire then you hook up to this

440
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,269
trailer and bail out and I'm like so

441
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:59,399
every year we unpack our house and fill

442
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:02,400
up a trailer and you know spend the

443
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,440
summer with this like bug out trailer

444
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,120
ready to go or something and it's like I

445
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,279
hear all these different theories on how

446
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,209
to deal with it and I mean I would say

447
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,720
the one thing that I've noticed

448
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,670
traveling to a lot of farms lately is

449
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,769
that a lot of the farms aren't prepared

450
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,470
for fires they're prepared for permits

451
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:21,150
and they're legal and and don't get me

452
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,620
wrong they're beautiful farms and things

453
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,030
but if you really look around you can

454
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:34,469
kind of notice that there nobody's

455
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:36,029
prepared for an actual fire we're seeing

456
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,309
a lot of fires down in Southern Oregon

457
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:40,740
too we can't forget our friends down

458
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:42,389
there and the Apple game and you know

459
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,130
Williams and the road and the Rogue

460
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,650
Valley down there just getting slammed

461
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,320
again this summer it hasn't ceased one

462
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,180
of my good friends James house was

463
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:52,919
fighting a fire around his house the

464
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,080
other day and he was able to save it so

465
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,060
but it's lost it's really scary for so

466
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,460
many people I've traveled in that

467
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,929
northern Cal and down into Humboldt it

468
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,329
was really bad down there and the

469
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,519
further I got into Mendo the worse it

470
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:07,589
got and then I was at Seattle Hempfest

471
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:12,269
last weekend and we could hardly breathe

472
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:15,599
on Saturday snow yeah and just to touch

473
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:21,299
up on like fire preparation in a let's

474
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:23,759
say a light up or outdoor permitted on a

475
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,809
situation where you're outside in like

476
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,460
more in the wilderness

477
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:30,759
you know like Mendocino and etc

478
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,190
well can you really do to kind of deter

479
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,109
the fire there's a huge fire your way

480
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:39,130
you know hundreds of thousands of acres

481
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:40,959
can you even do anything yeah it travels

482
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,429
it's such an incredible speed you know

483
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,250
it's it's definitely something that's

484
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:47,019
gonna be hard to prepare without really

485
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,089
affecting your life in a major way like

486
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:50,829
you know removing trees all around your

487
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:52,808
house and creating that sort of buffer

488
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:54,609
zone but when Eric was talking about

489
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:56,230
slam and everything into a trailer it

490
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:58,119
really reminded me of the back in the

491
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,159
Prohibition days of how often we had to

492
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:02,109
do that with our gardens I mean how many

493
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,990
people here through their whole indoor

494
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:05,829
garden into a trailer while their

495
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,929
landlord

496
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:09,730
you know visited their property I can't

497
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:11,620
even count how many times I did that in

498
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,200
my life both helping friends and doing

499
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:16,239
it for myself you know we got so

500
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,399
confident at it towards the end we'd

501
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,528
leave the [ __ ] truck parked in the

502
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:22,509
driveway of the house so the people

503
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:24,669
would literally walk by the [ __ ]

504
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,890
thing go into the house be like yeah

505
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:28,419
okay everything looks good have a good

506
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,278
day like they're driving away in the

507
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:32,200
truck doors getting opened up and be

508
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,109
like alright let's get this [ __ ] back in

509
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,538
there it's kind of ridiculous

510
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:38,829
oh yeah shout out to all the firemen and

511
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:40,990
the prisoners who have been fighting the

512
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:42,939
fires down in Cali and up in Canada and

513
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,429
I guess we haven't really had a

514
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,210
discussion since loud packs greenhouse

515
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:51,640
facility went up in smoke that's that's

516
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,140
a soul wrench sure as well really sorry

517
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,940
to hear about that for the lab pack

518
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,278
family and the DNA genetics and all

519
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,288
those guys that had things growing there

520
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,569
that was I heard all sorts of different

521
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:03,849
numbers from you know 10 million dollars

522
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:07,178
upwards of 20 to 30 million dollars and

523
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:09,490
whatever it was I definitely want to

524
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:11,700
give my you know were shut out to those

525
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:16,288
guys that you know keep keeping on

526
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,340
absolutely devastating news and sounds

527
00:23:16,288 --> 00:23:20,379
sounds like one of those things that

528
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:22,178
could have potentially have been well I

529
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,250
mean you people asked how we can prevent

530
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,320
things like sprinkler systems is it is a

531
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,450
good idea right off the bat never a bad

532
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,099
idea to have a sprinkler system be able

533
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,960
to soak everything down with water and

534
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:34,209
get that fire out before it really

535
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,429
starts but sometimes these things are

536
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:40,670
uncontrollable and that that loud

537
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:43,009
backfire was unbelievable

538
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,050
yeah prisoners fighting fires I think

539
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:47,029
down in Cali they pull prisoners out to

540
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,279
I don't know they don't pay him much but

541
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:51,579
they get out for the for the day or

542
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,920
whatever and they they fight fires so

543
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:56,389
good on them it's kind of like a better

544
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,029
thing to be doing is sitting and rotting

545
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:02,150
in prison anyway they get time off their

546
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:03,829
sentences as well Marcus I would think

547
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,660
they should I mean that's some serious

548
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:09,799
life-or-death [ __ ] you're really kind of

549
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:11,180
like you know there's when I first when

550
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:15,049
I met these legs and we were smoking

551
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,789
hash on the banks of the Ganges and all

552
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:18,169
sorts of different languages were being

553
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,750
spoken it was just an incredible

554
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,850
experience from from top to bottom but

555
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,710
one of the things I was intrigued by was

556
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:26,719
the sort of like there was a couple of

557
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,970
guys and I couldn't really put my finger

558
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,769
on what their trip was but they were the

559
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:34,039
helpers of the Baba's so they would make

560
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:36,049
the chai tea they would pack and clean

561
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,849
chill ohms they would make the campsite

562
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:40,129
clean they would sweep they would make

563
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:41,899
sure that everything was was kind of

564
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,330
capisce with the with the Baba's

565
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,970
campsites they would prepare food and I

566
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:48,649
sort of asked the Baba pashupati that

567
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,269
you guys have maybe seen a picture of me

568
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,000
with back in the day back in the late

569
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:54,799
90s when I was in India and he said that

570
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,259
you know these guys were people that had

571
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,389
gotten that had got caught stealing and

572
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:01,339
they had an alternative to going to

573
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,520
prison they could actually become like a

574
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:06,079
helper for a Baba and follow this you

575
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,490
know these Baba's have hard lives they

576
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,949
don't live an easy life they sleep

577
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,380
outside some of them own nothing they

578
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,960
walk everywhere they go I mean some some

579
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,310
take cars some you know actually fly but

580
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,470
for the most part a lot of them

581
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:21,049
depending on what sect they're from

582
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,789
whether they're from the Naga Baba's or

583
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,919
the Christian of Baba's or the shivay

584
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,559
Baba's they live particularly different

585
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:33,920
hard lives and I guess in India there's

586
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:36,529
this all these numbers instead of going

587
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,080
to prison and I thought it was a pretty

588
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:43,309
cool thing where you just hey what a

589
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:45,109
great way to rehabilitate my when it

590
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:47,299
comes to the law at least with the

591
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,859
cannabis cannabis prohibition over the

592
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:50,960
years definitely taught me to think a

593
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:52,279
certain way but I guess people that have

594
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,779
you know are getting in trouble a

595
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,710
multitude of times have this opportunity

596
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:59,210
to go

597
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,500
and almost study under asado and travel

598
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,990
with him and learn about the

599
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,519
spirituality and you know learn about

600
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,400
karma and all these different things and

601
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:09,589
I just thought it was a very kind of

602
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,990
intriguing way of getting past you know

603
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:13,990
the pattern of committing crimes against

604
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:35,839
especially with unreel except that I

605
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:38,029
appreciate that Sam ii have been the

606
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,009
most twisted crazy joke ever as he

607
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,960
opened his mouth but yet it was a

608
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:46,309
compliment at least i take that as a

609
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,259
compliment so Marc Marc Sheldon sent me

610
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,179
a link today he said hey maybe we could

611
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:52,369
talk about this the article is called

612
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,279
wide patent lawyers are watching this

613
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:56,779
Colorado cannabis case and I guess for

614
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,139
those of you that don't know we've got

615
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:03,589
you can good old Tony and Ernie's

616
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:07,700
company currently suing a Colorado

617
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:11,329
company named pure hemp and I guess it's

618
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,370
for jacking their cannabis fat

619
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:16,369
extraction is that what it's all about

620
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:19,069
mark have you gone have you gone far

621
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:21,129
into this case what they claim is that

622
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:23,599
the product that pure have cells

623
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,330
infringes on their number-one claim and

624
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,439
in that patent right but isn't their

625
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:31,269
number-one claim

626
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,450
soaking cannabinoids into plant fat I

627
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:37,039
think their number-one claim is just a a

628
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:41,539
composition of cannabinoids and

629
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:45,859
terpenoids says a liquid formulation of

630
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:49,220
THC a greater than 95% plus

631
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:52,669
terpenes it's pretty broad doing that to

632
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,190
me could be any Connecticut that's 95

633
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:58,009
percent and with terpenes correct I

634
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,360
think their number one claim if I

635
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,509
remember correctly I'm not looking at

636
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:06,319
the pan right now I think if there was

637
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:07,609
all the wait a second I have I can tell

638
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,829
you what the patent

639
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:18,369
is because I have it up it's the so

640
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:21,199
called 911 patent it's us nine seven-30

641
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:26,959
911 how it ends in nine one one nine one

642
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:29,000
one so yeah I think the number one claim

643
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,670
in that patent is if I remember

644
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,079
correctly is just a somebody could look

645
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,730
it up and make sure that this is right

646
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:42,259
it's just a composition that contains

647
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:44,059
THC a greater than 95% plus terpenes to

648
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:46,309
make it liquid I think that's the number

649
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:48,559
one claim in that patent and they

650
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:51,589
explain I guess from what I know and I

651
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,929
haven't seen actually I have seen it the

652
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:57,500
the document Marcus maybe you could put

653
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:59,779
a post that link because in that link or

654
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,910
in one of these links here here I'll

655
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,430
send you this link this is a different

656
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:06,470
link Marcus if you could post this link

657
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,630
this would be really useful for people

658
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,779
to see because you could actually see

659
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,900
the legal document that was filed in the

660
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:18,500
court and and read it and you could see

661
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:21,950
like I I don't want to say anything

662
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:27,190
because again I you know how it is right

663
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,190
no yeah you don't want to get sued yeah

664
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,809
Church right I mean and he talked about

665
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,009
this and he talked about you know

666
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:38,450
wanting to have this is a way to sort of

667
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:40,460
you know make sure that their

668
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,130
intellectual property is protected and

669
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,440
you cans a publicly traded company so if

670
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,930
they are going to pursue a patent on

671
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,700
something you would only assume that if

672
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,320
they pursue the patent and they pay the

673
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,660
attorneys and they pay all the patent

674
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,849
fees and they actually get an issued

675
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,960
patent that they're going to enforce it

676
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:59,689
or at least they're going to try to

677
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,539
enforce it so what can happen with this

678
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,549
particular patent is if somebody is

679
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:07,609
being told that while you're infringing

680
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:09,789
on our case well it's kind of like a way

681
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:12,859
for you can to say well okay well maybe

682
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:15,109
for your product you should you know buy

683
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:18,169
a license to our patent and it's a way

684
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:21,500
to basically try to monetize the patent

685
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:24,980
that that Tony and you can has and so

686
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,059
or the company could say well [ __ ] we

687
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,370
don't wanna license this we've been

688
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:30,079
selling this for years we'll try to

689
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:32,329
invalidate your patent and then they'll

690
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,559
go through Tony's the patent you know

691
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,059
and they'll go through the claims and

692
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,789
everything and try to invalidate it

693
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:39,799
that's an expensive exercise to to

694
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:41,210
invalidate a patent cost hundreds of

695
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,879
thousands of dollars because they got to

696
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,250
get a good Accord it's just a big

697
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,780
protracted battles so something you

698
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,900
probably don't want to do you'd probably

699
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:54,019
rather license it and so it's terrible

700
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,170
horrible and Ernie and those guys are

701
00:30:54,019 --> 00:31:00,349
probably betting on the fact that

702
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:04,550
companies will play the low risk road

703
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:06,799
and license it as Epona - that's exactly

704
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:09,529
what happened mark with the people in

705
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:14,359
Colorado that they were suing they

706
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:16,639
rolled and they license right because

707
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,500
its licensing is is a low-risk

708
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,990
opportunity and if you think about it

709
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,750
you know maybe that's you cans value

710
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,299
play here is to try to put together as

711
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,609
many of these licensing agreements that

712
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:31,639
they possibly can so people are

713
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:34,459
basically just you know paying them

714
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,550
licensing revenues and you know I mean

715
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,410
yeah I mean how valuable that I mean as

716
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:41,359
opposed to like my patent for example

717
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,850
just as an example I can talk about it

718
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:47,149
because I know about it in in when we

719
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:51,319
take THC a which is what the plant makes

720
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:55,340
and we hydrogenated we make hhc a and H

721
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:58,429
HCA is a total new composition of matter

722
00:31:55,339 --> 00:32:00,559
that was never described in the chemical

723
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,860
literature or never described in a

724
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,929
patent literature so right away we we

725
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:07,759
rushed the patent that just because we

726
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:11,450
wanted to make sure that other people

727
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,099
didn't write so you could protect a new

728
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,470
composition like that now if you look at

729
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:19,009
Tony's composition their compositions a

730
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:21,140
mixture of things so it's really in an

731
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:24,859
examiner's a patent examiner's opinion

732
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,780
that that there's an inventive step

733
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,969
there there's like again think of always

734
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:32,329
I've used this example on hashed Church

735
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,710
before Edison when he was looking for

736
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:35,329
the filament for the incandescent

737
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,980
lightbulb right he was

738
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:40,279
trying filament after filming after

739
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,319
filament should have given up after 152

740
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,109
he tries the 150 third time it's

741
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:52,639
tungsten filament the bulb stays lit aha

742
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:59,000
an invention that's the invention he's

743
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:01,490
stolen whatever the analogy still stands

744
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,019
man I don't even know if it's 152 or 252

745
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,910
doesn't make it different the point is

746
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:10,490
is that you can't predict an invention

747
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:12,560
from what's prior art what's what was

748
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,920
already known so if it's already known

749
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:19,609
that THC and cannabinoids and terpenoids

750
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,550
can be provided in a formulation to give

751
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,679
a certain effect there's a you can argue

752
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:30,169
again that there's a certain obvious

753
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:32,289
mnestheus the aha moment of that

754
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,870
invention like was there a certain

755
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:37,730
combination of terpenes and a certain

756
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:41,469
ratio of cannabinoids I don't know I

757
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:44,269
mean it becomes difficult to really say

758
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,640
where the inventive step is not like

759
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:48,829
again with just the contrast again let's

760
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,770
start trying to throw sand at this I'm

761
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:53,899
with our compound we were the first ones

762
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:56,480
at making it we don't know what it's

763
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,160
good for but because we're the first to

764
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,140
make it we have to patent it because

765
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,180
it's a new composition

766
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,040
Tony's patent is around the existing

767
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,710
composition so when you take existing

768
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:08,630
compositions and do new things to them

769
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:12,530
you have to do something that's

770
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:15,440
completely new and unexpected and and

771
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,300
that unexpected result like you try 50

772
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,329
combinations and it doesn't work but

773
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,220
that 50 first combination works that's

774
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:24,739
an invention right that's something that

775
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:27,319
you have to protect because the prior

776
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:30,649
art everything that's known to that

777
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,220
point tells you that that 50 first thing

778
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:36,710
won't work but you find some synergistic

779
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:39,739
combination that you would enable to be

780
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,780
predicted from what's already known so

781
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,809
that's really important in patent law is

782
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,060
having something that you know I mean

783
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:48,960
again yeah everything's kind of known to

784
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:51,148
a certain level like

785
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,559
people know that you can make new

786
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:54,838
cannabinoids and they have certain

787
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,820
biological activity but certainly when

788
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,380
you're making new compositions and new

789
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,599
structures that have never been made

790
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,059
before which is what I've been doing

791
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,150
that's where it really becomes just a

792
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,980
complete all-out exploration because you

793
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,510
can take existing ingredients in

794
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,608
existing terpenes and existing

795
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:15,390
cannabinoids combine them in a certain

796
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:17,940
way and maybe find some you know off the

797
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:19,500
scale combination that you know all the

798
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,050
other combinations don't work but this

799
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,699
one combination for whatever the effect

800
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,670
that you're looking for is it gives you

801
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:28,739
some unexpected activity that's the

802
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,180
thing you want to you want to patent

803
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:31,500
because you couldn't predict that from

804
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:34,199
everything else got it sound like a

805
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,750
broken record but but that sounds a lot

806
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,759
more complex than just like saying oh we

807
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,559
put terpenes and cannabinoids into a

808
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,410
platf admixture which people have been

809
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,469
doing for a very long time right and

810
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:50,098
patenting that right and and so like

811
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:53,009
what pure hemp will do or any potential

812
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:55,289
infringer of Tony's patent can do is

813
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:57,810
look at the literature find those

814
00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:01,130
examples and bring those examples to the

815
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:04,679
examiner to try to invalidate the patent

816
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:11,519
again that expensive and unfamiliar

817
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:13,500
trust ad spend several hundred thousand

818
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:17,369
or a million dollars doing so fighting

819
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,150
the back yeah but you know like people

820
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:23,940
who like put their life savings into

821
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,619
their eyes but here I'm here trying to

822
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,450
bring it to market I mean you think

823
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:30,300
about it some some of these people are

824
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:33,419
hanging on to dear life just trying to

825
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:37,980
maintain the exclusivity that their

826
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:43,650
patent provides to them you know well

827
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:45,570
thing and how I really chose to deal

828
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,369
with that is that when you have someone

829
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,720
like you can with a patent like this

830
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:51,450
they're going to start attacking

831
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:55,459
infringers what the infringers need to

832
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:58,500
do is they need to gather together and

833
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,170
create like so they're all sharing one

834
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,610
lawyer and they make one case and once

835
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,559
they tack it far

836
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,680
five or six or seven or eight people and

837
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,559
those five or six or seven other and

838
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:12,419
fight back with independently well now

839
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,299
they're only pinning one eighth of the

840
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,369
court fee or really otherwise pay and

841
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,800
you get a lot more strength so I'm not

842
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:29,369
trying to tell everyone how they should

843
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:31,830
fight he just I felt when and I ended up

844
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:36,659
the patent and I worked it out with Ryan

845
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:39,119
really well and I'm glad that it but at

846
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:41,399
the same time if you don't feel the

847
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,630
patent is valid and you really you know

848
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,690
want to fight it and have that

849
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,849
previously published knowledge doing it

850
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:50,099
as a group of with other people who are

851
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:53,369
being infringed it's definitely the way

852
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:55,799
to go about that yeah absolutely because

853
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:58,380
as you point out the legal costs are

854
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,570
tremendous but also just the the

855
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,030
negative burden or the burden of all

856
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,330
this negativity you know when you go

857
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:08,160
after people in a court and you're

858
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:10,259
filing motions against each other

859
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,089
you send tend to get you know a little

860
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,640
bit things tend to get a little bit

861
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:18,900
nasty but you got also remember that

862
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:21,449
like if if you can licenses that patent

863
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,920
to a company so let's say a company gets

864
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,759
together with Tony and they actually get

865
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,980
a license for it

866
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,850
now that company that's paying that

867
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:32,969
licensing fee they need you can to crack

868
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:35,219
down on infringers right because they're

869
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:37,709
paying the licensing fee they expect to

870
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:40,319
have some exclusivity around that

871
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:43,070
technology and that's the way patents

872
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,430
work is that you you're patenting and

873
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:49,440
licensing basically something that gives

874
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:51,989
another party the freedom to operate and

875
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,240
freedom to basically make that knowing

876
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:56,009
that again the people who hold the

877
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,009
intellectual property are getting some

878
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:01,050
kind of licensing revenue from that you

879
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,850
know typically in the in the chemical

880
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,380
industry or in the food industry not

881
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:07,380
pharmaceuticals anything about

882
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,420
pharmaceuticals those licensing revenues

883
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,840
are anywhere between two to five to

884
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,940
seven sometimes percent in perpetuity so

885
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,130
when you license the technology to a

886
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,829
commercial organization at them takes

887
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,110
that and commercialize it the owner of

888
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:25,809
that IP should expect to see somewhere

889
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,360
between about five six seven percent of

890
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:30,239
that revenue that gross revenue come

891
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,490
back to you in a licensing agreement

892
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:36,059
typically you have a there's milestone

893
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:38,579
payments when you get a license a

894
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:41,529
technology and you enter into a

895
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:43,299
memorandum of understanding and LOI

896
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,620
typically or usually the way those

897
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,600
things get started but ultimately

898
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,969
there's licensing fees that are paid and

899
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:53,049
yeah those companies that basically now

900
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:55,329
buy those licenses need the enforcement

901
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:59,680
of that intellectual property over these

902
00:39:55,329 --> 00:40:02,500
so-called infringes so it can breed a

903
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,909
lot of negativity in the industry

904
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,440
because if you think about it there's a

905
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:10,750
lot of people selling you know terpene

906
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,590
concentrates right and so it's hard to

907
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:17,349
think you know who's not infringing on

908
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:22,900
on this patent right I mean let's be

909
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:24,699
frank I'm not throwing sand on the

910
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,829
patent I'm not saying anything that's

911
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:29,379
legally but I think you're just giving

912
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:35,980
you my opinion as an expert in the field

913
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:40,470
of patenting so how much hydrogenated

914
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:44,130
THC a I want well thank you but I like

915
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:47,500
I'm just gonna cut you a good discount

916
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:52,450
I'm jacking it I'm jacking it I want to

917
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:57,190
see mark sue me no we're gonna do the

918
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:59,710
right thing yeah they're against it the

919
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,139
bees yeah I mean we're doing the right

920
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:05,590
thing with HCA we're gonna be doing

921
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:09,759
preclinical testing cuts starting this

922
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:13,170
month actually in in unfortunately in

923
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,520
animals but also in in human cellular

924
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,860
testing models where we're gonna look at

925
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:21,250
the anti-cancer property of hydrogenated

926
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:23,530
cannabinoids and we do believe a quick

927
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:26,530
and easy route to market is a topically

928
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:30,070
applied cream or salve for the treatment

929
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:33,050
of skin cancer because you have a direct

930
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:35,150
delivery of the cannabinoids right into

931
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,460
the cancerous tumor you don't have to go

932
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,950
through a pill and the gut and the liver

933
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,530
and everything that comes with taking a

934
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:45,049
pill or some type of oral medication

935
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,570
we're gonna go after you know sort of

936
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:49,550
like Rick Simpson notion of hey apply

937
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,830
cannabis oil the skin tumors and they go

938
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,170
away we're gonna put a value proposition

939
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:56,480
to that and basically take hydrogenated

940
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,430
cannabinoids into those formulations

941
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,740
because we think they'll have good

942
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:02,750
activity doing that and you know it's

943
00:42:00,739 --> 00:42:05,689
just an easy way to basically take

944
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:09,409
something that's obviously a tumor and

945
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,420
you know treat it directly with infusion

946
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:15,319
of cannabinoids right into the tumor

947
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:19,389
itself which is just a godsend for drug

948
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:22,099
delivery yeah you're trying a pill and

949
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:23,868
chemical delivery of cannabinoids to

950
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,650
somewhere that has cancer in your body

951
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:29,750
that's a real tough Boulder to push up a

952
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:33,070
hill but direct treatment of tumors with

953
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,760
with cannabinoids could essentially be a

954
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:37,190
good payoff

955
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,740
well cannabis survived prohibition let's

956
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:44,389
hope it can survive corporate

957
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:47,539
douchebaggery yeah well because the the

958
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:50,480
plant is is ubiquitous I mean it's it's

959
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:54,469
it's here it's so it's already been here

960
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,420
you know I mean you gon make it so yeah

961
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:57,919
I mean you see this happening here in

962
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:01,400
the states and I'm sure it's happening

963
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,559
with legalization in Canada is yeah big

964
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,260
money is getting in and where big money

965
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,469
gets in that's where pets and you know

966
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:11,420
exclusive licensing and branding and all

967
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:14,358
that stuff you know plays a really big

968
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,690
big money has come in we used to think

969
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:22,029
it was big money when tilray and and

970
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:22,030
privateer and tweed canopy were raised

971
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:35,838
and a four billion US v Billy not raised

972
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,108
in the cannabis industry from coronation

973
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:43,309
the company that owns Corona beer mm-hmm

974
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:47,329
that's that's the law our Jesus rays

975
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:49,099
I've ever heard of in my life has has

976
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,920
anyone else heard of anything larger

977
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:55,130
than that no that's it that's the one

978
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,579
huh that's it they license a distressed

979
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:00,740
license in in Florida a medical license

980
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,019
they're about to go recreational but

981
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:04,609
they're about to issue a bunch more

982
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:08,420
medical license but a distressed license

983
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:11,120
in Florida recently closed at 59 million

984
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,980
dollars you know so this is probably a

985
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,690
license that probably cost I don't know

986
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,789
maybe one or two million dollars to put

987
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:18,110
together and they're selling it for 59

988
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:20,360
million dollars I mean that's pretty

989
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:23,059
pretty substantial it turned out that

990
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,309
one they then they put the law in

991
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:27,559
Florida in place you had to be

992
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:31,190
grandfathered in as somebody who has

993
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,650
been in the agricultural industry either

994
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,960
you know growing perennials or shrubs or

995
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,539
vegetables or whatever and we all know

996
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:42,619
that you know just because you can grow

997
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:44,179
you know arborvitaes and you know roses

998
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:46,460
that doesn't mean you can grow cannabis

999
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:48,319
and so this was one of those examples of

1000
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,730
the business that basically got into the

1001
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,570
industry that never should have been in

1002
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:53,059
to begin with

1003
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:58,250
fail and then some multinational comes

1004
00:44:53,059 --> 00:45:06,739
in and basically scoops them up and an

1005
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:09,440
incredible you know up side sorry I'm

1006
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:10,909
just trying to close some some programs

1007
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,769
like people are saying that they're not

1008
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:15,170
hearing me very well that I'm breaking

1009
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:21,009
up like a robot which is not great

1010
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:24,920
Marcus sounds very clear and fine yeah

1011
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,720
yeah I don't know I don't know what's

1012
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,820
going on it's a bummer it it means I

1013
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,169
don't I can't really share I guess it

1014
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:34,570
doesn't help it they cut each other off

1015
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:41,030
to John page also recently sold an idea

1016
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:43,370
for a hundred which is a third of what

1017
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,880
haiku just said sold their brand that

1018
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:52,849
has two coffee shops to canopy for what

1019
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:55,150
350 million dollars for a brand pretty

1020
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:55,150
insane

1021
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:00,789
well I'm probably gonna stop talking so

1022
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,289
if you guys want to keep the

1023
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:06,119
conversation going if I'm a robot

1024
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:06,119
there's no point for me to talk really

1025
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:13,379
well I'm reading the chat it sounds like

1026
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,909
it's a lot no you're fine

1027
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,890
maybe it'll record better anyway so

1028
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:19,920
sometimes that happens the bandwidth

1029
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:21,909
just squishes out but once it's recorded

1030
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,480
people will be able to kind of go back

1031
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:27,730
and listen and watch so I'm fine now I

1032
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,548
think it was earlier and it's probably

1033
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:32,019
just your Wi-Fi right well I think it's

1034
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:37,630
important that we all keep our mics

1035
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:39,940
muted as well how much is bubble man

1036
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,470
brand worth I don't know man I really

1037
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,039
don't know I'm having a hard time in

1038
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:46,298
this whole thing is with this just giant

1039
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,940
corporate structure that it's occurring

1040
00:46:46,298 --> 00:46:51,670
with you know the different it's it's

1041
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:54,329
just it's a changing game in cannabis

1042
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:57,068
you see it and and I'm not necessarily

1043
00:46:54,329 --> 00:47:00,369
overly against it I mean I kind of see

1044
00:46:57,068 --> 00:47:02,139
how cannabis is just it's it's doing

1045
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:04,530
what we wanted it to do we're plugging

1046
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:06,940
it into every other aspect of

1047
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,760
agricultural products and so you you

1048
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:12,039
know like these things are occurring in

1049
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,440
every other aspect of life I see people

1050
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:16,239
complain about cannabis constantly but I

1051
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,369
know they're still supporting every

1052
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,539
other industry and every other aspect of

1053
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,579
their life from where they buy their

1054
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:24,119
vehicles their computers their clothes

1055
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:27,010
their food you know the beer they drink

1056
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,390
like literally everything but they you

1057
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,369
know they're all like but we got to buy

1058
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:32,769
craft cannabis it's like well but you

1059
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:35,079
don't really do that in regards to

1060
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:37,119
everything else like you're like it's

1061
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:38,980
just an interesting switch to see how

1062
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,559
many people truly will support craft

1063
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:45,010
cannabis and how many people will end up

1064
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:47,410
you know purchasing Coors Light I think

1065
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:50,079
Coors Light does more sales than the IPA

1066
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:52,149
all the testing now - because a lot of

1067
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,298
people are really concerned about how

1068
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:57,130
clean cannabis can be but yet our food

1069
00:47:55,298 --> 00:47:59,259
has a lot of allowable limits and I'm

1070
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:01,690
not trying to advocate dirty cannabis by

1071
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,460
any means but you know I did a panel

1072
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,300
with some people that were from testing

1073
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,400
labs or testing or lab

1074
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,260
you know companies and one of the things

1075
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,630
they said was what is the metric for

1076
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:14,270
zero like what is clean if everybody's

1077
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,640
like you know if every bit of wine is

1078
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:18,889
contaminated with glyphosate and kids

1079
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,599
are peeing roundup you're the same and

1080
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:22,879
it's you know basically they're saying

1081
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,889
everything is contaminated to a certain

1082
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,019
degree and so how do we start with zero

1083
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:29,809
for cannabis and go from there because

1084
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:31,759
if everything else is contaminated they

1085
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:33,679
have a tough time creating that zero

1086
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,650
metric as I guess is what I'm trying to

1087
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:40,909
say yeah especially in the Salinas

1088
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:43,690
Valley it may be impossible guys all saw

1089
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:46,549
this but sea salt turns out has

1090
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:52,519
microplastic in it no more sea salt

1091
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:54,170
folks yeah yeah I mean it's tough I mean

1092
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:55,519
a lot of people aren't passing tests

1093
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:59,150
right now since that they kicked up the

1094
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,469
new testing on July 1st for California

1095
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:03,230
and so it's been a little bit tough

1096
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:05,859
getting everything organized I went to

1097
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,940
Oakland right after July 1st and

1098
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,500
everybody in Oakland was freaking out

1099
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,300
because there was no flowers on the

1100
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:15,070
shelves I mean Harborside from what I

1101
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:17,570
heard and various dispensaries in in

1102
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,519
Oakland didn't have any flowers because

1103
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,440
after July 1st the packaging and the

1104
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,679
testing kind of wiped everything out and

1105
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,450
so it's definitely gonna be an

1106
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:28,730
interesting time here for all the labs

1107
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:35,299
and what we're dealing with now for

1108
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:38,420
getting all this product out there I

1109
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:42,050
mean even touching up on that I was down

1110
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,940
in LA three weeks ago to see some

1111
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:51,350
potential lab space and I was at a

1112
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:52,250
friend's shop at HHS in Hollywood or

1113
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:54,860
whatever that area is called

1114
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:59,210
particularly but anyways that shop used

1115
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:01,970
to have like every single like good

1116
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:04,400
produce product in the medical side of

1117
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:06,919
things years ago if you had seen some

1118
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,889
good amount from whatever your favorite

1119
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:13,159
producer was you could find it there you

1120
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:15,289
know and I was there and I wanted to see

1121
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:17,239
what adult use looked like because I had

1122
00:50:15,289 --> 00:50:18,699
never stepped into a I hope you guys can

1123
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:22,000
hear me well sorry I had

1124
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:24,819
ever stepped into a recreational store

1125
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,170
in California so since I was in there in

1126
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,500
the back room I was like you know let me

1127
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:32,980
check out your shop and the shelves were

1128
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:38,108
so empty man I mean there is one hash

1129
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:41,050
brand 710 labs no one else I was looking

1130
00:50:38,108 --> 00:50:44,469
for topicals I personally like Carter

1131
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:47,380
Carter's aromatherapy design and he's

1132
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:49,809
not on the adult use either it's it was

1133
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,490
like 90% of everything that was on the

1134
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:53,019
Shelf was brands that I had never heard

1135
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:56,199
of before

1136
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:57,880
very nice marketing and presentation

1137
00:50:56,199 --> 00:51:01,449
obviously they got their [ __ ] together

1138
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:04,750
that they can get their product on a

1139
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:06,730
regulated shelf but I only recognized

1140
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:09,880
10% of people from the medical days so I

1141
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:12,490
asked Jason about it I was like you know

1142
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,858
what percentage of the old cannabis

1143
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:16,899
industry do you expect to be fully

1144
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:19,179
regulated let's say like two years from

1145
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,010
now and everything stabilizes who do you

1146
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:23,919
think will be the players is that God

1147
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:25,540
it's only gonna be about 10% 90% is

1148
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,170
gonna be everyone else I had a good game

1149
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:30,969
plan that you know had a goal and they

1150
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,159
work together to achieve that goal and

1151
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:37,088
everyone else was taking advantage of

1152
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:39,338
how easy it was to to be you know in the

1153
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:44,710
open market and that rattled me man

1154
00:51:39,338 --> 00:51:47,670
because it's so hard to to be in in the

1155
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:51,099
adult use California market it's like

1156
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:53,440
crazy creates almost impossible I mean

1157
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:55,720
to do it straight legal and do it on

1158
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,519
your own and not have investors or any

1159
00:51:55,719 --> 00:52:00,669
of these kind of things or not try to

1160
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:03,579
create little side doors I guess and you

1161
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:06,519
know like it's really tough and I just

1162
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,960
went to Garberville Thursday night and

1163
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:10,269
they had what was called a community

1164
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,818
outcry meeting in southern Humboldt and

1165
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:15,420
I mean it was three hours of people

1166
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:18,039
getting up at the mic pretty much

1167
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,710
explaining how difficult everything is

1168
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:22,779
not even on the state level but just on

1169
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,510
the county level application process

1170
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,130
because there was people that you know

1171
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,930
the county is saying and the permitting

1172
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,220
people are saying how easy it is they'll

1173
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:31,960
help you they'll walk you through it

1174
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:34,088
it's just you know

1175
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,530
process and then there's people that got

1176
00:52:34,088 --> 00:52:38,440
up and said look I got a you know

1177
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:39,730
master's degree I'm a lawyer this that

1178
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,650
and the other and we couldn't get

1179
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:43,750
through your application process and

1180
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:47,079
then people end up paying a consultant

1181
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,639
of some kind to spend a lot of money it

1182
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:50,980
sounds like to me to get through the

1183
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:53,588
application process only to get denied

1184
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,570
because something got screwed up or

1185
00:52:53,588 --> 00:53:00,460
whatever didn't get filled out properly

1186
00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:02,260
so I mean people 40% less cannabis is

1187
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,240
planted in garber in Humboldt County

1188
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:07,450
alone not the Emerald triangle just

1189
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:09,939
Humboldt County 40% less cannabis has

1190
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:12,549
been planted this year on the on the

1191
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,470
permitted side of things and they just

1192
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:17,859
had a bus to actually of an unpermitted

1193
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:19,629
garden when I was up there on Wednesday

1194
00:53:17,858 --> 00:53:22,838
was twenty thousand two hundred eleven

1195
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:25,809
plants sixty-five pounds of pre-rolls

1196
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:28,809
like 90 pounds of eight cartridges I

1197
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:30,460
mean it was insane and there's plenty of

1198
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:33,309
them like that up they're really kind of

1199
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:36,429
divided everything in a weird way I

1200
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:39,549
guess you could say so what we seen up

1201
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:42,098
here in Washington is the same thing

1202
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:45,450
you're gonna see in California we lost

1203
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:48,789
like 90 percent of the medical growers

1204
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:50,919
and now that we're now the legalization

1205
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:53,500
happened 70 percent of the people who

1206
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,409
signed up are no longer in business plus

1207
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,000
it's happening now in Oregon and you're

1208
00:53:56,409 --> 00:53:59,769
gonna see the same thing in California

1209
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,780
these communities have just been

1210
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:03,759
devastated like the whole Southern

1211
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,190
Oregon region has totally been

1212
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,130
devastated I think there's only like

1213
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:11,019
ninety ninety percent of the medical

1214
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:13,358
growers don't grow down there anymore

1215
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:15,338
the prices are hitting rock bottom for

1216
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:17,799
everybody and from what I hear in

1217
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:20,440
California when you're taking money now

1218
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:23,109
they're averaging out it's a hundred

1219
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,608
dollars a pound so when you're when

1220
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:27,130
you're borrowing money or you're going

1221
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:28,509
into some deal with somebody the the

1222
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,700
rate is gonna be a hundred dollars a

1223
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:33,070
pound so that's how can anybody turn a

1224
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:36,699
light on for $100 a pound as my question

1225
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:38,650
there you go that's exactly and a lot of

1226
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:40,059
the guys like in the chat they're

1227
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,010
talking about you know support black

1228
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:44,769
market and this and that but let me tell

1229
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,700
you when that model also would fail

1230
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:47,949
theoretically

1231
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:52,089
because it's the reality check that I

1232
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:54,159
got it cost me I grow indoors it's my my

1233
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:57,460
personal view on things it cost me about

1234
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:59,649
400 to 450 dollars to produce a good

1235
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,030
unit if I get 3 pounds per light it

1236
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,329
might go down a little bit but I have to

1237
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:05,560
pay for permits rent employees

1238
00:55:03,329 --> 00:55:07,569
everything right I got to calculate that

1239
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,639
into that price per pound so I'm making

1240
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:12,280
these concentrates off this very

1241
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:14,949
expensive pound right but what about

1242
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,620
what if someone comes around and maybe

1243
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:20,109
they're also regulated and they say hey

1244
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:21,940
look let's make a contract I'll grow the

1245
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:25,210
same quality you give me your strains

1246
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:29,139
I'll grow you an acre and I'll charge

1247
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:31,150
you $200 a pound or $150 a pound and at

1248
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:33,489
that point you can make a similar

1249
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:35,650
quality concentrate bring your price

1250
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:37,899
down to where it's on the shelf for $40

1251
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,400
maybe per gram or something like that

1252
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,920
instead of having to put it on there for

1253
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,389
a hundred and at that point growing

1254
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,650
wheat is not even it doesn't even make

1255
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:46,119
sense indoors anymore

1256
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,889
unless you're growing four flowers now

1257
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:50,829
there's always gonna be companies that

1258
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:53,469
grow craft canopies right they have a

1259
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:55,900
loyal following but when I'm talking

1260
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:59,079
about like scaling like seeing a product

1261
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:01,599
on and available for 21 and over all

1262
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:03,429
across the state or let's say all across

1263
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,199
the country to where you won't have to

1264
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:09,159
go black market because maybe the same

1265
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:11,619
qualities they're tested clean you know

1266
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:14,319
etc that's what black market probably

1267
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:15,969
doesn't work anymore my opinion you know

1268
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,380
and that's where this thing is going and

1269
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:22,629
it's sad but it's true though you know

1270
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,640
so what I've been faced with is that if

1271
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,590
I try to focus on black market I'm just

1272
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,079
gonna get swallowed up by the legal

1273
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:31,210
market but I've had a lot of difficulty

1274
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:34,569
getting into the legal market so I think

1275
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:36,550
what I want to do is consult I feel like

1276
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:40,180
that I can help companies produce the

1277
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:43,300
product and not have to go through like

1278
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:47,909
like the loops of getting my own or the

1279
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:51,789
hoops of getting my own permit amen amen

1280
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:53,230
yeah salting is a good way because what

1281
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:56,529
you're doing is you're lending your

1282
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:59,349
expertise to a client who basically is

1283
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:01,570
bearing the financial risk and you know

1284
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:04,150
at this point again your expertise is

1285
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:07,559
none other I mean Cuban if I could say

1286
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:10,030
stuff myself I mean you bring a unique

1287
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:13,779
product to market that people will

1288
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:16,600
definitely want to pay consulting fees

1289
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,890
for to distinguish their product but I

1290
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,349
want to go back to something you had

1291
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:22,839
just said so the months are the moments

1292
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:24,730
not lost on this is that one thing you

1293
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,670
have to consider when you go from say

1294
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:30,490
like a 10 lighter to a 10-acre is the

1295
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:33,880
scaling of your workforce and ultimately

1296
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:35,679
you're talking about no longer you know

1297
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,170
just growing cannabis you're talking

1298
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:41,409
about managing a workforce which is a

1299
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:43,030
whole burden unto itself because you

1300
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:45,639
know again there's a lot of different

1301
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,830
crazy characters out here and going

1302
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:50,289
through the resumes and going through

1303
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:54,159
the background checks and getting people

1304
00:57:50,289 --> 00:57:56,199
who are compliant in a legal market is

1305
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:57,699
one bucket of people there's a lot of

1306
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,489
people because they have digs on the

1307
00:57:57,699 --> 00:58:04,049
record who are not compliant and that

1308
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:07,089
often creates again a you know

1309
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:09,940
separation and those who can work in a

1310
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:13,660
legal regulated industry and those you

1311
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:16,720
can't but that cost so at the end of the

1312
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:18,699
day and commoditization you see this in

1313
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,969
regardless of whether it's cannabis or

1314
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:24,819
any commodity is the guy who can produce

1315
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:26,859
at the lowest cost and still produce a

1316
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,830
high-quality product and how does he do

1317
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:32,410
that he gets you to consult you get you

1318
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:35,860
to consult at his large grove where now

1319
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:38,710
he can use your expertise to make a high

1320
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:41,380
quality product at that volume employing

1321
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,389
that workforce insuring those people

1322
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:45,550
running the background checks for those

1323
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:49,029
people and really creating a whole

1324
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:50,500
economy unto itself if you know what I'm

1325
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:52,650
trying to say I don't know if you dig

1326
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,900
what I'm trying to say yeah yeah like

1327
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:58,300
like being an IP holding almost and

1328
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:01,030
being able to I don't know I see it in

1329
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:03,220
two different ways you can produce help

1330
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:04,450
produce the product for them you know in

1331
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:06,549
the sense that they put up the money

1332
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:08,859
throw up the lab go through all of that

1333
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:11,920
and you go in their private label it for

1334
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,090
them but or you could do also like

1335
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,559
consulting just

1336
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,000
in there they have their crew instead of

1337
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,779
having to assemble crew they have their

1338
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,340
own crew and kind of optimize the square

1339
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,810
footage of that lab space as much as

1340
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,550
possible so they actually make good

1341
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:27,519
money they have a product that's

1342
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:29,140
marketable for them you know but a lot

1343
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:31,509
of these guys that are growing acres I

1344
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:33,460
think it's um it's a lot harder for

1345
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:36,070
someone that's let's say in the

1346
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:38,619
prohibition outdoor guys have it better

1347
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:41,710
because they scaled pretty big you know

1348
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:43,119
but endure the scaling was small so when

1349
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,949
you're trying to get somebody and say

1350
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,259
yeah grow good weed and you try to make

1351
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:49,659
them scale a lot of times it's not the

1352
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:52,210
same as somebody that may have a degree

1353
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:54,429
in agriculture or whatever you know it's

1354
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:57,820
dude that has a team with a bunch of

1355
00:59:54,429 --> 01:00:01,539
money you know and they come with a plan

1356
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:03,010
ready to grow multiple acres you know

1357
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:05,469
successfully like they hit the books

1358
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:07,360
they they theoretically believe in what

1359
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:11,589
they're doing and I think that that

1360
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:15,670
transition going from craft to that big

1361
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:17,620
scale takes a lot of knowledge man it

1362
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:22,650
takes a lot of help a team it's tough

1363
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:25,329
it's very tough and a long runway yeah

1364
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:28,389
you need serious investments to create a

1365
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:30,099
long enough runway to get a company like

1366
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:32,079
that to take off properly because so

1367
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:34,449
many companies just don't understand the

1368
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:37,059
actual investment that needs to be made

1369
01:00:34,449 --> 01:00:41,559
to create some of these some of these

1370
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:44,469
labs large walk-in freezer oh yeah dude

1371
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:47,429
I'm waiting for Mike to come in my quest

1372
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:50,709
but I have sort of a little project that

1373
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:52,329
I'm working on here in Canada on the

1374
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,079
west coast that I wanted to share with

1375
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:55,150
you guys

1376
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:56,769
but I'll wait for Mike to come in before

1377
01:00:55,150 --> 01:01:00,760
we talk about it because he drove up

1378
01:00:56,769 --> 01:01:02,739
from Spokane two days ago to come to

1379
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,630
come to a walkthrough of the facility to

1380
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:07,209
check it out much what you were speaking

1381
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:08,829
in regards to consulting I'm all about

1382
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:10,720
like pulling sort of the best people

1383
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:13,929
that I know from my community to put

1384
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:16,869
these projects together and I know for

1385
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:19,329
myself that my expertise is very limited

1386
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:22,440
with mechanical screen separations water

1387
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:22,440
extraction and law

1388
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:34,020
I don't have all different types of

1389
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,150
attractions of good enough keep keep

1390
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:38,099
that in and we'll be smoking that in a

1391
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,750
little scene everyone puffs and tough

1392
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:41,880
maybe we should have a little like maybe

1393
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:46,920
if D 420k was in the room he'd say ba

1394
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:55,980
grip and we'd all hit a little rep he

1395
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:59,130
goes down Tom's down well all I can say

1396
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:00,360
for everybody is we got to diversify all

1397
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,610
of us that have been in this industry

1398
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:05,010
for so long and kind of created it and

1399
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:07,110
you know we give them the platform from

1400
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:10,170
which to grow it's time for us to really

1401
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:11,880
diversify and you know be as flexible as

1402
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,860
possible if we're gonna survive this

1403
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,320
whole transition into this corporate

1404
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:18,390
mess that we're headed into it's a it's

1405
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,309
a downhill slide that's a race to the

1406
01:02:18,389 --> 01:02:21,569
bottom like we seen here and Washington

1407
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:24,299
and Oregon the same thing is gonna

1408
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:25,920
happen in California all these poor

1409
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,170
farmers up there in the Golden Triangle

1410
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,260
are gonna re Army in the Emerald

1411
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:32,760
triangle or really gonna suffer big-time

1412
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:35,460
well you know it's it's going to be

1413
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,590
horrible how many of these mega

1414
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:40,079
facilities are there in California I'm

1415
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:41,789
counting like eight to ten of them you

1416
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,009
know so it's really gonna be the price

1417
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:45,960
is just gonna hit the bottom and we all

1418
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,880
just got to diversify and come up with

1419
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,800
different kind of game plans and which

1420
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,240
so we can stay in the game and so we can

1421
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,360
take care of our families and our

1422
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:55,979
communities absolutely I think the

1423
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,289
beautiful thing about cannabis is it's

1424
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,119
the most adaptable plant so if we can't

1425
01:02:58,289 --> 01:03:02,039
adapt with it then there's there's

1426
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:04,079
something wrong and and at the same time

1427
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:06,119
you know I want people to be able to

1428
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,799
make their living off of cannabis but on

1429
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:10,710
the flip side of things like three and

1430
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,750
four and five thousand dollar pounds was

1431
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:14,610
obscene and it was based not on the

1432
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:16,590
magical mists of the plant it was based

1433
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:18,960
on people doing 10 years in prison in

1434
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:21,390
Alabama and Oklahoma and Texas and all

1435
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,250
these [ __ ] states and that's where

1436
01:03:21,389 --> 01:03:27,119
those prices came from so those were

1437
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:28,889
like those were the the way they came to

1438
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,809
be that the prices just weren't an

1439
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,909
accurate description of reality they

1440
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:35,039
were a description of prohibition and to

1441
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:37,139
get rid of prohibition got rid of those

1442
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,889
prices and it's true it's you know Sam's

1443
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:39,569
been saying if

1444
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:41,730
years we could grow this stuff way

1445
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,200
cheaper and make it very affordable for

1446
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:46,139
pennies on the dollar kind of thing

1447
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,909
compared to these I mean my god $5,000

1448
01:03:46,139 --> 01:03:51,779
pounds holy smokes

1449
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:54,239
I honestly have been chained for decades

1450
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:57,620
that the industry will end up in the

1451
01:03:54,239 --> 01:04:02,969
hands of people like Pete organic

1452
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:05,000
vegetable growers or the organic flower

1453
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:08,459
growers like for the cut flower industry

1454
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:13,110
it's even in Holland they barely have a

1455
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:15,929
cut flower industry anymore even in many

1456
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:21,320
countries in the last decade they moved

1457
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:24,389
them all to tropical countries Malaysia

1458
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:27,000
tinea countries like that that's where

1459
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:29,369
all the cut flowers are produced most of

1460
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,800
them are not organic but it can be done

1461
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:33,929
organically - and these are professional

1462
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:37,170
or groundless and I guarantee you they

1463
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:40,349
can grow cheaper than you can yeah but

1464
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:43,559
that doesn't Kalka halt prohibition

1465
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:46,250
offer any insight to what may happen in

1466
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:49,440
the repeal of cannabis prohibition so if

1467
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:52,469
like the repeal of alcohol prohibition

1468
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,869
and again not all counties in the US

1469
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:57,449
serve alcohol there are still dry

1470
01:04:54,869 --> 01:05:00,059
counties that abide by prohibition of

1471
01:04:57,449 --> 01:05:02,699
alcohol but as alcohol prohibition was

1472
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:05,400
repealed and if you think about it in

1473
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:09,079
the 50s and 60s we were drinking beers

1474
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:11,970
from multinational beer corporations and

1475
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:14,549
ultimately there became a craft beer

1476
01:05:11,969 --> 01:05:17,399
industry microbrews and people are

1477
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:19,980
really into flavored scotches now and

1478
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:23,700
authentic you know really you know

1479
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:26,099
artisan level you know alcohol could the

1480
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:27,809
same kind of thing be like a reflection

1481
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:30,119
of what's gonna happen with cannabis

1482
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:32,159
which is that yeah there will be some

1483
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:34,769
mass-produced [ __ ] that you can buy

1484
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,899
and Walmart but hopefully still at you

1485
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:40,170
know somewhere close 5-2 where you live

1486
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,300
you'll be able to buy a craft cannabis

1487
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:45,930
product be it a concentrator flower and

1488
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:48,780
it's made just the way that you know it

1489
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:51,088
was when it was grown in the black

1490
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:53,579
market days and it's still good and it's

1491
01:05:51,088 --> 01:05:55,949
still you know really dank and it's not

1492
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:58,559
suffered and quality and it's basically

1493
01:05:55,949 --> 01:06:00,538
maybe paying a little bit more than

1494
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,298
you're gonna pay in 7-eleven for

1495
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:07,410
pre-rolls but you're paying the farmer

1496
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:10,528
who needs to you know who his investment

1497
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:12,328
and you know have a livelihood to be

1498
01:06:10,528 --> 01:06:14,429
able to produce that product for you I

1499
01:06:12,329 --> 01:06:16,499
think it's likely mark I think the only

1500
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:18,899
problem is that its niche and it's gonna

1501
01:06:16,498 --> 01:06:20,728
be a lot fewer people than the people

1502
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,559
that are you know if it's musical chairs

1503
01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:25,078
a lot of people are gonna be left

1504
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,298
standing without a chair because it's

1505
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:29,068
just not the same way as it wasn't and

1506
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:32,608
although 7-eleven is a good analogy I

1507
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:34,048
think the real the real low quality is

1508
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:36,538
going to be served up at the gas

1509
01:06:34,048 --> 01:06:39,119
stations you get into the gas stations

1510
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:43,140
go get some pre-rolled ERV that's gonna

1511
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:45,269
be Marilyn tells you that the best fried

1512
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:48,420
chicken is at the Royal Farms which is a

1513
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:51,689
gas station so you know gas stations are

1514
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:56,039
now these mega complexes that serve food

1515
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:58,170
caffeine gasoline sugar fats and

1516
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,180
everything that we need as humans to

1517
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:02,309
basically keep our cars and ourselves

1518
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:04,348
gone they also have bathrooms if you

1519
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:08,579
need to do that so yeah I mean those

1520
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:10,680
mega gasoline station complexes would

1521
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:12,690
seem to be invading our country I don't

1522
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:15,239
know if they're like that up in up in

1523
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:18,028
Canada but certainly these places like

1524
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:24,690
Wawa or a royal farm so yeah you can get

1525
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:28,380
really good fried chicken we just and

1526
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:32,068
it's perfect now we just left one road

1527
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:34,588
goes from the west to east but I think

1528
01:07:32,068 --> 01:07:37,650
there's the awesome not not many though

1529
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:40,679
it's more of a rarity does anybody have

1530
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:42,450
an idea how much what's the cheapest

1531
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:44,998
price you can produce the highest

1532
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:47,218
quality cannabis for I know by the

1533
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:51,209
kilogram because I've done it for

1534
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:52,858
decades on multi acre facilities yeah so

1535
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:55,409
share that information with us cuz

1536
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:58,348
there's definitely your the one time a

1537
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:59,998
hundred euros a kilo on manicured and

1538
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:04,210
manicuring was the most expensive

1539
01:07:59,998 --> 01:08:08,259
possible wow that's pretty good consider

1540
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:12,280
that herb he's talking about is it's

1541
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:14,830
it's it's shockingly strong and like

1542
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:18,880
shockingly good that's what I will say

1543
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:20,649
about that to this day I've been trying

1544
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,449
to look at a lot of those numbers or go

1545
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:25,238
back and forth with people about that

1546
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:28,449
and I'm finding the indoors up to 545 a

1547
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:30,429
pound on the hydro you know general

1548
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:32,949
hydroponics type of method and then when

1549
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:35,259
we get into the no-till organic or even

1550
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:37,838
you know outdoor growers for that matter

1551
01:08:35,259 --> 01:08:40,439
it's it varies so much because one of

1552
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:43,719
the things that's happening is that

1553
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:45,969
everybody's dealing with disease and and

1554
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:47,739
they gotta pass these tests and the rue

1555
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:51,609
de foods are taking everybody by storm

1556
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:53,500
and it's just insane the level of battle

1557
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:56,620
that people are paying for in order to

1558
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:59,680
try to make their plants they make it to

1559
01:08:56,619 --> 01:09:01,659
the end and be passed the test and so

1560
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,219
it's not even the cost of production I

1561
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:04,599
feel like in some ways even though

1562
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:08,829
that's what we would call it it's the

1563
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:11,289
cost of like loss yeah it's the you know

1564
01:09:08,829 --> 01:09:12,729
and so there's a lot of break even out

1565
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:15,100
there there's a lot of people that are

1566
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:17,379
not knowing what to do anymore and the

1567
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,819
funny thing is is or you know the sad

1568
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:20,770
part about it was a lot of people are

1569
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:22,719
actually we're trying new things and now

1570
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:25,089
they're going back to the old ways and

1571
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,980
the old ways don't work like they used

1572
01:09:25,088 --> 01:09:29,318
to either and so there's a lot of like

1573
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:31,088
throwing the hands in the air because we

1574
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:33,250
started going with the new methods and

1575
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:34,899
that wasn't really serving them right so

1576
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:37,600
they jump back to the old methods and

1577
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:39,548
then those blow apart too so I mean it's

1578
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,588
been really tough out there and I've

1579
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:43,509
been going around too since I left

1580
01:09:41,588 --> 01:09:46,390
forever flowering to a lot of farms

1581
01:09:43,509 --> 01:09:48,699
doing some assessments and some

1582
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:50,770
management type things and a lot of

1583
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:53,939
rescues what I call a greenhouse and

1584
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:56,080
farm rillette rescue to a degree because

1585
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:58,089
like I said so many people are throwing

1586
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,579
their hands up and not everybody also is

1587
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:02,980
at their farms the owners of these farms

1588
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:05,050
are actually or owned several farms and

1589
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:07,899
they can't be in one place every time or

1590
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:10,600
you know they don't have the SOP setup

1591
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:13,119
either for their crew necessarily so I

1592
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:15,910
mean we find a lot of people didn't so

1593
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,710
many different things like ten different

1594
01:10:15,909 --> 01:10:19,539
things on you know one Road for

1595
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:22,210
ten different farmers and nobody has any

1596
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:24,640
type of you know here's what I'm doing

1597
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:27,039
but then that person does a little bit

1598
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:32,260
differently so it's kinda confusing out

1599
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:36,699
the cannabis or pest or cannabis say

1600
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:39,310
that again diseases or pests it comes

1601
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:41,139
with both the the the the places people

1602
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:44,050
are buying their clones right now are

1603
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:46,600
having several viruses as well as pests

1604
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:48,909
so if you get if you get clones from a

1605
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,760
nursery that's a permitted nursery and

1606
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:54,250
you just get spider mites you're pretty

1607
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,260
lucky or you're stoked but I mean

1608
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,579
there's several nurseries right now that

1609
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,250
are licensed that are going through

1610
01:10:57,579 --> 01:11:02,229
several lawsuits right now because they

1611
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:04,899
all made claims to a degree on their

1612
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:06,759
selling points and then they sell a lot

1613
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:09,670
of people disease and viruses and things

1614
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,860
like this but then when people get these

1615
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:13,989
problems they actually do things to

1616
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:16,569
eradicate it the combat or make the

1617
01:11:13,988 --> 01:11:18,189
problems even worse so here's this is an

1618
01:11:16,569 --> 01:11:20,349
interesting conversation because we're

1619
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:22,419
talking about this the growing of

1620
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,950
cannabis blowing up so big that it's

1621
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,329
turning into this corporate thing and

1622
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:27,488
how are we gonna keep from getting cut

1623
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:29,130
off now on the flip side of that and

1624
01:11:27,488 --> 01:11:32,259
this is kind of interesting

1625
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:34,060
we have cannabis the only clonally

1626
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:36,280
produced plant that's in the numbers

1627
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:39,250
that it is that is not using tissue

1628
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:40,869
culture to grow the plant let's now

1629
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:43,390
tissue culture is going to remove the

1630
01:11:40,869 --> 01:11:45,640
pathogens the fungi the microbials the

1631
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:47,829
intracellular bacterias it's going to

1632
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:52,350
renew vigor it's going to produce equal

1633
01:11:47,829 --> 01:11:54,460
perfect plants that you know you can do

1634
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:57,100
acclamation from the plantlets

1635
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:59,380
into a small clone in a room that's

1636
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,820
designed specifically for the type of

1637
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:01,960
grow that you're putting those plants

1638
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:05,049
into whether it's field growing

1639
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:07,630
greenhouse or indoor and and this isn't

1640
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:09,730
available in cannabis because that's

1641
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:11,890
really only available when you get to a

1642
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:13,689
certain level of commercial production

1643
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:16,630
and that's where all the other plants

1644
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:18,579
all of them figured out that we need

1645
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:19,840
tissue culture to continue this on the

1646
01:12:18,579 --> 01:12:21,189
level that we're continuing if we're

1647
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,710
going to grow without being destroyed

1648
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:26,710
because these pests these bacterias

1649
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:30,010
these fungi these these diseases and

1650
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:31,449
viruses can actually decimate your crop

1651
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:33,460
to the level of like

1652
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:35,710
millions upon millions upon millions of

1653
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:37,569
dollars and the nurseries are

1654
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:39,310
responsible because I don't care how

1655
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:41,109
good of a grower you are if you're

1656
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:43,180
buying plants that are impregnated with

1657
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:46,179
past pathogens fungi sin my end

1658
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:48,220
microbials you are already working like

1659
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:50,230
one arm tied behind your back and one

1660
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,730
leg tied behind your back how the [ __ ]

1661
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:53,979
are you supposed to produce great

1662
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:56,189
cannabis when you've been given a

1663
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:59,199
terrible starting product and so

1664
01:12:56,189 --> 01:13:01,329
cannabis tissue culture really at this

1665
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:04,979
point sure there's companies that can

1666
01:13:01,329 --> 01:13:07,119
clean the the plant up and that's called

1667
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:09,219
initiation it takes about six months

1668
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:12,489
where you're removing all the bacteria

1669
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:14,110
fungi pathogens intracellular bacterias

1670
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:16,420
all of that is getting taken out of the

1671
01:13:14,109 --> 01:13:18,369
plant and now you have this this perfect

1672
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:30,340
plant that's now healthy and ready to go

1673
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:31,630
and ready to micro propagate clothes as

1674
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:33,760
well as from sent a tissue culture

1675
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:37,029
company that I've spoken about a few

1676
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,770
times these guys have it down they have

1677
01:13:37,029 --> 01:13:39,880
an incredible tissue culture scientist

1678
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,860
and they're starting to make it

1679
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:44,079
available for the for the cannabis

1680
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:46,630
community they're gonna make available

1681
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:48,880
these clean cultivars and not only that

1682
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:51,340
but also working out deals with breeders

1683
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,050
where they can kind of get royalties on

1684
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,550
their plants which once again this is

1685
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:56,860
going to get people in an uproar but

1686
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:58,810
this is how it works in bananas and

1687
01:13:56,859 --> 01:14:01,630
almonds and blueberries and raspberries

1688
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:05,470
and basically every other plant that's

1689
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:07,630
micro propagated very strawberries of

1690
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:09,100
course it's everyone like it gets to a

1691
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:11,050
point where if you want to grow on

1692
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:13,150
I mean Driscoll's alone to mention

1693
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:15,130
strawberries which he and often does and

1694
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:17,739
that's where I heard this they do ten

1695
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:27,010
billion plantlets worldwide a year

1696
01:14:17,739 --> 01:14:28,569
almost two billion in plantain they take

1697
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:30,130
them and they load them up with

1698
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:32,739
carbohydrates and they put them in these

1699
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:34,930
aseptic styrofoam boxes that fit ten

1700
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:37,329
thousand of these plant lists plantlets

1701
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:39,820
with bare roots so you can take them and

1702
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:42,039
acclimate them yourself into clones they

1703
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:44,109
don't photosynthesize so you have about

1704
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:44,659
72 hours where you can send this thing

1705
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:46,729
in the pitch

1706
01:14:44,659 --> 01:14:48,199
black and because they're preloaded with

1707
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:50,119
carbohydrates and they've never photo

1708
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:52,279
synthesized they don't actually go into

1709
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:54,500
flour it doesn't convince the plant or

1710
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:56,960
trick the plant and as we know from Sam

1711
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,970
talking about it one of his awesome tips

1712
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,579
that he gave was in regards to pre

1713
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:03,710
flowering plants to check them for sex

1714
01:15:01,579 --> 01:15:07,189
and he would just do it for like it what

1715
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:10,489
was it a day or some hour Sam it depends

1716
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:13,929
if it's an indica or sativa or widely

1717
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:16,819
for narrow leaf as I say all right with

1718
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:18,980
longer flowering narrow leaf varieties

1719
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:21,829
might have to do it for two maybe even

1720
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:24,229
three days for really late maturing they

1721
01:15:21,829 --> 01:15:26,899
bench induction ones

1722
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:30,319
whereas what really early ones one day

1723
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:32,210
all Zito yeah so both of those fail when

1724
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:33,920
it comes to sending things in the pitch

1725
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:35,779
black in the mail if you're sending

1726
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,369
clones you're gonna you're gonna confuse

1727
01:15:35,779 --> 01:15:38,689
them and start off a process that you

1728
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:41,029
really don't want to start off on a

1729
01:15:38,689 --> 01:15:42,739
plant let that small and that's just one

1730
01:15:41,029 --> 01:15:45,019
more reason tissue culture is gonna be a

1731
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:46,909
huge save for the cannabis industry I

1732
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:49,310
think it's gonna help drive the prices

1733
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:52,099
down while still allowing people who

1734
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:54,410
want to produce large-scale grows to to

1735
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:57,320
actually get the job done because this

1736
01:15:54,409 --> 01:16:02,750
diseases and pasts will debt I mean any

1737
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:06,949
farmer knows and as far as I know

1738
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:08,960
Segre they are exploring this that they

1739
01:16:06,949 --> 01:16:13,689
have not developed a protocol to

1740
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:16,550
identify all of the cannabis viruses

1741
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:18,169
excellent excellent point so when it

1742
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:20,210
comes to tissue culture one of the most

1743
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:22,880
important things is that tissue culture

1744
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:25,760
companies need to also have microbiology

1745
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,920
labs those labs have to be you know

1746
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,539
cutting-edge and on point is on point is

1747
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,520
on point and the most important thing

1748
01:16:29,539 --> 01:16:33,949
which is one of the things Sager

1749
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,720
actually did is they validated their

1750
01:16:33,949 --> 01:16:37,399
microbiology lab before they did

1751
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,199
anything in it so they took a plant like

1752
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:41,979
hops which has had tens of millions of

1753
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:44,899
dollars spent on it to genetically

1754
01:16:41,979 --> 01:16:47,929
fingerprint it and they they validated

1755
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:50,000
their procedures in that lab with hops

1756
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:52,789
rather than trying to do it with

1757
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,649
cannabis which really has no you know

1758
01:16:52,789 --> 01:16:56,329
genetic fingerprint that job hasn't

1759
01:16:54,649 --> 01:16:57,789
really been done to the to the degree of

1760
01:16:56,329 --> 01:17:00,159
hops I can promise you that

1761
01:16:57,789 --> 01:17:02,640
and so validation of the microbiology

1762
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:05,109
lab is extremely important and then also

1763
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,480
the SOP that you run in that

1764
01:17:05,109 --> 01:17:10,119
microbiology lab and Sega has an

1765
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:12,669
exceptional microbiologist dr. John

1766
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:15,340
Bronstein who I think ran like the

1767
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:17,590
Canadian hospital microbiology labs here

1768
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:20,500
for a decade or more the guy definitely

1769
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:21,940
knows what he's doing and it's kind of

1770
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,229
the flip side of that coin where you

1771
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:25,149
know we get to a point where we're

1772
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:26,919
growing and growing and growing and you

1773
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:28,960
know everyone wants a big grow I used to

1774
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:30,550
grow cannabis I haven't for a while but

1775
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,260
I started with a light and it grew to

1776
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:34,480
five to ten to twenty and you know how

1777
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:36,909
it goes it's it grows as big as you can

1778
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:39,279
make it happen and so the first time I

1779
01:17:36,909 --> 01:17:40,689
was ever in a large garden where people

1780
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:42,819
were like oh [ __ ] those corporate

1781
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:45,009
gardens or whatever I came out of it

1782
01:17:42,819 --> 01:17:47,769
going no way man like I think we should

1783
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:49,720
probably get the people who are feeling

1784
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:51,520
a ousted that they don't that they're

1785
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,619
not able to grow their powdery mildew

1786
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,020
but in a garage anymore or whatever and

1787
01:17:53,619 --> 01:17:57,939
get them into like a larger you know

1788
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:00,220
some of these larger facilities that

1789
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:01,809
aren't necessarily huge canopies a lot

1790
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:05,079
of the rooms are a thousand square foot

1791
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:07,060
or 1200 to 1500 square foot and I've got

1792
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:09,460
some exceptional people from the black

1793
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:11,860
market at these large-scale licensed

1794
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:13,930
production facilities and they're kind

1795
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:15,789
of living their dream they're able to

1796
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:17,500
grow cannabis every day they're working

1797
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:20,289
with a team of people that grow cannabis

1798
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,850
is sure I think much the way mark shall

1799
01:18:20,289 --> 01:18:24,159
don't mentioned with alcohol prohibition

1800
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:26,829
that it's inevitably likely that if we

1801
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:29,260
will find find ourselves you know

1802
01:18:26,829 --> 01:18:30,640
hopefully really in the least in a place

1803
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:32,320
like with alcohol where it can be

1804
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,510
advertised where it's available

1805
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:37,779
everywhere I mean to me alcohol is

1806
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:39,970
dangerous it's not a safe drug it has an

1807
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:42,069
ld50 it can kill you it's dangerous for

1808
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:45,100
children it's it affects your mind it

1809
01:18:42,069 --> 01:18:48,849
affects your liver it it's it's it's a

1810
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:51,130
huge social tear in my opinion a tear on

1811
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:53,289
the social fabric of the art communities

1812
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:55,390
now I'm jaded because I grew up in an

1813
01:18:53,289 --> 01:18:57,550
incubator of alcoholics not my family

1814
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:59,860
but the community that I grew up in was

1815
01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:02,199
just like let's just drink as much as we

1816
01:18:59,859 --> 01:19:05,920
can so it turned me off of alcohol in a

1817
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:07,750
big way but I think prohibition

1818
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,779
sorry Sam let me just finish my thought

1819
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:11,470
I think prohibition is going to be much

1820
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,269
like

1821
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:14,829
when it ended with alcohol remember for

1822
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:17,080
close to 20 years when alcohol

1823
01:19:14,829 --> 01:19:23,829
prohibition ended you could not have a

1824
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:30,640
sign in your window that said beer all

1825
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:32,829
day today 10 20 years legal medal the

1826
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:36,700
packet needs to be like black it's the

1827
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:38,680
most boring package directed at children

1828
01:19:36,699 --> 01:19:40,929
which basically means you can types or

1829
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:42,550
characters or anything that definitely

1830
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:45,250
you know the cannabis industry would

1831
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:47,920
shine in regards to its marketing

1832
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:49,840
portfolio if we could actually market

1833
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,789
everyone's products the way we should be

1834
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,770
able to market with the clear knowledge

1835
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:56,829
that we're not trying to market to

1836
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:59,740
children I mean look at all the

1837
01:19:56,829 --> 01:20:02,050
characters in here Cuban and and and Tom

1838
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:03,869
and skunk man Sam for God's sakes I'm

1839
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:06,100
bubble man like we all have like

1840
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:09,159
characters that could be caricatured

1841
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,960
almost into a brand that is considered

1842
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:13,000
here in Canada at least like that's

1843
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,770
marketing to children you're trying to

1844
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,630
market to children they're so worried

1845
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:18,070
about children when it comes to cannabis

1846
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:28,050
that they don't seem to care that

1847
01:20:18,069 --> 01:20:28,049
they're popping oxy calm that's my rant

1848
01:20:30,029 --> 01:20:34,869
my trouble is I have short-term memory

1849
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:37,240
loss so I was going to say something

1850
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:39,159
really really really important but I

1851
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:41,199
don't know what the [ __ ] it was well I

1852
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:43,420
cut you off I'm sorry dude I wanted to

1853
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:46,359
welcome alright you were correct

1854
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:49,869
actually I was not correct but there's a

1855
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:52,059
reason for my stupidity all right you

1856
01:20:49,869 --> 01:20:53,979
know what dude on your on your worst day

1857
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,720
you're a pretty smart guy so I

1858
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:57,729
appreciate you I'll just say that much

1859
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:04,090
and I want to welcome my quest to the

1860
01:20:57,729 --> 01:21:06,250
room what's going on Mike Mike's like my

1861
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:07,779
mics not working you know that's a

1862
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:11,800
bummer when your name's Mike and your

1863
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:15,279
mic doesn't work that's that's something

1864
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:17,260
else yeah it's a Mike song Mike song

1865
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,689
Mike song is do you know I saw Mike song

1866
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:22,210
in 1993 at the Commodore Ballroom

1867
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:24,219
standing right in front of Mike with no

1868
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,779
knowledge of the song whatsoever it was

1869
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:28,599
the dark dismal

1870
01:21:25,779 --> 01:21:31,599
dark-dark Mike song days where it was

1871
01:21:28,599 --> 01:21:33,909
like they would do the ten to ten ten to

1872
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:36,909
15 minutes of strobe lights jumping on

1873
01:21:33,908 --> 01:21:39,548
the [ __ ] and total madness I mean

1874
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:42,998
honestly right the smoke they had the

1875
01:21:39,548 --> 01:21:45,519
mingkun hangings right did they have

1876
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:49,298
these wall hangings absolutely the

1877
01:21:45,519 --> 01:21:53,798
demand 100% yeah and the old wooden

1878
01:21:49,298 --> 01:21:56,378
speakers yeah so just to take it just to

1879
01:21:53,798 --> 01:21:58,958
jump us over to a little fish a world of

1880
01:21:56,378 --> 01:22:00,788
fish right now that was that was the

1881
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:02,259
that was the first time I got denied to

1882
01:22:00,788 --> 01:22:05,198
go see the Grateful Dead in shoreline

1883
01:22:02,259 --> 01:22:08,889
Jerry ban shows in Seattle Grateful Dead

1884
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:11,198
in Portland was like 93 and I basically

1885
01:22:08,889 --> 01:22:13,149
drum I drove out west instead and

1886
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:15,728
accidentally saw fish at the Commodore

1887
01:22:13,149 --> 01:22:18,819
ballroom which has a floor that's pushed

1888
01:22:15,729 --> 01:22:20,469
down on radial tires so it bounces it's

1889
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:22,749
infamously known throughout Canada as

1890
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:24,759
the bouncing dance floor and so they of

1891
01:22:22,748 --> 01:22:26,858
course did bouncing around the room

1892
01:22:24,759 --> 01:22:29,229
because they because they heard about

1893
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:32,019
our floor and they play that song often

1894
01:22:29,229 --> 01:22:35,249
anyway it was [ __ ] awesome I think I

1895
01:22:32,019 --> 01:22:37,599
remembered which is that besides having

1896
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:39,759
companies like Sabre clean up your

1897
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:42,219
plants the other thing that needs to be

1898
01:22:39,759 --> 01:22:46,359
done is cannabis has not really been

1899
01:22:42,219 --> 01:22:49,269
bred to be mildew resistant but try this

1900
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:52,838
resistant I mean there has not been

1901
01:22:49,269 --> 01:22:55,958
serious breeding towards resistant to

1902
01:22:52,838 --> 01:22:57,849
disease and pests and in the future

1903
01:22:55,958 --> 01:23:00,759
that's all anybody will grow its

1904
01:22:57,849 --> 01:23:03,128
varieties that are resistant to diseases

1905
01:23:00,759 --> 01:23:05,649
so that once you get delivered it

1906
01:23:03,128 --> 01:23:07,269
cleaned up clone it stays clean it

1907
01:23:05,649 --> 01:23:09,399
doesn't pick it up from the environment

1908
01:23:07,269 --> 01:23:11,469
yeah and it shows up with the

1909
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:13,749
microbiology lab work that shows the

1910
01:23:11,469 --> 01:23:15,639
fingerprint the number the the record

1911
01:23:13,748 --> 01:23:17,679
that the plant is the plant that you're

1912
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:19,088
getting which is exactly what Driscoll's

1913
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:21,819
does I guarantee you the banana

1914
01:23:19,088 --> 01:23:24,038
raspberry strawberry almond all those

1915
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:26,469
industries will do the same thing the

1916
01:23:24,038 --> 01:23:28,688
the the lab is an integral part of the

1917
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:30,038
of the company because when you get your

1918
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:31,929
tissue culture clones you want

1919
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:33,458
documented proof that those are the

1920
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:38,039
genetics that you're actually acquiring

1921
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:40,109
I wish

1922
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:42,539
ian was here today I know that he's busy

1923
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:44,909
on Sundays probably with family but he

1924
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:48,119
can speak on it so well I know Eric is a

1925
01:23:44,909 --> 01:23:50,460
friend of IANS as well and Ian it's just

1926
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:52,859
a really knowledgeable cat I was just

1927
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:54,840
with him actually visiting with skunkman

1928
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:58,949
Sam in Amsterdam when we were at the

1929
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,329
ICRS conference in Leiden chimera was

1930
01:23:58,949 --> 01:24:01,979
there as well that was that was an

1931
01:24:00,329 --> 01:24:04,319
extremely good time we had a good trip

1932
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:06,509
doing doing the good work of the tissue

1933
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:10,349
culture so that's a that's a company I

1934
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:12,949
consult for and Sam is actually I

1935
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:17,220
believe here on the board aren't you Sam

1936
01:24:12,949 --> 01:24:19,289
yes I'm bored I'm bored

1937
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:22,860
indeed Mike can you hear us yet what's

1938
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:26,210
going on Cubans gonna go rotate his grow

1939
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:32,039
up his dogs or did you already do that

1940
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:34,949
when I went downstairs in there she's

1941
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:37,069
holding it down man I totally forgot

1942
01:24:34,949 --> 01:24:39,539
what it was that I was gonna say but

1943
01:24:37,069 --> 01:24:43,710
farmer Tom you have an awesome beard bro

1944
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:45,180
I just have to say dude that's why he's

1945
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:48,600
one of the most beautiful people in

1946
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:52,260
cannabis oh man I hope my beard ends up

1947
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:55,680
like that one day yeah it's got good

1948
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:58,530
form good fullness and good color yeah

1949
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,940
and about that tissue culture you're

1950
01:24:58,529 --> 01:25:03,059
definitely right I mean I think the

1951
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:05,009
biggest issue right now with genetics me

1952
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:09,690
coming from let's say Florida we didn't

1953
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:13,409
see any of those pathogens you know and

1954
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:16,079
moving to the west coast as the first

1955
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:18,149
time I ever saw a pathogen like that was

1956
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,309
when I took a clone in I had a lot of

1957
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:22,259
genetics I popped from seeds and I dealt

1958
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:23,970
with people that that were also pretty

1959
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:27,480
private as well you know they had their

1960
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:30,030
stuff but those pathogens man things

1961
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:36,449
like office areum I feel is is a real

1962
01:25:30,029 --> 01:25:38,250
bad one it definitely can can destroy

1963
01:25:36,449 --> 01:25:39,809
your whole program you know where you

1964
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:43,170
have to start over and one of the

1965
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:44,880
easiest ways to bring that stuff back I

1966
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:47,399
mean you could do selective cloning and

1967
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,079
sterilizing trying to use as many

1968
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:51,460
beneficials and stuff to see if

1969
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:53,409
potentially you can

1970
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:56,470
call it out you know but I think that

1971
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:58,630
that's kind of manat the right angle you

1972
01:25:56,470 --> 01:26:00,670
get good selection that way so at least

1973
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:03,730
your rooms are filled with clothes I

1974
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:06,970
have vigor but tissue culture is the

1975
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:08,829
only way that I've do research have read

1976
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:12,220
that you can actually take those

1977
01:26:08,829 --> 01:26:15,550
pathogens out and in the case of mildew

1978
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:20,500
it's not systemic so you can't eliminate

1979
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:23,350
mildew with in vitro work what you have

1980
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:28,840
to do is you have to blow resistant

1981
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:30,280
varieties yeah I guess the thing with

1982
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,510
tissue culture is that the mere and

1983
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:33,670
we're talking mere stomach

1984
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:35,530
micropropagation here we're not talking

1985
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:37,750
about what 90% of the tissue culture

1986
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:40,239
world is which is callus tissue culture

1987
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:42,699
which is what they do for genetically

1988
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:44,319
modifying organisms this is this is

1989
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:46,809
micropropagation so it's still just

1990
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:49,119
cloning but you're cloning just the mere

1991
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:50,800
stem that the tiny little growth site

1992
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:52,809
like a couple of millimeters or whatever

1993
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,279
and that's what's getting put into the

1994
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:56,890
agar medium and that's what's getting

1995
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:58,239
multiplied into you know four or five or

1996
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:00,340
six different clones and then cut up

1997
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:02,109
again and so I guess the way Ian

1998
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:04,779
explained it was when the Mir stem is

1999
01:27:02,109 --> 01:27:07,299
growing it travels faster than a lot of

2000
01:27:04,779 --> 01:27:09,369
the pathogens and microbials and fungi

2001
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:12,310
that are trapped in that plant and so

2002
01:27:09,369 --> 01:27:14,619
what happens is especially viruses so

2003
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:16,990
what you do is you end up growing the

2004
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:19,300
Mir stem cutting it growing the Mir stem

2005
01:27:16,989 --> 01:27:21,639
cutting it and it's said to be after

2006
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:25,869
about three or four of those runs that

2007
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:27,850
you're like 99.9% like out of you know

2008
01:27:25,869 --> 01:27:29,399
those things will be the majority of

2009
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:31,780
them will just be gone and that's

2010
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:34,329
generally why they're gonna figure out

2011
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:36,489
the fingerprint for a dozen or more of

2012
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:38,319
the of all these different viruses and

2013
01:27:36,489 --> 01:27:39,880
pathogens and fungi so that they can do

2014
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:42,429
it through the microbiology lab and then

2015
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,810
give you a clean stamp of Health so not

2016
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:45,579
only are they giving you the fingerprint

2017
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:47,680
of your plant but they're also telling

2018
01:27:45,579 --> 01:27:50,260
you that it's you know based on their

2019
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:52,180
company's stamp of approval but it's not

2020
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,770
gonna have these these things present in

2021
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:55,539
it it's you know it's one thing to

2022
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:57,580
acquire them in a grow room but it's

2023
01:27:55,539 --> 01:28:00,460
another thing to be like a Cuban who

2024
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:02,470
comes from Florida and then gets a clone

2025
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:04,010
given to him and it's just like yeah

2026
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:06,289
here bro here's like

2027
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:07,940
ten years of pathogens and fungi sand

2028
01:28:06,289 --> 01:28:10,399
microbials I've been collecting in this

2029
01:28:07,939 --> 01:28:12,829
impregnated plant through a multitude of

2030
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:15,079
vectors you know good luck with it let

2031
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:18,439
me know how it works for you it's just

2032
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:21,500
like it's so dirty and nasty and it's

2033
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:23,659
it's it just reminds me of like the like

2034
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:27,738
venereal diseases or something it's just

2035
01:28:23,659 --> 01:28:29,449
like ooh like bummer sorry and and Kuban

2036
01:28:27,738 --> 01:28:32,359
I did one more thing I wanted to say was

2037
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:34,010
that you know it's one thing to have

2038
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:36,289
your garden decimated by these diseases

2039
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:39,320
and pests but it's even almost another

2040
01:28:36,289 --> 01:28:41,119
kick in the nuts to have so many that

2041
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:43,729
are present that don't even really

2042
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:45,380
create a lot of effects that you can see

2043
01:28:43,729 --> 01:28:48,139
it doesn't necessarily kill the plant

2044
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:49,880
it's more like Candida in a human where

2045
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:51,500
it's just lowering the vigor it's

2046
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,840
lowering the expression of cannabinoids

2047
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:55,760
it's lowering the terpene expression and

2048
01:28:53,840 --> 01:29:00,010
it's just all around making that plant

2049
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:02,030
slower budding less you know just just

2050
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:03,800
attacking it in a way that's not

2051
01:29:02,029 --> 01:29:06,710
necessarily killing it but just making

2052
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:08,630
the grow like more of a break even if

2053
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:14,239
you're lucky then we you had a great

2054
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:17,150
success yeah with most viruses they are

2055
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:19,159
asymptomatic you've got the virus but

2056
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:21,799
cause it doesn't reduce the health of

2057
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:23,869
bigger a little bit but you don't want

2058
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:26,779
it because sometimes when you have two

2059
01:29:23,869 --> 01:29:30,439
or three viruses together they screw the

2060
01:29:26,779 --> 01:29:33,829
plant really bad and if you have any

2061
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:38,988
pests at all maybe bad insects they

2062
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:42,859
spreader yeah the pathogen that I've had

2063
01:29:38,988 --> 01:29:46,179
experience with and we named it the dud

2064
01:29:42,859 --> 01:29:48,649
so we I've been growing strings for

2065
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:50,810
multiple years you know same same

2066
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:52,789
genetics because I felt like you know

2067
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:54,890
how it is you pop a hundred seeds and

2068
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:57,829
you find one one good strain that you

2069
01:29:54,890 --> 01:30:00,610
put into production once I took that

2070
01:29:57,829 --> 01:30:04,100
cloning I started noticing things like

2071
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:07,399
the internodal growth and structure was

2072
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:09,410
different the plant didn't grow in the

2073
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:11,719
same structure was supposed to it was

2074
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:14,930
weak it almost felt like in between the

2075
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:16,670
the branching in the main stalk that I

2076
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:17,960
don't know what that part is called that

2077
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:19,010
it almost looks like

2078
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,719
you know I'm talking about and you have

2079
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:22,489
like the stock and the stem coming out

2080
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,430
like that that little part that would be

2081
01:30:22,488 --> 01:30:27,429
completely not there at all the step

2082
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:30,170
those branches would get pinched off

2083
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:32,659
you'd have weed that wouldn't have any

2084
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:36,469
trichomes it wouldn't have any smell is

2085
01:30:32,659 --> 01:30:39,469
so like hey and you were planning

2086
01:30:36,469 --> 01:30:42,109
numbers and I'd noticed that some of my

2087
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:43,789
cuttings in production had it and some

2088
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:47,659
didn't this is years ago like four years

2089
01:30:43,789 --> 01:30:49,130
ago and I just couldn't couldn't believe

2090
01:30:47,659 --> 01:30:52,130
it I didn't know what it was I thought

2091
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:57,710
maybe I had bugs no no I didn't have

2092
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:59,090
bugs and what I realized is that it by

2093
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:02,529
the time I realized that it was some

2094
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:05,690
sort of systemic problem I had remodeled

2095
01:31:02,529 --> 01:31:07,939
using a sick cut so one of my mother's

2096
01:31:05,689 --> 01:31:09,319
was a dud and that already [ __ ]

2097
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:13,069
everything up because I like to rotate

2098
01:31:09,319 --> 01:31:14,840
my mother's so I had to really work on

2099
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:17,539
like I don't know like you said ten

2100
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:19,969
years of this guy's STDs it took me like

2101
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:23,029
almost four to five years to completely

2102
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:26,300
get my dud rate at like 5% maybe it's

2103
01:31:23,029 --> 01:31:28,250
not even completely gone it's crazy

2104
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:30,920
some strings like the one that i

2105
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:33,170
mothered the does yeah that that plant

2106
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:36,590
never came back

2107
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:37,969
ever and it was like three years of

2108
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:40,250
trying to clone this piece of [ __ ] like

2109
01:31:37,969 --> 01:31:42,829
taking fifteen cuts just making the best

2110
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:44,329
one the one that rooted the best look to

2111
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:47,359
like kind of grow the best and it was

2112
01:31:44,329 --> 01:31:50,329
just done in veg and looks like a shrub

2113
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:52,969
you know and I lost open it man that

2114
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:55,640
just started popping seeds the shrub dub

2115
01:31:52,969 --> 01:31:59,920
the shrub the shrub dud

2116
01:31:55,640 --> 01:32:02,539
aka the piece of [ __ ] yeah are you going

2117
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:06,529
right now or sorry on I see Meg there's

2118
01:32:02,539 --> 01:32:09,079
a thread that's maybe 30 pages long on

2119
01:32:06,529 --> 01:32:10,460
the dud and it was crazy that I called

2120
01:32:09,079 --> 01:32:12,859
it the third but that's exactly what it

2121
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:14,480
looks like there's a lot of information

2122
01:32:12,859 --> 01:32:16,579
there a lot of theories but nobody

2123
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:20,299
really knows you know what they need to

2124
01:32:16,579 --> 01:32:22,340
do is I guess send like like biomass to

2125
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:24,590
a lab to actually have it tested to

2126
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:27,739
identify what it is would be great

2127
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:30,300
well to confirm that you have eliminated

2128
01:32:27,738 --> 01:32:34,079
most diseases and virus you

2129
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:37,529
to test that after it sent you be clean

2130
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:41,430
you can test it and it is clean it

2131
01:32:37,529 --> 01:32:43,439
doesn't have the virus and also before

2132
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:47,400
you test it you should test it and see

2133
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:50,399
it does have the virus because I could

2134
01:32:47,399 --> 01:32:52,889
tell you keep I've kept close for 30

2135
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:55,979
years and I'll tell you unless you're

2136
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:59,520
extremely careful they're gonna pick up

2137
01:32:55,979 --> 01:33:03,389
something and the only way that you can

2138
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:07,040
be sure is by either only cloning

2139
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:09,539
mother's that don't pick up something or

2140
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:15,109
yeah or have a test like I'm talking

2141
01:33:09,539 --> 01:33:15,109
about hey welcome back Mike

2142
01:33:15,529 --> 01:33:25,829
I can hear you dude are you on your

2143
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:27,510
phone nice yeah Mike's like tenacious

2144
01:33:25,829 --> 01:33:29,550
he's like the first computer wouldn't

2145
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:32,640
work the second computer wouldn't work

2146
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:35,010
he's like I'll try my phone third time's

2147
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:39,660
a charm welcome welcome to the room my

2148
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:41,159
quest in the house so that was fun

2149
01:33:39,659 --> 01:33:43,250
having you here did you get my message

2150
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:47,220
on Facebook

2151
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:48,960
yeah totally cool machine I haven't run

2152
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:52,350
it myself but if they're good things

2153
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:55,199
about them so there's yes kind of

2154
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:58,800
different ways of processing and it goes

2155
01:33:55,199 --> 01:34:00,420
back into what we were talking about

2156
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:03,480
I guess what you guys are talking about

2157
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:04,949
earlier hey Mike try try to put your mic

2158
01:34:03,479 --> 01:34:07,799
a little bit closer to your mouth it

2159
01:34:04,949 --> 01:34:14,869
might make the quality sound better a

2160
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:19,140
little bit better it's passable go ahead

2161
01:34:14,869 --> 01:34:22,649
yeah so mark was kind of loose today

2162
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:24,270
ting earlier so a lot of a lot of the

2163
01:34:22,649 --> 01:34:27,829
equipment that's used in the cannabis

2164
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:31,500
industry is used in other industries and

2165
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:34,439
just because you find a piece of

2166
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:36,359
equipment that could be used in process

2167
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:39,389
of cannabis oils doesn't mean that it's

2168
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:43,589
a novel novel technology in the same way

2169
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:45,450
that a broad spectrum of

2170
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:49,289
have annoyed that hasn't been thoroughly

2171
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:53,429
researched as you know it's difficult to

2172
01:34:49,289 --> 01:34:55,949
support and very very easy to show prior

2173
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:58,789
art when it's you don't have specific

2174
01:34:55,949 --> 01:35:01,470
ratios of cannabinoid specific ratios of

2175
01:34:58,789 --> 01:35:03,750
terpenoids and then actually looking at

2176
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:09,210
how to formulate is how the process and

2177
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:11,939
then their use right so what they would

2178
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:16,109
live scene a while I spent a lot of time

2179
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:18,239
reading pack and as you dive in the

2180
01:35:16,109 --> 01:35:21,630
patent some of them you can see they're

2181
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:24,479
kind of relatively broad with tons of

2182
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:27,930
prior art and many patents are

2183
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:29,279
relatively specific and those specific

2184
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:32,820
patents are going to be the ones that

2185
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:36,420
are much easier to I guess protect

2186
01:35:32,819 --> 01:35:38,069
enforce and then the much stronger the

2187
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,600
license out whereas one of the

2188
01:35:38,069 --> 01:35:43,679
far-reaching patents are going to be

2189
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:46,340
more difficult now that part is from the

2190
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:48,300
cannabis industry a lot of us have taken

2191
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:50,789
tools and instruments from other

2192
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:53,989
industries and kind of you utilize them

2193
01:35:50,789 --> 01:35:57,510
or modify them for use in the canvases

2194
01:35:53,989 --> 01:35:58,829
and you know as we actually scale up as

2195
01:35:57,510 --> 01:36:03,680
an industry you're actually going to see

2196
01:35:58,829 --> 01:36:06,119
those factors of efficiency grow with us

2197
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:08,190
for sure did you did you get the other

2198
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:10,399
part of my message the last one I sent

2199
01:36:08,189 --> 01:36:10,399
you

2200
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:18,510
he's got a look on his phone I just

2201
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:22,680
there's just in regards to what we can

2202
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:25,800
talk about yeah so I did want to talk a

2203
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:29,100
little bit about this this facility that

2204
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:35,070
I'm involved with here in on the west

2205
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:36,990
coast it's definitely kind of the dream

2206
01:36:35,069 --> 01:36:38,909
quiver in a sense like for me I'm

2207
01:36:36,989 --> 01:36:42,300
everyone knows me as a solvent list guy

2208
01:36:38,909 --> 01:36:46,769
a most focused on bubble hash you know

2209
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:49,050
water extraction dry sifting rosin and

2210
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:50,820
maybe maybe a little bit of like terpene

2211
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:54,420
extraction you know some vac steam

2212
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:56,399
distillation or something but you know I

2213
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:57,350
was approached by a group that had this

2214
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:00,889
real interest

2215
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:03,980
in building kind of like a really great

2216
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:07,579
facility beyond and above just what I do

2217
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:09,769
but also basically all of the options in

2218
01:37:07,579 --> 01:37:13,630
Canada that would be allowed legally on

2219
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:16,660
the federal on the federal level so co2

2220
01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:28,609
cryo ethanol the isolation of

2221
01:37:16,659 --> 01:37:31,550
crystallized cbda and THC a free enemy

2222
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:34,729
pet of expanding common situations have

2223
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:37,630
an interest in in doing so I called Mike

2224
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:40,129
up because I know that he has an extreme

2225
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:42,710
extremely good background when it comes

2226
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:44,779
to both cryo ethanol he's been doing

2227
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:47,090
that for 20 years or whatever and then

2228
01:37:44,779 --> 01:37:50,210
co2 as well he's done thousands of runs

2229
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:52,100
of co2 is from the small ones to the big

2230
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:57,170
ones and everything in between so we got

2231
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:59,870
to walk through the facility recently

2232
01:37:57,170 --> 01:38:03,109
here and it was it was pretty

2233
01:37:59,869 --> 01:38:04,149
inspirational wouldn't you say Mike yeah

2234
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:08,799
beautiful

2235
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:13,039
you know it's an old biomedical biotech

2236
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:15,770
warehouse so it you know when you look

2237
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:21,079
at one of the things that I see a lot is

2238
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:24,710
people utilizing repurposed buildings

2239
01:38:21,079 --> 01:38:27,619
that weren't doing medical processing

2240
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:29,140
prior so being able to find buildings

2241
01:38:27,619 --> 01:38:31,369
that already have a lot of these

2242
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:35,570
prerequisites built out cleanroom

2243
01:38:31,369 --> 01:38:37,819
sterility levels and then in that case

2244
01:38:35,569 --> 01:38:41,929
having multiple walk-in refrigerators

2245
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:46,429
freezers wonderful yeah it had three of

2246
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:51,340
them in two readers and a fridge

2247
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:55,010
yeah two freezers in the fridge so just

2248
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:58,150
write a couple of fume hoods as well a

2249
01:38:55,010 --> 01:39:00,650
very exciting project that possibly

2250
01:38:58,149 --> 01:39:03,589
we're hoping that mike is going to join

2251
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:05,599
us on and we've got a whole group of

2252
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:07,489
different people this incredible people

2253
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,289
I want to mention the guys that with

2254
01:39:07,489 --> 01:39:10,819
Whistler technologies who have been

2255
01:39:09,289 --> 01:39:12,920
spending the last year and

2256
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:15,590
after two years designing industrialized

2257
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:18,078
you know large scale water extractors

2258
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:20,569
that don't affect the end outcome of the

2259
01:39:18,078 --> 01:39:25,158
quality so still producing multi-screen

2260
01:39:20,569 --> 01:39:26,988
filtrations you know doing freeze drying

2261
01:39:25,158 --> 01:39:28,638
the the final product I don't know if

2262
01:39:26,988 --> 01:39:30,948
you guys saw on Instagram recently I was

2263
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:33,590
at Whistler Medical and we were running

2264
01:39:30,948 --> 01:39:35,509
a batch we did a whole day five hours

2265
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:39,020
worth or whatever and we made two kilos

2266
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:41,570
of dried bubble hash just in the small

2267
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:43,790
unit at 250 liter but they also do like

2268
01:39:41,569 --> 01:39:46,399
five hundred and thousand liter units so

2269
01:39:43,789 --> 01:39:48,519
we were walking through this facility

2270
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:51,888
and it's it's a big facility I mean it's

2271
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:53,690
45,000 square feet and the whole thing

2272
01:39:51,889 --> 01:39:56,239
is going to be an extraction lab you

2273
01:39:53,689 --> 01:39:58,729
know and it was just like two kids in a

2274
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:00,259
candy store really just like hops

2275
01:39:58,729 --> 01:40:01,729
skipping and jumping through this

2276
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,260
facility and we walked through it for

2277
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:05,750
four hours I remember at the end of the

2278
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:07,820
day I looked and it was like thousands

2279
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:11,810
of was it ten or fifteen thousand steps

2280
01:40:07,819 --> 01:40:18,529
and eight eight nine nine important yeah

2281
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:20,840
twelve and nine kilometers walk through

2282
01:40:18,529 --> 01:40:23,149
that facility so it was pretty fun it's

2283
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:25,190
definitely something that you know I'm

2284
01:40:23,149 --> 01:40:27,289
alluding to a lot of things cuz I don't

2285
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:29,178
want to say things I'm not allowed to

2286
01:40:27,289 --> 01:40:31,550
say and it's still in the very early

2287
01:40:29,179 --> 01:40:34,670
stages but let's just say that it's a

2288
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:37,789
very exciting potential project with you

2289
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:41,868
know cryo ethanol capabilities of 10,000

2290
01:40:37,789 --> 01:40:43,729
pounds per day you know co2 capabilities

2291
01:40:41,868 --> 01:40:46,368
of potentially close to a thousand

2292
01:40:43,729 --> 01:40:49,158
extraction mark ethanol extractions okay

2293
01:40:46,368 --> 01:40:51,710
in Canada but butanes not is that right

2294
01:40:49,158 --> 01:40:53,779
yeah the one thing that they're kind of

2295
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:55,609
harsh on are the gap the propane and the

2296
01:40:53,779 --> 01:40:57,408
butane and the gas mixtures so they're

2297
01:40:55,609 --> 01:41:00,889
allowed you're allowed cryo ethanol

2298
01:40:57,408 --> 01:41:03,078
you're allowed co2 obviously that's what

2299
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:04,789
the majority of companies are doing and

2300
01:41:03,078 --> 01:41:06,349
and you know what to get into a little

2301
01:41:04,789 --> 01:41:08,149
bit of a co2 conversation because I've

2302
01:41:06,349 --> 01:41:10,039
never been a fan of co2 and mainly

2303
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:12,049
because the majority of people that are

2304
01:41:10,039 --> 01:41:13,310
using co2 and mike has a better way of

2305
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:16,010
explaining it and I'll let him explain

2306
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:17,929
it is just that there's different ways

2307
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:19,280
to run the machines and if you just run

2308
01:41:17,929 --> 01:41:21,380
the machine like you're just going for

2309
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:23,300
cannabinoids then you're obviously going

2310
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:23,690
to [ __ ] with your terpene content and

2311
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:26,150
often

2312
01:41:23,689 --> 01:41:28,159
people say about co2 oh I just find the

2313
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:30,109
terpenes are just not that exciting I'm

2314
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:32,630
not a big oil guy in the first place I

2315
01:41:30,109 --> 01:41:34,069
really just kind of smoke rosin but you

2316
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:35,900
know maybe you want to talk a little bit

2317
01:41:34,069 --> 01:41:37,670
about the differences in between pulling

2318
01:41:35,899 --> 01:41:49,670
for Terps and pulling for cannabinoids

2319
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:50,869
with the co2 machine Mike yeah different

2320
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:54,130
classes of turbines are going to have

2321
01:41:50,869 --> 01:41:57,349
different boiling so a lot of the times

2322
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:59,380
early generations of the co2 extractors

2323
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:01,690
were designed to be able to extract

2324
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:05,630
their turkeys and the cannabinoid

2325
01:42:01,689 --> 01:42:07,639
essentially all in one go what we're

2326
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:09,079
seeing is that you know at high enough

2327
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:11,090
pressures you can actually get some

2328
01:42:09,079 --> 01:42:12,829
thermal degradation to those certified

2329
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:14,569
in the same way that when you do

2330
01:42:12,829 --> 01:42:16,448
fractional distillation but the high

2331
01:42:14,569 --> 01:42:19,069
temperatures cause thermal degradation

2332
01:42:16,448 --> 01:42:21,738
so do you know when you look when you

2333
01:42:19,069 --> 01:42:23,119
look at doing there's a lot of research

2334
01:42:21,738 --> 01:42:25,009
out there that's looking at the

2335
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:27,590
fractional distillation of chiral

2336
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:28,820
compounds which are compounds that share

2337
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:31,989
the same molecular weight molecular

2338
01:42:28,819 --> 01:42:33,649
structures that has just have a

2339
01:42:31,988 --> 01:42:43,269
differentiation and where the double

2340
01:42:33,649 --> 01:42:43,269
bonds are located isomers thank you so

2341
01:42:46,569 --> 01:42:50,319
you know several generations of Buchanan

2342
01:42:49,219 --> 01:42:52,789
characters that have been able to

2343
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,559
improve the quality of the extracts

2344
01:42:52,789 --> 01:42:56,539
coming out of them and we're starting to

2345
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,960
see the same thing from coming out of

2346
01:42:56,539 --> 01:43:01,850
the co2 extractors now that the seeding

2347
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:04,789
equipment manufacturers have done

2348
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:07,190
several generations of instruments

2349
01:43:04,789 --> 01:43:09,250
they've been able to kind of dial in you

2350
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:12,619
know what kilometers works best for

2351
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:14,930
whether you do extracting high chirping

2352
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:17,269
content material pipe wax content

2353
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:19,820
material or high cannabinoid content

2354
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:21,820
material and then there's some cool

2355
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:26,170
stuff you can do with it where you can

2356
01:43:21,819 --> 01:43:29,149
actually do some super fluid or

2357
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:32,810
fractionation using subcritical to use

2358
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:35,409
and then supercritical co2 but

2359
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:37,720
ultimately I think it was the way that

2360
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:40,059
gonna wanna check your monitors millage

2361
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:41,470
you're low-balling low boiling volatiles

2362
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:43,870
is going to be slightly different than

2363
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:47,050
the way that you want to extract your

2364
01:43:43,869 --> 01:43:50,649
tricycle it's an avenue so developing

2365
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:54,159
developing efficient and operating

2366
01:43:50,649 --> 01:43:56,049
procedures that work well for no matter

2367
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:59,739
what product would producing it kind of

2368
01:43:56,050 --> 01:44:02,699
really good increasing efficiencies that

2369
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:02,699
slows increase in quality

2370
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:07,640
well it's exciting I'm not going to talk

2371
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:10,159
too much about it but it's definitely

2372
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:14,150
the quiver of all Quivers it's gonna be

2373
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:16,789
a monster facility and we'll see if mike

2374
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:18,139
is gonna join us in this adventure but

2375
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:26,810
it sounds like something that could be

2376
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:31,700
pretty darn fun bill we're just maybe a

2377
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:34,850
sibility I've come a day exciting from

2378
01:44:31,699 --> 01:44:36,529
my perspective I wanna I want to I'm

2379
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:39,470
definitely like my whole mission is to

2380
01:44:36,529 --> 01:44:40,909
bring the price down on hash and I love

2381
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:42,920
the fact that some hash is still

2382
01:44:40,909 --> 01:44:45,079
expensive but it's just like I wish it

2383
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:46,850
was more accessible in all the different

2384
01:44:45,079 --> 01:44:49,309
wonderful varieties and I just wish he

2385
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:53,800
could like I just wish he could get you

2386
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:56,210
know jars giant pickle jars of hash

2387
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:59,390
rather than these these little small

2388
01:44:56,210 --> 01:45:02,090
ones here's a little Joseph for a Cuban

2389
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:06,650
I don't know if that's gonna show that

2390
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:08,300
very well and Marcus the water hash

2391
01:45:06,649 --> 01:45:10,579
machine's a big giant ones you're

2392
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:14,510
talking about walking through this with

2393
01:45:10,579 --> 01:45:17,029
a batch or continuous operation they can

2394
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:19,369
do both you can make it a batch or you

2395
01:45:17,029 --> 01:45:21,619
can literally get it pretty continuous

2396
01:45:19,369 --> 01:45:23,390
it's there's little bits of breaks in

2397
01:45:21,619 --> 01:45:25,729
the sense where the basket that holds

2398
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:28,280
all the material inside like a giant

2399
01:45:25,729 --> 01:45:31,129
thousand liter unit it's got a hydraulic

2400
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:33,170
arm that lifts up the the basket with

2401
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:35,510
the with all the plant matter and ice

2402
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:37,369
cuz it's so heavy but you can literally

2403
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:39,770
have another one going right away and

2404
01:45:37,369 --> 01:45:43,579
have that thing mixing again in you know

2405
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:46,370
minutes I always knew the future would

2406
01:45:43,579 --> 01:45:48,529
continue this operation but you have to

2407
01:45:46,369 --> 01:45:51,559
have it so it produces the same quality

2408
01:45:48,529 --> 01:45:53,659
or better than that absolutely and

2409
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:55,460
that's not as hard with water extraction

2410
01:45:53,659 --> 01:45:57,199
as people think I know how people were

2411
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:58,579
always worried about running five gallon

2412
01:45:57,199 --> 01:46:00,139
batches and then they were like oh I'm

2413
01:45:58,579 --> 01:46:01,819
not getting the quality on the twenty

2414
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:03,590
but it's like there's simple parameters

2415
01:46:01,819 --> 01:46:06,380
to follow it shouldn't it shouldn't

2416
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:09,409
affect you that the process is is very

2417
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:10,940
simple you're freezing the wax membranes

2418
01:46:09,409 --> 01:46:12,649
you're making them brittle and then

2419
01:46:10,939 --> 01:46:15,769
you're mixing in a way that efficiently

2420
01:46:12,649 --> 01:46:17,299
knocks off the heads and allowing them

2421
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:17,980
to sink in the water and fall on the

2422
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:20,710
different screen

2423
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:22,000
so it's it's a pretty simple process in

2424
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:25,480
the sense I think that's why it caught

2425
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:28,420
on just a little over 20 years ago the

2426
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:31,719
actual it's actually exactly the same as

2427
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:34,329
your I sitting in that both dry sifting

2428
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:37,539
today is batch but I'm telling you the

2429
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:40,000
future will be continuous operation yes

2430
01:46:37,539 --> 01:46:47,529
absolutely streaming extraction using

2431
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:49,960
solvent what's that Mike extraction so

2432
01:46:47,529 --> 01:46:52,479
you can actually have like a middle

2433
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:55,600
flowers then through a tube with the

2434
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:58,449
screw and then ethanol or solvents or

2435
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:03,780
co2 sent through an opposite direction

2436
01:46:58,449 --> 01:47:03,779
that you can actually ten into seven

2437
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:12,550
okay I want to welcome the Dragonfly

2438
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:16,050

just different you know vitality xand

2454
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:14,710
different plants and strains and

2455
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:16,840
selecting with drains based off their

2456
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:18,970
resistance and and everything and I mean

2457
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:21,130
that's that's really what we're doing on

2458
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:23,409
our farm here just learning as much as

2459
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:26,500
we can from you know what the plant has

2460
01:48:23,409 --> 01:48:28,930
to teach us so here we are you know

2461
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:31,840
students of the plant yeah this year we

2462
01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:33,460
just started all seeds a whole lot of

2463
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:36,880
you know ones that we've been working on

2464
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:39,550
for like 25 years and adding new strains

2465
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:41,350
in there and just seeing what we get up

2466
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:42,640
here in the north and it was really it's

2467
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:44,740
been a phenomenal year we're really

2468
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:48,250
stoked we've been gifted seeds from the

2469
01:48:44,739 --> 01:48:50,619
Himalayas Himalayan connection and lot

2470
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:53,079
of creams given those a try we went to

2471
01:48:50,619 --> 01:48:55,239
Jamaica picked up some really beautiful

2472
01:48:53,079 --> 01:48:57,069
you know seeds out of Jamaica

2473
01:48:55,239 --> 01:49:01,300
that's a Moroccan strain we got some

2474
01:48:57,069 --> 01:49:04,239
Moroccan chef Shaolin strains going you

2475
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:05,699
know some Pakistani purples and then a

2476
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:09,579
whole list of you know

2477
01:49:05,699 --> 01:49:13,210
Hetty's from the west coast you know i

2478
01:49:09,579 --> 01:49:13,809
i'm i select super natural selections

2479
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,609
from Bodi

2480
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:17,950
we got lots of good bodis up here he's

2481

awesome we love him yeah and then all of

2482
01:49:17,949 --> 01:49:22,389
our old outdoor seeds from you know 29

2483
01:49:20,590 --> 01:49:24,460
years ago or something like that and

2484
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:26,770
we're still trying to breed in that to

2485
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:28,899
get early finishers that are just super

2486
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:32,590
fire do you remember the white grizzly

2487
01:49:28,899 --> 01:49:38,079
Marcus from back in the day the white

2488
01:49:32,590 --> 01:49:39,819
way back yeah yeah around crazy you know

2489
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:41,920
another one that I that I never have

2490
01:49:39,819 --> 01:49:44,759
seen but I remember from back then from

2491
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:48,430
the Kootenays in particular is the a1

2492
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:50,350
magenta if you ever hear about that

2493
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:51,700
cultivar Mensch drop that name to some

2494
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:54,250
of your old school buddies because

2495
01:49:51,699 --> 01:49:56,819
that's one to find it's just like it was

2496
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:56,819
so special

2497
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:03,759
came from number one that also

2498
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:06,760
throughout the magenta purple plants I'm

2499
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:09,010
not sure but I suspect it may very well

2500
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:12,579
it was a beautiful beautiful like

2501
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:14,829
silvery purple outdoor Kootenay cultivar

2502
01:50:12,579 --> 01:50:17,470
that was almost like like almost like

2503
01:50:14,829 --> 01:50:34,329
coffee when you put it in a jar and

2504
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:36,070
closed it up but like not quite yeah I

2505
01:50:34,329 --> 01:50:37,449
don't know it was our computer but you

2506
01:50:36,069 --> 01:50:43,479
kind of went out on that one so we

2507
01:50:37,449 --> 01:50:45,010
didn't hear that was that a Coast

2508
01:50:43,479 --> 01:50:48,250
cultivar

2509
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:49,719
Kootenays okay yeah we haven't seen that

2510
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:51,789
one we've been working a lot with some

2511
01:50:49,719 --> 01:50:54,340
hemp strains and getting some gorgeous

2512
01:50:51,789 --> 01:50:57,250
magenta pinks and purples in there and

2513
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:59,170
really trying to upper QED game your not

2514
01:50:57,250 --> 01:51:01,000
yours but we're gonna look for that

2515
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:02,859
magenta strain for sure you know yeah

2516
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,488
the holy the holy smokes culture shop

2517
01:51:02,859 --> 01:51:09,339
guys like Paul D or Destin or those guys

2518
01:51:06,488 --> 01:51:11,049
would probably remember and know it cuz

2519
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:13,510
it was it was through them that I saw it

2520
01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:17,500
originally and we still see those guys

2521
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:19,600
all the time yeah that was like 92 well

2522
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:23,198
you know that's a while ago now cuz

2523
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:30,190
they're still doing it yeah if the seeds

2524
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:32,948
you got from Morocco and from India from

2525
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:36,009
the Kulu Valley in that area if if

2526
01:51:32,948 --> 01:51:38,710
they're pure you're look for Morocco

2527
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:40,960
they're not pure there are no pure

2528
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:43,439
Moroccan land races left they're all

2529
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:47,279
hybridized with Western genetics and

2530
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:50,229
Manali it's pretty much the same story

2531
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:52,719
same thing in Jamaica they don't mind

2532
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:57,399
pure varieties there anymore it's hard

2533
01:51:52,719 --> 01:52:02,560
oh I totally agree with ya you can you

2534
01:51:57,399 --> 01:52:04,149
can see you can see that in the in the

2535
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,260
genetics for sure and I mean when we

2536
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:06,698
were going around Jamaica I mean that

2537
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:08,920
was the biggest thing I mean it was just

2538
01:52:06,698 --> 01:52:12,638
there all damn near all hybrids until

2539
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:15,219
until you get to the the seeds that are

2540
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:16,659
in like the food cupboard you know and

2541
01:52:15,219 --> 01:52:18,219
then you find oh what's this though I

2542
01:52:16,658 --> 01:52:21,638
don't know I guess the seeds from like

2543
01:52:18,219 --> 01:52:25,239
my auntie you know or my grandma and you

2544
01:52:21,639 --> 01:52:27,880
know till then there those are the ones

2545
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:30,729
that are like the super like 30 years

2546
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:32,500
old then you're in luck I mean really in

2547
01:52:30,729 --> 01:52:34,599
Jamaica it's like us there's this

2548
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:36,010
there's a main situation that you're

2549
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:39,280
looking for you're looking to go hang

2550
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:42,639
out with some old school like shanthi or

2551
01:52:39,279 --> 01:52:44,679
nyeh bengi like Rasta elder who's like

2552
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:47,980
super I tell lives in the bush doesn't

2553
01:52:44,679 --> 01:52:50,710
even have a house and that guy has the

2554
01:52:47,979 --> 01:52:52,868
sativa that's like you know twelve feet

2555
01:52:50,710 --> 01:52:54,399
tall that he's growing that those are

2556
01:52:52,868 --> 01:52:56,769
the seeds that you want to find from

2557
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:58,599
Jamaica if they're they're so rare that

2558
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:01,450
finding that guy

2559
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:04,470
could take weeks literally weeks of a

2560
01:53:01,449 --> 01:53:08,319
trip of just one spot so another yeah

2561
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:12,010
multiple trips multiple trips if you're

2562
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:13,779
not yeah you gotta earn that together it

2563
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:17,560
is very good cuz you got to do so much

2564
01:53:13,779 --> 01:53:21,969
drivings it is good it's good company to

2565
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:25,120
make give the prize to take when I did

2566
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:25,480
my seed collection in the 70s it wasn't

2567
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:27,970
better

2568
01:53:25,479 --> 01:53:30,129
there wasn't everybody was not taking

2569
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:32,710
seeds everywhere it was completely

2570
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:36,100
different and it started a little bit of

2571
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:39,100
Mexico but most every place else

2572
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:42,100
there was no pollution primarily what's

2573
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:44,770
polluting the rest of the universe's

2574
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:48,430
wildly drug varieties that just cranked

2575
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:52,330
out resin by the wazoo well we tend to

2576
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:57,060
like those ones what you don't in the

2577
01:53:52,329 --> 01:54:01,000
traditional area of heirloom varieties

2578
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:02,530
hi fetus I think it's the thing is is it

2579
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,760
kind of like when you're a kid and then

2580
01:54:02,529 --> 01:54:05,019
you're not a kid anymore and you're like

2581
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,460
oh I want to be a kid and it's like no

2582
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:08,470
those days are gone it's like that's

2583
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:10,149
kind of like it's this craziness of life

2584
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:12,610
where it's just like these little

2585
01:54:10,149 --> 01:54:13,329
snippets of like wow it'll never be like

2586
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:15,639
that again

2587
01:54:13,329 --> 01:54:18,039
oh wow it'll never be like that again oh

2588
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:20,380
wow and it just keeps happening and

2589
01:54:18,039 --> 01:54:22,390
going on yet at the same time I feel

2590
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:24,100
like I'm smoking great cultivars I feel

2591
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:26,289
like I'm enjoying the resin that I have

2592
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:29,110
the dry sift the bubble hash like I feel

2593
01:54:26,289 --> 01:54:30,909
like things are still pretty good I mean

2594
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:32,649
even when we went to Jamaica the first

2595
01:54:30,909 --> 01:54:33,819
time together Sam I can't remember what

2596
01:54:32,649 --> 01:54:36,189
year that was it must have been the

2597
01:54:33,819 --> 01:54:38,529
early 2000s obviously that was very

2598
01:54:36,189 --> 01:54:41,349
deeply wide leaf drug cultivar

2599
01:54:38,529 --> 01:54:44,609
contaminated by then we still made

2600
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:47,710
pillar hash do you remember that [ __ ] oh

2601
01:54:44,609 --> 01:54:50,319
absolutely it was actually you know very

2602
01:54:47,710 --> 01:54:52,810
wonderful and there was little to no

2603
01:54:50,319 --> 01:54:56,649
seeds at all in it was properly grown

2604
01:54:52,810 --> 01:55:00,280
and it was vastly majority what people

2605
01:54:56,649 --> 01:55:03,519
called sativa marilee no I really really

2606
01:55:00,279 --> 01:55:07,210
liked it and I thought mine was slightly

2607
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:10,480
better but I had no trouble smoke into

2608
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:12,519
the water hash absolutely I dry said

2609
01:55:10,479 --> 01:55:14,649
yours was slightly better

2610
01:55:12,519 --> 01:55:16,748
but I would say that the fact that we

2611
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:18,729
made hash that was almost on point with

2612
01:55:16,748 --> 01:55:27,340
your dry sift with a five-gallon bag of

2613
01:55:18,729 --> 01:55:30,129
bubble bags and some herb I I still get

2614
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:33,880
props yeah we made like announcement in

2615
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:35,889
like 20 minutes that's what's up these

2616
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:38,679
are my memories I'll never forget making

2617
01:55:35,889 --> 01:55:40,269
water hash with skunk man Sam in Jamaica

2618
01:55:38,679 --> 01:55:42,670
that's pretty awesome and even though

2619
01:55:40,269 --> 01:55:44,739
that even though the old drug cultivars

2620
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:46,269
are you know maybe gone and the purity

2621
01:55:44,738 --> 01:55:49,058
of the land races are gone and we know

2622
01:55:46,269 --> 01:55:51,730
that we're still pulling out a lot of

2623
01:55:49,059 --> 01:55:54,429
those you know old chemo types and

2624
01:55:51,729 --> 01:55:56,078
phenotypes you know out of those we

2625
01:55:54,429 --> 01:55:59,349
we've got plants right now that are like

2626
01:55:56,078 --> 01:56:01,509
easily 16 14 to 16 feet tall these

2627
01:55:59,349 --> 01:56:01,719
beautiful lanky they're like this right

2628
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:05,889
now

2629
01:56:01,719 --> 01:56:07,779
gorgeous yeah you know just because we

2630
01:56:05,889 --> 01:56:09,190
have to light them so that means they're

2631
01:56:07,779 --> 01:56:11,920
in a greenhouse which means they just

2632
01:56:09,189 --> 01:56:14,348
want to just go like a so it with our

2633
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:16,210
Moroccans we we definitely saw that they

2634
01:56:14,349 --> 01:56:19,119
were hybrid they definitely finished

2635
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:21,219
like outdoors here without any light you

2636
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:25,170
know manipulation which I wouldn't

2637
01:56:21,219 --> 01:56:28,239
expect from you know a local landfill is

2638
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:30,489
what they used to eat because you gotta

2639
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:32,529
remember the hash industry only came to

2640
01:56:30,488 --> 01:56:36,218
Morocco in the sixties in the early

2641
01:56:32,529 --> 01:56:38,649
sixties well I made you know me good

2642
01:56:36,219 --> 01:56:40,359
hash and it finished early some of the

2643
01:56:38,649 --> 01:56:42,129
mallanna's that we got there you can see

2644
01:56:40,359 --> 01:56:45,908
some of the hybrids but first sure we

2645
01:56:42,130 --> 01:56:47,859
got some that were just numbers and you

2646
01:56:45,908 --> 01:56:50,288
know they're they're crazy they're just

2647
01:56:47,859 --> 01:56:52,448
like serpents you know Jim I gotta ask

2648
01:56:50,288 --> 01:56:55,509
you Sam we had some cultivars that were

2649
01:56:52,448 --> 01:56:57,609
specifically from you know the the Kulu

2650
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:59,019
Valley that somebody had sent us and

2651
01:56:57,609 --> 01:57:00,578
there's just some things that I had

2652
01:56:59,019 --> 01:57:03,010
never seen before and I just wanted to

2653
01:57:00,578 --> 01:57:05,198
ask you so when the new leaves are

2654
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:08,320
coming out you know like the new growth

2655
01:57:05,198 --> 01:57:09,969
or coming out they're so thin that it

2656
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:12,788
almost looks like they're growing out

2657
01:57:09,969 --> 01:57:15,099
dying and then as soon as the leaf opens

2658
01:57:12,788 --> 01:57:18,729
up and it turns into a beautiful sativa

2659
01:57:15,099 --> 01:57:20,498
leaf but they're so like doing dainty it

2660
01:57:18,729 --> 01:57:21,819
almost looks like whoa what's going on

2661
01:57:20,498 --> 01:57:23,769
at this plant and then you realize that

2662
01:57:21,819 --> 01:57:25,210
it was all of the cultivars that we had

2663
01:57:23,769 --> 01:57:26,079
gotten from the same area that we're

2664
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:29,409
doing that

2665
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:32,619
you seen that yeah in the Himalayas it's

2666
01:57:29,409 --> 01:57:36,539
really common okay most most of the

2667
01:57:32,619 --> 01:57:40,529
cannabis cultivated in Manali Kulu and

2668
01:57:36,539 --> 01:57:44,380
parabati area around there but and even

2669
01:57:40,529 --> 01:57:49,000
well Kashmir they imported teens from

2670
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:51,909
Kent from Pakistan and Afghanistan but

2671
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,729
the further southward the area you're

2672
01:57:51,909 --> 01:57:57,189
talking about they they were Himalayan

2673
01:57:54,729 --> 01:58:02,319
varieties and that's what they used to

2674
01:57:57,189 --> 01:58:04,239
rub - and yes I did see what you're

2675
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:06,309
talking about yeah it's cool in the

2676
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:08,199
Moroccan you know just really dropped

2677
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:09,070
its leaves and just did like a crazy

2678
01:58:08,199 --> 01:58:11,470
molting

2679
01:58:09,069 --> 01:58:13,359
in a thing towards the end it was super

2680
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:15,460
interesting yeah is this as if the

2681
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:17,349
Moroccan was just like mulching itself

2682
01:58:15,460 --> 01:58:19,869
it went through three different cycles

2683
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:22,180
of all Sun leaves and it dropped all the

2684
01:58:19,869 --> 01:58:23,979
Sun leaves regrew them back dropped him

2685
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:26,320
and then regrew them back it was really

2686
01:58:23,979 --> 01:58:34,299
amazing and all of the the seeds that we

2687
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:37,569
had did that I've grown maybe a dozen

2688
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:41,380
Baraka varieties I never found any that

2689
01:58:37,569 --> 01:58:43,329
I thought was truly truly stellar but I

2690
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:48,190
have really really high critical

2691
01:58:43,329 --> 01:58:51,279
standards so the inter peas yes but just

2692
01:58:48,189 --> 01:58:54,669
plain brute force not especially in

2693
01:58:51,279 --> 01:58:57,039
regards to Morocco in the 60s would that

2694
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:59,800
have been the Nigerian Mustapha who came

2695
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:03,310
with the Lebanese screening technology

2696
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:04,779
he was out during the Algerian okay I

2697
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:06,310
like to I knew that you would know that

2698
01:59:04,779 --> 01:59:06,880
so that's something that people should

2699
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:10,210
know

2700
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:13,329
I mean problem stuff up it went to the

2701
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:15,640
farmer who he first worked with this was

2702
01:59:13,329 --> 01:59:19,119
in the sixties when all that was being

2703
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:21,010
grown was Keith Keith was huge and had

2704
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:23,409
been there for hundreds of years but

2705
01:59:21,010 --> 01:59:25,390
they were not hashish producers Mustafa

2706
01:59:23,409 --> 01:59:27,760
said hey you got all this marijuana or

2707
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:31,300
cannabis or whatever he called it and

2708
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:33,820
why don't you make a so he showed him

2709
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:38,949
how they started making it the first

2710
01:59:33,819 --> 01:59:39,909
time I got to Morocco was 71 and already

2711
01:59:38,949 --> 01:59:41,800
about ten

2712
01:59:39,909 --> 01:59:45,460
% of departments were throwing hash

2713
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:48,010
rather than just key because the main

2714
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:50,980
difference is keep as a domestic product

2715
01:59:48,010 --> 02:00:04,750
for Morocco hashish means you can make

2716
01:59:50,979 --> 02:00:08,559
cash through export cash equality at the

2717
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:14,560
time now that you vote me and Cuban on

2718
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:16,600
the cash eesh and it is true you know we

2719
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:19,680
try simple different types of varieties

2720
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:22,870
and the Moroccan dry citrus by far

2721
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:24,940
amazing I mean wow we weren't even doing

2722
02:00:22,869 --> 02:00:27,130
it when it was minus zero and it was

2723
02:00:24,939 --> 02:00:28,989
just falling off often beautiful

2724
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:32,680
terpenes and it has a really light

2725
02:00:28,989 --> 02:00:35,590
flavor kind of an uplifting lemony and

2726
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:38,500
beta carry a Fellini and really light

2727
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:41,980
white coloured you know dry sift really

2728
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:44,170
beautiful lovely well you know growing

2729
02:00:41,979 --> 02:00:46,509
cultivars for all that time and I you

2730
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:49,090
know I was never a fan of Moroccan it's

2731
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:51,460
not until a mutual friend of Sam's and

2732
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:54,400
and ours showed me Moroccan hash that I

2733
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:56,829
was actually like I was like what this

2734
02:00:54,399 --> 02:00:59,500
is Moroccan hash it was just so melty

2735
02:00:56,829 --> 02:01:01,329
and so beautiful it was unbelievable but

2736
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:04,420
to me Moroccan hash has always got this

2737
02:01:01,329 --> 02:01:05,829
sort of taste like Morocco that I just I

2738
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:07,329
guess because I didn't grow up really

2739
02:01:05,829 --> 02:01:10,840
with access to it we had access to

2740
02:01:07,329 --> 02:01:14,289
Afghani we had access to Lebanese we had

2741
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:16,449
access to Indian and Nepali which were

2742
02:01:14,289 --> 02:01:18,970
kind of my favourites but we never

2743
02:01:16,449 --> 02:01:31,479
really had that Moroccan coming through

2744
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:33,789
where I lived and my favourite school in

2745
02:01:31,479 --> 02:01:36,009
the early 90s and Southern Oregon late

2746
02:01:33,789 --> 02:01:40,479
80s it was called the gold-plated Black

2747
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:43,090
Widow hash and it was Lebanese super

2748
02:01:40,479 --> 02:01:46,299
thin light-colored and it was just like

2749
02:01:43,090 --> 02:01:48,520
crazy smelling awesome yeah we used to

2750
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:50,320
get this beautiful role of hashed and

2751
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:53,300
maybe Sam you've seen this before it was

2752
02:01:50,319 --> 02:01:56,000
called blonde Afghani hash

2753
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:58,579
and the woman who used to sell it to all

2754
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,189
of us college kids were she was really

2755
02:01:58,578 --> 02:02:03,558
old like probably in her 70s and she

2756
02:02:01,189 --> 02:02:05,839
would roll it out and measure it never

2757
02:02:03,559 --> 02:02:07,820
weigh it just the measurement of it was

2758
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:11,599
a perfect weight and it was in like a a

2759
02:02:07,819 --> 02:02:12,880
coil and that was amazing so cerebral

2760
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:16,130
I've never seen it since

2761
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:18,109
had it been a hand sifted it wasn't

2762
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:22,449
rubbed was it because you don't ever see

2763
02:02:18,109 --> 02:02:25,009
drug Afghan hash it's all dried to death

2764
02:02:22,448 --> 02:02:27,888
yeah you know it was it would definitely

2765
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:29,809
was hard enough that you know they made

2766
02:02:27,889 --> 02:02:31,760
it into a coil but when you cracked it

2767
02:02:29,809 --> 02:02:37,130
off it definitely cracked off more like

2768
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:39,170
a Keith good old hashish I remember

2769
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:41,900
getting like those quarter pounds in the

2770
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:44,989
white little bags from Lebanon with like

2771
02:02:41,899 --> 02:02:46,789
either red Lebanese or blond Lebanese I

2772
02:02:44,988 --> 02:02:48,289
guess they cut the field early they let

2773
02:02:46,789 --> 02:02:50,929
the field sit a little late you get

2774
02:02:48,289 --> 02:02:52,939
different colors in the resin but those

2775
02:02:50,929 --> 02:02:54,739
were always nice I felt like I was right

2776
02:02:52,939 --> 02:03:00,460
at the end of that you know that was in

2777
02:02:54,738 --> 02:03:00,459
the 80s towards the end of the 80s so

2778
02:03:00,578 --> 02:03:07,658
you could buy kilo of medium hash for

2779
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:11,210
five dollars a kilo

2780
02:03:07,658 --> 02:03:13,098
damn five bucks a kilo that's that's

2781
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:17,500
amazing that just puts a smile on my

2782
02:03:13,099 --> 02:03:17,500
face let's bring back five dollar kilos

2783
02:03:20,559 --> 02:03:25,279
are you kidding me Cuban was shaking his

2784
02:03:23,389 --> 02:03:30,380
head Thomas like what are you talking

2785
02:03:25,279 --> 02:03:32,658
about $5 kilos come on bubble man I also

2786
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:36,230
bought kilos of sinsemilla in the

2787
02:03:32,658 --> 02:03:42,679
mountains in South India would our have

2788
02:03:36,229 --> 02:03:45,649
been 73 74 7-5 around that time $3.50

2789
02:03:42,679 --> 02:03:47,199
completely seedless almost as good as

2790
02:03:45,649 --> 02:03:49,819
the best time you've ever had a

2791
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:56,348
completely different genetics and and

2792
02:03:49,819 --> 02:03:59,779
high but incredible incredible 350 kilo

2793
02:03:56,349 --> 02:04:02,599
$3.50 Jesus Christ I could listen to

2794
02:03:59,779 --> 02:04:05,029
stories like that all day tell me more

2795
02:04:02,599 --> 02:04:08,060
about the old school hash

2796
02:04:05,029 --> 02:04:12,739
well I used to pay a nickel they would

2797
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:14,630
put it on the back of the truck we used

2798
02:04:12,739 --> 02:04:20,000
to get the best stuff in Europe when I

2799
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:23,869
first got here was Turkish silver it was

2800
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:27,710
pressed really thin little slabs really

2801
02:04:23,869 --> 02:04:29,059
thin and it was almost when you broke it

2802
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:31,640
it was like mica

2803
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:34,310
you know how some really good hash when

2804
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:36,500
you press the dry set or even water

2805
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:39,680
Bosch and you break it when it's a

2806
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:46,340
little bit cold it'll almost chip like

2807
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:47,810
mica a faceted surface to it are you

2808
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:50,270
kidding me when I first started making

2809
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:52,550
bubble and didn't have the knowledge and

2810
02:04:50,270 --> 02:04:54,260
I'd have this like beautiful bubble I'd

2811
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:57,440
press it up in my fingers I'd get these

2812
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:59,390
hard little golden pucks and then I go

2813
02:04:57,439 --> 02:05:01,369
to break a piece off with my finger and

2814
02:04:59,390 --> 02:05:04,520
literally the thing would be so hard

2815
02:05:01,369 --> 02:05:06,710
that it would go up under my fingernail

2816
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:09,020
like it would literally I was jamming

2817
02:05:06,710 --> 02:05:10,609
chunks of hash under my fingernail and

2818
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:12,230
it happened a few times it's kind of

2819
02:05:10,609 --> 02:05:14,389
right up there with rubbing resin in

2820
02:05:12,229 --> 02:05:15,769
your eye you really try not to do it

2821
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:17,510
after you've done it a couple of times

2822
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:18,950
but every once in a while that would

2823
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:20,539
catch you off-guard and that yeah that

2824
02:05:18,949 --> 02:05:22,429
bubble has that turned like hard as a

2825
02:05:20,539 --> 02:05:24,380
rock but if you played with it it would

2826
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:26,000
soften up but if you were impatient and

2827
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:28,010
you tried to break it while playing with

2828
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,439
it it would still be hard and literally

2829
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:36,500
be like bamboo under the fingernails

2830
02:05:30,439 --> 02:05:39,769
have you ever broken a piece of mica not

2831
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:42,760
off the top of my head I can't think the

2832
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:48,200
Pioneers used to use for Windows

2833
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:52,430
those were the house covers mica

2834
02:05:48,199 --> 02:05:54,439
greenhouse covers hey the Romans used

2835
02:05:52,430 --> 02:05:58,240
mica to create some of the first

2836
02:05:54,439 --> 02:06:05,299
greenhouses oh cool I didn't know that

2837
02:05:58,239 --> 02:06:07,659
[ __ ] Romans hey that sounds amazing I

2838
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:09,710
bet you get some really beautiful

2839
02:06:07,659 --> 02:06:12,380
microclimates in that I've seen some

2840
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:14,000
really cool old pictures from Europe and

2841
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:16,639
stuff where they just build rock walls

2842
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,560
all over town like in the nether

2843
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:20,150
I'm sure you I've never been there so

2844
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:23,869
maybe it's you see it when you're there

2845
02:06:20,149 --> 02:06:25,939
but uh and then you know it could grow

2846
02:06:23,868 --> 02:06:28,219
peach trees all in them and stuff and

2847
02:06:25,939 --> 02:06:30,229
then I could only imagine with like you

2848
02:06:28,219 --> 02:06:32,210
know my collective mind or some kind of

2849
02:06:30,229 --> 02:06:35,349
reflective thing I mean I would imagine

2850
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:38,149
that would bring out like amazing light

2851
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:39,710
diffused turps and stuff that would come

2852
02:06:38,149 --> 02:06:42,559
out from the rock I would love to see

2853
02:06:39,710 --> 02:06:45,739
some obsidian greenhouses it's like

2854
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:49,219
Central Oregon like glass buttes kind of

2855
02:06:45,738 --> 02:06:51,859
like greenhouses let's work on that some

2856
02:06:49,219 --> 02:06:53,710
Wally penes with obsidian roofs that's

2857
02:06:51,859 --> 02:06:57,559
what I'm talking about that's the next

2858
02:06:53,710 --> 02:07:00,710
night cliff idles the Pioneers used mica

2859
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:03,560
because glass was too expensive for them

2860
02:07:00,710 --> 02:07:06,139
and it was hard in the old 100 few

2861
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:09,380
hundred years ago to produce large flat

2862
02:07:06,139 --> 02:07:12,770
pieces of glass for as mica you could

2863
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:15,679
get you know at least a page paper size

2864
02:07:12,770 --> 02:07:21,590
mica and then you know put it in a frame

2865
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:24,199
and make Windows up sounds really

2866
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:29,500
amazing we have a lot of mica in this

2867
02:07:24,198 --> 02:07:29,500
area Darin and handled wrong

2868
02:07:34,578 --> 02:07:39,259
yeah I don't know if I'm still on but

2869
02:07:37,399 --> 02:07:42,469
yeah it would be cool to make a hole

2870
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:44,119
back like wall out of Micah - cuz it

2871
02:07:42,469 --> 02:07:46,639
would reflect and stuff we don't have

2872
02:07:44,118 --> 02:07:50,988
like clear micah around there lots Iraq

2873
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:53,150
my cousin's really cool yeah I'm talking

2874
02:07:50,988 --> 02:07:56,779
about kids is clearance it's like

2875
02:07:53,149 --> 02:07:59,029
beautiful windows not reflection and the

2876
02:07:56,779 --> 02:08:05,359
pioneer choose to use it because they

2877
02:07:59,029 --> 02:08:07,789
get it that's probably the good way to

2878
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:11,679
decide it's accessible we can get it

2879
02:08:07,789 --> 02:08:15,170
let's use it it's gonna be my windows

2880
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:18,170
from hash to mica from mica back to hash

2881
02:08:15,170 --> 02:08:24,469
anyone want a puff a little Bowl maybe a

2882
02:08:18,170 --> 02:08:28,099
little Terp dip I want to offer up I

2883
02:08:24,469 --> 02:08:32,599
made a trip to show Sasha when back in

2884
02:08:28,099 --> 02:08:35,929
2001 and found the hashish very nice

2885
02:08:32,599 --> 02:08:42,440
there especially as compared to what was

2886
02:08:35,929 --> 02:08:43,849
available in Tangier and in Spain you

2887
02:08:42,439 --> 02:08:46,448
could find good Moroccan but it was

2888
02:08:43,849 --> 02:08:49,819
considerably more expensive than what

2889
02:08:46,448 --> 02:08:51,348
the little town of Shoshone is there's

2890
02:08:49,819 --> 02:08:54,590
about three thousand people that live

2891
02:08:51,349 --> 02:08:57,650
inside the town and yeah good hashish

2892
02:08:54,590 --> 02:09:01,039
was really easy to find back in 2001

2893
02:08:57,649 --> 02:09:04,399
there's my offering also I wanted total

2894
02:09:01,039 --> 02:09:08,179
change of subject I think it was Eric

2895
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:11,388
who put the thought in my head that

2896
02:09:08,179 --> 02:09:14,569
instead of calling the black market the

2897
02:09:11,389 --> 02:09:17,840
unregulated market he suggested that we

2898
02:09:14,569 --> 02:09:20,269
start calling it the free market in fact

2899
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:23,360
it's what cannabis looks like when

2900
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:25,340
there's no regulations and it's either

2901
02:09:23,359 --> 02:09:28,609
the free market or the regulated market

2902
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:31,309
not the black market I like it me too on

2903
02:09:28,609 --> 02:09:33,710
one level it sounds really good to be

2904
02:09:31,309 --> 02:09:37,130
able to do that on another level I just

2905
02:09:33,710 --> 02:09:39,230
remember what you know unregulated

2906
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:42,469
cannabis when we first started testing

2907
02:09:39,229 --> 02:09:45,618
it 70% of it came up spraying this

2908
02:09:42,469 --> 02:09:48,498
poison yeah I'm mostly just talking

2909
02:09:45,618 --> 02:09:51,198
about changing the languaging of it

2910
02:09:48,498 --> 02:09:52,998
I'm in favor of testing as you know for

2911
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:55,518
medical need you really know need to

2912
02:09:52,998 --> 02:09:59,029
know what's in your concentrates but uh

2913
02:09:55,519 --> 02:10:01,820
just in terms of political strategy if

2914
02:09:59,029 --> 02:10:03,259
you will I really want to start pushing

2915
02:10:01,819 --> 02:10:06,049
the idea particularly here in America

2916
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:09,559
free-market is kind of a catch phrase

2917
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:13,880
for a lot of people in politics and I

2918
02:10:09,559 --> 02:10:16,130
think it's a good use of that term yeah

2919
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:18,498
it's not the black market it's the free

2920
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:20,359
market yeah you gotta have you gotta

2921
02:10:18,498 --> 02:10:23,139
have some sort of regulations or you'll

2922
02:10:20,359 --> 02:10:26,509
end up with some Labrador in your [ __ ]

2923
02:10:23,139 --> 02:10:28,219
remember that someone said it in the in

2924
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:29,689
the room so I had to I had to say it

2925
02:10:28,219 --> 02:10:33,019
I should shout them out because it was

2926
02:10:29,689 --> 02:10:38,300
scone of bark it's got some Labrador in

2927
02:10:33,019 --> 02:10:40,458
it classic Cheech and Chong [ __ ] exactly

2928
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:43,010
laughter [ __ ] yeah I think it's got some

2929
02:10:40,458 --> 02:10:45,288
Labrador that's some classic funny

2930
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:48,800
ridiculous [ __ ] I don't care who you are

2931
02:10:45,288 --> 02:10:50,719
got to appreciate that they had their

2932
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:53,748

2937
02:10:59,958 --> 02:11:04,158

2938
02:11:01,668 --> 02:11:06,260

I made really really awesome to connect

2941
02:11:08,658 --> 02:11:12,859
on this Sunday morning and the rest of

2942
02:11:10,189 --> 02:11:15,918
you though right back at you I feel the

2943
02:11:12,859 --> 02:11:18,679
love and I look forward to hearing from

2944
02:11:15,918 --> 02:11:20,389
you and I and I do like that free market

2945
02:11:18,679 --> 02:11:23,208
thing I think that it's important you

2946
02:11:20,389 --> 02:11:25,368
know I'm not saying you know free to do

2947
02:11:23,208 --> 02:11:28,519
and grow however you want if it's toxic

2948
02:11:25,368 --> 02:11:30,529
but you know a free market for you know

2949
02:11:28,519 --> 02:11:32,510
that that's that's what brought it here

2950
02:11:30,529 --> 02:11:34,550
you know and it's not necessarily that

2951
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:36,439
regulations are gonna stop people and

2952
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:38,809
grow and wrap either it's a

2953
02:11:36,439 --> 02:11:40,340
consciousness you know and I feel like

2954
02:11:38,809 --> 02:11:42,139
that's really important there's so many

2955
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:44,150
people that are really I've seen

2956
02:11:42,139 --> 02:11:46,400
stepping up to the plate and bringing

2957
02:11:44,149 --> 02:11:48,288
their cultivation practices forward and

2958
02:11:46,399 --> 02:11:49,668
really saying hey you know this is the

2959
02:11:48,288 --> 02:11:53,029
way that I've been doing it since you

2960
02:11:49,668 --> 02:11:54,708
know 64 68 and and then teaching the

2961
02:11:53,029 --> 02:11:56,898
rest of the community that way and they

2962
02:11:54,708 --> 02:11:59,090
came from the free market and you know

2963
02:11:56,899 --> 02:12:00,650
they did it you know within beautiful

2964
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:02,930
integrity from the beginning

2965
02:12:00,649 --> 02:12:05,569
and you know and it's kind of calling it

2966
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:08,720
out like it is I mean and in this time

2967
02:12:05,569 --> 02:12:11,119
of transformation and to regulation it's

2968
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:14,329
kind of like extreme take over it's

2969
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:16,279
almost like a you know reality show you

2970
02:12:14,329 --> 02:12:17,750
know or it's called it's dream take over

2971
02:12:16,279 --> 02:12:21,050
and and they've taken over the whole

2972
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:23,119
entire industry with these mind-blowing

2973
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:25,010
regulations that just change all the

2974
02:12:23,119 --> 02:12:28,189
time and you know we talked to farms

2975
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:30,140
with our pure certification often and we

2976
02:12:28,189 --> 02:12:31,879
hear stories of years you know we just

2977
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:34,430
talked to some beautiful people you know

2978
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:37,220
yesterday and in Mendocino and it's

2979
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:39,230
taken three years to get you know their

2980
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:40,940
their registration and stuff and and

2981
02:12:39,229 --> 02:12:43,939
there's not a lot of freedom in that you

2982
02:12:40,939 --> 02:12:46,009
know it's not a lot of but it's fine and

2983
02:12:43,939 --> 02:12:47,899
we'll play and we want to be able to

2984
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:50,449
move forward into the future and have

2985
02:12:47,899 --> 02:12:52,699
safety and regulations at all it all is

2986
02:12:50,449 --> 02:12:54,649
what it is but it's it's it's important

2987
02:12:52,699 --> 02:12:57,559
I I believe that it's really important

2988
02:12:54,649 --> 02:13:00,289
you know some of us the cannabis culture

2989
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:03,830
is the only culture that we have we've

2990
02:13:00,289 --> 02:13:06,350
lost so much of our culture and I you

2991
02:13:03,829 --> 02:13:08,269
know identify myself as somebody who's

2992
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:10,940
part of the cannabis culture and and

2993
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:14,210
part of not only that movement but also

2994
02:13:10,939 --> 02:13:16,129
you know it's a family of people and I

2995
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:18,260
believe you know with the regulations

2996
02:13:16,130 --> 02:13:20,150
and you know all this corporate cannabis

2997
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:22,760
a lot of that culture is going to be

2998
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:25,369
lost so I think it's really important

2999
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:26,869
that you know the free market and the

3000
02:13:25,369 --> 02:13:29,000
elders and the people that have brought

3001
02:13:26,869 --> 02:13:32,059
this plant forward continue with the

3002
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:35,510
culture because the culture is what you

3003
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:37,760
know has given cannabis you know all of

3004
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:39,829
the medicinals that it has given us in

3005
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:42,079
our own culture as well as our free

3006
02:13:39,829 --> 02:13:43,699
thought and I mean I could go on and on

3007
02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:46,600
with the gifts that it's given us

3008
02:13:43,699 --> 02:13:48,889
well the culture is going to change

3009
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:50,990
guaranteed so I hear what you're saying

3010
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:53,630
in the sense of protecting the roots of

3011
02:13:50,989 --> 02:13:55,429
the culture but it's it's interesting

3012
02:13:53,630 --> 02:13:58,520
too because the culture has always been

3013
02:13:55,430 --> 02:14:00,020
sort of like almost in a closet really

3014
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:01,760
like literally like whether you're

3015
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:03,470
growing it or smoking it like people

3016
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:05,390
have always you know not the people on

3017
02:14:03,470 --> 02:14:06,980
this panel we're very out with it and

3018
02:14:05,390 --> 02:14:08,930
very you know we're the proponents and

3019
02:14:06,979 --> 02:14:11,209
the voices of the promotion of this

3020
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:12,800
plant but there's so many people that

3021
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:14,239
have an appreciation for this planet

3022
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:15,860
that are more like don't

3023
02:14:14,239 --> 02:14:18,349
want people to know they haven't really

3024
02:14:15,859 --> 02:14:29,210
grabbed the cannabis horn by the reins

3025
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:31,400
they have is happening white ating

3026
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:32,960
towards these growing jobs and all these

3027
02:14:31,399 --> 02:14:34,489
different jobs in the cannabis community

3028
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:37,880
and wanting to be involved starting

3029
02:14:34,489 --> 02:14:43,210
their own brands etc etc it's it's it's

3030
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:45,350
almost like the the immigrants you know

3031
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:47,359
patriot argument like where you have

3032
02:14:45,350 --> 02:14:48,260
your person who's from that country but

3033
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:49,549
then they're like they don't want

3034
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:51,079
immigrants coming to their country

3035
02:14:49,550 --> 02:14:52,220
because they took guard jobs and it's

3036
02:14:51,079 --> 02:14:53,479
the same sort of thing with this

3037
02:14:52,220 --> 02:14:55,460
cannabis industry that you have all

3038
02:14:53,479 --> 02:14:57,259
these new people and you know the

3039
02:14:55,460 --> 02:14:59,029
cannabis industry for the whole time

3040
02:14:57,260 --> 02:15:00,980
I've been involved has been like let us

3041
02:14:59,029 --> 02:15:02,659
be normal let us be normal let us just

3042
02:15:00,979 --> 02:15:04,879
be a part of all the other systems let's

3043
02:15:02,659 --> 02:15:06,649
let this just happen let this not like

3044
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:08,690
don't stop kickin our doors and stop

3045
02:15:06,649 --> 02:15:10,279
taking our kids away just let this

3046
02:15:08,689 --> 02:15:11,689
happen and then all of a sudden they

3047
02:15:10,279 --> 02:15:13,399
listened and it was like okay let it

3048
02:15:11,689 --> 02:15:14,839
happen we're gonna let it happen and now

3049
02:15:13,399 --> 02:15:16,489
that now they do it the way they do

3050
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:19,369
everything which is over regulated

3051
02:15:16,489 --> 02:15:21,380
control it and [ __ ] tax it and now

3052
02:15:19,369 --> 02:15:23,000
people are like oh my god I can't

3053
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:24,800
believe they're doing this well it's

3054
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,989
attracting a whole different group on

3055
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:29,630
one side I hate the regulations I hate

3056
02:15:26,989 --> 02:15:31,909
you know I like that things that people

3057
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:33,920
consumers are protected via certain

3058
02:15:31,909 --> 02:15:36,079
regulations I think treating cannabis

3059
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:37,730
like plutonium with biometric scanners

3060
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:40,699
to get into vaults at a three-foot thick

3061
02:15:37,729 --> 02:15:42,919
is absurd and ridiculous and cannabis

3062
02:15:40,699 --> 02:15:45,439
doesn't need to be people don't need to

3063
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:47,000
be protected from cannabis therefore

3064
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:48,619
like a simple fence in the security

3065
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,960
system is more than enough it shouldn't

3066
02:15:48,619 --> 02:15:52,579
have to be treated like plutonium but

3067
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:55,100
the main point on what I was saying was

3068
02:15:52,579 --> 02:15:56,600
now with our community the way you know

3069
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:58,280
we had this roots community I almost

3070
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:00,289
feel like if you were back in the day at

3071
02:15:58,279 --> 02:16:03,170
the old cannabis cups in Amsterdam like

3072
02:16:00,289 --> 02:16:05,029
that was that was originally what I kind

3073
02:16:03,170 --> 02:16:06,680
of knew is the cannabis community the

3074
02:16:05,029 --> 02:16:08,389
core cannabis community I knew there

3075
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:10,250
were many other groups all around the

3076
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:11,810
world that connected to that to that

3077
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:13,880
group not everyone could make it but

3078
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:15,710
that was this group and they met every

3079
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:17,480
year they flew from all over the world

3080
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:19,460
and they came and they congregated and

3081
02:16:17,479 --> 02:16:23,659
they met and they smoked and they you

3082
02:16:19,460 --> 02:16:25,789
know it's created together now you have

3083
02:16:23,659 --> 02:16:27,920
this whole other group of people that

3084
02:16:25,789 --> 02:16:29,988
aren't from necessarily that

3085
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:31,279
culture there they have there from all

3086
02:16:29,988 --> 02:16:33,468
these other different cultures and

3087
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:35,269
they're coming in much like it's a

3088
02:16:33,468 --> 02:16:36,739
Canada in the sense that everyone's

3089
02:16:35,269 --> 02:16:38,450
welcome it's like yeah it's the canvas

3090
02:16:36,739 --> 02:16:40,099
plant like of course you're welcome pick

3091
02:16:38,450 --> 02:16:43,010
it up do it do something great with it

3092
02:16:40,099 --> 02:16:45,620
like bring bring something new to to the

3093
02:16:43,010 --> 02:16:48,079
people grow great cannabis make great

3094
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:50,030
extracts and you have so many people

3095
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:51,769
involved that it's hard for the people

3096
02:16:50,030 --> 02:16:54,590
who are at the core of it for so many

3097
02:16:51,769 --> 02:16:56,510
years to not feel threatened by what's

3098
02:16:54,590 --> 02:17:00,069
happening because suddenly you know your

3099
02:16:56,510 --> 02:17:02,780
private game has become very public and

3100
02:17:00,069 --> 02:17:05,029
and everyone can play and it was a lot

3101
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:06,920
easier and I'll say this in a sense that

3102
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:09,920
you know the smaller the number of

3103
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:13,489
people the easier to compete is when you

3104
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:16,610
bring in like large numbers it's like

3105
02:17:13,489 --> 02:17:18,500
whoo the exponential difficulties of

3106
02:17:16,610 --> 02:17:20,329
that when suddenly people who you're

3107
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:22,280
like they may have not been doing it for

3108
02:17:20,329 --> 02:17:24,379
the last 25 years but you know maybe

3109
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:26,360
their plant biologists or agricultural

3110
02:17:24,379 --> 02:17:28,819
students and they come in and absolutely

3111
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:30,530
just crush it I've seen it I've seen

3112
02:17:28,819 --> 02:17:32,808
people that have never made hash in

3113
02:17:30,530 --> 02:17:35,300
their life take the bags put their own

3114
02:17:32,808 --> 02:17:38,629
herb that they grew into the bags and

3115
02:17:35,299 --> 02:17:41,239
come out with basically hash on anyone's

3116
02:17:38,629 --> 02:17:43,609
level like what I call the nicest hash

3117
02:17:41,239 --> 02:17:45,829
basically that you can make in the world

3118
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:49,159
whether it's some skunk man Sam hash or

3119
02:17:45,829 --> 02:17:50,569
some Cuban grower or whoever it's as

3120
02:17:49,159 --> 02:17:53,478
nice as it gets once you get to that

3121
02:17:50,569 --> 02:17:58,099
level it's as nice as it gets and that's

3122
02:17:53,478 --> 02:18:00,859
uh it's true I think that what you're

3123
02:17:58,099 --> 02:18:02,929
saying is really it is sort of true and

3124
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:05,510
you know you can look at it as the

3125
02:18:02,929 --> 02:18:07,250
cannabis culture is worldwide you know

3126
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:09,170
no matter where you go in the world you

3127
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:10,819
can find people and they may not look

3128
02:18:09,170 --> 02:18:12,649
like you and they may not speak the same

3129
02:18:10,819 --> 02:18:14,989
language at you as you but you still

3130
02:18:12,649 --> 02:18:17,539
have this love and this sharing of

3131
02:18:14,989 --> 02:18:19,579
cannabis and I believe that that's also

3132
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:21,860
part of the cannabis culture you know it

3133
02:18:19,579 --> 02:18:23,058
is worldwide it's a love of cannabis it

3134
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:25,400
doesn't mean that you have to cultivate

3135
02:18:23,058 --> 02:18:29,239
the cannabis it doesn't mean that you

3136
02:18:25,399 --> 02:18:31,099
have to grow it or or or make hash or be

3137
02:18:29,239 --> 02:18:33,289
around it all the time it's just it's a

3138
02:18:31,099 --> 02:18:35,540
love for it and it's a true respect for

3139
02:18:33,290 --> 02:18:37,820
it and when I talk about you know the

3140
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:40,130
culture of cannabis it's it's a respect

3141
02:18:37,819 --> 02:18:41,869
for cannabis and I do believe that there

3142
02:18:40,129 --> 02:18:44,329
are corporate entities that do may

3143
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:46,400
have an unbelievable respect for

3144
02:18:44,329 --> 02:18:48,530
cannabis but I think when I talk about

3145
02:18:46,399 --> 02:18:51,109
the culture of cannabis it's it's the

3146
02:18:48,530 --> 02:18:53,480
respect for not necessarily being a part

3147
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:55,579
of you know group of people or certain

3148
02:18:53,479 --> 02:18:57,799
group of people and and you can't live

3149
02:18:55,579 --> 02:19:00,170
in the past in the sense like you know

3150
02:18:57,799 --> 02:19:02,000
is it's never gonna be what it was you

3151
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:06,200
know and and maybe we can look at it

3152
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:09,379
like I remember now I remember what it

3153
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:12,079
was like now in 2018 you know and maybe

3154
02:19:09,379 --> 02:19:14,179
in my 2028 like who the hell knows what

3155
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:16,190
we're looking at then so I mean it

3156
02:19:14,179 --> 02:19:18,799
that's part of like to enjoy the the

3157
02:19:16,190 --> 02:19:20,569
journey and like here we are you know we

3158
02:19:18,799 --> 02:19:23,000
have these crazy regulations it's um

3159
02:19:20,569 --> 02:19:25,699
it's kind of like harsh but you know

3160
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,319
part of our pure certification and the

3161
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:30,320
group of farmers that we're working with

3162
02:19:27,319 --> 02:19:33,379
you know we've worked really hard to

3163
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:36,500
keep a quality from that generation

3164
02:19:33,379 --> 02:19:38,869
before and all of our ancestors to keep

3165
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:40,670
that quality moving forward you know

3166
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:43,250
within this new regulated market is

3167
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:45,860
extremely important to us and you know

3168
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:47,360
Big Love to you know the the pure

3169
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:50,569
farmers out there that are doing in our

3170
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:53,420
and also I think that in a part of the

3171
02:19:50,569 --> 02:19:55,250
culture had a responsibility to help

3172
02:19:53,420 --> 02:19:58,129
teach the people who are just stepping

3173
02:19:55,250 --> 02:20:00,170
into the industry you know how to have

3174
02:19:58,129 --> 02:20:02,449
respect everybody's invited

3175
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:04,879
it is not exclusionary if you love

3176
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:06,409
cannabis you can be part of the cannabis

3177
02:20:04,879 --> 02:20:08,689
culture and I think that it's up to us

3178
02:20:06,409 --> 02:20:11,060
to really share what it has meant for us

3179
02:20:08,690 --> 02:20:12,890
to be a part of the free market and to

3180
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:14,601
be to bring the respectful part of

3181
02:20:12,889 --> 02:20:16,639
cannabis forward and we would like to

3182
02:20:14,601 --> 02:20:18,710
you know give special love to heart Rock

3183
02:20:16,639 --> 02:20:20,840
Mountain who just came on and and

3184
02:20:18,709 --> 02:20:23,149
they're really amazing and check them

3185
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:25,430
out online I mean they're 50 years of

3186
02:20:23,149 --> 02:20:28,729
cultivation with the whole family there

3187
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:31,120
and they're in Mendocino and they're you

3188
02:20:28,729 --> 02:20:34,159
know moving forward in this new paradigm

3189
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:36,110
keeping family alive keeping culture

3190
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:38,780
alive keeping this cannabis alive

3191
02:20:36,110 --> 02:20:41,510
breeding moving in the moving forward

3192
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:43,430
and I'm really just really stoked to see

3193
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:45,409
this group grow and be a part of the

3194
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:51,351
future so it's not just a pharmaceutical

3195
02:20:45,409 --> 02:20:52,940
style it's funny absolutely but I think

3196
02:20:51,351 --> 02:20:55,579
of the free market

3197
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:58,100
I think of Oregon

3198
02:20:55,579 --> 02:21:02,780
for the prices are so cheap it almost is

3199
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:04,568
for free in the market yeah that's

3200
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:08,800
unbelievable

3201
02:21:04,568 --> 02:21:15,049
no Oregon farmer was laughing at that

3202
02:21:08,799 --> 02:21:17,420
humor I have a question for Sam how long

3203
02:21:15,049 --> 02:21:20,509
do you think how many generations or

3204
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:24,500
years do you think it would take for an

3205
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:28,420
acclimatized cultivar to become a land

3206
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:33,799
race in a place like Humboldt County or

3207
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:35,898
or British Columbia I mean these land

3208
02:21:33,799 --> 02:21:39,978
races obviously part of their stability

3209
02:21:35,898 --> 02:21:41,449
is for maybe thousands of years the

3210
02:21:39,978 --> 02:21:43,969
plants were just breeding amongst

3211
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:46,130
themselves right in an area and the ones

3212
02:21:43,969 --> 02:21:47,659
that were flourishing were the ones that

3213
02:21:46,129 --> 02:21:49,159
did well in that environment this is

3214
02:21:47,659 --> 02:21:51,469
something you've talked about before Sam

3215
02:21:49,159 --> 02:21:54,340
I just wonder how long would how many

3216
02:21:51,469 --> 02:21:58,608
generations would it take for a

3217
02:21:54,340 --> 02:22:01,549
stabilized seed line to be that was

3218
02:21:58,609 --> 02:22:03,739
acclimatized in a climate area that was

3219
02:22:01,549 --> 02:22:09,279
widely spread to become a land race how

3220
02:22:03,739 --> 02:22:12,170
would that work what has to happen is

3221
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:18,200
there has to be enough generations that

3222
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:22,068
any of the more off or different ends of

3223
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:24,950
the of the gene pool are basically more

3224
02:22:22,068 --> 02:22:28,689
eliminated and what you have left are

3225
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:32,210
slight variations of the same song and

3226
02:22:28,689 --> 02:22:35,568
that bat can take you know thousands of

3227
02:22:32,209 --> 02:22:39,139
years or it can be done actually in a

3228
02:22:35,568 --> 02:22:43,639
few hundred probably if a decade but

3229
02:22:39,139 --> 02:22:47,139
people with human selection if they pay

3230
02:22:43,639 --> 02:22:50,629
very close attention to the plants and

3231
02:22:47,139 --> 02:22:52,459
import materials into that area which

3232
02:22:50,629 --> 02:22:55,059
are consistent with the environmental

3233
02:22:52,459 --> 02:22:55,059
conditions

3234
02:22:55,659 --> 02:23:03,060
I just noticed that there's no set

3235
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:05,739
amount it's really up to the specific

3236
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:08,890
Eric for example if you want something

3237
02:23:05,739 --> 02:23:12,130
bro up in Alaska and become a land race

3238
02:23:08,890 --> 02:23:14,560
there I would take good luck and lean

3239
02:23:12,130 --> 02:23:19,180
towards really really early varieties to

3240
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:24,279
do this I just noticed that Sam has a

3241
02:23:19,181 --> 02:23:25,140
apex vaporizer on his lap from bird the

3242
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:28,391
bird is the word

3243
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:31,001
and if you look really really closely at

3244
02:23:28,390 --> 02:23:34,501
its face it sounds face he's totally

3245
02:23:31,001 --> 02:23:36,431
totally spaced down on it

3246
02:23:34,501 --> 02:23:42,271
he looks baked

3247
02:23:36,431 --> 02:23:47,739
oh god I'm exhausted tired tired I

3248
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:50,110
wanted to bring up some cool stuff that

3249
02:23:47,739 --> 02:23:53,890
I guess is popping on Instagram with the

3250
02:23:50,110 --> 02:23:58,360
rosin the sauce I don't know if you've

3251
02:23:53,890 --> 02:24:00,819
have you seen that diet funk put it out

3252
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:02,980
there and I started seeing a lot of I

3253
02:24:00,819 --> 02:24:05,140
don't I don't produce much anymore you

3254
02:24:02,979 --> 02:24:06,850
know I make edits - here and there but

3255
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:08,850
the people that are producing I get to

3256
02:24:06,851 --> 02:24:13,391
see what they're doing and they're

3257
02:24:08,851 --> 02:24:16,360
effectively separating the Terp layer

3258
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:19,600
from the THC without a second press

3259
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:21,521
using like a jar and creating a head

3260
02:24:19,601 --> 02:24:24,280
pressure with just the terpenes it's

3261
02:24:21,521 --> 02:24:26,950
slight heat and over time it'll separate

3262
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:31,601
and some people are getting like pretty

3263
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:33,400
awesome crystal formations that are more

3264
02:24:31,601 --> 02:24:37,870
than just like what the apple sauce was

3265
02:24:33,399 --> 02:24:39,989
with the BHO and diamonds I think it's

3266
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:45,541
it's wonderful it's just like one step

3267
02:24:39,989 --> 02:24:48,280
closer to what non-solvent can do versus

3268
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:52,149
hydrocarbon like I always I thought that

3269
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:54,070
may be the pinnacle of a oil extraction

3270
02:24:52,149 --> 02:24:56,831
was being able to separate and create

3271
02:24:54,069 --> 02:24:59,290
like that of that sauce with the a lot

3272
02:24:56,831 --> 02:25:02,110
of the BHO guys was making but to see

3273
02:24:59,290 --> 02:25:04,920
high quality 90 micron being pressed out

3274
02:25:02,110 --> 02:25:07,001
and then that being separated and

3275
02:25:04,921 --> 02:25:09,431
looking like it's getting close to that

3276
02:25:07,001 --> 02:25:11,229
level to me I think that's

3277
02:25:09,431 --> 02:25:13,121
and I don't know what your thoughts were

3278
02:25:11,229 --> 02:25:15,251
on it I know that you've been pressing a

3279
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,470
lot of Raza get to play only things that

3280
02:25:15,251 --> 02:25:19,899
I would be concerned about is does it

3281
02:25:17,470 --> 02:25:21,850
lower the terpene content of what you're

3282
02:25:19,899 --> 02:25:24,431
smoking if you're only smoking the

3283
02:25:21,851 --> 02:25:26,681
diamonds or the pearls of a caviar

3284
02:25:24,431 --> 02:25:29,771
whatever you call it it's crystallizing

3285
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:33,011
out does that mean that the terpenes are

3286
02:25:29,771 --> 02:25:34,961
free liquid and you're not consuming the

3287
02:25:33,011 --> 02:25:40,810
terpenes of the same ratios it came to

3288
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:43,720
the earth although those THC 8088

3289
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:46,710
diamonds usually typically have between

3290
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:49,569
5 to 10% terpenes in them so they're

3291
02:25:46,710 --> 02:25:53,130
infused with terpenes just dripping with

3292
02:25:49,569 --> 02:25:57,761
them and yeah you definitely get a full

3293
02:25:53,130 --> 02:26:00,010
entourage effect so from my observation

3294
02:25:57,761 --> 02:26:04,751
your premise if you're pressing that and

3295
02:26:00,011 --> 02:26:08,291
you're getting 10 grams of THC and one

3296
02:26:04,751 --> 02:26:11,351
gram or two rounds of terpenes when you

3297
02:26:08,290 --> 02:26:14,290
press it and then it separates out that

3298
02:26:11,351 --> 02:26:16,751
means there's now less terpene in the

3299
02:26:14,290 --> 02:26:22,109
ratio than there was when it started

3300
02:26:16,751 --> 02:26:22,110
no denying it Sam you would like okay uh

3301
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:30,570
and I think so now turkey from the beans

3302
02:26:28,469 --> 02:26:32,670
back on the THC a and smoke it

3303
02:26:30,569 --> 02:26:35,100
I think it looks beautiful and it's

3304
02:26:32,670 --> 02:26:38,159
pretty cool and I've smoked it and it's

3305
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:41,460
it's definitely it's different it's not

3306
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:44,219
the exact same eye the one thing I would

3307
02:26:41,459 --> 02:26:46,739
say is and Mark you could correct me if

3308
02:26:44,219 --> 02:26:48,329
I'm wrong but although it's a solvent

3309
02:26:46,739 --> 02:26:50,010
'less thing it is still using

3310
02:26:48,329 --> 02:26:53,190
hydrocarbons to produce that effect

3311
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:56,478
which is the terpenes within the profile

3312
02:26:53,190 --> 02:27:00,450
that's creating that separation correct

3313
02:26:56,478 --> 02:27:01,228
well okay go ahead no no sorry I'm sorry

3314
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:03,720
I'm going to good

3315
02:27:01,228 --> 02:27:07,949
I was just going to say with um with

3316
02:27:03,719 --> 02:27:10,199
butane so the key to you know sauce

3317
02:27:07,950 --> 02:27:12,930
production or trying to get that as

3318
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:19,290
first of all using fresh frozen material

3319
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:21,239
so you can't normally make live resin or

3320
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:24,330
you can't normally make it from live

3321
02:27:21,239 --> 02:27:27,059
resin the live resin is typically always

3322
02:27:24,329 --> 02:27:30,690
from fresh material and fresh material

3323
02:27:27,059 --> 02:27:33,779
just has a huge load of terpenes and so

3324
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:37,560
the key thing I think in in crystal

3325
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:39,870
growth is that a non-polar environment

3326
02:27:37,559 --> 02:27:42,840
is always the best environment to have

3327
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:46,560
when you're trying to grow crystals like

3328
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:51,690
THC a and so certainly as the as the

3329
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:53,789
butane boils off your clock now is the

3330
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:56,940
terpenes and recognize that each

3331
02:27:53,790 --> 02:28:01,290
individual variety of cannabis is going

3332
02:27:56,940 --> 02:28:03,210
to have a different terpene profile so

3333
02:28:01,290 --> 02:28:06,210
each one is different and so not all

3334
02:28:03,209 --> 02:28:08,069
strains of cannabis are going to be ones

3335
02:28:06,209 --> 02:28:10,709
that when you start getting a

3336
02:28:08,069 --> 02:28:14,549
crystallization it's basically going to

3337
02:28:10,709 --> 02:28:16,679
be completely solving and by the or I'm

3338
02:28:14,549 --> 02:28:18,420
sorry the THC a is going to be

3339
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:20,729
completely solvated so you won't get

3340
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:23,340
crystallization or in other terpene

3341
02:28:20,728 --> 02:28:25,978
profiles where the terpene profile is

3342
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:27,228
dominated by more nonpolar terpenes you

3343
02:28:25,978 --> 02:28:29,670
are going to start seeing

3344
02:28:27,228 --> 02:28:33,170
crystallization so-called diamonds right

3345
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:36,979
but those diamonds as those THC a

3346
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:39,860
crystals are just thoroughly and can

3347
02:28:36,979 --> 02:28:42,109
completely perfused with terpenes so

3348
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:46,431
there's no mistake about it it's not

3349
02:28:42,110 --> 02:28:47,750
just crystal and white vanilla ta da

3350
02:28:46,431 --> 02:28:49,730
that they're getting out and I just

3351
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:52,129
wanted to comment that my experience has

3352
02:28:49,729 --> 02:28:54,770
always been with butane extraction Cuban

3353
02:28:52,129 --> 02:28:56,569
so I'm hearing about this method for the

3354
02:28:54,771 --> 02:28:59,391
first time so I don't know about this

3355
02:28:56,569 --> 02:29:01,699
pressing and using the terpene head

3356
02:28:59,390 --> 02:29:04,940
pressure is I think is what you said to

3357
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:07,641
fractionate the sauce from the diamonds

3358
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:12,370
but certainly the one thing that I seen

3359
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:17,270
before is absolutely pristine and pure

3360
02:29:12,370 --> 02:29:20,329
THC a by NMR analysis with no other

3361
02:29:17,271 --> 02:29:23,000
impurities in there that's derived from

3362
02:29:20,329 --> 02:29:26,299
a second pressing that's what we use to

3363
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:29,360
hydrogenate to make this batch of h HCA

3364
02:29:26,299 --> 02:29:31,430
in Chris Barone's lab so we looked at

3365
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:33,620
that material by NMR and it was

3366
02:29:31,431 --> 02:29:36,470
absolutely pristine and pure and again I

3367
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:39,260
I was the one who is very much skeptical

3368
02:29:36,469 --> 02:29:41,659
that you can make THC a solid but you

3369
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:44,090
know what you find in the hang up in the

3370
02:29:41,659 --> 02:29:46,280
rosin bags and everyone I've seen he has

3371
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:48,829
seen this now is that white crystalline

3372
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:53,200
material was people were thrown away for

3373
02:29:48,829 --> 02:29:55,340
years have been tht a solid right I

3374
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:57,470
think it's funny I just think it's like

3375
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:59,510
how this whole thing has a bomb right

3376
02:29:57,469 --> 02:30:02,090
from when we first started about

3377
02:29:59,510 --> 02:30:05,569
pressing talking about pressing rosin

3378
02:30:02,090 --> 02:30:08,060
here on as church and yeah evolved to

3379
02:30:05,569 --> 02:30:11,420
you know now it's been sophisticated

3380
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:14,140
enough that we can actually we really

3381
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:17,299
get a reasonable production yield on

3382
02:30:14,140 --> 02:30:20,420
pressing like you say either sift or

3383
02:30:17,299 --> 02:30:22,310
flour itself to make rosin for the

3384
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:24,799
market that would you know again rival

3385
02:30:22,310 --> 02:30:26,989
that of a butane you know solvent

3386
02:30:24,799 --> 02:30:31,729
extract did you want to go ahead cumin

3387
02:30:26,989 --> 02:30:35,239
it yeah so I hear myself all right cool

3388
02:30:31,729 --> 02:30:38,569
so the way that with wit BHO they used

3389
02:30:35,239 --> 02:30:42,110
the the pressure from not not only the

3390
02:30:38,569 --> 02:30:44,959
butane but also the terpenes in a sealed

3391
02:30:42,110 --> 02:30:47,900
container to create a positive pressure

3392
02:30:44,959 --> 02:30:49,640
and this positive pressure and when you

3393
02:30:47,899 --> 02:30:50,629
break that surface tension and the oil

3394
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:53,689
what

3395
02:30:50,629 --> 02:30:56,109
does overtime is a promotes the thca to

3396
02:30:53,689 --> 02:30:59,720
begin to crystallize if the beginning

3397
02:30:56,110 --> 02:31:01,850
product is pure you know minimum and

3398
02:30:59,719 --> 02:31:04,429
waxes and things like that o begin to

3399
02:31:01,850 --> 02:31:07,750
crystallize and and the terpene fraction

3400
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:10,370
will separate so never the beginning

3401
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:14,120
starting material does not necessarily

3402
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:16,040
change because it's trapped so what you

3403
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:18,470
get after it's done is kind of like a

3404
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:21,920
pressure release you may get some smell

3405
02:31:18,469 --> 02:31:24,170
but it's you know small I wouldn't say

3406
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:26,270
that maybe not even point one or point

3407
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:27,799
to a gram that I think you would lose in

3408
02:31:26,270 --> 02:31:29,720
this process and this is for working

3409
02:31:27,799 --> 02:31:31,250
alongside with somebody that produces

3410
02:31:29,719 --> 02:31:33,679
quite a bit of oil and seeing this

3411
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:37,489
process I always thought that that would

3412
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:40,489
be a crazy method for rosin but because

3413
02:31:37,489 --> 02:31:45,020
I didn't quite understand how to create

3414
02:31:40,489 --> 02:31:47,209
that that fraction or because rosin wax

3415
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:49,040
is so fast that you don't get that

3416
02:31:47,209 --> 02:31:52,969
liquid layer but these guys have been

3417
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:55,700
able to achieve just that by pressing

3418
02:31:52,969 --> 02:31:57,829
out there they're high-quality hash you

3419
02:31:55,700 --> 02:32:00,680
know my friend just made it was 45 but a

3420
02:31:57,829 --> 02:32:03,228
lot of these guys are pressing 90 micron

3421
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:06,500
first wash they're getting this oil

3422
02:32:03,228 --> 02:32:08,239
their flash heating it to go pastel with

3423
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:10,819
the wax phase and back to a liquid phase

3424
02:32:08,239 --> 02:32:14,059
you know sealed container they'll put it

3425
02:32:10,819 --> 02:32:15,610
back to about 90 degrees and they'll

3426
02:32:14,059 --> 02:32:18,350
leave it for about two to three days in

3427
02:32:15,610 --> 02:32:21,500
overtime without any agitation on this

3428
02:32:18,350 --> 02:32:25,399
rosin and will begin to crystallize the

3429
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:27,319
THC a just like it does with BHO but not

3430
02:32:25,398 --> 02:32:30,260
at that degree or some of these guys are

3431
02:32:27,319 --> 02:32:32,270
getting like four carat diamonds yeah

3432
02:32:30,260 --> 02:32:35,329
how big are the crystals are they really

3433
02:32:32,270 --> 02:32:38,270
are they long or just small little like

3434
02:32:35,329 --> 02:32:40,969
nacho crystals and some people are

3435
02:32:38,270 --> 02:32:43,579
everyone's doing it like reaching

3436
02:32:40,969 --> 02:32:46,309
different degrees of crystallization

3437
02:32:43,579 --> 02:32:47,719
some are getting elongated crystals you

3438
02:32:46,309 --> 02:32:50,209
know there's have the facets and

3439
02:32:47,719 --> 02:32:51,949
everything others are getting like a

3440
02:32:50,209 --> 02:32:53,599
nice sauce consistency where they're

3441
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:56,510
getting small kind of like micro

3442
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:59,149
diamonds but the fraction so liquidy

3443
02:32:56,510 --> 02:33:01,340
that it looks insane you it looks really

3444
02:32:59,148 --> 02:33:03,349
cool so all greens is doing it really

3445
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:04,408
nice all greens extraction they have a

3446
02:33:03,350 --> 02:33:07,859
nice Instagram and

3447
02:33:04,408 --> 02:33:10,259
information are they posting data to

3448
02:33:07,859 --> 02:33:12,509
they showing data to these things they

3449
02:33:10,259 --> 02:33:14,789
the one that I think would be closest to

3450
02:33:12,509 --> 02:33:16,648
show data would for sure be all greens

3451
02:33:14,789 --> 02:33:19,199
because they have a dispensary in

3452
02:33:16,648 --> 02:33:21,689
Colorado and they do a lot of in-house

3453
02:33:19,199 --> 02:33:23,658
production and I'm sure that we can

3454
02:33:21,689 --> 02:33:26,338
probably get him to do some testing

3455
02:33:23,658 --> 02:33:27,658
because he's one of in the forefront of

3456
02:33:26,338 --> 02:33:29,929
that technique I would say but the one

3457
02:33:27,658 --> 02:33:32,878
that released that that's doing a lot of

3458
02:33:29,929 --> 02:33:37,799
you know knowledge dropping is a diet

3459
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:40,919
funk on Instagram but I totally sweet so

3460
02:33:37,799 --> 02:33:43,799
terpenes smoke men they don't

3461
02:33:40,918 --> 02:33:45,869
necessarily escape in the rosin so when

3462
02:33:43,799 --> 02:33:48,390
you take a DAB you can't just get just

3463
02:33:45,869 --> 02:33:50,429
crystals unless you strain the crystals

3464
02:33:48,389 --> 02:33:53,398
and the Terp fraction separated

3465
02:33:50,429 --> 02:33:55,469
willingly if not regardless those

3466
02:33:53,398 --> 02:33:56,998
crystals are saturated and terpenes like

3467
02:33:55,468 --> 02:33:59,668
literally dripping off of those crystals

3468
02:33:56,998 --> 02:34:01,738
and and the smell and the taste is

3469
02:33:59,668 --> 02:34:03,509
amazing I think it doesn't lose any

3470
02:34:01,738 --> 02:34:04,978
flavor at all you could tell when it

3471
02:34:03,509 --> 02:34:07,228
starts to lose the terpenes because

3472
02:34:04,978 --> 02:34:09,448
their consistency consistency changes it

3473
02:34:07,228 --> 02:34:11,968
kind of dries out a little bit but as

3474
02:34:09,449 --> 02:34:15,029
long as you keep it sealed the terpenes

3475
02:34:11,968 --> 02:34:17,248
have nowhere to go but the proper liner

3476
02:34:15,029 --> 02:34:22,020
what kind of yield are they getting do

3477
02:34:17,248 --> 02:34:24,179
you know given I don't know we can go

3478
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:25,560
ahead and check I recently tried to do

3479
02:34:24,179 --> 02:34:28,439
it with some strawberry banana I got

3480
02:34:25,559 --> 02:34:32,189
great results but I put so much rosin in

3481
02:34:28,439 --> 02:34:34,139
a four ounce ball jar that I blew two

3482
02:34:32,189 --> 02:34:35,969
lids because of the pressure that was

3483
02:34:34,139 --> 02:34:38,608
accumulating in the jar like tightly

3484
02:34:35,968 --> 02:34:41,938
sealed and it kind of warped the

3485
02:34:38,609 --> 02:34:43,799
laid-out Turks yeah seriously dude if

3486
02:34:41,939 --> 02:34:45,719
you had a chamber and you're able to

3487
02:34:43,799 --> 02:34:48,089
like maybe pressurize it with nitrogen

3488
02:34:45,718 --> 02:34:50,818
you might get it likes faster results I

3489
02:34:48,088 --> 02:34:53,039
don't know yeah I mean that's again

3490
02:34:50,818 --> 02:34:54,988
where the the downfall may be and

3491
02:34:53,039 --> 02:34:57,088
ultimately some of these methods which

3492
02:34:54,988 --> 02:34:59,309
are using ball jars which just aren't

3493
02:34:57,088 --> 02:35:01,129
meant for these kinds of pressures I

3494
02:34:59,309 --> 02:35:03,689
mean these things are meant for canning

3495
02:35:01,129 --> 02:35:05,879
vegetables and fruits and stuff like

3496
02:35:03,689 --> 02:35:08,158
that and certainly can take some

3497
02:35:05,879 --> 02:35:09,959
pressure because in that process you you

3498
02:35:08,158 --> 02:35:12,389
know in the canning process you generate

3499
02:35:09,959 --> 02:35:15,119
some pressure but certainly that's an

3500
02:35:12,389 --> 02:35:17,038
area where I believe in Denver now

3501
02:35:15,119 --> 02:35:18,270
there's been decade where Colorado this

3502
02:35:17,039 --> 02:35:20,220
would be the

3503
02:35:18,270 --> 02:35:25,520
fire departments issued some edict about

3504
02:35:20,219 --> 02:35:28,889
using ball jars for doing that

3505
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:31,170
incubation of sauce and there are a

3506
02:35:28,889 --> 02:35:32,670
couple companies that are now providing

3507
02:35:31,170 --> 02:35:35,549
so-called spots

3508
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:37,738
Ott's which are basically just stainless

3509
02:35:35,549 --> 02:35:40,108
steel vessels that have pressure

3510
02:35:37,738 --> 02:35:42,389
regulation on top and a way that you

3511
02:35:40,109 --> 02:35:44,520
could vent pressure and certainly the

3512
02:35:42,389 --> 02:35:46,889
way that these things look there look

3513
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:49,680
like cannons that are you know over you

3514
02:35:46,889 --> 02:35:52,439
know engineered for pressures way higher

3515
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:53,789
than you would generate but what you're

3516
02:35:52,439 --> 02:35:57,420
talking about here is an alternative

3517
02:35:53,789 --> 02:35:59,159
method to make similar constant Trickett

3518
02:35:57,420 --> 02:36:01,529
without having to deal with those kinds

3519
02:35:59,158 --> 02:36:04,889
of safety issues if you're talking about

3520
02:36:01,529 --> 02:36:07,590
using butane which as it off gases yeah

3521
02:36:04,889 --> 02:36:09,510
it does create pressure which is which

3522
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:12,000
is exactly what the Terps are doing in

3523
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:16,578
the jar which are also hydrocarbons

3524
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:18,260
right right it's all yeah right terpenes

3525
02:36:16,578 --> 02:36:20,879
sorry go ahead

3526
02:36:18,260 --> 02:36:22,978
I mean a ball jar you're right it's not

3527
02:36:20,879 --> 02:36:25,078
the right thing to do no I'm making this

3528
02:36:22,978 --> 02:36:27,389
with my rosin press at home you know I

3529
02:36:25,078 --> 02:36:29,340
don't have a lab but if I did I will get

3530
02:36:27,389 --> 02:36:31,738
with a fabricator get a vessel made and

3531
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:33,389
that vessel not only would I be able to

3532
02:36:31,738 --> 02:36:36,629
hold four times the pressure of a ball

3533
02:36:33,389 --> 02:36:39,180
jar safely but I feel like pressure and

3534
02:36:36,629 --> 02:36:41,118
the purity of the product is what will

3535
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:43,920
achieve those like bigger

3536
02:36:41,119 --> 02:36:45,630
thca formations or at least can separate

3537
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:48,299
the top fraction completely even that

3538
02:36:45,629 --> 02:36:49,978
those crystals aren't huge but it'll be

3539
02:36:48,299 --> 02:36:53,759
completely separated

3540
02:36:49,978 --> 02:36:56,849
I've seen some samples of BHO sauce has

3541
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:59,460
been made under pressure in a vessel and

3542
02:36:56,850 --> 02:37:02,068
the top fraction is completely liquidy

3543
02:36:59,459 --> 02:37:04,318
it's no comparison looking at something

3544
02:37:02,068 --> 02:37:06,898
that is using just a head pressure of

3545
02:37:04,318 --> 02:37:09,709
the terpenes and the butane versus

3546
02:37:06,898 --> 02:37:12,898
something that's been pressurized and

3547
02:37:09,709 --> 02:37:15,328
it's a it's a big difference and I feel

3548
02:37:12,898 --> 02:37:16,769
like that and rosin will also make a big

3549
02:37:15,328 --> 02:37:22,949
difference but I don't think anyone's

3550
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:24,810
tried that yet does the rosin or the

3551
02:37:22,949 --> 02:37:27,810
extract or whatever it is that you

3552
02:37:24,809 --> 02:37:30,059
started with to make crystals if it's

3553
02:37:27,809 --> 02:37:32,069
under pressure does it reduce a higher

3554
02:37:30,059 --> 02:37:35,909
yield of crystals or a fact

3555
02:37:32,069 --> 02:37:38,969
are you a it's it could essentially

3556
02:37:35,909 --> 02:37:43,229
produce both I've heard claims where

3557
02:37:38,969 --> 02:37:45,270
like for example on BHO for it to

3558
02:37:43,229 --> 02:37:46,770
crystallize they put it in in its liquid

3559
02:37:45,271 --> 02:37:49,110
state not a shatter they don't allow it

3560
02:37:46,771 --> 02:37:52,560
to draw it to drive to that state and it

3561
02:37:49,110 --> 02:37:55,380
could take under its own pressure that

3562
02:37:52,559 --> 02:37:58,439
it creates in a sealed container about

3563
02:37:55,379 --> 02:38:00,299
five days but there are people that say

3564
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:01,950
that within 48 hours in a pressurized

3565
02:38:00,299 --> 02:38:06,239
vessel that they get that complete

3566
02:38:01,950 --> 02:38:10,200
separation THC a crystals and the Terp

3567
02:38:06,239 --> 02:38:12,959
fraction I believe the yield no matter

3568
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:14,730
is the same at the end maybe the higher

3569
02:38:12,959 --> 02:38:17,429
pressure will create more yield because

3570
02:38:14,729 --> 02:38:19,680
they get that even more separation the

3571
02:38:17,430 --> 02:38:23,909
less THC a in the Terp fraction the more

3572
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:25,350
liquidy it is but more in that realm

3573
02:38:23,909 --> 02:38:27,780
would their focus on because they're so

3574
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:30,510
beyond that already is the size of the

3575
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:33,870
crystal how can the crystal is the

3576
02:38:30,510 --> 02:38:35,969
clarity of the crystal so they're like

3577
02:38:33,870 --> 02:38:37,680
in their own zone but we're I think

3578
02:38:35,969 --> 02:38:40,590
we're getting in the beginning steps of

3579
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:44,700
where they were six months ago or you

3580
02:38:40,590 --> 02:38:48,870
know nine months ago with Rossi can you

3581
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:53,730
get crystals that are yellow or red or

3582
02:38:48,870 --> 02:38:57,660
in other words THC when it's absolutely

3583
02:38:53,729 --> 02:39:03,899
pure and not broken down it off it's as

3584
02:38:57,659 --> 02:39:06,750
clear as water and when THC as a ranking

3585
02:39:03,899 --> 02:39:09,449
oil of alcohol extracted something it

3586
02:39:06,750 --> 02:39:12,299
slowly starts turning yellow and it ends

3587
02:39:09,450 --> 02:39:15,000
up more like a dark red if there's no

3588
02:39:12,299 --> 02:39:17,549
impurities like Clara for horror film

3589
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:21,090
and any of that kind of stuff and can

3590
02:39:17,549 --> 02:39:23,879
people make crystals with color so the

3591
02:39:21,090 --> 02:39:26,190
crystals the muck that I've seen is a

3592
02:39:23,879 --> 02:39:29,849
pure example of THC a is a clear crystal

3593
02:39:26,190 --> 02:39:31,710
when the crystal is has impurities the

3594
02:39:29,850 --> 02:39:34,319
crystal will then be yellow perhaps in

3595
02:39:31,709 --> 02:39:36,329
its pure form from fresh frozen not

3596
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:38,610
cured material we're talking material

3597
02:39:36,329 --> 02:39:40,319
it's never been dried the what changes

3598
02:39:38,610 --> 02:39:43,710
mostly with the size of the resin

3599
02:39:40,319 --> 02:39:46,020
between an amber head a clear head or

3600
02:39:43,709 --> 02:39:49,319
cloudy head is the color of the turf

3601
02:39:46,021 --> 02:39:51,841
action a Terp fraction on an Amber like

3602
02:39:49,319 --> 02:39:54,029
a seven-year of 45 the third fraction

3603
02:39:51,841 --> 02:39:56,610
will be more amber but the Diamonds will

3604
02:39:54,030 --> 02:39:58,829
still be clear if you use a 90 or 120

3605
02:39:56,610 --> 02:40:01,711
then you'll have like a really almost

3606
02:39:58,829 --> 02:40:04,771
like liquid clear turb fraction maybe

3607
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:06,119
slightly yellow the Diamonds regardless

3608
02:40:04,771 --> 02:40:09,329
will be the same you may get a higher

3609
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:15,061
yield of diamonds per gram using a 90 or

3610
02:40:09,329 --> 02:40:17,521
120 versus a 45 but maybe with age if

3611
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:19,890
you leave this product out and cure it

3612
02:40:17,521 --> 02:40:24,120
potentially the color of the diamond can

3613
02:40:19,890 --> 02:40:30,239
change because THC I mean naturally ends

3614
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:32,610
up turning to almost red turned red I've

3615
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:36,140
got resin heads which I just kept aside

3616
02:40:32,610 --> 02:40:38,819
for about a year on the open shell and

3617
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:43,289
within a year or a year and a half at

3618
02:40:38,819 --> 02:40:46,050
the most they were really red well I

3619
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:50,011
remember the dry sift from from Michael

3620
02:40:46,050 --> 02:40:52,800
that was like it was 12 13 years old

3621
02:40:50,011 --> 02:40:54,211
when I first saw it I think 16 or 17

3622
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:57,751
years old when I last saw it

3623
02:40:54,210 --> 02:41:00,119
Wow yeah and when it melted it melted

3624
02:40:57,751 --> 02:41:04,261
into this like reddish dark black

3625
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:09,061
obsidian like just oil it was it was

3626
02:41:04,261 --> 02:41:10,950
definitely no Terps left welcome back

3627
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:16,409
Mike you have something you want to say

3628
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:18,391
about this sauce yeah so Marc probably

3629
02:41:16,409 --> 02:41:21,210
did talk about this but I would assume

3630
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:25,949
that that general trend of coloration is

3631
02:41:21,210 --> 02:41:29,430
going to be oxygen binding to not not

3632
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:34,159
only your cannabinoids but all the

3633
02:41:29,431 --> 02:41:37,771
terpenoids that occur in your sauce

3634
02:41:34,159 --> 02:41:43,079
flatly flavonoids are really highly

3635
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:45,780
colored and are very prone to oxidizing

3636
02:41:43,079 --> 02:41:48,300
in air and they'll oxidize if you stare

3637
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:51,030
cross-eyed at them they're that unstable

3638
02:41:48,300 --> 02:41:53,880
and so just even on the rotovap what

3639
02:41:51,030 --> 02:41:56,521
comes out as a clear extract will start

3640
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:58,739
to turn yellow as you concentrate it and

3641
02:41:56,521 --> 02:41:59,890
the other thing I've seen again just

3642
02:41:58,739 --> 02:42:02,379
putting stuff on the

3643
02:41:59,889 --> 02:42:05,228
all certain terpenes when you isolate

3644
02:42:02,379 --> 02:42:08,259
them first have basically little to no

3645
02:42:05,228 --> 02:42:10,090
color if you're isolating them under

3646
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:12,939
vacuum or if you're isolating them by

3647
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:15,219
sometimes this distillation process as

3648
02:42:12,939 --> 02:42:17,170
soon as they come in contact with air as

3649
02:42:15,219 --> 02:42:19,929
soon as they come and they start

3650
02:42:17,170 --> 02:42:22,559
darkening up right away so I think

3651
02:42:19,930 --> 02:42:26,199
there's you know again some you know

3652
02:42:22,559 --> 02:42:29,158
oxidative instability with some isolated

3653
02:42:26,199 --> 02:42:32,109
terpene fractions that perhaps are kept

3654
02:42:29,158 --> 02:42:33,670
protected by the cannabinoids in the

3655
02:42:32,109 --> 02:42:36,158
plant that's out because remember the

3656
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:39,969
cannabinoids themselves are phenolic in

3657
02:42:36,158 --> 02:42:42,639
nature and phenols are antioxidants so

3658
02:42:39,969 --> 02:42:45,340
perhaps when they're in the plant the

3659
02:42:42,639 --> 02:42:48,219
the cannabinoids act as a photo

3660
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:50,859
protectant or a protectant from

3661
02:42:48,219 --> 02:42:53,648
oxidation of the terpenes but when the

3662
02:42:50,859 --> 02:42:57,059
terpenes are isolated and no longer you

3663
02:42:53,648 --> 02:42:59,889
know intermingled with the antioxidant

3664
02:42:57,059 --> 02:43:02,408
and the possibility by later on the

3665
02:42:59,889 --> 02:43:04,238
tribe comic head is going to reduce the

3666
02:43:02,408 --> 02:43:06,250
amount of oxygen that's actually

3667
02:43:04,238 --> 02:43:09,209
entering the trait from a gland right

3668
02:43:06,250 --> 02:43:13,059
right and isn't that the whole nature of

3669
02:43:09,209 --> 02:43:16,448
timing harvest based on resin gland

3670
02:43:13,059 --> 02:43:19,658
color and I think right when we had Mel

3671
02:43:16,449 --> 02:43:22,270
Frank on a number of episodes ago I

3672
02:43:19,658 --> 02:43:24,129
can't exactly remember how this came up

3673
02:43:22,270 --> 02:43:26,319
conversation but I think one of the

3674
02:43:24,129 --> 02:43:29,679
things that I took from Mel Frank's

3675
02:43:26,318 --> 02:43:31,478
original text was the timing of harvest

3676
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:35,829
and how it's very important to be able

3677
02:43:31,478 --> 02:43:39,728
to recognize the change of those glands

3678
02:43:35,829 --> 02:43:42,579
as to try to guess when you're going to

3679
02:43:39,728 --> 02:43:45,818
get maximum potency and I think there is

3680
02:43:42,579 --> 02:43:47,829
some delicate balance of chemistry

3681
02:43:45,818 --> 02:43:49,869
that's happening there the highly

3682
02:43:47,829 --> 02:43:51,699
colored things I think are flavonoids

3683
02:43:49,870 --> 02:43:54,310
because it only takes a little bit of

3684
02:43:51,699 --> 02:43:55,840
those flavonoids to color a whole lot of

3685
02:43:54,309 --> 02:43:58,119
material because again most of the

3686
02:43:55,840 --> 02:44:00,939
terpenes when you isolate them on their

3687
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:03,699
own will be clear liquids but some of

3688
02:44:00,939 --> 02:44:06,939
them will start immediately turning

3689
02:44:03,699 --> 02:44:08,920
color and I don't exactly know what's

3690
02:44:06,939 --> 02:44:14,010
happening there but I've seen it happen

3691
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:16,989
in front of my eyes I've also

3692
02:44:14,010 --> 02:44:19,290
excuse me you you want to go first or

3693
02:44:16,989 --> 02:44:19,289
should I

3694
02:44:20,850 --> 02:44:28,659
well your Bronson - I'll go the first

3695
02:44:25,989 --> 02:44:38,729
time I got pure THC a hundred percent

3696
02:44:28,659 --> 02:44:43,930
pure THC was created for THC it was th

3697
02:44:38,729 --> 02:44:47,559
see I think I was THC yes okay did it

3698
02:44:43,930 --> 02:44:50,590
what I saw there was good yes it was an

3699
02:44:47,559 --> 02:44:54,729
absolutely clear liquid it has a texture

3700
02:44:50,590 --> 02:44:58,239
of a sort of runny epoxy glue and it had

3701
02:44:54,729 --> 02:45:00,100
absolutely zero taste zero smell maybe

3702
02:44:58,239 --> 02:45:02,729
put a tiny drop on your tongue

3703
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:05,979
it tasted like absolutely nothing I

3704
02:45:02,729 --> 02:45:10,209
think it was THC because it been

3705
02:45:05,979 --> 02:45:12,459
synthesized from CBD and I think just

3706
02:45:10,209 --> 02:45:16,359
that process he would have converted it

3707
02:45:12,459 --> 02:45:19,750
to THC but I'm mad at her % sure yeah

3708
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:23,500
open up it was in a little ampule a

3709
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:27,219
glass ampule with a gram in it and it

3710
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:29,319
was acted in the nerve gas and it was

3711
02:45:27,219 --> 02:45:33,809
everybody kept frozen until it was given

3712
02:45:29,319 --> 02:45:37,389
to me I opened it and I stuck a little

3713
02:45:33,809 --> 02:45:40,149
thin piece of toothpick or something in

3714
02:45:37,389 --> 02:45:41,439
it just to see what the texture was I

3715
02:45:40,149 --> 02:45:45,609
could so I could taste it on my tongue

3716
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:48,430
and when I found out was that within a

3717
02:45:45,610 --> 02:45:53,550
few minutes where I have stuck the

3718
02:45:48,430 --> 02:45:58,180
dipping into the to the THC it left an

3719
02:45:53,549 --> 02:46:01,750
ultraviolet trail through the THC which

3720
02:45:58,180 --> 02:46:05,710
started turning yellowish and eventually

3721
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:10,000
reddish like yeah when I saw that it

3722
02:46:05,709 --> 02:46:13,929
blew my mind man that would have been a

3723
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:16,979
great macro photograph moral of the

3724
02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:20,370
story is that you're extracting nitrogen

3725
02:46:16,979 --> 02:46:25,799
yep and don't and don't poke your

3726
02:46:20,370 --> 02:46:27,100
extracts with with toothpicks stories

3727
02:46:25,799 --> 02:46:29,528
documents

3728
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:32,619
while that you can finish mark when you

3729
02:46:29,529 --> 02:46:35,920
open them yeah there you go

3730
02:46:32,619 --> 02:46:37,210
there you go I like it well that's yeah

3731
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:39,068
it's an interesting conversation I'm

3732
02:46:37,209 --> 02:46:41,259
pretty sure soil grounds been doing that

3733
02:46:39,068 --> 02:46:44,738
for a while if I'm not mistaken correct

3734
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:48,130
Kuban well what he achieved is similar

3735
02:46:44,738 --> 02:46:50,590
he does a double press and then will

3736
02:46:48,129 --> 02:46:52,929
liquefy the THC a fraction from that's

3737
02:46:50,590 --> 02:46:54,670
retained in the bag right and he

3738
02:46:52,930 --> 02:46:56,529
actually got he has steps that I don't

3739
02:46:54,670 --> 02:46:57,908
want to talk about because he we we're

3740
02:46:56,529 --> 02:47:00,579
friends man he's a cool guy actually

3741
02:46:57,908 --> 02:47:02,379
yeah he's great very much fine

3742
02:47:00,579 --> 02:47:03,459
we kicked a kinship when I see him in

3743
02:47:02,379 --> 02:47:05,228
person and I don't want to put yourself

3744
02:47:03,459 --> 02:47:08,139
out there that he doesn't talk about but

3745
02:47:05,228 --> 02:47:10,809
his process is nice too he gets a nice

3746
02:47:08,139 --> 02:47:14,170
turn fraction he is THC a is also pure

3747
02:47:10,809 --> 02:47:18,488
but he does a two-step process and

3748
02:47:14,170 --> 02:47:21,158
although it's achieving a very similar

3749
02:47:18,488 --> 02:47:22,779
end product this is done with a one-step

3750
02:47:21,158 --> 02:47:24,039
process so it's a different technique I

3751
02:47:22,779 --> 02:47:26,949
talked to him about it when I was down

3752
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:28,330
in LA so I bet in the last three weeks

3753
02:47:26,949 --> 02:47:30,670
he's probably been on that for sure

3754
02:47:28,329 --> 02:47:32,559
right okay no I thought he was also

3755
02:47:30,670 --> 02:47:34,119
doing the other one as well I could be

3756
02:47:32,559 --> 02:47:37,689
mistaken I've invited him in but he's

3757
02:47:34,119 --> 02:47:39,880
busy today so I'm gonna have to I'm

3758
02:47:37,689 --> 02:47:42,040
gonna have to get him on next week maybe

3759
02:47:39,879 --> 02:47:43,750
in further the conversation because it's

3760
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:47,580
nice to get together with you guys and

3761
02:47:43,750 --> 02:47:50,290
gals and talk ash and cannabis just

3762
02:47:47,579 --> 02:47:53,170
spend a couple hours on a Sunday Sunday

3763
02:47:50,290 --> 02:47:56,520
morn and chilling out what when I did

3764
02:47:53,170 --> 02:48:01,270
that with the pure THC I was absolutely

3765
02:47:56,520 --> 02:48:04,720
convinced 2080 would have a smell and

3766
02:48:01,270 --> 02:48:06,908
taste I put it on my tongue I couldn't

3767
02:48:04,719 --> 02:48:10,750
tell even they just heard you tell there

3768
02:48:06,908 --> 02:48:14,408
was you know some gooey stuff on my time

3769
02:48:10,750 --> 02:48:16,540
but I mean I'm so used to all

3770
02:48:14,408 --> 02:48:20,079
cannabinoids I never had that report

3771
02:48:16,540 --> 02:48:24,189
straight being really really pepper on

3772
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:25,930
it right because they always had

3773
02:48:24,189 --> 02:48:31,170
terpenes which is where the pepper was

3774
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:31,170
coming from sure beta carrion Shalini

3775
02:48:33,079 --> 02:48:40,700
Erbs mr mark maybe you can help me out

3776
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:42,650
with this but something I've in and I

3777
02:48:40,700 --> 02:48:44,480
actually Marcus you and I talked about

3778
02:48:42,649 --> 02:48:46,579
it or all of us didn't we're in Whistler

3779
02:48:44,479 --> 02:48:49,699
you know last week happy birthday to

3780
02:48:46,579 --> 02:48:52,280
your wonderful son yeah anyway it's a

3781
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:56,900
little buddy he's the dude so dude

3782
02:48:52,280 --> 02:49:00,021
Marcus how's the dude but I have a

3783
02:48:56,899 --> 02:49:02,449
question about CVG and you know it's

3784
02:49:00,021 --> 02:49:05,450
something that it no matter what strain

3785
02:49:02,450 --> 02:49:07,730
that that people bring us our numbers

3786
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:09,771
and CDG are coming up really high and

3787
02:49:07,729 --> 02:49:12,439
then the cultivars that we've been

3788
02:49:09,771 --> 02:49:14,720
working with for a really long time come

3789
02:49:12,440 --> 02:49:17,420
up even higher in CPG and then people

3790
02:49:14,719 --> 02:49:18,920
will give us you know a seed and then

3791
02:49:17,420 --> 02:49:20,750
they'll say oh you know it doesn't have

3792
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:22,639
any CBG in it well we're growing it and

3793
02:49:20,750 --> 02:49:26,060
it has CVG so I'm just wondering about

3794
02:49:22,639 --> 02:49:28,879
like a cultivated burden of cbz coming

3795
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:34,250
up you know in in the plans or a

3796
02:49:28,879 --> 02:49:35,479
possible genetic CBD it seems to be it's

3797
02:49:34,250 --> 02:49:38,420
just a question for me I was wondering

3798
02:49:35,479 --> 02:49:42,949
if you guys had an idea we developed CPG

3799
02:49:38,420 --> 02:49:48,889
varieties that were well over 10% and

3800
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:51,740
that's finding are you finding CDG 10%

3801
02:49:48,889 --> 02:49:53,689
in the flowers yeah that's what I'm

3802
02:49:51,739 --> 02:49:55,610
talking about yes we started with

3803
02:49:53,690 --> 02:49:58,010
varieties that are one or two percent

3804
02:49:55,610 --> 02:50:03,050
and then through selective classical

3805
02:49:58,010 --> 02:50:04,340
breeding we brought him up to over 10 we

3806
02:50:03,049 --> 02:50:07,609
created a distraint

3807
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:11,090
cause Ellie's gift and green life

3808
02:50:07,610 --> 02:50:15,409
productions just sent us a the do it for

3809
02:50:11,090 --> 02:50:17,780
the turfs family there did a a lab test

3810
02:50:15,409 --> 02:50:19,610
and they got their third they're back

3811
02:50:17,780 --> 02:50:23,480
there's back in it was a ten point three

3812
02:50:19,610 --> 02:50:26,150
I want to say G and it just seems to be

3813
02:50:23,479 --> 02:50:30,529
a just wondering about genetic versions

3814
02:50:26,149 --> 02:50:37,329
of CDG is it different I think it was

3815
02:50:30,530 --> 02:50:43,130
you ABS digi labs CBD is object x

3816
02:50:37,329 --> 02:50:44,600
shown in literally in flower the you

3817
02:50:43,129 --> 02:50:46,879
know plants produce enzymes that

3818
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:49,880
actually not only find terpenes

3819
02:50:46,879 --> 02:50:55,579
the precursor cannabinoids CBG is one of

3820
02:50:49,879 --> 02:50:57,459
the precursor to nab annoys cbda the

3821
02:50:55,579 --> 02:51:00,439
breeding that's been kind of going on

3822
02:50:57,459 --> 02:51:03,589
developing those higher CBD cultivars is

3823
02:51:00,439 --> 02:51:07,398
actually delaying the production of CBD

3824
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:11,829
a and THC days which is the enzyme that

3825
02:51:07,398 --> 02:51:16,189
converts CBG a to either CBD a or THC a

3826
02:51:11,829 --> 02:51:20,239
so if you take those cultivars that are

3827
02:51:16,189 --> 02:51:22,430
showing eight to ten percent CPG you

3828
02:51:20,239 --> 02:51:24,469
know and it's an additional four leads

3829
02:51:22,430 --> 02:51:26,989
you'll actually see that CBG numbers

3830
02:51:24,469 --> 02:51:31,188
decrease and your either your THC or CBD

3831
02:51:26,989 --> 02:51:34,010
numbers start to trend upwards well it

3832
02:51:31,189 --> 02:51:36,648
depends what 10 cases they have if also

3833
02:51:34,010 --> 02:51:39,469
happens to CBD synthase and they don't

3834
02:51:36,648 --> 02:51:45,019
have functional THC or CBD some places

3835
02:51:39,469 --> 02:51:47,029
you don't see THC or CBD they have to

3836
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:50,870
have the functional synthase to produce

3837
02:51:47,030 --> 02:51:53,930
the property key so do you all believe

3838
02:51:50,870 --> 02:51:55,479
that the cultivation practices or the

3839
02:51:53,930 --> 02:52:00,648
way that the plant is being cultivated

3840
02:51:55,478 --> 02:52:04,789
can even raise CBG in possible genetics

3841
02:52:00,648 --> 02:52:08,269
that don't have it I'd be surprised I've

3842
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:10,610
heard people say that they oh I think it

3843
02:52:08,270 --> 02:52:13,010
early in the CBD is highly higher

3844
02:52:10,610 --> 02:52:16,399
because it hasn't converted to THC or

3845
02:52:13,010 --> 02:52:19,850
CBD yet I don't think that's true at all

3846
02:52:16,398 --> 02:52:24,920
it's it's not what we saw and we did I

3847
02:52:19,850 --> 02:52:27,800
mean the work we did was you know more

3848
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:30,620
than 15 years ago and we were the ones

3849
02:52:27,799 --> 02:52:33,170
who wrote the papers on the inheritance

3850
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:35,420
of CBD and the other good evidence

3851
02:52:33,170 --> 02:52:37,850
yeah I think the question that she asked

3852
02:52:35,420 --> 02:52:40,670
is can you introduce an environmental

3853
02:52:37,850 --> 02:52:42,530
stimulus to the plan to up regulate the

3854
02:52:40,670 --> 02:52:47,030
expression of the synthase that's either

3855
02:52:42,530 --> 02:52:53,979
not being read you know present at the

3856
02:52:47,030 --> 02:52:56,989
right level because yes CBG a is not a n

3857
02:52:53,978 --> 02:52:58,819
pathway precursor or it's on and it's

3858
02:52:56,989 --> 02:53:00,449
not the end of the cannabinoid

3859
02:52:58,819 --> 02:53:03,029
biosynthetic pathway

3860
02:53:00,450 --> 02:53:07,050
right the other sentences are there it

3861
02:53:03,030 --> 02:53:09,090
is me and no no so the other synthesis

3862
02:53:07,049 --> 02:53:11,879
are there they're just not expressed at

3863
02:53:09,090 --> 02:53:15,630
the level that they need to be

3864
02:53:11,879 --> 02:53:19,649
non-functional from Cass CBD synthesis

3865
02:53:15,629 --> 02:53:22,109
but they're non-functional yes but okay

3866
02:53:19,649 --> 02:53:24,539
so that yet so the question has to be

3867
02:53:22,110 --> 02:53:26,790
asked at the genetic level is there

3868
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:28,590
something that can up regulate the

3869
02:53:26,790 --> 02:53:33,720
expression of that enzyme and that's

3870
02:53:28,590 --> 02:53:36,120
something that yeah can I cannot basis

3871
02:53:33,719 --> 02:53:38,609
it won't if you have the proper

3872
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:42,360
sentences maybe it can tweak it a bit

3873
02:53:38,610 --> 02:53:46,710
yes but you need the synthesis you can't

3874
02:53:42,360 --> 02:53:47,790
you know turn a scissor or the era Sam

3875
02:53:46,709 --> 02:53:50,189
that's the point

3876
02:53:47,790 --> 02:53:50,880
no I'm not they're not you you're

3877
02:53:50,190 --> 02:53:53,521
mistaken

3878
02:53:50,879 --> 02:53:56,789
listen you're a chemist I'm a planet for

3879
02:53:53,521 --> 02:53:58,370
you and we should stick to what we're

3880
02:53:56,790 --> 02:54:06,120
good at

3881
02:53:58,370 --> 02:54:08,300
okay I know it's it's there you're

3882
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:12,030
technically right but it's not

3883
02:54:08,299 --> 02:54:14,640
functional so I know I've seen a couple

3884
02:54:12,030 --> 02:54:18,900
of artists of DVD that have been

3885
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:21,359
cultivated along the west coast and what

3886
02:54:18,899 --> 02:54:26,760
one of the LED companies I was

3887
02:54:21,360 --> 02:54:29,069
researching was claiming was not enough

3888
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:31,200
supporting documentation but they were

3889
02:54:29,069 --> 02:54:34,379
saying that their third spectrum was

3890
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:38,061
improving the CBD scores because of the

3891
02:54:34,379 --> 02:54:40,379
higher presence of red spectrum blight

3892
02:54:38,060 --> 02:54:43,199
there are some research papers looking

3893
02:54:40,379 --> 02:54:46,729
at with shifting towards the red

3894
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:49,650
spectrum is person cannabis can produce

3895
02:54:46,729 --> 02:54:53,250
more of the CBD eighth and days unless

3896
02:54:49,649 --> 02:54:55,681
the PPACA synthase but I think that that

3897
02:54:53,250 --> 02:54:57,810
that's you know manipulating light

3898
02:54:55,681 --> 02:55:00,300
spectrum for producing specific

3899
02:54:57,810 --> 02:55:04,799
cannabinoid profile hasn't been done on

3900
02:55:00,299 --> 02:55:06,659
the field to actually approach what you

3901
02:55:04,799 --> 02:55:09,149
want to do is you want to breed with

3902
02:55:06,659 --> 02:55:11,760
high expression of the synthesis of the

3903
02:55:09,149 --> 02:55:13,770
target or after moving environmental

3904
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:15,601
conditions is you know

3905
02:55:13,771 --> 02:55:22,711
small potatoes compared to the big

3906
02:55:15,601 --> 02:55:26,521
potato yeah totally it all had to start

3907
02:55:22,710 --> 02:55:28,649
with and if you have the genetics and

3908
02:55:26,521 --> 02:55:31,261
having those environmental conditions to

3909
02:55:28,649 --> 02:55:33,720
manage method will kind of help you I

3910
02:55:31,261 --> 02:55:37,940
guess you know the life I just got

3911
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:41,130
twenty kilos of french fry decent

3912
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:45,501
seventy because it's reported to have

3913
02:55:41,130 --> 02:55:47,850
small amounts of CVG so I picked up

3914
02:55:45,501 --> 02:56:00,771
750,000 seeds of it so I can screen a

3915
02:55:47,851 --> 02:56:03,511
few thousand with all your experience

3916
02:56:00,771 --> 02:56:07,261
and and testing all the cannabinoids I

3917
02:56:03,511 --> 02:56:09,211
mean do you is is it really just the

3918
02:56:07,261 --> 02:56:11,909
cannabinoids that we're looking at on

3919
02:56:09,210 --> 02:56:14,609
the tests that are really of note on a

3920
02:56:11,909 --> 02:56:17,251
medicinal level I just want to believe

3921
02:56:14,610 --> 02:56:20,159
that out of 100 and avenues that are

3922
02:56:17,251 --> 02:56:22,800
there's so much more to the story I feel

3923
02:56:20,159 --> 02:56:25,560
like I'm it like the the beginning of

3924
02:56:22,800 --> 02:56:27,180
this like amazing book or story and I

3925
02:56:25,560 --> 02:56:28,351
just want to hear the rest of it like

3926
02:56:27,181 --> 02:56:29,851
you I feel like we're growing for

3927
02:56:28,351 --> 02:56:31,891
cannabinoids we don't know yet and I

3928
02:56:29,851 --> 02:56:35,940
just want to I would just be interested

3929
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:41,100
to know about how you know you can dial

3930
02:56:35,940 --> 02:56:44,521
in and then how to quit joining what you

3931
02:56:41,101 --> 02:56:46,501
can say for sure is that people wouldn't

3932
02:56:44,521 --> 02:56:48,421
know that yet because there are

3933
02:56:46,501 --> 02:56:52,530
varieties with high THC they're always

3934
02:56:48,421 --> 02:56:53,579
had been there are now varieties of high

3935
02:56:52,530 --> 02:56:56,841
CBD

3936
02:56:53,579 --> 02:57:00,181
well I produced the first one that was

3937
02:56:56,841 --> 02:57:01,921
over ten percent but that was twenty

3938
02:57:00,181 --> 02:57:04,739
years more than twenty years ago

3939
02:57:01,921 --> 02:57:06,989
so there are see and now that people

3940
02:57:04,739 --> 02:57:12,210
have varieties which I paper approaching

3941
02:57:06,989 --> 02:57:16,819
30 percent TV in the plant so and we did

3942
02:57:12,210 --> 02:57:16,819
the same thing with CBC we did it with

3943
02:57:16,909 --> 02:57:29,539
CPG we did it with the topo homologues

3944
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:29,539
of THC CBD so T a TV TV TV TV see me

3945
02:57:33,021 --> 02:57:40,620
about this what else the end that's more

3946
02:57:37,380 --> 02:57:43,260
that we've been finding a lot of news by

3947
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:49,980
the plant it's an aggregation product of

3948
02:57:43,261 --> 02:57:51,211
most primary row techniques enhance any

3949
02:57:49,979 --> 02:57:57,449
cannabinoids

3950
02:57:51,210 --> 02:58:00,479
also does not happen to 810 face any lab

3951
02:57:57,450 --> 02:58:03,631
in tell you that terroir is gonna affect

3952
02:58:00,479 --> 02:58:05,159
your terpenes and you know affecting

3953
02:58:03,630 --> 02:58:07,560
your terpenes are going to change them

3954
02:58:05,159 --> 02:58:09,389
listen the effect of the cannabinoid

3955
02:58:07,560 --> 02:58:13,170
Sirians that's

3956
02:58:09,389 --> 02:58:21,420
because is the right terpenes to both

3957
02:58:13,170 --> 02:58:24,120
and a lot of modulate the offensive by

3958
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:27,829
building more diverse soils that have

3959
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:30,750
you know you know more and more and more

3960
02:58:27,829 --> 02:58:32,760
microorganisms I just know and I see you

3961
02:58:30,750 --> 02:58:35,158
through testing and I want to see more

3962
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:37,770
and and through the family is just how

3963
02:58:35,158 --> 02:58:39,329
you know much more diverse they can get

3964
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:41,699
and I really look forward to the day

3965
02:58:39,329 --> 02:58:44,189
when we can get you know deeper and into

3966
02:58:41,699 --> 02:58:46,560
the story and much and much like our

3967
02:58:44,189 --> 02:58:49,380
cultivars of our land races we've lost

3968
02:58:46,559 --> 02:58:51,448
our land race soils as well we've lost

3969
02:58:49,379 --> 02:58:53,250
that incredible biodiversity and our

3970
02:58:51,449 --> 02:58:56,939
soils in the same way that our land

3971
02:58:53,250 --> 02:58:59,010
races have been lost you know so we're

3972
02:58:56,939 --> 02:59:02,220
really trying to bring that back and

3973
02:58:59,010 --> 02:59:04,818
create more and more diversity hopes

3974
02:59:02,219 --> 02:59:08,760
that only know it's insurance

3975
02:59:04,818 --> 02:59:11,908
soil and lights and other environmental

3976
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:15,590
conditions can certainly affect ratios

3977
02:59:11,908 --> 02:59:18,809
but you're not going to get a new

3978
02:59:15,590 --> 02:59:23,488
cannabinoid with different light or

3979
02:59:18,809 --> 02:59:25,769
different so you have to have the

3980
02:59:23,488 --> 02:59:29,250
surface to be able to produce that

3981
02:59:25,770 --> 02:59:31,529
cabinet oh yeah I totally understand

3982
02:59:29,250 --> 02:59:34,290
that that III I'm thinking more along

3983
02:59:31,529 --> 02:59:35,850
the lines of just information about new

3984
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:37,680
ones that we just haven't heard about

3985
02:59:35,850 --> 02:59:41,340
because I there's not like a list of all

3986
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:43,529
hundred cannabinoids and all there yes I

3987
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:45,210
would like to seed probably you know

3988
02:59:43,529 --> 02:59:47,310
what learn more about that that you know

3989
02:59:45,209 --> 02:59:50,459
it's just not common through testing

3990
02:59:47,309 --> 02:59:53,579
with recreational farms you know to get

3991
02:59:50,459 --> 02:59:56,809
those numbers you gotta remember some of

3992
02:59:53,579 --> 03:00:00,539
the key notes listed like Delta eight

3993
02:59:56,809 --> 03:00:03,318
listeners it's not produced by the plant

3994
03:00:00,540 --> 03:00:08,040
directly there's not a synth bass for it

3995
03:00:03,318 --> 03:00:16,318
most people agree my shulam and dr. o

3996
03:00:08,040 --> 03:00:20,100
solely and doctor weather doctor per

3997
03:00:16,318 --> 03:00:21,879
tree that they say that it's a

3998
03:00:20,100 --> 03:00:25,329
degradation product of

3999
03:00:21,879 --> 03:00:27,699
laughing hours and I'm I guess I'm just

4000
03:00:25,329 --> 03:00:30,010
saying I guess I wish that the labs gave

4001
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:32,409
us more information to where we could

4002
03:00:30,010 --> 03:00:35,479
use that and access that information so

4003
03:00:32,409 --> 03:00:38,398
where we could put the two together

4004
03:00:35,479 --> 03:00:42,760
[Music]

4005
03:00:38,398 --> 03:00:45,879
what's that Sam they they may not know

4006
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:48,610
the answers the labs there they're you

4007
03:00:45,879 --> 03:00:50,589
know doing the best they can but if they

4008
03:00:48,610 --> 03:00:53,710
don't have the knowledge then they

4009
03:00:50,590 --> 03:00:56,920
certainly can't share it yeah a lot of a

4010
03:00:53,709 --> 03:01:00,429
lot of the terpene if you look at soil

4011
03:00:56,920 --> 03:01:02,680
microbiology is there are soil microbes

4012
03:01:00,430 --> 03:01:05,739
that produce a lot of the precursors to

4013
03:01:02,680 --> 03:01:08,380
terminally in the soil so having having

4014
03:01:05,739 --> 03:01:12,850
biodynamic soils it provides those

4015
03:01:08,379 --> 03:01:15,670
precursors please increase the amount of

4016
03:01:12,850 --> 03:01:17,620
terpenes that you get absolutely I've

4017
03:01:15,670 --> 03:01:20,860
seen that myself many many many times

4018
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:23,620
but whether it will create a new term

4019
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:31,360
earthy that you have never had expressed

4020
03:01:23,620 --> 03:01:34,540
before that yeah now would the variation

4021
03:01:31,360 --> 03:01:36,270
in indigenous microorganisms I mean I

4022
03:01:34,540 --> 03:01:38,830
would I'd have to assume that the

4023
03:01:36,270 --> 03:01:41,380
microorganisms in Afghanistan versus

4024
03:01:38,829 --> 03:01:43,840
Morocco earth and have a different ratio

4025
03:01:41,379 --> 03:01:47,949
or different microorganism with that

4026
03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:49,389
then I guess different ratios and

4027
03:01:47,950 --> 03:01:53,170
microorganisms were produced from

4028
03:01:49,389 --> 03:01:55,209
different ratios or turkeying precursors

4029
03:01:53,170 --> 03:02:01,120
are going to probably slightly affect a

4030
03:01:55,209 --> 03:02:03,699
terpenes expression they are you're

4031
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:07,390
looking at easy enough to find out all

4032
03:02:03,700 --> 03:02:10,090
you do is you grow one the same clone in

4033
03:02:07,389 --> 03:02:14,170
Afghanistan soil and you grow it in

4034
03:02:10,090 --> 03:02:17,860
California soil Kansas soil Alaska soil

4035
03:02:14,170 --> 03:02:21,670
etc etc and if there's no it all that's

4036
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:25,210
changing is the amount of the terpenes

4037
03:02:21,670 --> 03:02:29,219
found and not new Turkey they're

4038
03:02:25,209 --> 03:02:29,219
different terpenes than the answer's no

4039
03:02:32,119 --> 03:02:39,290
well may I share one thing I've learned

4040
03:02:34,850 --> 03:02:43,149
is that you can vary the cannabinoid

4041
03:02:39,290 --> 03:02:47,569
ratio the amount of CBD to THC by

4042
03:02:43,148 --> 03:02:50,478
varying when you harvest the plant what

4043
03:02:47,568 --> 03:02:54,049
what I've found for a number of high CBD

4044
03:02:50,478 --> 03:02:57,198
cultivars is if you want the maximum

4045
03:02:54,049 --> 03:03:00,709
amount of CBD and the minimum amount of

4046
03:02:57,199 --> 03:03:03,560
THC you would harvest when you're

4047
03:03:00,709 --> 03:03:06,618
trichomes are still clear and a good

4048
03:03:03,559 --> 03:03:08,988
portion of them have gone milky whereas

4049
03:03:06,619 --> 03:03:12,800
if you wait till most of them are milky

4050
03:03:08,988 --> 03:03:16,488
and a good portion of them are amber the

4051
03:03:12,799 --> 03:03:20,719
CBD levels tend to go down and the THC

4052
03:03:16,488 --> 03:03:24,500
comes up and so you end up creating what

4053
03:03:20,719 --> 03:03:26,929
was a thirty to one if it was harvested

4054
03:03:24,500 --> 03:03:29,359
while trichomes were still clear it

4055
03:03:26,930 --> 03:03:32,720
turns into a four to one if you wait

4056
03:03:29,359 --> 03:03:35,658
till they're amber I haven't seen that

4057
03:03:32,719 --> 03:03:37,488
much of an extreme difference but I

4058
03:03:35,658 --> 03:03:40,568
absolutely agree with what you're saying

4059
03:03:37,488 --> 03:03:44,448
that's even myself in my lab for you

4060
03:03:40,568 --> 03:03:45,618
yeah I know I have farms are harvesting

4061
03:03:44,449 --> 03:03:50,090
early just to prevent that

4062
03:03:45,619 --> 03:03:51,800
bioaccumulation is the THD nice

4063
03:03:50,090 --> 03:03:53,389
we've even noticed that temperature

4064
03:03:51,799 --> 03:03:56,840
changes you know being greenhouse

4065
03:03:53,389 --> 03:03:59,478
growers that we are you know it the

4066
03:03:56,840 --> 03:04:01,130
maturity can change overnight it's

4067
03:03:59,478 --> 03:04:03,049
incredible you know we'll be looking at

4068
03:04:01,129 --> 03:04:05,148
you know the heads they'll be maybe

4069
03:04:03,049 --> 03:04:07,849
crystal clear and then we have a really

4070
03:04:05,148 --> 03:04:11,000
cold night and then they all turn amber

4071
03:04:07,850 --> 03:04:13,790
within hours so temperature really seems

4072
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:16,879
to be a big part of it as well it's also

4073
03:04:13,790 --> 03:04:20,090
very dependent on varieties sometimes

4074
03:04:16,879 --> 03:04:24,519
some varieties cold temperatures speed

4075
03:04:20,090 --> 03:04:24,520
above other ones it slows it down

4076
03:04:26,139 --> 03:04:30,769
great conversation today so far guys I

4077
03:04:29,148 --> 03:04:33,349
mean it's been three hours we've been

4078
03:04:30,770 --> 03:04:35,658
rocking it out we've spoke we started on

4079
03:04:33,350 --> 03:04:37,729
a depressing topic with the fires and

4080
03:04:35,658 --> 03:04:39,078
but we always got to cover things maybe

4081
03:04:37,728 --> 03:04:41,898
even if we don't necessarily think

4082
03:04:39,078 --> 03:04:44,840
they're super positive and we got into a

4083
03:04:41,898 --> 03:04:45,108
little hash conversation Cubans blasted

4084
03:04:44,840 --> 03:04:47,988
out

4085
03:04:45,109 --> 03:04:51,469
but he was able to share a little of

4086
03:04:47,988 --> 03:04:52,818
that solvent with sauce with us and that

4087
03:04:51,468 --> 03:04:54,408
text so you guys got those good

4088
03:04:52,818 --> 03:04:56,718
Instagram accounts that if you want to

4089
03:04:54,408 --> 03:05:00,408
go follow I think all greens extraction

4090
03:04:56,718 --> 03:05:01,998
was one and diet funk was another Cuban

4091
03:05:00,408 --> 03:05:03,770
put a couple other ones I'm sure he'll

4092
03:05:01,998 --> 03:05:07,179
shout them out on his Instagram or

4093
03:05:03,770 --> 03:05:09,469
whatnot but yeah I don't know I think

4094
03:05:07,179 --> 03:05:11,270
three hours is pretty solid

4095
03:05:09,468 --> 03:05:15,468
I'm sure the Dragonfly earth medicine

4096
03:05:11,270 --> 03:05:16,299
crew has much much work to go do my

4097
03:05:15,468 --> 03:05:20,059
correct

4098
03:05:16,299 --> 03:05:23,209
yeah we do we've had minimal we've had

4099
03:05:20,059 --> 03:05:25,278
minimal sleep lately and yeah thankful

4100
03:05:23,209 --> 03:05:27,439
for it and we are I mean the harvest

4101
03:05:25,279 --> 03:05:29,810
this year has been unbelievable that

4102
03:05:27,439 --> 03:05:31,699
means food fruit all the apples are

4103
03:05:29,809 --> 03:05:34,398
coming on at the same time we've got the

4104
03:05:31,699 --> 03:05:35,779
kids in their canning you know we're out

4105
03:05:34,398 --> 03:05:38,748
here clipping that's all it's all

4106
03:05:35,779 --> 03:05:42,770
happening and we are just so incredibly

4107
03:05:38,748 --> 03:05:44,539
thankful and we're really to be with you

4108
03:05:42,770 --> 03:05:49,729
all

4109
03:05:44,539 --> 03:05:52,998
general temperatures well we've had a

4110
03:05:49,728 --> 03:05:54,978
combination of high temperatures and

4111
03:05:52,998 --> 03:05:57,189
then not so high temperatures only

4112
03:05:54,978 --> 03:06:00,408
because it's been so and you know

4113
03:05:57,189 --> 03:06:03,709
atmospherically smokey and most of

4114
03:06:00,408 --> 03:06:05,538
British Columbia so it can be as nice as

4115
03:06:03,709 --> 03:06:10,159
it wants to outside but if you don't see

4116
03:06:05,539 --> 03:06:12,829
the Sun it's not actually been that warm

4117
03:06:10,158 --> 03:06:14,478
I mean it's it's been pretty stagnant in

4118
03:06:12,828 --> 03:06:16,279
a lot of ways too with the wind there's

4119
03:06:14,478 --> 03:06:17,568
been like really kind of minimal wind

4120
03:06:16,279 --> 03:06:20,389
and stuff we usually have a really good

4121
03:06:17,568 --> 03:06:23,078
clear of wind and stuff so you know

4122
03:06:20,388 --> 03:06:25,638
other than that it's the just the

4123
03:06:23,078 --> 03:06:27,529
naturalness of just this this time of

4124
03:06:25,638 --> 03:06:30,048
year and we're starting to get colder

4125
03:06:27,529 --> 03:06:31,639
nights so that you know the the plants

4126
03:06:30,049 --> 03:06:34,579
are maturing and and they're coming in

4127
03:06:31,638 --> 03:06:37,638
it's beautiful yeah well I'll definitely

4128
03:06:34,578 --> 03:06:40,520
give a hug to sky and Sierra and you

4129
03:06:37,638 --> 03:06:44,059
guys take care up there in the coots of

4130
03:06:40,520 --> 03:06:48,289
Kootenay Lake to you guys during this

4131
03:06:44,059 --> 03:06:51,978
birthday time and everyone on the aid

4132
03:06:48,289 --> 03:06:54,560
mark and Sam and Tom and everyone nice

4133
03:06:51,978 --> 03:06:56,708
to see everyone that was here we

4134
03:06:54,559 --> 03:06:58,769
appreciate the conversation yeah I just

4135
03:06:56,709 --> 03:07:01,020
recall the last time we

4136
03:06:58,770 --> 03:07:04,859
saw each other which we were texting

4137
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:07,828
about it was my first time going to the

4138
03:07:04,859 --> 03:07:11,100
Emerald cup this year and and joshing

4139
03:07:07,828 --> 03:07:12,988
Kelly said look for the TP yeah look for

4140
03:07:11,100 --> 03:07:15,119
the TP the TP will stand out there's

4141
03:07:12,988 --> 03:07:17,279
only one TP there at the Emerald cup and

4142
03:07:15,119 --> 03:07:18,720
certainly right after the gate where you

4143
03:07:17,279 --> 03:07:22,439
get in and you get your card to go

4144
03:07:18,719 --> 03:07:24,599
Medicaid there is the TP and so I found

4145
03:07:22,439 --> 03:07:26,340
the TP before I found the innards of the

4146
03:07:24,600 --> 03:07:29,220
Emerald cup I was hanging out with our

4147
03:07:26,340 --> 03:07:30,869
friends Josh and Kelly and Josh I don't

4148
03:07:29,219 --> 03:07:33,389
know if you remember but you gave me a

4149
03:07:30,869 --> 03:07:38,670
can of gar remember that category you

4150
03:07:33,389 --> 03:07:40,528
gave me yeah I want that to del Fest

4151
03:07:38,670 --> 03:07:42,658
this year which is a Bluegrass Festival

4152
03:07:40,529 --> 03:07:46,199
that I go to in Western Maryland and

4153
03:07:42,658 --> 03:07:48,449
during Del McCoury bands Saturday nights

4154
03:07:46,199 --> 03:07:50,158
at we we smoked that in front of the

4155
03:07:48,449 --> 03:07:52,199
band and they were looking down saying

4156
03:07:50,158 --> 03:07:54,420
oh my god look at that thing is it a

4157
03:07:52,199 --> 03:07:54,840
cigar is it a joint what the hell is

4158
03:07:54,420 --> 03:07:57,510
that

4159
03:07:54,840 --> 03:07:58,710
that thing burned for an hour long I
