yeah oh yeah oh yeah I forgot

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,759
something on your seats of course you

5
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,359
you've all got the little gifts of

6
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,920
extracts but you've also got this

7
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,640
fabulous bookmark and you're looking at

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,480
it you're saying great I'm going to read

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,198
something with it right turn it over on

10
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,599
the

11
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:52,519
back if it is signed by

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,480
Paul you have been given a free copy of

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,000
my celium running and he will sign it

14
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,000
for you up

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
here

16
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,569
[Music]

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
this is going to be um this is going to

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,079
be an immersion talk I hope that

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
subsequent this talk your lives will

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,239
forever be changed for the better um

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,200
this is a a culmination of over 40 years

22
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,599
of research and I'm just so honored to

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
be the messenger of this knowledge it's

24
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,118
really hard and and know it's not right

25
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,478
I can't claim ownership of this

26
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,959
knowledge but I feel like I'm a conduit

27
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:36,879
and um the end of this talk there's an

28
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,478
epiphany that is taken me 30 years to

29
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,319
achieve epip usually happen faster but

30
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,959
not with me um and so but I want you to

31
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,359
sort of clear your receptor sites open

32
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:53,399
up your minds take a deep breath hold on

33
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:58,078
to your proverbial hat um and um I do

34
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,680
speak rather quickly um but the um

35
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:05,919
Avalanche of knowledge that is about to

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,118
wash over you is U something that is

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,280
that really speaks to guyan intelligence

38
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:12,439
the intelligence of Nature and I'm just

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,560
so honored at this time critical period

40
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,199
in the evolution of Life on this planet

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,400
that I'm alive to be one of the

42
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,598
messengers and there'll be more

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Messengers obviously you know in the

44
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:26,839
future so um okay so I want to tell you

45
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,799
about my hat because Jeff has one oh I

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,000
wanted to first I want to dedicate this

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,680
uh talk to Steve Shephard Steve will you

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,680
please stand up

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,080
so uh Dr Steve Shephard is the chair of

50
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,519
enology at Washington State

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,159
University um and our relationship has

52
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,239
been magical it's been catalyic uh it's

53
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:53,799
a dance of minds and spirits that I

54
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,959
think U synergizes to something that'll

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,879
U lead to an evolutionary jump and what

56
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,759
we can do to help this planet so this

57
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,798
hat is made from a mushroom called amadu

58
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:09,719
amadu is a birch poly por it's a hard

59
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:14,280
wood con and amadu um is a mushroom that

60
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:16,239
really is uh responsible for why humans

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,479
survived especially thousands of years

62
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,599
ago there's no doubt that we came from

63
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,238
Africa 40,000 years ago we migrated

64
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,759
North into Europe we discovered

65
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,878
something new called winter oops and

66
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,560
this mushroom allowed for the

67
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:32,560
portability of fire this called a Tinder

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,400
CLK uh and our ancestors realized if you

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Hollow this mushroom out put EMP of fire

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,519
inside it can carry fire for days now

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,519
ceremonially today in First Peoples the

72
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,000
firekeeper of the of the clan um has a

73
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,360
very important symbolic role but not too

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,719
long ago they literally held the life of

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,799
the clan in their hands because as you

76
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,239
approach the winter if you couldn't

77
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,760
Kindle a fire uh then of course you know

78
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,000
the freezing temperatures would be very

79
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,199
very detrimental so moreover um this

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,680
mushroom when you put it into lie water

81
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,798
ashes and water and pull it after a few

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,959
days it delaminates into melum and so

83
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,719
this mushroom is made of melum um and

84
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,280
our this is this tradition has been

85
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,798
going on for thousands of years this hat

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,319
is actually made by some ladies in

87
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,000
Transylvania um and there's about seven

88
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,639
or eight hat makers a few years ago now

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,319
there's only three or four um and this

90
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,519
is an example of the threat of knowledge

91
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,279
that goes through time and because of

92
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,478
disease War relig religious persecution

93
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,918
you know accidents the the threads of

94
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,319
knowledge have been clipped and um and

95
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,439
this is why it's so important with first

96
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,959
people here the on on the west Western

97
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,079
North America in particular the oral

98
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,519
Traditions when there's disease and they

99
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,120
lose their Elders they lose that contact

100
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,279
you know to the ancient past so this

101
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,399
mushroom also revolutionized Warfare in

102
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,879
Napoleonic times um this this mushroom

103
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:59,038
became the the the punk that made Flint

104
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,279
spark spark guns work it created the

105
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,120
spark that the gunpowder so there's a

106
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,159
massive amount of trade in Napoleonic

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,800
times of the of the Amad mushroom um

108
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,520
this mushroom also is the first mushroom

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,280
ever found to have an antiviral property

110
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,478
highly active against the mosaic virus

111
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,959
uh which afflicts many many plants um

112
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:23,918
and um this mushroom um has other

113
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,478
properties um that are key to the

114
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:29,000
ecosystem that I'll be showing you in in

115
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,038
the very near future here so I have a

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,720
few other f friends and I'll be talking

117
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,439
about amadu a lot I'll be talking about

118
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,720
the red RI mushroom that I have

119
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:42,800
here you'll be hearing about the red

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,680
belted polypore which is called um

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,319
phomopsis picula these are all up on the

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,360
slide here by the way so as I hold these

123
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,199
up you can see them um and then there is

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,319
another Birch poor called cha innot

125
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,720
oblas so these are four of the species

126
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,639
I'll be talking about but I have one

127
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,639
other friend I brought with me

128
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,000
and this is a garon a garon goes

129
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,038
exclusively in the old growth forest

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,839
it's known as f topsis a fish nus it is

131
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,079
uh now thought to be extinct largely in

132
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,560
Europe a few sky islands in Austria and

133
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,399
Slovenia uh and the high ales but

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,478
otherwise largely extinct in Europe

135
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,079
because they cut down the old growth

136
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,279
forest it still grows in Northern

137
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:28,079
California Oregon Washington State and

138
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,918
here in British Columbia diares

139
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:34,399
described this Mushroom in 5 ad 2,000

140
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:37,680
years ago as elerium at longum vum the

141
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,159
elixir of long life um and this mushroom

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,400
I suggest to you is similar in a

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,120
significance in terms of it medical and

144
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:50,198
benefit for human survival as we enter

145
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,759
into the next Century so I want to um

146
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,759
well here we

147
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:02,279
go so the title of my talk is mus of

148
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,720
melum in the worldwide food web and

149
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,878
micro diversity is essential for

150
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,319
biocurity we live in this wonderful

151
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,759
Planet but we've now entered into Sixx

152
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,759
the sixth greatest Extinction event

153
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,199
known in the history of life this planet

154
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,800
but this Extinction event is not caused

155
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,840
by an asteroid it's not CA by methane

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,759
hydrate hydrate bursts out of the ocean

157
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:26,598
um is not caused by Cosmic race is

158
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,479
caused by an organism by us not only we

159
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:31,038
the cause of this Extinction event but

160
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:34,079
we're very likely to be is vicin but I

161
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:37,519
think there is a path for human survival

162
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:40,038
in in um in the dance with nature and

163
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,478
that is if we follow the path of melum I

164
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:44,878
think we will be well rewarded as well

165
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,680
Justified well unfortunately there's a

166
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,960
lot of bad news before we get to the

167
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,478
good news and this is an article that

168
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,519
came out in science just recently and

169
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:58,560
basically 58% of the of the the species

170
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:02,359
richness uh in the land masses have gone

171
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,478
now down below the caring capacity for a

172
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,520
sustainability and so we have fracturing

173
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,240
ecosystems we're artificially supporting

174
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,439
our food web through importation of

175
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,478
foods we have factory farming uh in the

176
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,120
pursuit of efficiency we lose

177
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:19,959
biodiversity but there is a a context

178
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,598
here when we bring fungi into the into

179
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,799
the conversation in terms of ecological

180
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,918
stability there's lots of benefits that

181
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,240
are being reaped but let's first go back

182
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:34,199
in time this is a pict gra in a in a

183
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,240
cave in Northern Algeria that Ayan andar

184
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,158
Plateau um and this was from 7,000 years

185
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,879
ago it's very interesting to me because

186
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,240
there is um a there's a term that argon

187
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,799
Watson described it's called mobia the

188
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,759
irrational fear of fungi um and it's

189
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,559
really quite clear what the artist's

190
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,159
intention was here the artist was really

191
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,159
excited about

192
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,039
mushrooms even though this is in scient

193
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
several scientific journals not none of

194
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,519
the scientists would dare speculate what

195
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,680
the intent of the artist was or what

196
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,278
these little Figures were well I think

197
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,359
this speaks to something that also

198
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:16,958
afflicts the Sciences in that you know

199
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,919
we in our experiential viewscape uh we

200
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,359
have long-term contact with animals and

201
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,679
plants we have a familiarity Factor but

202
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,519
mushrooms they come up and they

203
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,799
disappear in a few days typically the

204
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,919
flesher mushrooms and so mushrooms that

205
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,679
are so ephemeral and you only encounter

206
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,360
their very infrequently and there

207
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,719
suddenly gone but with something that

208
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,480
can feed you that can kill you that can

209
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,959
heal you that can send you on a

210
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,320
psychedelic spiritual journey and yet

211
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,319
disappears you know our experiential

212
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,560
context is very very limited so it's

213
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,160
natural for humans to fear that which is

214
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,278
so powerful but which is not well

215
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,639
understood so now we we've come to a new

216
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,039
threshold of knowledge and um and this

217
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,199
knowledge I think is just really

218
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:01,799
revolutionary in its implications well

219
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:06,200
going forward in time this is 450 BCE

220
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:09,078
and this is a a a a Codi where demer is

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,560
giving prapan a mushroom uh and upon

222
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:12,879
consuming the mushroom then she goes

223
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,239
into the underworld this is speaks to

224
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,360
the origination myth and Greek culture

225
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,079
of the seasons and so the winter would

226
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,159
ensue and then the spring she would come

227
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:23,359
back up and you know the crops will grow

228
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,679
and warmer environments and this is the

229
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,959
cyol the seasons all related to deer

230
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,559
giving prapan this mushroom mov and she

231
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,159
went to the underworld there a great

232
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,838
book called The Road to elus the Elan

233
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,120
Mysteries that speaks about the

234
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,360
religious use of psychoactive mushrooms

235
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:43,000
by the Greek cultures Plato um Sophocles

236
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,399
Aristotle all partook of these magical

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,240
mushroom Brews and a great teston in

238
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:52,519
Greek culture thousands of years ago but

239
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,039
hypocrates around 460 BCE first

240
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,440
mentioned amadu uh for carzing wounds it

241
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,439
was recognized back then as being highly

242
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,720
flamable and it was very very good has

243
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
an anti-inflammatory as well as carzing

244
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,639
wounds because of this flammability and

245
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:10,000
as I mentioned diares in about 65 ad the

246
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,519
very first Materia Meda um introduced a

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,360
gacon um and recorded it it was used

248
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,360
long before that of course um as highly

249
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,120
active against respiratory illnesses

250
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,600
especially consumption so um these this

251
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
gives you sort of the threat of

252
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,480
knowledge going back over the eons that

253
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
the use of these mushrooms were actually

254
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,039
and knowledge of were quite pervasive

255
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,599
but I always like give credit to my

256
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,240
teachers and so this is uh Dr Daniel

257
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,000
stunts from the University of Washington

258
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,360
Dr Alexander Smith from the University

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,759
of Michigan Katherine skates from Post

260
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,519
Falls Idaho and Michael Bu from The

261
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,639
Evergreen State College he was my direct

262
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,078
Professor these three individuals have

263
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,680
passed on and Michael bu and I are still

264
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,838
in contact I just saw him last week and

265
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,120
um I came into the field of mology

266
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,880
rather Young when I about 16 or 17 years

267
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,759
of age my interest in mushrooms um and

268
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,838
when I was about 18 19 19 years of age I

269
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:06,639
was sort of adopted by these these huge

270
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,079
giants in the field of micology um and

271
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,360
they took me under their wi all the more

272
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,359
surprising because Alexander Smith in

273
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,839
particular and Daniel stunts were yeah

274
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,000
politically conservative individuals so

275
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:21,279
when I came on the scene um in about

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,240
1975 it was um all the more surprising

277
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,000
that they took a liking to me because

278
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,000
this is what I look

279
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,278
like your suspicions are I'll

280
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,720
[Music]

281
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:37,399
confirm so um but they saw that I had

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,160
sincere interest and and Bui and of

283
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,639
course had magic mushrooms and the

284
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,719
reason I had such an interest in magic

285
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,560
mushrooms in particular is because of my

286
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,000
dear brother John who unfortunately

287
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,879
passed away a few years ago um John went

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,519
down to Mexico and Colombia came back

289
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,958
with these fantastic stories of eating

290
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,799
soul and mushrooms I really excited I'm

291
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,879
the youngest son the youngest child in

292
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,838
my family of five John was the oldest

293
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,320
brother but John was was a serious

294
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,399
scientist we grew up in a small town in

295
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,278
Ohio we had a complete laboratory in the

296
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,559
basement I'm talking three rows of

297
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,159
chemicals on on on on shelves three

298
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,439
three shelf rows of chemicals and my

299
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,639
father was a lieutenant and that y car

300
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,680
there in trepid and so after wood War II

301
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,039
he got the Intrepid aircraft carrier

302
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,120
radio the main radio so we had that in

303
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,719
the basement and my brother would let me

304
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,198
play in the laboratory on the radio and

305
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,278
and I was listening to all these cated

306
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:29,919
messages behind the Iron Curtain strung

307
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,360
these long wave antennas and it was just

308
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,799
totally exciting I was this boy

309
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
scientist I thought oh when I grow up

310
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,198
I'm going to be a scientist you know

311
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,120
have own laboratory because my brother

312
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,159
wouldn't let me play in the laboratory

313
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,240
so John went on the Yale my brother bill

314
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,439
went on the Cornell uh my sister went on

315
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,560
the Ohio State and then I had the

316
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,959
laboratory to myself you know which I

317
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,479
remember immediately looking up every

318
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:53,439
experiment and said danger do not bring

319
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,000
their flame boom um I had a few of those

320
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,199
um but that was sort of really imprinted

321
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,278
me and now I'm living my life's stream

322
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,359
you know I'm fortunate and gratified

323
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:06,838
that I have a a wonderful company I have

324
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,278
75 employees I I Own 100% I have no debt

325
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,680
um it's been a long road I'm here today

326
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,039
because of the generosity and kindness

327
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:16,559
of many people including many people in

328
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,799
this room many of you so I have really

329
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,000
you know been been um sort of imprinted

330
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,278
uh by this love of Science and um and

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,958
from my family and I want to give a deep

332
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:28,879
respect to my brother John who really

333
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,879
first inspired me but this is where I

334
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,879
love like to say we go to church on

335
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,240
Sundays I like to go in the old growth

336
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,759
forest I grew up in a Charismatic

337
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
Christian environment um after my family

338
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,120
sort fell apart my mom became very

339
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
religious and my mother says when are

340
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,519
you going to go to church and I go mom I

341
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
go to the Old Forest all the time so to

342
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,720
me that's like I going to church but

343
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,560
let's look at the the ecosystem of the

344
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,600
of the forest and to get better

345
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,919
understanding this is a cross-section of

346
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,040
the mixed deciduous Conor for Forest

347
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,479
there are sacrific fungi that break down

348
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:01,078
dead wood there are the endic fungi that

349
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,600
are inside Tri of trees and leaves in

350
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,239
fact there literally can several hundred

351
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,399
species been identified tically that are

352
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,079
growing beneficially to help the host

353
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,958
defensive immunity of plants against

354
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:16,078
infections and then the microa fun lots

355
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,638
of you uh know about this and I want to

356
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,719
give a shout out to Dr Suzanne Samar she

357
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,959
is a hero of mine she's a micro rology

358
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,160
you know and micrology here in British

359
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:28,599
Columbia and then there's a parasitic

360
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,799
fungi that can kill weakened trees and

361
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,120
uh and then often times grow cytic like

362
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,000
Jeff mentioned the honey mushroom is a

363
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,000
parasite and they can grow

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,639
cytic well as wasn't until just recently

365
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,839
that scientist discovered that all

366
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,480
plants are part fungus now I remember

367
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,000
doing thick thin sectioning in the

368
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
botney and looking under the microscope

369
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,799
and I see threads of fungi and my

370
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,240
professor would say oh they're

371
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,198
infections it's causing a disease well

372
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,318
now we know that they aren't many of

373
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,078
these threads of fungi are part of the

374
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:00,838
community of fungi that gives the host

375
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,479
uh organism the plant better immune

376
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,720
protection and um and the consorting of

377
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,079
the spongy really make a huge difference

378
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,079
in terms of their survival now excellent

379
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,638
book I highly recommend is micral

380
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,159
symbiosis this is the little pine tree

381
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,318
this is the root here but all this is

382
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,159
the rizosphere this is the microsphere

383
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,120
around the rizosphere and it literally

384
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,958
extends the root zones hundreds if not

385
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,240
thousands of times the plants are

386
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,278
secreting sugars and then and they're

387
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,519
benefiting the fungi and the fungi are

388
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,679
then uh contributing Minal that then

389
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,839
helps the plants to grow but increases

390
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,719
the moisture absorption capability and

391
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,839
the mineral untake uptake enormously

392
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,480
well yeah so science is so slow to catch

393
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,240
up to me what I think is the obvious but

394
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,278
this is a great experiment it was only

395
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,399
done in

396
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,360
2013 and this experiment kind of

397
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,078
revolutionized our understanding of the

398
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,039
communication networks that Suzanne

399
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,799
samart and other ones other scientists

400
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,318
are now talking about and what these

401
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,078
scientists did is they had five bean

402
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,039
plants and separate pots and they uh the

403
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:03,758
beans were growing up fine and they

404
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:07,318
exposed the first bean plant with aphids

405
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,318
well immediately um anti-aid alids

406
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,639
uptick uh uh were coed and expressed by

407
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,240
the plant that was being attacked by

408
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,640
apids as a protection uh these were

409
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,160
toxic Al alids the apids well the other

410
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,959
four plants did not of course they

411
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
didn't have direct contact when they

412
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,759
repeated the experiment and they put all

413
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,519
five plants in the same common U vessel

414
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:30,000
of soil where the microsphere of the

415
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,079
melum then inter connected when they

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,279
exposed the first plant with aphids what

417
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:38,319
happened all four other plants remote

418
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,839
from contact up regulated the anti-aid

419
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,960
alkaloids this then proved for the first

420
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,079
time the scientists that the melum

421
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,000
actually is a communication pathway that

422
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,798
is communicating in order to protect the

423
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,759
community of organisms within the

424
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,038
biosphere to be able to protect the

425
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,839
biodiversity and so this was an

426
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:57,679
astonishing breakthrough on our

427
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,319
understanding that these myal networks

428
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,440
are actually communication NW n works as

429
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,240
well now mycelium can take many

430
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,240
different forms this is just some of the

431
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,599
forms that I I enjoy and this next is a

432
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
10day sequence and so often times my

433
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,480
time La sequence don't work and this is

434
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,759
the melum rep dis this is a lot of part

435
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,759
of my life I have about 700 strains in

436
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:23,079
in culture of melium about over 500

437
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:25,038
species in our laboratory complex um but

438
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:26,599
we most mostly primarily focus on

439
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,759
sacrifice because I'm naturally

440
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:32,158
impatient and I'm very interested in

441
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:35,200
saic fungi sapic fungi break down Li

442
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,679
cellulose the primary plant constituents

443
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,000
and um and so we take wood primarily we

444
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,919
had melium lots of things happen but

445
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,640
ultimately we generate soil so these

446
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,320
sacratic fungi are the grand molecular

447
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,159
disassembles of nature the soil

448
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:52,158
magicians they break down complex plant

449
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,480
and animal tissue and they render It

450
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,480
ultimately into soil and that way of

451
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,480
decomposition then feeds many other

452
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,400
communities and and in in in um in the

453
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
ecosystem now I'm involved in the

454
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,798
permaculture movement and I was at a

455
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,080
zeri conference and the Zer permaculture

456
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,839
people were wondering how is it possible

457
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,480
mushrooms grow in in the desert we you

458
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,839
know we have these mul sheep piles and

459
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,038
then suddenly all these mushrooms are to

460
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,759
form and I realized that that they did

461
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:21,640
not know if you take a 100 like 100

462
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:24,200
kilos of uh of sawdust for instance up

463
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,520
to 20 kilos of water will be released

464
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,519
out of 100 kilos of dried sawas mushroom

465
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:33,480
melium generat water so it inhales

466
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,200
oxygen it's then breaking down Li

467
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,798
cellulous it combines hydrogen oxygen to

468
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,840
H2O and so it generates its own water

469
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,519
hydrating the habitats in advance of

470
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,279
contact this makes sense because around

471
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,359
compost piles many of you've seen little

472
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,759
puddles of water that's what's happening

473
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:50,879
so very interesting article because of

474
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:53,640
monoculture and I spent a lot of time in

475
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,159
the woods uh for 3 years I was in the

476
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,880
wood products industry actually four

477
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,799
years I was U I ran I was on the green

478
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,440
chain pulling Saw Mill I caught up in a

479
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,400
shingle Mill I went into as a logger I

480
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,279
set chokers became a rig and Slinger

481
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,038
three guys in my crew got killed and

482
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,839
they wanted me to appoint me when I was

483
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,558
21 years of age as the head of the crew

484
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,279
I said I'm going back to college um but

485
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,359
those three guys who died I mean I they

486
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,000
I depended upon them for my life and

487
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,719
they depended upon me so I really got a

488
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,919
feeling of deep Brotherhood and respect

489
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,200
for the School of Hard kns so a shout

490
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,600
out to all those people who've gone

491
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,519
through this scho of hard KN who have a

492
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:31,240
great respect but unfortunately because

493
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:33,158
of mono culture of slash and burn

494
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,519
planting trees slash and burn

495
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,679
unfortunately we're harming the

496
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:39,480
biodiversity of the ecosystem um and now

497
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,679
we are seeing um that we are getting

498
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,519
premature decline as soil lenses become

499
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,880
thinner the carbon exported out of the

500
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,960
ecosystem but it's very inter this that

501
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,280
in healthy soils 70% of the soils are

502
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,038
composed of microbial mass and 30% of

503
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:57,599
that soil mass is fungal so 20 1%

504
00:20:55,038 --> 00:21:00,480
approximately of healthy soil is fungal

505
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,439
cells living or dead that's how much

506
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,200
fungi there is literally in under the

507
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,080
under your feet upon every step that you

508
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,679
make on soil now I spent many years as a

509
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,439
scanning electron microscopist this is

510
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
some of my electron micrographs here's

511
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,440
the mushroom myum under under electron

512
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,400
microscope and then under the response

513
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,960
to four environmental stimuli well

514
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,480
introduction of rain we've had lots of

515
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,759
that turn to be a great mushroom season

516
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,519
when you have introduction of rain and

517
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,558
water that's one you also have

518
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,079
evaporation so you have cooling so drop

519
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,480
in temperature that's what happens in

520
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,519
the fall that's number two the third is

521
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,038
the melium then as it comes up to the

522
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:40,480
wet surface it exhales carbon dioxide

523
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,519
inhales oxygen so exposure to oxygen is

524
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,599
number three and the fourth one is quite

525
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,240
surprising to many people is light 99%

526
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,000
of all mushrooms require light before

527
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,798
the mycelium will produce a mushroom

528
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,759
fruit body and so light is critical for

529
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,440
mushroom formation so those are the four

530
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:00,759
primary stimuli now the fact that we

531
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,759
exhale carbon oide in fungi 2 speaks to

532
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,278
our common evolutionary relationship 650

533
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,679
million years ago there there we had a

534
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:11,400
common ancestor in fact a new super

535
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,559
Kingdom has been created called a pisant

536
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,759
that joined Animalia and fungi together

537
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,278
at that split when we split from fungi

538
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,158
the fungi went underground externally

539
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:23,159
digesting its nutrients outside it cell

540
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,799
walls we chose the path of in

541
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,799
circulating our nutrients in a cellular

542
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,200
sa and then producing enzymes and

543
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,038
digesting foods Within so that's kind of

544
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,519
the split between animals and fungi

545
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,319
fungi e digest our nutrients externally

546
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,759
we digest our nutrients internally so in

547
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,558
respons is for environmental stimuli

548
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,798
then a mushroom then severly emerges and

549
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:46,720
a matter of four or 5 days it goes from

550
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,519
this state here to this state now

551
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,839
mushrooms actually do not have a good

552
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,038
very good immune system most all of them

553
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,240
because they're the fruit bodies like a

554
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:57,158
peach on a tree it ripens it attracts

555
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,319
herbivores you know and us and insects

556
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,080
and animals just spread the pits and

557
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:03,240
spread the seeds mushrooms are no

558
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,079
different they're very very protein and

559
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,558
sugar rich but they're delicious and

560
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,839
they attract a lot of animals that can

561
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,119
help spread the spores so but I'm

562
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:13,119
fascinated with the decomposition cycles

563
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,239
of mushrooms and so the mushrooms then

564
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,519
as they begin to decompose for instance

565
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,599
there's a rush lless species in the Old

566
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,918
grth Forest a few days later I come back

567
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,119
and all sorts of spores are germinating

568
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,840
there's other fungi and lots of bacteria

569
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,519
a whole you know microbiome is evolving

570
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,199
and then a few days later it goes

571
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,000
underground e goes Subterranean in a

572
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,240
single inch of soil there can be more

573
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,319
than a mile of these Thin Red like

574
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,558
threads of melium my foot covers

575
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:43,439
approximately 300 miles of melium and so

576
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:46,359
the melum actually is resident in the

577
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,600
ecosystem for a very long time the melum

578
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:51,158
is the immune system of the mushroom and

579
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,839
my friend Patrick hicki made these

580
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,200
movies and when he made these

581
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,759
microscopic movies it really

582
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,319
revolutionized our understanding about

583
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,158
the how these fungal networks work these

584
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,399
are are bundles of nuclei that are

585
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,120
streaming through the mycelial networks

586
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,640
and notice that they surge in clusters

587
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,399
well as it turns out melum grows and a

588
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,360
SWAT of mycelium the breath of my arms

589
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,679
here can literally have billions of end

590
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,119
branches are constantly forking at the

591
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,038
very very tips they become polynuclear

592
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,959
many nuclei for cell later on they just

593
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:22,038
have two nuclei for cell as the mcel

594
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,640
that's old but the melum you know all

595
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:25,359
nuclei don't go in One Direction some of

596
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,159
them are going backwards against

597
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,719
cytoplasmic flow and so think of the at

598
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,919
the branches the tips there's hundreds

599
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,319
of nuclei sometimes per cell and it just

600
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,360
takes two nuclei to reassort and if

601
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:40,639
there's a new insect a new toxin a new

602
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:42,519
piece of plants a new piece of wood and

603
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,960
if they code for the enzyme that can

604
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,119
break down that new potential food

605
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,240
resource and then they can incorporate

606
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,959
it what happens the melium surges but

607
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,880
then that genetic information becomes

608
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,720
encoded within the melium so not only

609
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,840
are these externalized digestive

610
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,919
membranes not only these externalized

611
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,359
lungs exhaling carbon dioxide inhaling

612
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,880
inhaling oxygen but these are are

613
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,719
learning networks you know these are

614
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,880
these are Micron neurological networks

615
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,159
that are constantly adapting to sudden

616
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,559
chains to C catastroph and they're able

617
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,600
to navigate and then learn and encode

618
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:20,038
within them within their genetic memory

619
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,879
the ability to to have that information

620
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:26,558
to help them to survive in the future so

621
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,320
we're up here in the BC Zone um and

622
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,240
here's the Columbia River and I live

623
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,398
near Olympia Washington and we're going

624
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,079
to fly down here to the John Day

625
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:36,678
Wilderness I literally hired an airplane

626
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:40,398
and flew down there to see the biggest

627
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:44,559
organism in the world is a myal map 2200

628
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:47,000
acres in size 1665 football fields and

629
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,519
it's one cell wall thick now think of

630
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,200
that you have five or six skin layers

631
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,558
that protect you from infection the

632
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,038
melium has one cell wall on the other

633
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,440
side of which are hundreds of millions

634
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,038
of microbes per gram many of which are

635
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,880
trying to consume it how is that

636
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:01,679
possible possible how is it possible the

637
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,080
largest organism in the world only has

638
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,440
one Thin cell layer that protects it

639
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,599
from from infection it's because it's a

640
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,880
constant bi communication with his

641
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:13,038
ecosystem it's able to navigate is able

642
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,360
to learn to adjust in this case the

643
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,599
largest organism in the world is a

644
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:19,599
hunting mushroom now I hired an airplane

645
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,759
and I flew down there once as a small

646
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,959
Bush pilot with a cloth you cloth

647
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,519
airplane uh covered airplane I went down

648
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,079
there and we couldn't find it and we had

649
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,879
the L latitude longitude from the

650
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,798
scientific article on this and we went

651
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,240
back to Boe field and we looked at our

652
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,079
our you know maps and I was there so the

653
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,839
next day we flew back down there again I

654
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,119
flew up and flew down there I still

655
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,839
couldn't see it so we had a climb an

656
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,678
elevation a climbing elevation so we

657
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:47,000
spiral up spiral up and I finally I saw

658
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,840
it and we're at 14,500 ft we just came

659
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,960
from sea level and I told the pilot I

660
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,558
think I'm going to faint and he goes me

661
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,798
too I oh no so let me get this

662
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:58,960
Photograph boom I took this Photograph

663
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,319
the best phot photogra I think of the

664
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,798
largest org in the world and when you

665
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,678
and it would kill the trees and so the

666
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,119
fort service would cut them down because

667
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,519
of lightning strikes C Firs but this is

668
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,599
basically the honey mushroom this is

669
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,679
what the trees look like I suspect for

670
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:15,599
my hiking in the sub alpar regions of of

671
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,919
the Cascades in the Olympics I wonder if

672
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,439
these mushrooms are actually Meadow

673
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,480
makers they actually climax the forest

674
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,720
they kill it the trees then die off and

675
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,798
Meadows come back and this is the way of

676
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,558
the ecosystem do time out with ulates

677
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,079
and deer and Elam and gra and way of the

678
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,119
ecosystem reestablishing but I've always

679
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,359
been confused why would there be Meadows

680
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,599
when there's all these forests and and I

681
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:39,079
think the honey mushroom is actually a

682
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:41,158
meadow maker so looking at the melium it

683
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,798
uh is wonderfully articulated and it

684
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,399
forms these micro cavities the micro

685
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,038
cavities swell with water and so a bated

686
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:50,158
habitat is a spongy habitat it holds

687
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:52,000
water it keeps water in the ecosystem

688
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,000
well that benefits all sorts of other

689
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
members in the ecological community and

690
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,359
moreover it's it's integration and it

691
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,159
sophistication of n working allows it

692
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,879
such that there's a break in a strand

693
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,080
then there's alternative Pathways

694
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,039
removing information nuclei Copic flow

695
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,678
to the rest of the network and so this

696
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,919
is one of the few organisms that you can

697
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,840
actually disturb and it benefits from

698
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,480
that disturbance um so the melium is

699
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,720
producing extracellular metabolites it's

700
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,519
absorbing nutrients anywhere along the

701
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,480
entire surface area and as it in these

702
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,519
metabolites it's they have anti

703
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,360
bacterial properties antimicrobial

704
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,440
properties and I believed and stated

705
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,599
that I believe they're deterministic in

706
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,840
pre-selecting the micro uh micro

707
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:40,798
microbial environment that is essential

708
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,639
for the plants to grow in the soil they

709
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,000
give rise to the canopy that grees the

710
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,679
debr field that then feeds the melum

711
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,200
resonant within um so I think these are

712
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,919
deterministic in the in the microbiomes

713
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,319
they're selecting that then helps the

714
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,360
plant communities Thrive and ultimately

715
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,798
guarantees the the progeny from these

716
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,000
FAL networks well Co with the growth of

717
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,119
these Fong as I mentioned there are

718
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,839
bacteria these are rods of bacteria here

719
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,798
um and and these rods the bacterial

720
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,879
communities are controlled by the

721
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:12,398
extracellular metabolites so um I put

722
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,799
together this this chart just in the

723
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,479
past few days you're about to see and

724
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,038
this is the melium that's grown on

725
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,880
sterile substrates in our laboratory now

726
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:26,960
this is eoli the dreaded 0157 staus orus

727
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,760
this is Mera MRSA the methy strains stus

728
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,720
orus I sered uh they chose about 12

729
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:35,359
species and this is a this is 10 to the

730
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,278
eth power a little higher than that uh

731
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:41,719
10 to eth power is more than 100 million

732
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:44,240
colonies and a and a milliliter of water

733
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,960
one gram is 1 Mill of water so the

734
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,960
startings the FDA laboratory and then we

735
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,240
challenge it with 1 milliliter of these

736
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,120
extracellular droplets uh from the

737
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:59,159
melium with 1 M of the bacterial

738
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:02,319
enriched water and in 24 to 7 2 hours it

739
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,840
went from 100 million colonies down to

740
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,879
uh to 10 to the thir power and then 10

741
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:09,879
to the second power so it went from 100

742
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,519
million colonies to to 10 thou to

743
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,600
100,000 one reduction to 1,00 to 100 a

744
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,880
remarkable uh drop in pathogenic

745
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:21,319
bacteria so this was the first time this

746
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,320
has ever been done um and I was able to

747
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:27,119
show that growing on cized substrates

748
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:29,839
that the melum from the wild would carry

749
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,599
forward these antimicrobial defenses

750
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,879
because we share in common many of the

751
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:40,240
same pathogens that harm us also harm

752
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:42,360
funi so candida uh um saus eoli are

753
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,679
pathogens to fungi as well as pathogens

754
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,439
to us so we can make take advantage of

755
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,200
the antimicrobial host defense immunity

756
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,679
of these fungi in order to protect us so

757
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,399
there's I have about 38 YouTube videos I

758
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,240
really encourage you to look at this one

759
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,199
I don't have time to show it but we

760
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,399
developed this submerged fermentation

761
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,120
method where we just take wood chips we

762
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,918
put it in water for two weeks we do this

763
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:06,518
with straw we can use this with salt

764
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,519
water and um it goes Anor robic if we

765
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,278
don't stir it it gets a bacterial slime

766
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,240
on it and and and the microbial

767
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,359
population changes from aerobic bacteria

768
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,839
to anerobic bacteria and then we just

769
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,519
let it sit for a long time for two weeks

770
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,678
and then we drain it uh and when we

771
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,558
drain it oxygen becomes a sterilizer

772
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,399
against the hobes and then you can

773
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,240
inoculate with mycelium and mycelium

774
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,798
runs like crazy it gobbles up the anoro

775
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,120
which not es fixating and because of the

776
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,319
high oxygen environment so we've been

777
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,638
doing this there's a great YouTube

778
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,398
videos I have up there to show you how

779
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:42,079
to do this and then U so I was said okay

780
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:45,398
I have a common batch of wood chips let

781
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,798
me inoculate from the same batch and I

782
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:50,638
put in the garden Giant in one and I put

783
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:53,440
herex lacus which is a crusted polypore

784
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:55,558
that's very important in bi remediation

785
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,960
and so I put them in the same wood chips

786
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:59,319
that and then we did what's called next

787
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,038
gen sequencing and a wonderful thing

788
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:02,359
about being in charge of my own company

789
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,798
and having a control of the bank account

790
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,199
is I can spend

791
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:09,440
money and so I spent thousands of

792
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,600
dollars so on this chart and this this

793
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,038
this we found a thousandfold difference

794
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,240
in the relative abundance across 500

795
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,519
species of bacteria that were selected

796
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
out by the garden giant mushroom versus

797
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,519
the crusted polycor first time this has

798
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,159
ever been shown is that the microbiome

799
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,000
in the soil in this case in the wood

800
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,559
chips was controlled by the antibiotic

801
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,200
profiles of species that we were prob

802
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:35,918
this was huge so um so this is an

803
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,960
example of healthy happy melium uh this

804
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,038
strand of melum here I weighed it and uh

805
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,519
1 cm compared to what this weight was

806
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:48,839
the difference was 30,000 to1 so 1 cm

807
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,679
length of myum held 30,000 times its

808
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:54,119
mass phenomenal so myum grows through a

809
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,440
habitat it's also tenacious and holds it

810
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,119
together well the melium runs is why my

811
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,558
book called myum running this is a happy

812
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,518
melium this is where it's multinucleate

813
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:05,678
on the very tips of the running edges

814
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,759
melium are are Edge Runners they love to

815
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,519
run along the edges um and so this is

816
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,079
this is what we want to see as

817
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,480
cultivators is rapidly the diverging

818
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,199
myal networks that are constantly on the

819
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,519
move and they're producing all sorts of

820
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,120
enzymes lactases in particular that are

821
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,120
able to break down cellulous and lium

822
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:26,439
well in the old growth forest was a

823
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,439
treasure Trove a genomic treasure that's

824
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,798
so important that we Preserve especially

825
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,798
in the Northwest here um we go into the

826
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:35,519
Old grth Forest and this is a place that

827
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:38,000
is very spiritually important to me I've

828
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,399
had many many exper experiences and I

829
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,960
was involved in cutting the old go

830
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:44,319
Forest so it's karmic payback for me to

831
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,840
give back to the ecosystem you know and

832
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:50,158
considering that I was involved in in

833
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:52,759
its decimation so being a manly man I am

834
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,480
very focused on decomposition so when I

835
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:55,919
see these logs and these trees laying

836
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,319
down in the ecosystem I like to watch

837
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,200
them over over the years and a log like

838
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,038
this will totally decompose in about 10

839
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,720
years it'll just be dff in the soil well

840
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,079
one of the most primary medicinal

841
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,559
mushrooms in the world is a woodland

842
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,679
mushroom called turkey tail tr's versol

843
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,000
Coral's versol is the old name retired

844
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,480
you know decades ago but this is the

845
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,239
most well studied medal mus in the world

846
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,320
um we applied for an NIH Grant and I was

847
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,199
a co-investigator co-pi is called

848
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,679
principal investigator help right the

849
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,678
Grant and NIH the national AG of Health

850
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,480
the United States awarded us $2.2

851
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,559
million for rest cancer clinical study

852
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,679
um so turkey tail was really indicated

853
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,398
in Asia as being very very helpful for

854
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,519
the immune system so we applied for this

855
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,878
grant we got the money everyone are very

856
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,239
excited they go Paul you're the my

857
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,279
callers where do we get our mushrooms

858
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,039
they go oh please get them from us

859
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,119
mushrooms hyper accumulate toxins the

860
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,759
mushrooms from China are notoriously you

861
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,039
know toxic with all sorts of pollutants

862
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,320
and heavy metals and pesticides I said

863
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,519
the chain of custody is really

864
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,399
critically important if you're going to

865
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,639
reproduce these experiments they said

866
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:00,078
well you can't be a principal

867
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,200
investigator and supplier so choose one

868
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,920
so I became a supplier we were put into

869
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,919
a jury of five other suppliers

870
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,119
thankfully we're chosen to be number one

871
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,200
as a soul Source supplier on the first

872
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,160
clinical study uh breast cancer clinical

873
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,919
study using medical Western the United

874
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:17,440
States so we fast forward and the

875
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,880
results of the study show statistically

876
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,320
significant highly significant increase

877
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,358
in CDA cytotoxic te- cells one of your

878
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,880
Frontline defenses and natural killer

879
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:29,480
cells um on a dose dependent basis so

880
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,280
prior pre radiation you your native

881
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,440
killer self Community is relatively

882
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,880
stable and high post radiation it

883
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,519
declines most of you know that your

884
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,760
immune system is impaired by radiation

885
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:40,440
therapy and two weeks later on a dose

886
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,240
dependent basis the immune system is

887
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,320
enhanced depending on how much of the

888
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,879
turkey tail melum now we've compared

889
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,318
fruit bodies and mycelium the melum is

890
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,240
far more active than the fruit bodies um

891
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:53,920
and so we're real excited about this it

892
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:55,598
was published um it got a lot of other

893
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,880
oncologists I work with a lot of

894
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,920
oncologists and medical researchers uh

895
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,680
on this and then um you know the breast

896
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,639
cancer clinical study was progressing

897
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,759
and then we had an internal tragedy uh

898
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,598
in our family and I think it's just best

899
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,040
for this short little Ted Med video to

900
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,599
address this

901
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,119
issue another mushroom empowers the

902
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,039
immune system and this is turkey tail

903
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,960
this hit home to me very personally in

904
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,119
June of

905
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,039
2009 when my 84 year-old mother called

906
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,160
me up and said Paul I have something

907
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,838
very serious to talk to you about but

908
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:34,559
you're always so busy it's a terrible

909
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:37,119
thing to hear from Mom I said Mom what's

910
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,719
wrong and she's a very happy genuine

911
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,720
person she goes I'm worried and my

912
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,799
mother's deeply religious has not seen a

913
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:45,439
doctor since

914
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,519
1968 she said my right breast is five

915
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,400
times the size of my left I have six

916
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:52,960
swollen lymph blands the size of walnuts

917
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,358
and her voice started shaking and I'm

918
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,240
not ashamed to admit that I started

919
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,358
crying why didn't you tell me sooner we

920
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,799
spent a large part of June at the

921
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,759
Swedish Breast Cancer Clinic in Seattle

922
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:08,519
the oncologist examined her and upon the

923
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,680
second examination she had a 5.5 CM

924
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:14,079
diameter tumor it metastasized it went

925
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:17,159
to her sternum I went to her liver she

926
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:20,240
had stage four breast cancer the doctor

927
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,879
gave her Less Than 3 months to live and

928
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,159
stated it was the second worst case of

929
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,079
breast cancer she is seen as a doctor in

930
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,960
20 years in practice we had to circle

931
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,400
family meing many of you gone through

932
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,400
this my mom announced that she bought a

933
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,960
pine casket the cheapest one that she

934
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,519
could find because she was going to

935
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,480
heaven but then the doctor said you know

936
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,519
you're too old to have radiation therapy

937
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,240
you can't have your breast removed but

938
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,440
there's an interesting study on turkey

939
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:49,199
tail mushrooms at B Medical School you

940
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,000
might want to try taking those and

941
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,199
that's my go well my son's supplying

942
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,960
those so she was put on taxol and her

943
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:59,519
septon wonderful drugs and she started

944
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,760
taking turkey tail capsules a day 4 in

945
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,679
the morning and 4 in the evening and

946
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,560
that was in June of

947
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:13,440
2009 and today my mother has no

948
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,440
detectible tumors and I'd like to BR

949
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,440
my

950
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,799
[Applause]

951
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:38,440
[Music]

952
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,400
so here's my wonderful mother and then

953
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,838
when she passed the 5year disease free

954
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,039
survival rate which doctors don't like

955
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,599
to use the word cure but there's no

956
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,838
evidence of disease we common people

957
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,519
will say cure but this is the message my

958
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:56,440
mother left on my

959
00:38:52,519 --> 00:39:00,239
voicemail I everything's go everything's

960

you for your prayers I love you and I'll

962
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,680
check in with you later byebye so my

963
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:12,679
mother now is 91 years of age she's

964
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,960
cancer free she's sharp as attack and

965
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,519
she just beat recently my two brothers

966
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,920
in

967
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:21,239
Scrabble CU my twin brother I said

968
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,000
really mom beat you in Scrabble she got

969
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:26,318
lucky you

970
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
know so then my mother was written up so

971
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:30,679
is the best case come a international

972
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,039
Journal they interviewed me they

973
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:34,799
interview interviewed Julie Smith her

974
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,639
oncologist at Swedish Breast Cancer

975
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,079
Clinic um and throughout these

976
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,318
interviews it was very interesting

977
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,240
because several things came up uh Julie

978
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:44,639
Smith recommended turkey tail mushrooms

979
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,679
in Seattle but my mother lives in win

980
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,639
Washington at the time and she started

981
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,639
her s program in Ellensburg Washington

982
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,078
over the mountains and she goes well she

983
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,279
I tell me new oncologist I'm taking

984
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,039
turkey tail musroom I go no please don't

985
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,720
the oncologist had an invent of caution

986
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,639
that they not experienced Julie Smith

987
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,159
oncologist Swedish Breast Cancer cancer

988
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,838
was up the learning curve the other

989
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,960
doctors will say no stop taking

990
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:09,318
everything so upon interviewing Julie

991
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,760
Smith and my mother we believe this was

992
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:13,960
a life and death decision that she did

993
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,119
not tell her oncologist that she was

994
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,039
telling taking turkey tail mushrooms she

995
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:22,920
Ed intercepted program 50 women did 48

996
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,119
women have died in that program after 5

997
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,440
years my mother and one other lady are

998
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,280
the only two known survivals survivors

999
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,200
this led in also then to a subsequent

1000
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,079
study that found that psk is and turkey

1001
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,639
tail mushrooms and that the turkey tail

1002
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:41,400
mushroom constituents at help her septin

1003
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:44,000
work better so it's a great example of

1004
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,480
of conventional therapy uh working with

1005
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,239
natural medicine in order to potentiate

1006
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,880
a a a good recovery recovery now this is

1007
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:54,078
something I really want folks to focus

1008
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,440
on this is an extraction chart basically

1009
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,560
using different solvents you're going to

1010
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,000
see this three times so the the hot

1011
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,400
water is a great is a polar solvent it

1012
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,318
pulls out proteins glyc proteins

1013
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,400
saccharides but most of you know that

1014
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:10,960
lipids you know are not soluble and oils

1015
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,400
are not soluble in water and so they use

1016
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,720
the least water loving uh non-polar

1017
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,280
solids hexane P ether Etc and so when

1018
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,759
you do hot water extraction you

1019
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,200
partition away all these other compounds

1020
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,839
some of them come through but the

1021
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,439
majority of them are left behind because

1022
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,279
they're not water soluble well I

1023
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,960
involved in these group of Physicians

1024
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,760
you know who literature driven and so am

1025
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,039
I but I said I can't figure out what psk

1026
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,880
is it's a molecular complex but there's

1027
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:40,559
no molecular signature you know what's

1028
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,880
the hlc that we can use for psk there

1029
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,358
well there is none and so I hammered

1030
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,240
these medical researchers and finally

1031
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,838
kind of I think I got through the noise

1032
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:50,519
and I was extraordinarily happy with

1033
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,559
this recent article that came out by

1034
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:54,759
some of the co-authors in the west

1035
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,799
cancer political study and they found

1036
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,200
that that psk and they Val not a pure

1037
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,359
compound as a molecular complex of great

1038
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:05,559
uncertainty but when they use lipases

1039
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,358
that dissolve the lipids away from the

1040
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,318
giant scaffolding of the beta glucan

1041
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,239
complex it denatured the immune benefit

1042
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:15,679
of psk by

1043
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:17,078
83% so it turns out the beta glucans

1044
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,078
they're wonderful they're this huge

1045
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,640
moleular complex tons of literature but

1046
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,519
until this time no one had used this

1047
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:26,199
these enzymes that would take away the

1048
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,239
lipids and this this huge black complex

1049
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:30,558
is a you know big glucans are going to

1050
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,318
have a million in terms of a million dot

1051
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,000
in terms of its molecular weight but a

1052
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,759
giant scaffolding embedded into which

1053
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,280
are all these other active constituents

1054
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,440
so this showed that if you didn't have

1055
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,359
the lipids in the beta glucans then you

1056
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,200
lost immune benefit well then we go

1057
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:48,239
forward and um there's an extraordinary

1058
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:50,960
uh uh uh double blind conceivable

1059
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:54,118
control uh uh study here that show that

1060
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,199
tury tail enhances the microbiome

1061
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,200
helping Lac of basilis and bacterium

1062
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:04,000
beneficial bacteria in the GI TR tract

1063
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:06,919
suppressing inflammatory stus Custer and

1064
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,159
oconus um and it modifies the vle

1065
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,000
microbiota well then the mushrooms then

1066
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:13,279
I realize oh my gosh just like in the

1067
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,639
ecosystem of the environment they they

1068
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,640
set the stage of the beneficial bacteria

1069
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:20,558
can to help their their members and

1070
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:23,239
their ecosystem well these fungi as you

1071
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,720
consume them internally also affect the

1072
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:27,439
bacterial Flora in your gut and to your

1073
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,239
benefit this is why when I meet people

1074
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,559
who say I can't stomach mushrooms

1075
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:33,719
they're actually giving you a very

1076
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:35,839
important scientific observation their

1077
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:37,959
microbiome is mismatched to the

1078
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,639
mushrooms and so this is why I think

1079
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,240
some people can't tolerate digestive

1080
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:44,440
mushrooms have incompatibility and the

1081
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,239
in the bacterial microf in their gut

1082
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,039
versus the mushroom

1083
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:51,558
species so the species that I mentioned

1084
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,800
before a gacon f Thompson fishys is the

1085
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:56,680
longest living Mushroom in the world and

1086
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,720
I received a National Geographic award

1087
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:02,558
um for uh in for my work in U in

1088
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,118
studying the old growth forest and they

1089
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,559
wanted to do a story on me so they sent

1090
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,079
a photojournalist from New York and

1091
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:11,160
before he came out says Paul we want to

1092
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:13,880
do a search for the Aaron it's perfectly

1093
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:15,480
from that Gio you know the go course but

1094
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,119
we don't want you to take us to a place

1095
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,800
you already know an aaran exists we want

1096
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,318
to have that Eureka experience of

1097
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,920
Discovery and says now How likely would

1098
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,599
would you find can we find it I totally

1099
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,280
lied you know it's so rare find this

1100
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,680
mushroom this one out of 100 trips in

1101
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,440
the Old Forest My Dear Professor Dr

1102
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:37,639
Michael bu 45 years hunting the Old

1103
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,039
Forest found this first garon last year

1104
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:40,838
and he goes into the old course all the

1105
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,159
time he finally found one that's how

1106
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:45,519
rare it is so I said oh 50/50 with my

1107
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,879
answerers for the

1108
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,719
phal I didn't want National Geographic

1109
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,680
to cancel the story on me you know so

1110
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:54,000
but I had good reason about 10 of my

1111
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:57,639
friends with high power binoculars we we

1112
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,960
rented a motor sailor here of Cortez

1113
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:01,759
with a zodiac and the idea is we go up

1114
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,679
the Inland passage of desolation sound

1115
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,920
lots of Old Forest and we look for snags

1116
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,358
and often times they look like a giant

1117
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,480
beehive and often the bald eagles are on

1118
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:13,719
these snags gacon grows in the same tree

1119
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,318
so you know we have 10 people with high

1120
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,719
power binoculars and we're going up

1121
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:19,279
desolation sound and there's a tree SN

1122
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,000
nothing there there's a tree nothing

1123
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,880
there there's a tree nothing there you

1124
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,318
do that for 3 hours 4 hours you got

1125
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,000
retina burn right and it's like they put

1126
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:30,159
a journalist talking upside like and you

1127
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,079
promis me like no I said 50/50 is like

1128
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,440
fishing be patient you're from New York

1129
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,640
you

1130
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,358
know so so the photo turn so our Skipper

1131
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:41,558
said you know listen it's lunchtime we

1132
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:43,719
were out for hours let's go over to a

1133
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,000
first people site and the first people

1134
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:47,639
site is is not really clear what the

1135
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,358
pictographs mean I've met a number of

1136
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:53,159
First Peoples and we did wage white

1137
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:56,519
people did wage biot terrorism against

1138
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:58,558
indigenous people you know purposely or

1139
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:01,559
or by accident but nevertheless

1140
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,040
tuberculosis flu viruses and pox viruses

1141
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,200
and my friend guja is the president of

1142
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,639
the height of people he said you know

1143
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,039
Paul you think that us Indians know

1144
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,879
everything about ethnobot ethnology well

1145
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:12,800
we knew a lot more before we had these

1146
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,160
pandemics but when you have six

1147
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,559
pandemics come within within 60 years

1148
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,960
wiping out 75 to 95% of the indigenous

1149
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,280
people it's a oral tradition we get

1150
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,039
disconnected from our ancestral

1151
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,559
knowledge so any we motor over there and

1152
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,599
this is a great place at a 30 foot

1153
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,359
overhand

1154
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,920
and we both over there have lunch and

1155
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,318
we're going over there and then one of

1156
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,119
my teammates goes there's one found one

1157
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,279
could not believe it it was right out

1158
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,760
our first people's uh site and this

1159
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,480
one's especially unusual because it was

1160
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,559
scrolling underneath another Branch it

1161
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,559
fell it Teeter tottered and then the

1162
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:49,200
myum regrew from the mushroom back into

1163
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,400
the branch and connected with the myum

1164
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,919
in the tree and then it grew two legs

1165
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,559
you know extraordinarily uh interesting

1166
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,720
well when you look at the origination

1167
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,440
myth women or the height of people this

1168
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,239
is an arite plate from Charles edans

1169
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,480
Shaw in 1894 this speaks to the

1170
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:09,078
origination of of women the height of

1171
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,358
and there's Raven pading on a canoe in

1172
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,119
the sea of Eternity and Raven seeks help

1173
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,719
from the bear the killer whale the bald

1174
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,519
eagle none of the other animals you know

1175
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:21,719
in the ecosystem can help Raven steer

1176
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:24,880
her canoe to find her Galia except for

1177
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,879
fungus man and this creature here and

1178
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,880
then and it turns out that grave Gard

1179
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,800
Ians that the that were carved from

1180
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,318
aacon were placed on the first people's

1181
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,720
Shaman's Graves to help the protect them

1182
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,480
to go into the Afterlife so they were

1183
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,239
the Chicago Field Museum and they were

1184
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,199
repatriated thankfully back third First

1185
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,759
Peoples and they analyzed these they

1186
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:46,719
were not made of wood they were made of

1187
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,800
a gan they were carved now as it turns

1188
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,959
out there's two potential candidates for

1189
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,480
the Orman that helped Raven there's a

1190
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,880
gacan there's also the artist conon and

1191
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,280
the artist conon may have been this

1192
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,760
fungus also not a gon even though we

1193
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,160
know the gra Guardians were carved of a

1194
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,240
gan and the reason arst may have been

1195
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:07,480
the one is that you can draw a map you

1196
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:09,199
can actually draw on this thing so from

1197
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,000
a practical point of view if you want to

1198
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,358
show someone help it up the fiords and

1199
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,358
the channels and pass the islands you

1200
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:17,400
could actually draw on this wood conon a

1201
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,759
map so kind of makes sense also but so

1202
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,119
we're there at the site and there is a

1203
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,520
fungus man like pictograph with salmon

1204
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:26,358
eggs and this is Dr Scott franbow he's

1205
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:28,039
the director of the tulous research

1206
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:30,199
institute he was very interested in

1207
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:32,440
ethnology I wrote an article in a gon he

1208
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,719
saw it he contacted me say I'm funded by

1209
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,760
The Gates Foundation we're very

1210
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,959
concerned about xdr TV multi resistance

1211
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,760
strange tuberculosis and he said I'd

1212
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,880
like to you know go with you Paul on the

1213
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,440
for so we invited him and he went with

1214
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,599
us to the site and so we take these

1215
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,358
tubes here we just need a small piece of

1216
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:54,240
tissue okay so I worked with Scott FR B

1217
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:57,279
and the UIC to bosis research division

1218
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,838
for five years we did

1219
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,240
solvent extractions we use the most

1220
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,599
polar water the least least polar and

1221
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,719
this is called bioga fractionation so

1222
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:09,599
you ref fractionate a natural substance

1223
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:12,000
and you go down a decision tree polar

1224
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,519
nonpolar you test those post fractions

1225
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,358
that increased activity was found in one

1226
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,159
fraction against tuberculosis and less

1227
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:20,159
than the other well of course there

1228
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,920
would be so you follow the path that has

1229
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,440
the most activity and you keep on

1230
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,039
fractionating fractionating

1231
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,599
fractionating each fraction takes weeks

1232
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:30,199
months it's a very laborious prod

1233
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:32,599
process this is how the pharmaceutical

1234
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:36,358
industry discovers active constituents

1235
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:39,318
new drugs uh from from from nature so

1236
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:42,358
after 5 years lo and behold Scott and

1237
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:45,960
our team we discovered two chlorinated

1238
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:49,119
cumin of aaran Highly active against

1239
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,838
tuberculosis wow I said okay I mean we

1240
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,838
we actually found active new drugs that

1241
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,318
resident in this in this mushroom that

1242
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,400
were celebrated by the Greeks the

1243
00:49:55,318 --> 00:50:00,159
celebrated by Haida and First Coast

1244
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,720
peoples um so that was that was really

1245
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:05,039
exciting okay we'll go back now five to

1246
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,959
the time we were there and we were there

1247
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:08,838
and and we're exploring there for

1248
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,079
several hours and I'm such an idiot and

1249
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm there and I I see this rock wow I

1250
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:14,720
see this rock and W that rock that's

1251
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,838
interesting kind of kind of looks like a

1252
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,039
g yeah there's a rock there's a gon

1253
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:19,039
there's a

1254
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,960
rock so How likely is it we find a gon I

1255
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:26,838
don't know one in 100 How likely is it

1256
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,000
we find pictographs are really

1257
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:32,759
reminiscent fungus man helping hide

1258
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,559
Raven to see eternity I I don't know one

1259
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,319
one in 10,000 one one in 100,000 How

1260
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,519
likely is it we find out a rock that

1261
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:41,798
looks really suspiciously like it's been

1262
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,440
carved in the shape of gon I don't know

1263
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:46,679
maybe maybe one in a million How likely

1264
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,240
is it we find it on my

1265
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,598
birthday and this is when the

1266
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,959
photojournalist start shaking your

1267
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,920
nervous and going does this happen to

1268
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,480
Paul

1269
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,519
often and my friends looked at him dead

1270
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,039
pan and said

1271
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:02,759
yes this I think speaks to a higher

1272
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:06,679
truth and the core of my belief if you

1273
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,880
walk with faith in nature with respect

1274
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:11,199
of indigenous peoples respect of your

1275
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,960
ancestors and the obligations of your

1276
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,639
descendants can you walk with

1277
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,079
truthfulness not motivated by money but

1278
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:20,400
inspired by science and Discovery and

1279
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,359
sharing that I believe nature will

1280
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,639
reward you and that's really what I

1281
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:24,639
believe

1282
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,559
in

1283
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,639
thank you and so Aaron is really hard to

1284
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:38,480
find but we have now 70 Springs of aaran

1285
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,480
by far the largest library of aaran in

1286
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,798
the world sometimes we have to go up

1287
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,119
trees a 700 year old tree on qu Island

1288
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:48,480
and this is what the gon the branch is

1289
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,200
hard as a rock so it doesn't Rock the

1290
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,159
branch that supports it and so this

1291
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:54,919
one's about 70 years of age and then it

1292
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:56,960
goes through a metamorphosis and I

1293
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,920
brought both of these specimens here and

1294
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,480
it goes to the white form the ghost form

1295
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,639
as it's known and so this mushroom

1296
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,280
changes into this white form as it lays

1297
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:11,719
in the Old Forest subjected to rain so

1298
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,720
we um this is dead and this is alive so

1299
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:15,639
we dat our cultures from this now we

1300
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:20,199
thought that was the biggest one in in

1301
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:22,558
the world but until we saw this one and

1302
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:25,719
this is from Northern California a t

1303
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:28,798
typical Nor Cal kind of guy and this

1304
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:31,159
one's about 20 lb it's over 100 years of

1305
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:33,280
age so this was the forest was going to

1306
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,279
be burned going to be cut down and

1307
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,760
slashed and burned and so the people

1308
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,960
called us up saying hey it's going to be

1309
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,799
log go for it dude you know but please

1310
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,760
send us a specimen send us a giant chunk

1311
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:45,880
so we got this one in the culture the

1312
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,280
forest was cut down and burned so we

1313
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,200
saved this phenotype we saved this

1314
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,880
strain of a gacon uh and we have it in

1315
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:56,519
culture today so we typically go on the

1316
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,680
old forest with the GPS we take a

1317
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:00,719
stainless steel tube we leave the Aaron

1318
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:02,879
we only need that amount of tissue we

1319
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,719
get it in the culture and then we grow

1320
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,280
them and we compare strains these

1321
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,519
strains are different strains this is a

1322
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,119
ridge of incompatibility if they're the

1323
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,079
same strain they grow together

1324
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,880
seamlessly and so this a way of our

1325
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,559
testing different phenotypes in the same

1326
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,599
Forest to see how many different

1327
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,000
varieties we have well I've been

1328
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,079
fascinated you know with the my

1329
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,159
antimicrobal properties of mushrooms and

1330
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,519
then I published an article in

1331
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:29,239
herbalgram in June of 2001 and

1332
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:31,559
summarized in one page all the

1333
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,558
information in scientific literature on

1334
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:35,760
the antiviral compounds and properties

1335
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:37,240
for mushrooms now it's a whopping one

1336
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,599
page long but less than one page with

1337
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:41,399
two big photographs and so I found about

1338
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,400
six or seven references that's all there

1339
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,559
was in scientific literature so that was

1340
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,639
in June of 2001 I published this made

1341
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:50,839
the cover of herbal gram and then 911

1342
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:54,400
occurs several months later 3 months

1343
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:56,599
later so 911 occurs and then you know

1344
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,039
the biggest concern very quickly became

1345
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:01,359
weaponized viruses in particular

1346
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:03,480
smallpox so a physician with the

1347
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,119
Department of Defense US bios Shield

1348
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,318
biod defense program got a hold of me I

1349
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:11,160
said Paul I saw this article you were

1350
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:13,159
very concerned about biot terrorism we

1351
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:16,239
we know you have a large library of old

1352
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:18,118
gr fungi uh will you submit some of your

1353
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,159
samples uh for the BIOS Shield biod

1354
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,680
defense program which was organized by

1355
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,759
ni niad and US AMD US Army Research

1356
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:27,598
Institute infe diseases so it was a huge

1357
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,160
honor they got of me so we started

1358
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,760
sending in mushrooms we sent in hot

1359
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:34,440
water extracts of RA and Artis con and

1360
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,079
aaran and then we did go out the melum

1361
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,480
we said water extracts of that and then

1362
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,960
we did ethanol extracts of melum so this

1363
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:45,199
this went on WE s our first 80 samples

1364
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:48,720
out and I waited a few months um and

1365
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:51,480
then um then uh I was up in Canada one

1366
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:53,558
of my managers called me up say Paul

1367
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,920
there's a helicopter over the laboratory

1368
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:58,160
I know no big deal helicopter laboratory

1369
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,039
and he goes well I goes no Paul it's

1370
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:04,719
really close I go how close he goes

1371
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:06,599
Listen whoa I go what's the the numbers

1372
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,279
on the tail of the helicopter he goes

1373
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:12,720
there are no numbers there a Blackhawk

1374
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:15,400
helicopter going on no so so now that

1375
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:17,399
same week what happened is that Federal

1376
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,480
Express delivered us all these research

1377
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,318
results from the BIOS Shield program and

1378
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,119
I'm flipping through them no activity no

1379
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:26,480
activity I get the sample 78 highly

1380
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,440
active against box viruses then I got

1381
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,559
another sample highly active against box

1382
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,358
viruses another one so I had three hits

1383
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,480
against box viruses I didn't tell the

1384
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:36,358
government what they were I had coded

1385
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,880
them in a not quote and I looked up the

1386
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:41,239
codes and they were all a gan so I got

1387
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,720
really excited and I so called up I was

1388
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:48,439
appointed a a a um a one one person in

1389
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:52,199
the bio Shield program was my manager my

1390
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,880
contact Dr Huggins he's a physician so I

1391
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:56,038
called up Dr hug and said This research

1392
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,798
results extraordinar exciting this is

1393
00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:58,799
great

1394
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,159
he goes what research results I go

1395
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:02,239
Federal Express just delivered me all

1396
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,838
these research results you know testing

1397
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,959
all of our extracts he goes you're not

1398
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,480
supposed to get those I go no problem

1399
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,039
I'll photocopy them and send them to you

1400
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,079
you know it were so disorganized you

1401
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:14,160
know and then then the helicopter shows

1402
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,559
up I oh my gosh so I told my employees

1403
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:19,038
okay shut down the business give three

1404
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,640
give the employees uh copies of the

1405
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,280
cultures that had activity against Fox

1406
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,759
viruses don't ever tell me who has them

1407
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
shut down the business right now leave

1408
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,760
while the hill copter is over the over

1409
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,920
the business

1410
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,000
and so we did 11 Vehicles separated from

1411
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,960
the facility later on I got security

1412
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,079
clearance we choked about it I told I

1413
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,358
told the defense department why didn't

1414
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,519
you guys TOA together they oh my God if

1415
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:40,639
you only

1416
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:41,920
knew so everything was fine but they

1417
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,838
said you know you did just the right

1418
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,838
thing you decentralize yourself as a

1419
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:51,519
Target so we advaned forward and um you

1420
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,960
can all look this up an interview with

1421
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,199
the BIOS Shield program the deputy

1422
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,599
director of the FDA and myself on

1423
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,480
National Public Radio Google stamus and

1424
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,280
small Fox NPR and we have a Ved press

1425
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,760
release from the US from the US

1426
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,720
Department of Defense it says that top

1427
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:10,160
10 samples of more than 200,000

1428
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,519
specimens was over 2 million and we're

1429
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,078
the only natural product that have high

1430
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:16,119
activity against pox viruses the other

1431
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:17,839
ones were Pharmaceuticals so okay now we

1432
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:19,720
go forward and we do biotic

1433
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,078
fractionation again this time we do the

1434
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:23,679
University of Mississippi School of

1435
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:25,798
Pharmacy same things as before you know

1436
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,078
polar solvant you know water non-polar

1437
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:29,079
you know

1438
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:32,240
um and we fractionate it out and after

1439
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:34,280
about 7 years lo and behold we find two

1440
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:37,159
active molecules highly active against

1441
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,640
Fox viruses more put sopir the

1442
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:42,598
preeminent positive anti-drug control

1443
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:44,440
with less side effects and so sulur EIC

1444
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:48,000
acid turns out to be highly active

1445
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:50,280
against pox viruses well most you know

1446
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,559
pox small pox you know cow poox is out

1447
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,798
there camel pox Etc um but uh small pox

1448
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:57,200
supposedly doesn't have any natural

1449
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:59,400
reserves uh we know in Russia and the

1450
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,480
United States and um two or three other

1451
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:05,079
countries they do have small foxing

1452
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,679
culture um but those of you who are not

1453
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:10,119
immunized so I think it's about 1968

1454
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,519
they stopped immunizing those of us uh

1455
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:14,920
you know who were in school at the time

1456
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:17,880
have smallpox vaccination scar on our

1457
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,000
arms typically but otherwise you're rest

1458
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,119
of you're immunologically naive which

1459
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,159
means you're highly susceptible to small

1460
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:28,200
pox and the first people in particular

1461
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:31,000
were super sensitive and 90% of the

1462
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:33,558
those First Nation people infected died

1463
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,318
us a European and African background 30%

1464
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:38,680
will die 30% will become blind 30% were

1465
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:41,558
highly scarred and recover and 10% would

1466
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:43,159
be immune so anyhow so we were great

1467
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:45,480
with nonactive molecules but then very

1468
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:48,480
quickly the virus of concern began flu

1469
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,599
viruses now there's been several uh

1470
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,358
pandemics you all know about Spanish Flu

1471
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:54,599
in

1472
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:57,318
1918 um and then different V flu

1473
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:59,559
pandemics in h5n1 because a very big

1474
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:03,358
virus of concern and then a poultry

1475
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:06,079
virus this P two years ago 87 and9 hit

1476
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:08,880
Minnesota and Iowa Mill millions and

1477
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:13,079
millions of birds were then euthanized

1478
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,760
um and um we an organic chicken owner

1479
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:17,960
who I helped their family out with a

1480
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,160
medical crisis um contacted me said Paul

1481
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,760
we're killing all these chickens and can

1482
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,480
you help you know we know about your

1483
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:29,079
research you know um can you help these

1484
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:32,159
chickens so um we sent back 50 kilos of

1485
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:34,480
a gon melum grown on Rice they fed it to

1486
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:37,598
20,000 chickens and those chickens

1487
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:41,199
became an O Asis of immunity they did

1488
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:44,280
not get the the the bird flu and so they

1489
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:46,480
did not to euthanized all the other u

1490
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,760
uhtry in the surrounding counties were

1491
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:53,318
euthanized and this was a stark stark

1492
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,319
contrast well the reason being is that

1493
00:59:53,318 --> 00:59:56,599
this is a a from the BIOS Shield by

1494
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:58,599
defense program

1495
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:00,318
prologist it's called the C activity

1496
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:04,039
index anything as two is active anything

1497
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:06,519
as 10 is highly active well this is a

1498
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:08,760
summary of our antiflu research results

1499
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:11,480
with the BIOS Shield B defense program

1500
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,480
and ribavirin is the preeminent of drug

1501
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,679
control anti control so you can see

1502
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,760
anything over 10 is active prob well

1503
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:22,838
this is you know 32 17 45 so here is our

1504
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:25,799
agaron melium our RI melium our cha

1505
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:27,239
melium then did a blend so but we gave

1506
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:29,199
the then we knew that the ethanol

1507
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:31,399
extracts of mycelium grown on Rice by

1508
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:35,719
the way uh were highly active against

1509
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:38,920
pox viruses so we sent those extracts in

1510
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:41,679
now the extracts are in 35% ethanol it's

1511
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,880
the very basically s to the extract you

1512
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:48,558
have that you received on your seats so

1513
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:52,000
we these are inv vitro human cell assays

1514
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:54,240
you can't put 35% EOL extract in a on a

1515
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,318
human cell it kill it so they deluded it

1516
01:00:54,239 --> 01:01:02,000
10 to1 to 3.5 10 one again to35 so 100

1517
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:05,880
to1 delution of our extracts and this is

1518
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,679
the results phenominally more potent as

1519
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,440
a natural extract diluted 100 to1

1520
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:14,279
compared to a pure antiviral molecule we

1521
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,280
beat the pants of a riron and then a

1522
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,079
combination of all three of these end up

1523
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:23,440
having extraordinar high activity

1524
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:26,079
against H5 And1 so of course I got very

1525
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:29,559
excited about this this is back in 200

1526
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:32,000
five and I filed a patent and I you know

1527
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:34,798
I My Discovery and spent all this money

1528
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,119
so I found a patent and then the patent

1529
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,519
disappears off the U the patent never

1530
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,720
gets published the applications are

1531
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:43,798
published within a year or two and the

1532
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,879
US pto. homepage uh US patent and

1533
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:47,639
trademark office homepage the patent

1534
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,280
didn't get published so I get all my

1535
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:51,598
patent turn going where's my fraking

1536
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,200
patent and so he contacted the patent

1537
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,640
office and the Department of Defense

1538
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:57,798
took the patent out of the patent office

1539
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:59,199
the because of national security for the

1540
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:01,559
same reason you can't write a patent

1541
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:03,078
about making a nuclear weapon you give a

1542
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:04,880
terrorist a blueprint for making a

1543
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:07,318
nuclear bomb so we had to do

1544
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,760
intergovernmental agency Trace after

1545
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:12,000
four or five years we pull the patent

1546
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,079
back from the US defense department it

1547
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,679
goes into the patent office and then we

1548
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,920
got the strangest rejection of all time

1549
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,278
it's like somebody talking to the patent

1550
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,440
examiner the patent rejection no sense

1551
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:25,480
at all we went to the board of appeals

1552
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,200
unanimity of opinion 10 examiners then

1553
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,920
approved the patent it was then

1554
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:33,519
published in

1555
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:36,798
2014 um a gan active against flu viruses

1556
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:39,920
and act against STA and eoli as well as

1557
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:41,920
herpes and pox viruses now I have a

1558
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,159
medicinal mushroom that's active against

1559
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,680
viruses the bacteria is really

1560
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:49,278
significant the more the most people who

1561
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:51,598
die from um U flu viruses die from

1562
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:53,519
bacterial pneumonia their immune system

1563
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,640
is challenged by the flu virus and then

1564
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,920
they have their immune system depressed

1565
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:59,118
and and the bacteria start going their

1566
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,119
lungs they die from respiratory

1567
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,680
bacterial pneumonia so to have something

1568
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,079
that's dually active as medically

1569
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:07,719
significant well so we did this and then

1570
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:11,039
the vector Institute in Russia they came

1571
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:13,480
out with an article you know in 2012 I

1572
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:15,640
discovered this in 2015 but it's very

1573
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,480
nice because the vector in like for dri

1574
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:19,679
is the top secret you know biot

1575
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,480
terrorism and and they have small pox

1576
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,879
there they also found that L beh to gon

1577
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,838
it's AC active against pox viruses so

1578
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,798
that was kind of good because they

1579
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:30,759
validated what I discovered I have a a

1580
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:32,599
talk in Washington DC and a whole bunch

1581
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,559
of people from Port Detroit they knew my

1582
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:36,798
research and the BIOS Shield program so

1583
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,079
I invited him to my talk I showed him

1584
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:39,599
this I said we beat the Russians by

1585
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,039
seven years and a small cheer went up in

1586
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,039
the

1587
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,278
audience and then another group of

1588
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,760
scientists then also found the same

1589
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:49,239
thing so was good we had multiple

1590
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,680
validation okay so the story now starts

1591
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:53,959
to take some strange twists and turns

1592
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:56,960
this article just came out recently it

1593
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,798
turns out that tlu is dependent upon the

1594
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,480
supply chain of the star Anis star Anis

1595
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:04,239
produces shmic acid shikimic acid you

1596
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:07,480
know tlu is antiviral against Blue

1597
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:09,239
viruses it turns out that blue light

1598
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:12,119
stimulates the melium of oyster

1599
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:15,118
mushrooms to produce shmic acid

1600
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,640
247 so imagine Supply chains of of star

1601
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,160
anas coming from Afghanistan are rather

1602
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,639
strange in so with the T flu shortage

1603
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:22,719
because they couldn't get up star anos

1604
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,639
to make ham flu now we know that oyster

1605
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:26,798
mushroom melium under blue light

1606
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:29,598
stimulation produc the antiviral

1607
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:32,400
precursors that that so that okay that's

1608
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:34,599
interesting so we go forward and this is

1609
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,240
we go lots of RA we go fruit bodies we

1610
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:40,160
go melum um we have very large

1611
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:42,558
Laboratories is a beautiful amp form and

1612
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,078
so I've been espousing because I'm a I'm

1613
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,599
a myologist with a strong emphasis on

1614
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:49,760
ecosystems and understanding I've been

1615
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,359
saying for a long time the mushrooms are

1616
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,799
the end of the life cycle you know the

1617
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:55,078
challenges of the melium are much

1618
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:56,719
greater than that of the mushroom fruit

1619
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,920
body they have to navigate through a

1620
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,719
microbial and hostile environment one

1621
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,000
cell all thick lots of microbes in their

1622
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,519
as side and so sure enough complete

1623
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,760
genome sequencing of RI mushroom shows

1624
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,278
that the melium codes for many more

1625
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,278
compounds than the mushrooms still uh

1626
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:13,880
and so because they coding these more

1627
01:05:12,278 --> 01:05:15,440
compounds there extracellular

1628
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,838
metabolites that we have been focusing

1629
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,480
on so uh we then were able you know we'

1630
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:22,358
kind of been ahead of a curve here and

1631
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,639
then science then validates a lot of our

1632
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:27,480
premises so this is

1633
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:29,078
cha cha was on Birch trees and beach

1634
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,480
trees sometimes on

1635
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:35,680
chestnuts um but unfortunately chaga is

1636
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:39,559
being cut off you know by the thousands

1637
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:42,118
and a wild west harvesting of chaga and

1638
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:43,480
scaring the trees and I'm nice to us a

1639
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:45,960
group of physicians in the United

1640
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:49,159
Kingdom got some of our choga extract

1641
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:52,798
with IBD patients and found that the

1642
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:55,798
melum grown on Rice uh protected DNA

1643
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:59,079
damage more than 55% highly significant

1644
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:01,199
against D DNA oxidative stress damage uh

1645
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:04,760
using the cha extract which I think is a

1646
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,358
very good argument that we should grow

1647
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,960
the melium in the laboratory is

1648
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:10,679
sustainable this is not sustainable now

1649
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,440
for your family and your friends I don't

1650
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,159
have an issue with this but when people

1651
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,400
go out collecting hundreds of pounds of

1652
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:18,078
chaga which was widely available a few

1653
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,160
years ago now you can barely get 10

1654
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,440
kilos if you you're lucky because the

1655
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,199
cha the cha nearest the roads and trails

1656
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:28,559
have been chopped off and it takes a

1657
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:33,118
long time okay all of this now has been

1658
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:35,240
a story line that comes up to an

1659
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:38,318
equation that's going to lead to a

1660
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:43,078
paradigm shifting solution so I call

1661
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:46,679
this microf Factor number one F of a

1662
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:49,160
okay so antivirals and antioxidants from

1663
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:52,318
polyer mushrooms so I'm going to create

1664
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:55,239
a Mico factorial equation that's going

1665
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,440
to lead to a paradigm solution that is

1666
01:06:55,239 --> 01:07:00,199
going to hopefully save hundreds of

1667
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,240
millions of lives in biodiversity of

1668
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:04,118
this planet so these are I didn't know

1669
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,078
what to call them they're experiences

1670
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:08,000
they're

1671
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:11,519
factors so I swung these together okay

1672
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,798
so that's micro Factor one we'll call it

1673
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:18,358
a okay f f of a for you math people out

1674
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:20,960
there okay so the next experience I'm

1675
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:23,199
growing the garden giant mushroom in my

1676
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,240
garden and this is

1677
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:28,318
1984 and I go out to my garden

1678
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,199
and there's my garden giant mushroom and

1679
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:32,440
I look really closely and I go this is

1680
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:35,078
so bizarre there's all these bees on my

1681
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,639
wood chips they move the wind chips outs

1682
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:38,519
side I looked at them very carefully and

1683
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:40,480
they're sipping on the melium there

1684
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:42,519
little droplets they uncover the

1685
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,760
mycelium that's hidden by the wood chips

1686
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:46,318
and it's like you know it's a huge

1687
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,480
amount of weight there and for 40 days

1688
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:51,199
from dawn to dusk there's a continuous

1689
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,240
Convoy a bees from my beehives that

1690
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:57,000
going to my garden giant patch my patch

1691
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,199
was about 8 10 in thick and it shrunk to

1692
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,679
about 2 in and strangely the garden

1693
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:03,480
giant mushrooms called the burgundy

1694
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,759
mushroom they're burgundy red like

1695
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:09,679
Burgundy wine and these mushrooms are

1696
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,480
all white so like this is so strange so

1697
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:14,038
I published this I mentioned it and

1698
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,679
herris Smith magazine 1988 was published

1699
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:18,480
I put it in one of my books growing gmet

1700
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:22,039
medical mushrooms in 1994 everybody

1701
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:26,439
basically ignored me um and I called

1702
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:29,198
this Michael Factor number two okay F of

1703
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:31,119
B okay this don't make sense to you in a

1704
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,158
while these are this series of strange

1705
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:36,039
experiences in my life ever since I was

1706
01:08:33,158 --> 01:08:38,479
a child you know to the present day so

1707
01:08:36,039 --> 01:08:41,640
I'm hiking in the oldw forest it's what

1708
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:44,278
I like love to do bear Scrat

1709
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:46,480
trees and the forest service L Timber

1710
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:48,920
industry put a bonty on Bears to kill

1711
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:50,599
them I live in Skookum Inlet there's

1712
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,279
massive Salon runs coming right in front

1713
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:56,079
of my place and there's no bears at all

1714
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:58,600
because the hunters killed the Bears on

1715
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:00,359
on a bounty because bears are scratching

1716
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:04,279
the trees and when they scratch the

1717
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:06,600
trees they introduce fungus the polypore

1718
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:09,640
mushroom in particular the red belted

1719
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,719
polypore that I held up at the beginning

1720
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:15,838
so when the beer crat trees then resins

1721
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:17,759
ooze out and uh and bees use the resins

1722
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,679
to make propolis to seal the cracks in

1723
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:23,838
their hives and for anti microbial

1724
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:25,960
protection so I'm hiking the South Fork

1725
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:28,479
of the h River in the Olympic mountains

1726
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,719
I like the orienteer I go off trail and

1727
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:32,838
I see this bear strike this is the best

1728
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,679
bear strike scratch photograph I've ever

1729
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:37,679
seen and I take this Photograph and you

1730
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:40,759
know bear went up this tree went bam you

1731
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:44,119
know and I'm wow I'm there with my wife

1732
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:45,759
dy I said you know the the forest and

1733
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:47,798
Timber industry killed the Bears because

1734
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,000
of these bear scratches they said the

1735
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:51,719
red belted poly pork you know is a

1736
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,640
parasitic fungus because of the scratch

1737
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:56,520
and it hurts their bottom line so let's

1738
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,719
kill all the Bears humans are so good at

1739
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,840
choosing opposite of their best interest

1740
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,119
so it turns out that work here in

1741
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,560
British Columbia found that bears bring

1742
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:07,519
salmon carcasses up on out of the stream

1743
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,760
the be the the salmon are bringing sea

1744
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,520
phosphorus and other minerals and by

1745
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:16,360
Scavenging animals of of wolves coyotes

1746
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,560
bald eagles Etc Ravens that they spread

1747
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:21,519
the phosphorus through the forest it

1748
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,280
helps the forest grow um so um but so we

1749
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,640
go back two years later took a long time

1750
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:28,198
to find this hours and hours hours and

1751
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,600
pouring rain and we find the exact tree

1752
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:33,719
two years later and lo behold my God the

1753
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,239
the red Delta polyp when is growing

1754
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:37,719
there a different tree but there's a

1755
01:10:35,238 --> 01:10:39,759
scar also but this is what red belt PO

1756
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:43,039
for looks like it was growing out of the

1757
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:45,039
tree well the red Bel of Po also creates

1758
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,719
the pesticides this is very active in

1759
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:49,719
micro remediation breaking down toxins

1760
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:50,719
uh so I found that to be really

1761
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:53,039
interesting because I was working with

1762
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:55,640
it already and I connected the dots H

1763
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:58,479
interesting be scat trees the red four

1764
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:04,719
comes out of its tree scratches that is

1765
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:07,238
Michael Factor number three F of C okay

1766
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,399
so my friend Lou schwarzberg who's a

1767
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:12,198
National Geographic and Walt Disney

1768
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:14,198
slowmo fast Mo photographer he knew my

1769
01:11:12,198 --> 01:11:17,000
work with enop pathogenic fungi I have

1770
01:11:14,198 --> 01:11:19,119
seven patents now on using fungi to

1771
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,119
control termites you know mosquitoes

1772
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:24,519
carpenter ants Etc he said Paul do you

1773
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:26,319
know about colony collapse with bees is

1774
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,520
horrible and a ver of Might I've been

1775
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:29,719
interviewing these beekeepers and

1776
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,000
they're under assault by this might and

1777
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:33,520
I went wow I have I know how to use

1778
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,880
these Spong to control insects and

1779
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:40,080
arthropod so maybe I can do something

1780
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,560
well so I started researching about bees

1781
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,359
and then President Obama came out with

1782
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,000
this memorandum and bees are on multiple

1783
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:49,279
stressors it's a Confluence it's a

1784
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,920
perfect storm all these stressors are

1785
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:55,279
coefficients in a in a in a formula the

1786
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,399
end of which is causing the bees to die

1787
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:59,679
well there there be nutrition last lack

1788
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:02,119
of foraging lands there's parasites the

1789
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:05,158
mites in particular the vector viruses

1790
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:10,359
and the uh cooccurrence of pesticide

1791
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:13,198
exposure and insecticides Etc so um and

1792
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:16,198
the use of now neonicotinoids neon as

1793
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:18,960
they're known um and it's harming the

1794
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:22,119
Drone sperm vitality and limiting their

1795
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,359
lifespan so again it's a perfect storm

1796
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:28,000
so I this sort of started coming at me

1797
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:30,039
and um then and whole foods thank you

1798
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,359
Whole Foods for this Photograph but

1799
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:34,319
here's your Dairy selection with bees

1800
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:38,198
and if we had no Bees this is what your

1801
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:40,039
Dairy selection would look like so 70%

1802
01:12:38,198 --> 01:12:43,799
of your food is

1803
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:45,439
indirectly uh indirectly dependent upon

1804
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,679
bollin

1805
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:51,599
pollination so um then the New York

1806
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,440
Times came out with an article and this

1807
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,039
has been all over the news for the past

1808
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:58,519
several years that the line of

1809
01:12:56,039 --> 01:13:01,399
pollination Services by bees and bats

1810
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:04,400
and other uh and other insects is a

1811
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:07,719
threat to Global Food uh

1812
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:11,879
biocurity so I'm laying in bed and I

1813
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:14,840
love the space The Ether space between

1814
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:17,039
sleeping and dreaming and wakefulness

1815
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:20,600
and I find that to be a really creative

1816
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:23,840
M to engage now and spend some extra

1817
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,840
time I'm writing this book on medicinal

1818
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,039
mushrooms and work with a bios Shield

1819
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,480
biod defense program you know I have all

1820
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:32,639
these patents on on working with you

1821
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:33,799
know controlling insects and it's not

1822
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:35,480
true it's all over the it's gotten

1823
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,239
viable about 10 times many of you seen

1824
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:41,759
it Paul stus can take down Monsanto you

1825
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:43,519
know not quite true you know um um but I

1826
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,840
do have a very destructive technology

1827
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,679
that we're launching in January that

1828
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:52,760
will be a big threat to Monsanto um but

1829
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:55,600
so I I have this Epiphany um and I went

1830
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:58,520
oh my God I think I know to help the

1831
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,960
bees I may be able to save the bees so I

1832
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,600
is Epiphany and I put these spots

1833
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,079
together I'm at ched I called the

1834
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,360
University of California Davis and tried

1835
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:11,000
to explain what doing the people got

1836
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:12,920
blurried eyed or ear I don't know what

1837
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,719
you're talking about I called Steve

1838
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,560
Shepard I said Steve just give me a few

1839
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,158
minutes to explain this and after

1840
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,639
explaining for a few minutes Steve said

1841
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:21,879
stop don't go anywhere else Washington

1842
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:24,279
State University I'm the chair of

1843
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,920
enology we're interested in doing this

1844
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:28,079
so I'm going to show you 5 minute movie

1845
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,560
that's aired on hundreds of PBS stations

1846
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,559
that kind of summarizes the initial

1847
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,199
research that Steve and I were doing uh

1848
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,199
with his with our

1849
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:45,199
[Music]

1850
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:47,799
teammates wow very nice these girls are

1851
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:50,519
fantastic I LIF that lid up and those

1852
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:53,119
girls are slid across there and they're

1853
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,480
making honey and they're making babies

1854
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,639
ericon owns more colonies than any

1855
01:14:55,479 --> 01:15:00,238
beekeeper in Washington state h no

1856
01:14:58,639 --> 01:15:02,239
there's nothing greater than to open a

1857
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:05,678
beehive and see them doing well they're

1858
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:08,399
doing well today look at that tickled

1859
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:10,639
but just months ago he opened his hives

1860
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:13,479
and discovered nearly half his bees were

1861
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:15,880
dead I spent 20 years as a pilot in the

1862
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:18,799
Air Force and my share of combat

1863
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:21,199
situations and I never was as low as I

1864
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:25,159
was when all those bees were dead that's

1865
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:27,599
the lowest time of my life it turns out

1866
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:29,319
this maybe The New Normal the US

1867
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,360
Department of Agriculture says that

1868
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:34,079
nearly half of colonies across the

1869
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:36,439
country died in the 2014

1870
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:38,920
season big losses have been happening

1871
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:41,158
for years and scientists haven't

1872
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:43,800
pinpointed what's causing them they say

1873
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:46,198
more than 60 factors may play a role in

1874
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,719
collapsing colonies factors like

1875
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:51,799
pesticides malnutrition and loss of

1876
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:54,119
habitat if we don't find some answer I

1877
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,520
am really concerned about whether these

1878
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:59,279
little girls will survive but one

1879
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:02,520
unlikely solution may be growing close

1880
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:04,079
by in the forest of Western

1881
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:08,040
Washington

1882
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:09,559
another enter Paul stamis he's a Pioneer

1883
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:12,000
in the study of

1884
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,000
mushrooms this a beautiful specimen the

1885
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,760
white margin here means is growing

1886
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,560
brilant well that's what I call Happy

1887
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:23,760
mushrooms makes me a happy person

1888
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:26,000
too I'm involved in the study of fi ever

1889
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,760
since a very young age

1890
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,279
my initial interest was magic mushrooms

1891
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,360
and then I got into edible mushrooms and

1892
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:33,238
medicinal mushrooms and my mother was

1893
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,119
much

1894
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:39,479
happier scoured the forest for rare

1895
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:41,679
types of fungi I use mology the use of

1896
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:44,238
fungi to help clean up the

1897
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:48,158
environment improve the immune system of

1898
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:51,000
animals and I began to think we've gone

1899
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:53,839
to the Moon we Bond the Mars and we

1900
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,079
don't know the way of the

1901
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,520
be

1902
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,519
all right bet I can do something to help

1903
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:03,719
the

1904
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,480
be stam's recently discovered a mushroom

1905
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,639
that might be able to take on one of the

1906
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:09,879
honeybee's worst enemies and that's

1907
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:13,480
called the verite with the the name

1908
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:17,400
veroa Destructor verites began wreaking

1909
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:19,359
havoc on USB hives in 1996 we lost about

1910
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:22,238
half the colonies east of the

1911
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:24,479
Mississippi over that winter Steve

1912
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,919
Shepard is an entomologist at Washington

1913
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:29,439
State University he spent decades trying

1914
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:32,239
to understand how verites

1915
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:34,759
honeybees he says they invade hives and

1916
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,559
attach themselves to infant bees I

1917
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,480
always think of it as having something

1918
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:42,120
about the size of a pancake feeding on

1919
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:45,678
you they live off Be Blood and transmit

1920
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:45,679
a slew of viruses to their

1921
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:55,279
host some sickly bees lose the ability

1922
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:57,639
to fly and gather food for the hive many

1923
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:59,399
end up dying prematurely they'll Kill

1924
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:01,670
The Colony within a couple of years

1925
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:03,679
unless in Keepers

1926
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:06,119
[Music]

1927
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:08,600
intervene that's why Shephard decided to

1928
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:11,158
try a new approach something doesn't

1929
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:14,360
look quite right with that

1930
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:16,319
yes he teamed up with Paul stamus stamus

1931
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:19,359
told him about a type of fungus that's

1932
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:21,719
highly attractive and highly lethal to

1933
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:23,719
termites Shephard wondered what this

1934
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:29,119
termite killing mushroom extract would

1935
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:29,119
do to the viral kn so we should U do

1936
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:37,560
something he recently started testing

1937
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:37,559
the product on bees in his

1938
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:49,439
lap so we take bees from colies with

1939
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:53,079
high might levels we set up numerous

1940
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:55,119
cages some with fungus they're finding

1941
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:57,880
that the product is killing mites

1942
01:18:55,119 --> 01:19:00,800
without harming bees it's certainly uh

1943
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,800
encouraging so

1944
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:09,880
far and that's not all that mushrooms

1945
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:13,158
can do for bees bees have immune systems

1946
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:14,880
just like we do and these mushrooms

1947
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:17,519
they're like miniature pharmaceutical

1948
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,039
factories their initial results show

1949
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,120
that certain forest mushrooms can reduce

1950
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:24,800
viruses in bees and help them live

1951
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:26,800
longer I think I've discovered now that

1952
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,119
the fungi that ring the logs are

1953
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,520
absolutely critical for the

1954
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:32,679
immunological health of the bees this is

1955
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,440
a really interesting potential

1956
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:37,480
breakthrough and understanding how

1957
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:40,960
nature works and how we coevolve with

1958
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:43,319
funi Shephard and stamitz plan to expand

1959
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,920
both experiments by partnering with

1960
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:47,840
commercial beekeepers Eric Olson was the

1961
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,279
first to sign up I don't have too much

1962
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:53,880
hair left I have pulled my hair out we

1963
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:55,279
just can't seem to get a control on the

1964
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,600
paroa m

1965
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,719
we've got our fingers crossed the future

1966
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,840
of Western honeybee colonies and the

1967
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:05,039
billions of dollars of crops they

1968
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:08,560
pollinate may depend on

1969
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:11,800
it so most beekeepers will tell you that

1970
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:15,159
the ver verite Vera Destructor is really

1971
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:18,560
the the biggest issue with u with bee

1972
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:22,158
colonies and Steve Shephard me told me

1973
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:25,159
that once there's 7% uh of the bees have

1974
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:28,238
barites the colonies are doomed

1975
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:30,719
so 7% of the population are infected The

1976
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:33,359
Rite that spells the death of the colony

1977
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:35,960
so this is metum anle it's an enop

1978
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:38,439
pathogenic fungus it's a mold sometimes

1979
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,279
it can produce a Corps mushroom and so

1980
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:42,479
this is the area this is the what I

1981
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:45,158
presented today at the B conference

1982
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:46,799
because this is very new information um

1983
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:48,920
and the next few slides come from

1984
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,840
Wasington state uh uh University C

1985
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:55,800
Shepherds team and Brandon Hopkins uh

1986
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:59,719
and a new post Nick nagler uh we uh they

1987
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:03,199
treated uh 10 hives uh with the metum

1988
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:04,439
fungus uh and 10 hives with a control

1989
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:05,799
and you know I was thinking about

1990
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:07,439
delivery system and the simplest

1991
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,920
delivery system by far was just a petri

1992
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:13,599
dish and so we put a petri dish on the

1993
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,158
top of the frames and the bees

1994
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,480
immediately started Scavenging there's

1995
01:21:15,158 --> 01:21:19,319
Sugar In Here Also malt sugar AG so I'm

1996
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:22,119
sure that's appetizer to them and then

1997
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:24,719
in a matter of a day they actually remov

1998
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:27,359
all this entire fungus and The Malt Ager

1999
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:29,000
and then the pach dis is basically empty

2000
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:30,719
well this are the newest research

2001
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,679
results just came in in the past two

2002
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:37,319
days um and the uh High significance on

2003
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:40,359
day five and day seven where we were

2004
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:43,880
able to uh eliminate a lot more Mall

2005
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:46,759
normalized MF the control is uh in Gray

2006
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:49,760
here the sporulating the melium is in

2007
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:53,800
red um now bear in mind this fungus that

2008
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:56,920
we have it was not they grow they kill

2009
01:21:53,800 --> 01:22:01,800
mice and also ticks and Carpenter Rants

2010
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:03,800
and termites uh but there's a a species

2011
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,840
there's a different varieties and more

2012
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:09,159
that are tuned for different uh targets

2013
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:12,880
insect targets so what we're doing with

2014
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:15,559
WSU is uh after only 3 days some of the

2015
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:17,760
mites fell uh from infection with this

2016
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,360
fungus and now we put the mites onto a

2017
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,880
pachra dish we grow out the mycelium as

2018
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:26,439
a second as a first generation and then

2019
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,960
we'll grow out the we do that again and

2020
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:32,839
then we'll get more MFS and then we'll

2021
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:34,520
then navigate to find a a new strain uh

2022
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:38,319
that uses epigenesis and natural

2023
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:43,280
selection to find a more virulent strain

2024
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:48,198
uh of metum against mice okay so that's

2025
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:53,000
myofactor number four okay F ofd metum

2026
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:54,879
infect okay so I'm writing this new book

2027
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,520
I have literally my manuscript up on the

2028
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,000
table and then this journal comes and I

2029
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,080
was really happy when I made the front

2030
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,319
page of the journal and it was about

2031
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:05,359
colony collapse and what these

2032
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:07,119
scientists found out that the colonies

2033
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,759
that for those of you don't understand

2034
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:10,800
the colony collapse there's lots of

2035
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:12,920
different factors but basically the bees

2036
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,440
just abandoned the nest and in two days

2037
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,760
they're gone you know thousands of bees

2038
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:18,238
that were there 2 days earlier now

2039
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,159
they're gone it's not like they're dead

2040
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:22,439
all around the nest they could be some

2041
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:25,319
but most of them are just gone it's like

2042
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:27,719
where'd they go um and so what happens

2043
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:30,079
is that the workers uh that used to

2044
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:32,639
forage for the average of nine days and

2045
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:34,840
now foraging for 4 days so the nurse

2046
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:36,520
bees taking care of The Brood then

2047
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,760
become worker bees to go out get more

2048
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,480
pollen because there's not enough worker

2049
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,440
bees coming back so their foraging range

2050
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,638
has been limited both temporarily as

2051
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:47,678
well as geographically so when they

2052
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:50,239
looked at the honey and abandoned

2053
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:54,119
beehives they found the honey lacked

2054
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:56,879
peic acid well peic acid I know peic

2055
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:59,679
acid when melium breaks down wood it

2056
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,639
produces pic acid and so I was

2057
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:05,279
astonished to learn that peic acid

2058
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:07,400
controls a cyome p p450 pathway is the

2059
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:09,759
detoxification pathway that all animals

2060
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:14,799
use we primarily have it in our liver

2061
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:18,360
many of liers detoxify uh Xeno compounds

2062
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:21,880
uh and the bees only have 47 genes but

2063
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:24,839
these genes are controlled by pic acid

2064
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:27,079
turning on the cytic p450 pathway most

2065
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:30,039
insects have 80 of these genes humans

2066
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:33,319
have 60 but bees only have 47 so the

2067
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:36,119
absence of pimaric acid prevents the

2068
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:38,840
bees from detoxifying pesticides

2069
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:43,479
insecticides all sorts of other toxins

2070
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:46,520
so I went aha well the melum is

2071
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:49,678
producing pic acid as it breaks down

2072
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:52,040
wood so I surmise unlik gosh well the

2073
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:55,920
bees want pic a they need to go to a red

2074
01:24:52,039 --> 01:24:58,439
LA and you take away you Forest you do

2075
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,319
monoculture you use fungicides to kill

2076
01:24:58,439 --> 01:25:02,039
all the fungi in the environment you're

2077
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:04,279
dismantling the pathway of

2078
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:07,800
detoxification that bees need because

2079
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:11,559
pic acid is no longer there what turns

2080
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:13,000
out that g phosphates you know uh this

2081
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,880
is something mon Sando doesn't want you

2082
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,279
to know but it's very well established

2083
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:21,118
that gly phosphates interfere also with

2084
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:23,158
the p450 pathway even in humans so this

2085
01:25:21,118 --> 01:25:25,158
is not just been found that glyos Fates

2086
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:26,679
are in all of our Foods

2087
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:29,118
in the United States the EPA was not

2088
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:30,520
testing for this until just recently

2089
01:25:29,118 --> 01:25:32,399
it's widespread throughout our entire

2090
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:34,400
food chain now so this is also

2091
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:38,118
interfering We Believe with with the

2092
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:41,559
detoxification pathway now so it started

2093
01:25:38,118 --> 01:25:43,679
Mak making sense to me now remember my

2094
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:46,800
garden giant mushrooms were supposed to

2095
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:49,840
be red but they're white and then I had

2096
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:52,199
this Epiphany oh my gosh see as it turns

2097
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:56,079
out it stimulate mushrooms to form we

2098
01:25:52,198 --> 01:25:59,238
need light but but muss are most highly

2099
01:25:56,079 --> 01:26:02,399
uh stimulated uh and light in the blue

2100
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:04,279
light in the 320 nanometer range that

2101
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,000
stimulates the melium to produce

2102
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:08,519
mushrooms now the melium is growing

2103
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,479
don't eat the wood chips has no light

2104
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:13,000
and when you the wood chips that are

2105
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:15,599
taken off and myum exposed to light it

2106
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,399
stops La cases which are breaking down

2107
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,560
the wood but now is triggering the

2108
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:22,319
mushrooms of form so why digest now

2109
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:26,159
let's produce a mushroom so myum stops

2110
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:28,960
lactases pic acid are stopped and then

2111
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:32,679
tyrosinase is coded for that leads to a

2112
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:35,000
pigment so the bees I think where and

2113
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:37,039
the bees can see down to 320 ners we can

2114
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,639
see down to about 400 nmet so we can't

2115
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:42,319
see this but I think the bees are

2116
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:45,079
buzzing along the habitat and they're

2117
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:48,319
looking down to see if there's any blue

2118
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:50,559
reflective melum and it's a whisper that

2119
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:53,599
melium coming up then they can go down

2120
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:55,039
there dislodge the wood chips get the PE

2121
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,239
cheric acid that they need for

2122
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:59,760
detoxification but once light hits that

2123
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:01,759
melum mushroom to a form but it turns

2124
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,039
out that it interferes with the teras

2125
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,639
pathways that causes melanization so I

2126
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:07,439
think my mushrooms were white because

2127
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:09,000
the bees were interfering with proat by

2128
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:11,678
exposing the wood chips prematurely to

2129
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,679
light I don't know that's my ey

2130
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,679
mother

2131
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:21,079
so thank you very much that the first

2132
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:23,118
audience has gotten this

2133
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:28,079
okay this is

2134
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:30,238
microfactories okay F fungal pic a acid

2135
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:33,000
activates the detoxification pathway

2136
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:35,638
okay so we started working and um we did

2137
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,439
develop mro honey so this is all from

2138
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:40,480
melium rown on Rice it's super sweet

2139
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:42,719
it's delicious and so we started

2140
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:45,079
developing micro honey uh it's great and

2141
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,439
coffee by the way uh super delicious

2142
01:27:45,079 --> 01:27:47,639
we're going to eventually come out with

2143
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:50,399
something like this you know for

2144
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:53,480
consumers and then we start presenting

2145
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:56,238
uh different forms of melium all grown

2146
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:58,678
on rice to Steve shefer at WSU for

2147
01:27:56,238 --> 01:28:01,359
longevity stress experiments in

2148
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:02,800
captivity worker bees live about 30 days

2149
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:06,079
they kind of die after that period of

2150
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,199
time so the bees are being fed extracts

2151
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:09,840
and this is the

2152
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:13,279
artist you know of the heida for

2153
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:15,039
instance this is a 10% solution and um

2154
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:18,599
the bees that are exposed and they're

2155
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:21,760
drinking this sugar water now uh

2156
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:23,400
beekeepers are feed their bees uh

2157
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,679
commercial beekeepers in particular

2158
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:30,799
sugar water is 50% sugar 50% water or

2159
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:33,118
corn Sy uh and so we the idea is you

2160
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,560
could put this this Michel honey or the

2161
01:28:33,118 --> 01:28:38,679
extracts into the sugar water and that

2162
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,440
way the bees then can be consuming okay

2163
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:43,239
so after doing this working now with

2164
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:45,559
Steve Shepard and his team at WSU a

2165
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:48,158
summary of the best mushrooms that

2166
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:51,639
showed benefit to the bees are uniquely

2167
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:54,079
associated with first trees and they are

2168
01:28:51,639 --> 01:28:57,960
the red Delta polycor it also goes on

2169
01:28:54,079 --> 01:29:01,439
bir trees birch trees chaga now remember

2170
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:03,840
chaga was active against flu viruses uh

2171
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:06,719
that you saw in the bio Shield program

2172
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,920
amadu which my hat is made from remember

2173
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,279
amadu is the first antiviral ever found

2174
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:14,639
from a mushroom against the mosaic virus

2175
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,840
came from amadu and the red RI mushroom

2176
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:19,520
well here's a summary of some of the

2177
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:22,199
best results that we got the longevity

2178
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,800
effects of omdu my hat is made from this

2179
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:26,479
is the number of bees that are surviving

2180
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:28,880
high significant and there's nearly a

2181
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:30,399
doubling of the number of bees that are

2182
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,760
this time critical period where they're

2183
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,158
foraging so there's many more bees out

2184
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,800
there that are surviving compared to the

2185
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:38,839
controls Steve made the statement in 39

2186
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,639
years of experience setting bees is uh

2187
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:42,440
he's unaware of any materials that can

2188
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:45,359
extend with life of work be more than

2189
01:29:42,439 --> 01:29:47,559
this and then we go and we look at the

2190
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:50,639
mushroom that bears introduced the red

2191
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:54,880
belted polyur here and here's the

2192
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:57,359
control and at a. 1% solution

2193
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:00,039
is also nearly a doubling on the light

2194
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:02,880
number of bees that are alive during

2195
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:05,479
these later stages of their life now

2196
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,960
this is at .1% that's one drop per

2197
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:11,718
thousand drops one milliliter per liter

2198
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:15,000
a very small amount of this extract from

2199
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:19,118
the red Delta polypore and then looking

2200
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:21,760
at the viruses and from cha the control

2201
01:30:19,118 --> 01:30:23,559
viruses go up one week to the next week

2202
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:26,679
and looking at the as we increase the

2203
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:31,199
concent ation then the viruses and

2204
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:33,239
plumet and then looking at the uh the

2205
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:34,759
effect of viruses by the red R she on

2206
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:37,519
the B viruses they go up with the

2207
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:39,159
controls blue to blue and then on a step

2208
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,080
as we increase the concentration of the

2209
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:43,238
viruses

2210
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:45,719
PL so the summary from these initial

2211
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:48,079
results so with the rice control the V

2212
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:49,480
viruses go up with these extracts

2213
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:51,399
remember this one is the BIOS Shield

2214
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:53,319
program active against Blue viruses this

2215
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:56,079
was active against Blue viruses the red

2216
01:30:53,319 --> 01:30:59,599
Bel for is a sister species is called

2217
01:30:56,079 --> 01:31:02,238
PSIs picula a gacon is called kopsis

2218
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,480
fical that's interesting so we found a

2219
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:07,279
cluster of four polypour mushrooms

2220
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:08,759
rotting wood that's highly uh

2221
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:11,519
significant and extending the lifespan

2222
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,280
of bees and also reducing their viruses

2223
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,679
then now I got really fascinated with

2224
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:18,759
this I started became a literature Hound

2225
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:21,760
uh looking at B viruses and the in the

2226
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:24,079
past 80 years from Asian BS the deformed

2227
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,960
Wing virus has spread all over the the

2228
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:29,479
world originally from Asia and now it it

2229
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:32,600
is thought that all bees in the world

2230
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:35,678
have the deformed wi virus it is spread

2231
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:38,119
this is just this is four articles in

2232
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:40,679
2016 where the deform wind virus is

2233
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:43,839
described as a primary one article the

2234
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:46,440
primary cause of colony collapse being

2235
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:48,679
vectored by the mites the mites are like

2236
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:50,759
dirty syringes they're shooting a slew

2237
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:54,960
of viruses not only the form wi virus

2238
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:57,600
but other ones as well and then uh TL

2239
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,239
came out Andre TL came with this article

2240
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,840
saying the deform wind virus is a

2241
01:31:59,238 --> 01:32:07,158
leading Contender as a cause agent of

2242
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:11,600
colony uh Coline uh the Klein and

2243
01:32:07,158 --> 01:32:14,799
another article here in 2016 by m MC MCM

2244
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:18,119
as say that there's a global pandemic of

2245
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:20,159
DMV is spreading throughout the world so

2246
01:32:18,118 --> 01:32:22,158
the latest research results so that was

2247
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:24,799
very encouraging and I really just

2248
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:26,920
wanted just profusely thank the

2249
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,920
Washington State University and Dr Steve

2250
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:31,039
Shepard for having faith and carrying

2251
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:34,158
this Mission forward because our latest

2252
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:37,000
results hold on to your hat this the

2253
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:38,559
latest results with the aladu mushroom

2254
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,840
the mushroom that my hat is made them

2255
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,920
and the red RI that reducing Amad

2256
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:47,440
reduces the deform Wing virus a th000 to

2257
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:51,000
one in the matter of about two weeks two

2258
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:54,599
to three weeks the uh the red R sheet

2259
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:57,158
decreases the lake Sinai virus 500

2260
01:32:54,600 --> 01:33:00,199
to one well we have species specificity

2261
01:32:57,158 --> 01:33:02,439
here folks we have different poly

2262
01:33:00,198 --> 01:33:06,638
mushrooms more active against uniquely

2263
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:09,719
different species of viruses so and then

2264
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:12,800
the Jay Evans a renowned biologist with

2265
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:15,279
the USDA uh sent this statement recently

2266
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,800
I've never seen such strong antii B

2267
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:20,039
viruses I've seen with st's extracts

2268
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:23,039
this is huge and then for the queen

2269
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:25,519
breeders out there uh they have viruses

2270
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:27,600
and it turns out that cha reduces the

2271
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:31,480
the black queen cell virus by more than

2272
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:34,440
100 to1 as does the red ra well this is

2273
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:37,718
huge so I got really excited I spent all

2274
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:40,839
this money on this and so I did file uh

2275
01:33:37,719 --> 01:33:43,000
US Patent I filed international patents

2276
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,880
they did massive searches through every

2277
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,639
language you know English German Chinese

2278
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:50,159
Japanese there was no prior art no one

2279
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:52,159
had ever made mention of this in

2280
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:54,638
anywhere in scientific or popular

2281
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:57,039
literature I apparently the first one

2282
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:59,400
the patent has now been approved is

2283
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:02,118
publishing October 25th the

2284
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:04,039
international patents will soon follow

2285
01:34:02,118 --> 01:34:06,359
and this is the most important

2286
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:10,719
communication that I can give you as all

2287
01:34:06,359 --> 01:34:12,079
hands on De we are facing 6X is a direct

2288
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:14,920
threat to food

2289
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:17,319
biocurity now in order to be charitable

2290
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:19,920
you have to be profitable to be

2291
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:22,319
sustainable with that condition I am

2292
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:26,930
announcing that I am going to open

2293
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:30,078
source for the comp all these be

2294
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:30,079
[Applause]

2295
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:46,639
pounds but we have to be profitable

2296
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:49,198
enough to be able to to show people this

2297
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,800
delivery system have to do it we make

2298
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:53,238
thousands and thousands of gallons of

2299
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,320
these extracts uh this is totally

2300
01:34:53,238 --> 01:34:56,599
deliverable

2301
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:58,559
Deployable um you know one of these

2302
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:02,280
barrels can probably treat you know

2303
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:06,600
10,000 20,000 hives uh it's a tremendous

2304
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:09,599
uh uh uh it's it's it's so ecologically

2305
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:12,119
rational it's so partible it's so

2306
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:14,400
deliverable uh it benefits from

2307
01:35:12,118 --> 01:35:16,960
biodiversity of the forest ecosystem

2308
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:20,079
we're intimately tied and the irony of

2309
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,359
this is that um we all grew up with

2310
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:24,319
Winnie the

2311
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:26,759
Pooh we all knew that bears when the

2312
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:29,238
wild logs because honey honey would be

2313
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:32,079
there for the beehives so I propose to

2314
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:34,238
you the stesan mushroom be

2315
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:36,279
hypothesis B scratches introduce

2316
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:39,479
mushroom molum of course woodpeckers do

2317
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:41,759
and you humans do be attct the rot LS

2318
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:44,519
Hab for immunological benefit the myum

2319
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,960
reduces viruses provides peic acid

2320
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:49,199
reduces Xeno xenobiotic toxin exposure

2321
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,359
the mum breaks down toxins bolsters the

2322
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:53,799
general immunity of these and I think

2323
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:56,039
they strengthens the wingspan because

2324
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,719
the deformed Wing virus and you saw that

2325
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:58,719
very terrible bee didn't have very good

2326
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:00,439
wings that would be kicked out of the

2327
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,880
hive it would die but what about the

2328
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:05,799
bees whose tensal strength has been

2329
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,960
diminished by low titer low infection

2330
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:09,880
population rates of the deform wind

2331
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:11,920
virus and so that may be why the bees

2332
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,760
cannot forage as far their wings

2333
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,639
basically are not strong because they're

2334
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,480
infused by the virus and it increases

2335
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,800
longevity now we don't know if this is

2336
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:24,399
true so this is a great project for a

2337
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,600
graduate student so folks

2338
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:30,039
micro Factor number

2339
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,760
six okay now this story starts to get

2340
01:36:30,039 --> 01:36:34,880
really really really

2341
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:37,719
strange okay I'm there you know I'm such

2342
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:40,719
an idiot my new book you know and this

2343
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:43,359
communication uh you know about pic acid

2344
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:45,359
I get really interested uh in being able

2345
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:48,559
to help the bees but I'm thinking to

2346
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:50,880
myself I got 70 strains of aaran I sent

2347
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,960
into the BIOS Shield program seven three

2348
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,960
of them were active against flu and pox

2349
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,118
viruses the other four were not this is

2350
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:00,279
probably why the pharmaceutical industry

2351
01:36:56,118 --> 01:37:01,880
missed this what if I70 I'll get a super

2352
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:03,118
hit Superstar there got to be one that's

2353
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:05,719
going to be really potent compared to

2354
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,519
the others so I get a NIH barology the

2355
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:09,760
BIOS Shield program had been shut down

2356
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,800
you know several years ago so I write

2357
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:14,560
NIH

2358
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:18,320
orology and uh and and 17 minutes later

2359
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:21,760
the director of orology NIH Chris sang

2360
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:23,840
tsg just retired he basically said hi

2361
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,800
Paul we love working with you was great

2362
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,480
work with you you had such a high hit

2363
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,719
rate there a percentage of the bio

2364
01:37:27,479 --> 01:37:31,319
Shield program you had 30% hit rate

2365
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:33,880
where they dropped you so we had a

2366
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:35,920
really high percentage of success and he

2367
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:39,199
said but you know we won't bio Prospect

2368
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:41,520
for you we won't do biotic fractionation

2369
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:44,279
you have to S us in a pure structure a

2370
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:47,320
pure molecule I'm not a

2371
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:49,399
chemist I'm like good news bad news NIH

2372
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:51,158
would love to work with this but with a

2373
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:53,799
pure molecule and before they'll accept

2374
01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:56,039
it they have to have virologist look at

2375
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:57,360
it and number one has anyone ever tested

2376
01:37:56,039 --> 01:37:59,800
this before they don't want to repeat

2377
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:03,439
somebody else's test they want a new

2378
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:05,279
molecule a new activity and secondly

2379
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:09,198
secondly the psychologically doesn't

2380
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:11,319
make sense so I'm going you know I have

2381
01:38:09,198 --> 01:38:12,559
this great opportunity NIH will give me

2382
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:14,960
they give me literally millions of

2383
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:17,280
dollars worth of research and now this

2384
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,079
wonderful opportunity doing research but

2385
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:22,759
they want me to send a pure molecule

2386
01:38:19,079 --> 01:38:24,920
there's more than 200,000 molecules uh

2387
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:27,280
being by the melium and in these

2388
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:31,399
mushrooms which molecule will I send

2389
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:35,000
them why not why don't I send them peic

2390
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:37,279
acid so I went into the literature I

2391
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,599
looked at the delignification pathways

2392
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:41,679
found two excellent articles that show

2393
01:38:39,599 --> 01:38:45,199
that pic acid as it breaks down the

2394
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:47,840
melum breaks down wood pic acid produces

2395
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:49,879
vanilla acid that's why wood smells like

2396
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,560
really wonderful rotted wood has that

2397
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:54,840
vanilla likee smell the vanilla AC acid

2398
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:57,599
is related to americ this being produced

2399
01:38:54,840 --> 01:39:00,159
so I chose 20 molecules that's all there

2400
01:38:57,599 --> 01:39:03,520
was and so I ordered the molecules from

2401
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:07,519
Sigma chemical and then I so I sent in

2402
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,040
10 molecules to NIH biology and they got

2403
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,800
all got accepted they said yep no one's

2404
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:12,760
ever looked at these this makes sense

2405
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,560
we'll test these and I said another

2406
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:18,920
second second set of 10 molecules so I I

2407
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:22,840
I will show you some of this results so

2408
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:25,800
this is extraordinary now this is again

2409
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:27,920
HP the human papala virus for which

2410
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,599
there is no good antiviral remember the

2411
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,480
SE activity index number anything over

2412
01:39:29,599 --> 01:39:35,159
10 is is highly active well this is

2413
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:37,678
really lowly highly active it's only at

2414
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:39,279
12 um so it's it's there's some

2415
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:42,239
antiviral activity but there's no

2416
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:46,039
antiviral drug that is on the market

2417
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:48,359
today that can control HPV and these are

2418
01:39:46,039 --> 01:39:50,238
they W sheet from NIH phology this is

2419
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:51,519
their red lettering this sample this

2420
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:55,319
sample this sample this sample this

2421
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:57,480
sample I hit home run here folks five of

2422
01:39:55,319 --> 01:40:00,799
these molecules turn out to be highly

2423
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:04,919
active against HPV and the SI numbers

2424
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:07,159
are just fantastic they 125

2425
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:08,840
1253 and then the strange and then

2426
01:40:07,158 --> 01:40:11,759
tested against these viruses verol

2427
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:14,400
zoster causes shingles Epstein bar anco

2428
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:16,840
virus causes cancer uh human papala

2429
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:18,158
virus causes cervical cancer neuro virus

2430
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:21,719
that many of you know about the ships

2431
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:24,719
and polio turns out of the 20 molecules

2432
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:26,960
that I sent eight of them them highly

2433
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:29,198
active and better than the positive

2434
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,599
anti-drug controls and the National

2435
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:33,319
Institute of

2436
01:40:30,599 --> 01:40:36,119
healthology used as a standard control

2437
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:39,039
the strangest one of all is vanilla

2438
01:40:36,118 --> 01:40:42,598
vanilla acid vanilla is more potent than

2439
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:44,399
a cycler against the shingles virus

2440
01:40:42,599 --> 01:40:46,279
you've all seen the TV commercials are

2441
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:48,479
everywhere now about people getting

2442
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:51,559
rashes and how harmful chiggles is

2443
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:55,959
they're pushing a cycl it's a 10 billion

2444
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:59,280
now off patent drug and vanilla no one

2445
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:02,480
tested vanilla as an antiviral until I

2446
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:05,279
tested it and all comes from my

2447
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:08,279
Association of peic acid and deification

2448
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:09,759
of wood so a few chemists here in the

2449
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:13,079
audience I know this so this is for you

2450
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,320
chemist there are the structures and um

2451
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:17,279
this is basically uh showing the

2452
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:19,880
comparison of the drug controls versus

2453
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:24,319
our activity and this is the list of the

2454
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:26,400
new anti molecules new to science and um

2455
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:29,920
then the summary we have the drug

2456
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:32,479
controls cycl Riv viin interfer Alpha TV

2457
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:34,920
Alp this is the viruses the drug

2458
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:37,879
controls our samples are more potent

2459
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:42,920
than all of these new standard antiviral

2460
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:45,279
drugs that is mof Factor number seven

2461
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:47,359
antiviral molecules related to pic acid

2462
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:51,000
are active against viruses pathogenic to

2463
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:52,238
humans so I present to you for the first

2464
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,479
time

2465
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:59,399
ever a microa factorial equation a

2466
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:02,000
formula for a paradigm shift that's not

2467
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:04,479
paulse stus that's paradigm

2468
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,439
shift a revolutionary solution for

2469
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:10,439
disease prevention so the the in order

2470
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:13,559
to achieve paradigm shift is f of a plus

2471
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:15,238
b plus C plus d plus e plus f plus G and

2472
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,520
this is what all these correlate through

2473
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:20,718
I just walk you through the entire story

2474
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:23,880
of the of the microfactory equation that

2475
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:26,520
can lead to a paradigm sh but but the we

2476
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:30,279
there's something more it turns out

2477
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:31,800
remember amadu extracts limit the mosaic

2478
01:42:30,279 --> 01:42:34,599
virus that harms

2479
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:38,639
plants if that's the case then we can

2480
01:42:34,599 --> 01:42:41,000
create folar sprays of amidu melium and

2481
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:45,239
we can spray on the crops to prevent

2482
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:47,639
plant viruses and also give bees access

2483
01:42:45,238 --> 01:42:50,598
to the antiviral properties of omin

2484
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:52,840
melium there's no examples of viruses

2485
01:42:50,599 --> 01:42:53,880
that infect plants that cross over to

2486
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:56,440
humans

2487
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:59,440
but this is an example of the common

2488
01:42:56,439 --> 01:43:01,678
solution that can control two different

2489
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:05,479
types of viruses in two different

2490
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:07,520
kingdoms where is this going to go well

2491
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:12,039
I don't really

2492
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:15,000
know micr Factor you know I what's F of

2493
01:43:12,039 --> 01:43:17,079
I this is a gateway folks this is a

2494
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,399
gateway to a whole new Arena of

2495
01:43:17,079 --> 01:43:21,880
knowledge this is ready for the Paradigm

2496
01:43:19,399 --> 01:43:24,198
Shift these microfactory equations can

2497
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:26,560
be dialed in they can be targeted

2498
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:28,359
specifically have ecosystems disease

2499
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,880
vectors population of the animals and

2500
01:43:28,359 --> 01:43:35,759
plants I think this is huge

2501
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:37,880
now we are all hopefully now be

2502
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,760
mushroom the scientists across

2503
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:42,920
disciplines need to work together mic

2504
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:45,280
diversity is our

2505
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:49,719
biodiversity and our

2506
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:54,519
biocurity so I present to you humans

2507
01:43:49,719 --> 01:43:57,239
trees Bears mushrooms the birds and the

2508
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:59,080
bees all terrestrial organisms evolve to

2509
01:43:57,238 --> 01:44:01,919
be interconnected with the myal web of

2510
01:43:59,079 --> 01:44:05,158
life within Earth's natural

2511
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:08,239
internet and we follow the path of melum

2512
01:44:05,158 --> 01:44:11,079
we respect nature we respect indigenous

2513
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:13,238
peoples we we honor The Descendants and

2514
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:15,079
a shout out to the first people the

2515
01:44:13,238 --> 01:44:17,919
concept of Seven Generations is

2516
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:19,639
something that we all need to adopt it's

2517
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,000
seem to be part of our constitution

2518
01:44:19,639 --> 01:44:25,639
frankly you know uh the constitution of

2519
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,198
the of the UN the United States Canada I

2520
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:30,960
think we also need to reframe the

2521
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:32,839
discussion we need to celebrate

2522
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:36,000
decomposition up

2523
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:39,920
Rock bumper sticker the best thing that

2524
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,319
you can do is put wood in your backyard

2525
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:45,960
and just let them

2526
01:44:41,319 --> 01:44:49,679
WR so I want to just

2527
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:52,639
end with A New Concept

2528
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:55,840
here and my friend Sasha here is the

2529
01:44:52,639 --> 01:45:00,118
graphic artist and we co evolved this it

2530
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:03,920
is now time to launch into the

2531
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:07,238
microe we list forever together within

2532
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:10,000
the myal micromolecular Matrix I am

2533
01:45:07,238 --> 01:45:12,198
Bound by confidentiality but I highly

2534
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:15,520
suggest that you watch Star Trek that

2535
01:45:12,198 --> 01:45:19,079
comes out in January of

2536
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:21,719
2017 and I think that we have the

2537
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:23,840
ability of terraforming other planets we

2538
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:27,760
can be able to to be able to create

2539
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:31,480
micro genomes that can be launched for

2540
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:33,159
the into other planets in order to

2541
01:45:31,479 --> 01:45:36,399
transform and create

2542
01:45:33,158 --> 01:45:38,359

2543

view view of the universe it conforms to

2545
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:47,639
the same archetype that is shared by

2546
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:51,039
melium by the computer internet by

2547
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:54,679
neurons and I personally believe matter

2548
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:56,599
begins life life become single cells

2549
01:45:54,679 --> 01:45:59,039
single cells become strings strings

2550
01:45:56,599 --> 01:46:01,520
Branch become membranes and these

2551
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:05,560
archetypes are resident throughout the

2552
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:08,679
cosmos inevitably we will find myal like

network based organisms on other planets

2554
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:13,399

two-minute movie that Louis schwarzberg

intelligent the fact that we lack the

language skills to communicate with

nature does not impune the concept that

2574
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:26,279
nature is intelligent it speaks to our
