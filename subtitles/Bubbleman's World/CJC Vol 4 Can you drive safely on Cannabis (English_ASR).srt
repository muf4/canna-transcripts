1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,759
hey everybody Welcome to the Cannabis

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,000
Journal Club where we review and

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,719
interpret United States cannabis patents

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,879
and cannabis journals uh and scientific

5
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,640
journals sorry with concise overviews of

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,160
complex scientific literature in an

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,118
understandable and easyto consume manner

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,439
to expose the knowledge hidden in the

9
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,920
scientific literature we do not comp

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,560
claim any medical utility and we

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,560
definitely advise you to obtain your own

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,079
copies of these public documents and

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,439
share them with your doctors and family

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,199
so without further Ado I would love to

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,238
introduce the man of the hour Dr David

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,960
Allen welcome Dr

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:44,718
Allen thank you bubble

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,280
man hi I'm Dr David Allen and this is

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,439
budley green and today we're going to

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,879
talk about uh driving performance when

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:58,119
you use cannabis so is it safe to use

22
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,518
cannabis and drive your car and and

23
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:03,238
that's a complex question actually and

24
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,239
it probably depends on a lot of things

25
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,478
especially your experience at using

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,519
cannabis so this article that we're

27
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:13,280
going to review is a NIH study National

28
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,519
Institute of Health so it's a government

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,320
study and you have to look at it look it

30
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:23,399
up yourself the the article is titled

31
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,798
sex differences in the effects of

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,920
marijuana on simulated driving

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,680
performance and this is a a great study

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,439
and it doesn't give us all the answers

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,200
but it gives us some answers and so what

36
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,438
they did is they took men and women and

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,719
they

38
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:44,158
uh uh put them on a driving simulator

39
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:46,118
and they would have stuff run out in

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,399
front of them like animals or cars or

41
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:50,840
something and they would test their

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,599
reaction time and whether they were able

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,118
to avoid a crash or not and uh they

44
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,438
tested the same person before they used

45
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,200
cannabis and then they had them use

46
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:03,199
cannabis and then they tested the same

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,960
person

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,598
afterwards and in table

49
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:14,519
two um if you expand table two it

50
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:17,479
clearly shows that uh women had no

51
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,920
difference in reaction time or crash

52
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,840
avoidance or anything like that and

53
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,639
that's a remarkable thing in itself that

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,000
it didn't change anything at all for

55
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:33,479
women but in men they had 1.1 second

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,400
faster reaction time and three times

57
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,439
better crash avoidance so in this

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
limited study you're actually safer

59
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:46,759
driving your

60
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:48,878
car uh when you're inebriated on

61
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,280
cannabis uh than you are when you're

62
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:55,158
when you're straight so uh there'll be a

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,640
lot more studies before this is over but

64
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:59,239
obviously uh there's not a lot of people

65
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,878
crashing right now and there's a whole

66
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,439
lot of people using cannabis so uh I

67
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,318
believe that you're probably a safer

68
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,919
driver when you use cannabis I would

69
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,039
also add to this information and I've

70
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,199
mentioned this to people many times in

71
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,400
the past that we know comparing to

72
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:21,318
alcohol in particular alcohol is

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,680
releasing inhibition it's it's allowing

74
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,798
you to make decisions that are not smart

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
decisions and so all sorts of people

76
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,480
most people 90 plus percent of people

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
absolutely are of the belief it's almost

78
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,840
like a Dunning Krueger effect when

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,039
people drink alcohol they suddenly think

80
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,959
oh I can totally Drive no problem I'll

81
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,438
be fine and that is really the danger

82
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,200
it's not the danger that they're so

83
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,359
impaired it's the danger that they don't

84
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,280
know they're so impaired and they decide

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
that they're able to drive on the flip

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,878
side with

87
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,719
cannabis most of the people I know if

88
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,199
they get uncomfortably High the last

89
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,919
thing they're going to do is drive they

90
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,719
just won't they will not drive they will

91
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,399
not say hey get give me the keys I'm

92
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,438
driving if they're just high and they

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,560
don't feel 100% comfortable the part of

94
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,719
the brain that allows you to make a

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,239
proper decision that isn't Frozen by

96
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,000
alcohol consumption allows you to say

97
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm not going to drive right now so I

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,120
think that plays a big portion of course

99
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,039
I know I've known people my entire life

100
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,519
that have driven under the effects of

101
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,800
cannabis I have done it myself I will

102
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,639
say the other part of asking is it safe

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,199
to drive under the influence of cannabis

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,759
is the getting pulled over by the police

105
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,800
part which which is definitely not safe

106
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,400
to do it's a little bit different than

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,120
what we talked about in the study but it

108
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,319
definitely also has another effect so

109
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,038
once again Dr Allen thank you so much

110
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,199
for sharing this wonderful information

111
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:47,439
on the Cannabis Journal Club I have put

112
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,319
the link to the patent or the study

113
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,759
sorry in the description of this video

114
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,159
and uh um excellent points yeah

115
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,400
excellent point so I'll leave it to you

116
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,000
to uh to finish us off

117
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:04,120
here all right well uh

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,399
so cannabis is his own Governor if

119
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,680
you're if you're smoking cannabis and

120
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,719
and like Marcus said you don't want to

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,759
drive if you're too high so it it

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,440
prevents you from driving and so and it

123
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,879
if you're driving it makes makes you

124
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:24,319
drive slower and you're more careful to

125
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:27,800
try to avoid crashes and stuff so um we

126
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:33,120
hope uh God blesses this chapter of

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:38,240
cannabis Journal club and and uh J over

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,439
evil live it God over evil awesome peace

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,439
out everybody
