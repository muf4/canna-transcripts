00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,599
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,560
just sitting here on the beautiful Sea

4
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,118
to Sky Highway overlooking the house

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,919
sound which is part of the uh Georgia

6
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,679
straight which is actually the Pacific

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,280
Ocean uh just heading back down from

8
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,840
Whistler I spent the last couple of days

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,879
up there really beautiful powder fell

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,039
overnight and actually today I got one

11
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,519
of my best runs I've gotten in a long

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,120
time but had some work to do needed to

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,879
head back to my home and so I figured

14
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,718
I'd stop here at the Shannon Archer

15
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,718
Memorial bench um this was a bench uh

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,640
for a young lady who passed away on the

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,558
highway back in

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,640
2005 uh she was only born in 19 85 so

19
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,280
she was uh only 20 years old and so this

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,719
is a bench that her family have set up

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,920
in remembrance for her if you're ever

22
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,158
traveling down the Sea to Sky highway I

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,680
find it to be a great place to stop and

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,320
have a little session and just uh enjoy

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,240

26
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,000

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,679
water nice small rig that

43
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,479
fits pretty much anywhere I

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,519
go and now it's just a matter

45
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,560
of pulling out a dab of something

46
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,959
delicious I've got a ton of stuff from

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,560
the great Gardener in here as well of

48
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,800
some of my own watermelon

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,479
but I think we're going to go d420

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,599
k OG cush full melt dry

51
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,759
sift I think that's going to be where we

52
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:42,000
go

53
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,878
today I love the texture on this one

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,318
although it's bone dry

55
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:47,799
powder it doesn't take much to press a

56
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,919
little piece into

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,080
a into a

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,280
hit I actually left my Skillet Tools in

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,879
Spain I think maybe with the Ripper

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,318
seeds guys I'm not sure I haven't heard

61
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,799
back yet but uh I'll tell you those

62
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,079
tools sure come in

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,959
handy you don't realize how often you

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
need them until they're

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,840
gone all right picked up my little creme

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,560
brulee torch at the Whistler kitchen

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,560
store thought that was kind of

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,920
funny all

69
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,919
right

70
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,840
dabs dabs on the ocean

71
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,158
still pretty new at the torching thing I

72
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,719
have to say I really like the electronic

73
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,519
Nails uh obviously the electronic Nails

74
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,080
aren't really going to let you dab in a

75
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,438
place like this so the little mini rig

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,439
in the torch comes in quite handy

77
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,879
all

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,879
