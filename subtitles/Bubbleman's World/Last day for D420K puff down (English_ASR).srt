69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,000

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,080
actually did some dabs oh yeah I dab the

72
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,679
dab bar we dabed at the dab bar what was

73
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
neat was you just literally pull

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,480
yourself right up to the bar there and

75
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
you see order like you're ordering a

76
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,639
drink and boom they're doing the dabs

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,920
they're running the torch the running

78
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,119
the Dabber the running the whole show so

79
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,559
you have the nice most optimal talk you

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,959
can have and I was impressed with the

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,479
whole situation i' actually go back

82
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,280
there again and uh I liked it I liked it

83
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,438
a lot very cool man yeah it's nice to

84
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,519
have a city that you know we've got our

85
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,959
our compassion clubs which are very

86
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,280
serious sort of almost medical

87
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,000
establishments we have our vapor lounges

88
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,918
which are really just like anyone can

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,399
kind of go you pay your five bucks or

90
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,198
whatever then you have your combination

91
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,560
Club Dash Vapor Lounge like what

92
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,160
Darren's talking about where you would

93
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,839
require to show a license you can't just

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,639
medical license they won't just dab

95
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,560
anyone out you got to have your license

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
so it's very cool that these things

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,038
exist and then then you have anomalies

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,400
it's so nice it's available you have

99
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,279
anomalies like um mega ill you know

100
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,038
these guys that are like Mark the weed

101
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,198
guy who's literally selling medicated

102
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,560
pizza and Med medicated treats I believe

103
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,879
there's a company in Vancouver called

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,720
Fusion that's also now doing it or

105
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,478
infused sorry I'll uh I'll write it in

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,440
the comment section cuz I don't want to

107
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,038
get the name wrong but uh

108
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,600
it's nice to see it starting to blow up

109
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:06,800
here in Vancouver you know it is for how

110
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,439
advanced Vancouver was in the '90s it

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,960
seemed like it really took a slow pace

112
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,000
in this last decade of not really in the

113
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,359
'90s it was really it was really hard to

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,680
get into that like that's when I was

115
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,879
coming down and met you you know and and

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,600
we're you know we're always smoking and

117
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,959
stuff but we never we're never uh you

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,560
know openly like this did we do this at

119
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,318
all it was just you know it was was it

120
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,160
wasn't wasn't able to be done although

121
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:41,280
getting [ __ ] we didn't mind getting [ __ ]

122
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,479
either yeah but not stupidly right

123
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,038
yeah so it's nice that we can do this

124
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,758
we're not offending anyone we're not

125
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:50,000
throwing anyone's day off and in no

126
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,160
shape or form to Darren and I feel like

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
we have to look around all rubber necked

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,400
worrying about you know any type of

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,720
police or security or any type of

130
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,279
actually take a look at the video yeah

131
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,600
watch this when you when you look back

132
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,799
at this video look to see if we were

133
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,759
like if we did that even once I I don't

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
remember doing it if I I did it one time

135
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,960
at the start of the video when the

136
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
Harley drove by and I just went like

137
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,598
this to to see the was yeah it's like

138
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,519
when you're on a bike and you hear a

139
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,319
bike you're looking at the bikes I look

140
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,120
at bikes even when I'm not on a bike yes

141
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,800
sir [ __ ] right it's part of loving it

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,720
you know dirt bikes [ __ ] crotch

143
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,319
rockets you know Road uh anything on two

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,000
wheels I'm telling you anything on two

145
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,840
wheels and even some of those [ __ ]

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
spider three-wheelers are pretty trippy

147
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,478
the two two wheels in the front I take

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,639
that thing for a ride I might not buy

149
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:42,279
one but you know I'm wondering if those

150
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,720
wheels go like this those yeah they

151
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,038
articulate like a car they literally

152
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
well I know they turn like this but do

153
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,000
they when you will they

154
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,279
lean I'm not sure you know what I mean I

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,759
don't know I'd like to check I bet if

156
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,918
you went around a corner fast enough

157
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,840
it's hard to say though because it

158
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,519
really is going to offset if I really

159
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,318
want to know I could just YouTube it

160
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,918
good I yeah it's true I'm sure someone's

161
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:07,840
gone like 130 mph like around sure does

162
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,519
the [ __ ] spider articulate or maybe

163
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,679
some of you out there know and you can

164
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,478
yeah let us know man video maybe you got

165
