00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,338
hey bubbleman here today to talk to you

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,279
about fresh headies brand new product

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,740
called the bubble bags light the bubble

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,928
bags light is a reply to the marketplace

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,359
being created around the high end

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,368
original bubble bags which all speak to

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,608
you a little bit about later which are

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,868
pretty much one of the highest grade

9
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:26,189
levels of extractors that you can

10
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:28,559
purchase warranty lifetime and parachute

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,660
throughout the whole nine yards we

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,619
created a fairly expensive product that

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,238
not everyone was able to afford into so

14
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,339
it created a marketplace where a lot of

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,099
companies were selling cheaper inferior

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,629
bags and unfortunately in the corners

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,090
that they cut to get those cheaper

18
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:48,359
prices the effects were felt by the end

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,050
user in the lack of quality in the lack

20
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,609
of potential workability or usage

21
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,709
sometimes the bag straight-up didn't

22
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:59,488
work sometimes the screens were the

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,410
wrong in the wrong order sometimes the

24
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,259
materials used were extremely cheap and

25
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,780
threads came up apart and other things

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,280
came apart so you basically ended up

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,609
with a product that you are not inspired

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,290
about and so bubble bags light is a

29
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,728
reply to that or reply to the

30
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,280
marketplace that's been created around

31
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,340
the higher-end bubble bags original in

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,689
order to release a product that the end

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,150
user can afford first of all and be able

34
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:29,069
to get into the world of water

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,780
extraction get into trying in and

36
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,849
experimenting with it without breaking

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,500
the bank so today I want to talk to you

38
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,259
first of all about the five gallon eight

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,078
bag kits if you're familiar with bubble

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,209
bags we sell generally eight bag kits in

41
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,279
all our sizes which are one gallon five

42
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,919
gallon and twenty gallon they all come

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,140
with eight bags but we also do for bag

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,570
kits we've discontinued our threes but

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,109
we sell individual bags so you can make

46
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,989
any kit that you want so back to these

47
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,340
bubble bag lights five gallon one of the

48
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,809
first things I did right off the bat I

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,118
can show you have an original set of

50
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,549
bubble bags here this is a little bit of

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,560
a more expensive fabric material it's

52
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,060
softer and thicker this is quite a bit

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,500
thinner so right off the bat I thought

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,629
what a great way to cut costs

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,370
I'm still making a carry case still

56
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,219
allowed to hold the bags and so you can

57
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,780
carry it but cut the costs it won't

58
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,879
affect the quality of the end product

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,140
that is being used to make the with

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,299
these bags so that was step one step two

61
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,099
which was a fairly big step if you're

62
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,550
familiar with the original bubble bags

63
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:35,549
there's eight colors we got them right

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:41,820
here the originals blue the two 20

65
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:44,939
micron bag the green 190 bag the red 160

66
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:48,329
micron bag the orange one 20 micron bag

67
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:52,609
the black 90 micron bag the yellow 73

68
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:55,410
the white 45 and the purple 25 micron

69
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,930
fairly expensive to buy cloth for all

70
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,789
those colors to the fairly exhaustive

71
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,670
investment and I was able to cut some

72
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:05,370
corners and save a little bit of money

73
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:07,649
by with the bubble bag lights I also the

74
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,750
main reason I did this I was able to cut

75
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,640
the colors down and only release three

76
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,860
colors so these particular the lights

77
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,879
are always going to be red white and

78
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,549
blue and those three colors in eight

79
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,879
bags will still represent these original

80
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:26,909
colors and how I did that was if you

81
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,349
notice the work bag is a 220 and you can

82
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,629
open it up this one's actually inside

83
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,120
out right now I was using it there's a

84
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,919
band on the bottom of each bag and the

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,750
threat as well you probably can't see it

86
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,208
but I have photos of this the thread is

87
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,930
blue and the band on the bottom of the

88
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,269
bag is also glue so this blue band

89
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,739
signifies the original work bag which I

90
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,890
just showed you in the original bubble

91
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,990
bags which is a 2 20 micron so that's

92
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:55,969
our 2 20 bag we move into

93
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,650
the next bag is a white bag the next

94
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,109
four bags are going to be white that's

95
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,599
going to be the 190 through to the 90

96
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,400
micron and each one is going to have

97
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,590
that same original piping of the

98
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,659
original color so the 190 original bag

99
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:16,009
is green green piping green threading or

100
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:18,769
red for the 160 orange for the 120 black

101
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:21,980
for the 90 and so on into the last three

102
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:25,149
bags which are blue they're the 73 the

103
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,970
45 and the 25 so they're going to be

104
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:31,039
yellow white and purple which is

105
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,900
according you know it correlates I

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,879
always like the bubble bags that it had

107
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:37,579
both the micron sizes but it also had

108
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,290
the color coordinated thing it was

109
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,579
always a nice bonus and it was it's for

110
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,430
sure you know people are still going to

111
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,810
always want to you know that are serious

112
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,370
about the game always go with the

113
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,199
original bubble bags but for those that

114
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,240
really want to experiment and get into

115
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,219
this game without affecting your end

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,920
product you're still going to make it as

117
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,560
nice of a product as you would with the

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,169
bubble bag originals you just won't be

119
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,610
getting a lifetime warranty so there's

120
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:03,589
those in a nutshell you're also going to

121
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,080
be receiving three pressing screens they

122
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:08,629
come in these little books pads whatever

123
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,229
envelopes you want to call them and you

124
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:14,839
open that up and you'll have a 25 micron

125
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,689
pressing screen with a band all the way

126
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,479
around and that folds in half and that's

127
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:23,240
how we dab the moisture out of the final

128
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,819
product so I didn't want to cut corners

129
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,379
so bad that I gave you a lesser product

130
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,879
and that's why I'm still giving you

131
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:32,389
three pressing screens because it's a

132
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,719
very important part of the process to

133
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:38,360
dry it and to get it properly opened up

134
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,050
so I definitely was going to make sure

135
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,050
that three of those went into every kit

136
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,050
alright
