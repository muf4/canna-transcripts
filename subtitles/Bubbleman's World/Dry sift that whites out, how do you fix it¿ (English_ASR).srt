00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:23,640
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,598
uh today I'm going to go over something

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,920
with you in regards to the infamous hash

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,679
Whiting out uh also known is buttering

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,160
we've seen it with water hash where the

7
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,200
water hash wasn't properly dried the wax

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,039
membrane was still hydrated when it was

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,679
pressed and this allows the water to

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,439
become trapped with those resins that

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,960
are inside the glandular triome head um

12
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,359
today we're going to be dealing with dry

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,600
sift but um what we found was sometimes

14
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,600
with the dry sift when we keep it real

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,960
nice powder um if it heats up in any way

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,399
shape or form it'll grease up and stick

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,280
to itself and generally if you allow

18
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,120
that puck that's once stuck together now

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,359
it seems to work almost as as though

20
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,840
it's a desicant it literally pulls

21
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,840
moisture out of the air and re I guess

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,478
it it creates that white effect where

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,880
that it just Butters out I have a little

24
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,200
bit of the Barb that was bone dry powder

25
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,158
when I brought it to um the treating

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,040
yourself show and what I've done is I've

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,118
broken it up uh it's kind of buttered

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,520
out I've broken it up onto the uh oil

29
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:29,599
slick and I've laid it down here on my

30
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,719
stainless steel barbecue um I guess the

31
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,158
drawer that's right next to the barbecue

32
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,399
it's nice and hot heating up in the Sun

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,759
and I'm going to show you how to Simply

34
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,040
with a little bit of heat um we can get

35
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,719
this stuff back to a nice shatter

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,320
product a nice dabbable product so I'm

37
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,599
going to pause the camera going to flip

38
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,519
the camera around and show you what I'm

39
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:53,199
doing and we'll uh get right back to it

40
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,560
okay all right so the the surface of

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,960
this um stainless steel is hot not not

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
extremely hot but I'm guessing that with

43
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,959
just a little bit of

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,478
pressure I'll be able to get this stuff

45
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,280
fairly pressed now what I'm also going

46
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:08,679
to do not just with this sort of

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,919
pressure you've got two different things

48
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,878
that pressure create uh an enormous

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,280
amount of pressure will create heat and

50
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,000
that heat will help uh with the process

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,598
of pressing um sometimes when you get a

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,560
buttery hash like this and it doesn't

53
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,159
want to press completely this is

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,640
pressing pretty

55
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,799
nice a little bit stuck to the top there

56
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,199
so you see we got a a decent press there

57
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,319
a little bit of a a hair stuck in there

58
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,560
so how I could help this as you've seen

59
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,199
I've already Pro it's pretty decent but

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,360
it's a bit still crumbly but how we can

61
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,719
help this is with a simple lighter and

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,280
just fan the top of the

63
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,318
hash fan the top of the hash try not to

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,919
burn

65
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:54,359
yourself nice and gentle

66
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:57,238
Fanning because it's windy the hash is

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,159
uh is heating up slow and then we'll

68
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,439
give it another real nice press and I

69
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,639
can feel it already in between the oil

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,318
slick that it's

71
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,598
um that

72
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:12,039
it's a little softer this time now

73
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:14,399
there's a gazillion ways to do this um

74
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,359
people do this by by uh pressing it in

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,760
their shoe sometimes oh this one's going

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,560
to stick a little bit more all right so

77
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,479
she's stuck on that side which is

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,598
perfect because now we'll light the

79
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,119
other side with the

80
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,079
lighter and a real gentle lighting I'm

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,680
not really getting it to to Bubble Up or

82
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,599
anything like that

83
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,400
just lighting it and moving it around

84
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,919
Fanning it to give that little bit of

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,799
heat that will allow us

86
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:43,280
to just give it that final

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,519
press and then what I like to do after

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,438
I'm done with with a press like this is

89
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,438
I'll go put it in the fridge or the

90
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,878
freezer just for a few seconds not the

91
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,120
not a super long time and I'll put this

92
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,318
in the freezer we'll open it up and

93
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,360
we'll see what we

94
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,919
got all right so we've just taken this

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,319
out of the

96
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,719
freezer I was only in there for about a

97
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,958
minute but now you can see we've got a

98
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,000
nice dabbable

99
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:14,239
product um from something that was

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,720
completely uh Whiting out you can now

101
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,319
keep the dabs in one whole

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,720
piece and uh yeah there it

103
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,439
is a little bit of a press a little bit

104
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,600
of a heat uh another way you could have

105
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,279
done this really simply put I could have

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,680
put boiling water inside of this um

107
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,679
lemonade

108
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,600
glass and just literally rolled over the

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,000
hash with the hot water inside here

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,479
that'll transfer enough of the heat to

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,918
melt that resin up bring those oils back

112
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:48,279
out and get yourself a nice uh dabbable

113
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:53,120
product I think it's time to go dab a

114
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:57,719
bowl all right so our little piece of

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,720
hash dabbing it up

116
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,759
