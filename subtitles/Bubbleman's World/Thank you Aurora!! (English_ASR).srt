18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,560
day and a half after the news of me

19
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,560
losing my camera um John Bell was uh

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,000
contacted by a friend of his

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,320
Elise now Elise works for a company

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,680
called Aurora uh and they are um a a

23
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,239

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,680
facility that have been applying for

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,519

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,159
license and are have a have a I guess a

27
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,599
facility somewhere in Alberta and so she

28
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,479
called me up and she was there when the

29
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,640
camera was taken and she saw the

30
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,200
devastation of both myself and John and

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,478
how it really you know from the

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,280
education that we were giving and

33
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,399
sharing and what we were doing and then

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,118
to be just our balloon be popped like

35
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,079
that uh it Disturbed her and so she

36
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,759
contacted uh Terry the owner of the

37
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,599
company and he's just a great guy and

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,759
they basically called me up within 36

39
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,879
hours of losing my camera and um between

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,239
the two of them they said that uh I had

41
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,959
spoken with them a little bit in regards

42
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,640
to potentially shooting their strains uh

43
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,559
with my macro lens for them when they

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,718
were uh ready and so Terry just put the

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,479
offer out through lease to purchase me a

46
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,118
new camera um without promoting their

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
company in any way which was really the

48
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:13,159
righteous thing about it they didn't

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,440
want me telling people about this they

50
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,639
weren't looking for free publicity uh

51
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,598
they weren't looking for me to tell

52
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,839
everyone that Aurora is the best company

53
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,598
and that we should all be supporting

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,519
Aurora they were really just uh rootsy

55
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,399
conscious loving people who wanted to

56
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,200
share uh and help a fellow human out who

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,239

should have it in the next couple of

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,959
days early next week and I just thought

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,800
it was important to go online and and

67
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,640
share this information you know a lot of

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,959
local people are hating on the licensed

69
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,158
producers they're saying that they're

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,878
nothing but money uh grubbing greedy

71
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:05,280
corporate entities that have come in to

72
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,479
take advantage of the medical marijuana

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,560
situation here in Canada and you know

74
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,280
from what I've seen from meeting this

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,560
group of people and from the reaction

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,479
they had to my camera being stolen and

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,759
in particular asking me not to uh you

78
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,798
know to say anything uh before I told

79
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,318
them how I would say something about it

80
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,760
which in which case they said was fine

81
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,598
they never asked me to support their

82
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
company they never asked me to tell

83
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,158
everyone that they were the best and to

84
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,679
get behind what they did was they got

85
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:36,438
behind me as a community member and they

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,120
