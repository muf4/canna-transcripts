go

68
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,719

too no they stopped it so that's the

70
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,400
that's is just telling me over here is

71
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,680
the bull fighting

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,759
arena right here so several years ago

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,160
they stopped it no more bull fighting

74
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,160
yes but still

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,160
dabbing all right

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,479
finally back for pops when I smell I

77
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,919
feel the high yeah

78
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:43,519
206 no I feel but I I I think this this

79
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,120
is not K me sure dude this is so nice uh

80
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,519
for those of you that aren't here this

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,680
is it's about a year and a bit old uh he

82
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,198
grew it last year before I left I think

83
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,519
or maybe before I got here and this is

84
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,680
2046 which is a Cali Mist I believe a

85
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:03,599
pre98 c Mist cross to NE is pre98 though

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,199
correct yeah of course of course I I I

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,199
have one pre98 and one pre 96 and for

88
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,840
your Neville's Haze did you plant many

89
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,439
and find the best one or was it a gift

90
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:20,038
or how did you find your Neville's Haze

91
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:24,038
W it's is the queen I think of my seat

92
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:27,199
bank is the the the more older plant I

93
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,959
got it in my my Ru mothers you know what

94
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,680
I mean did you plant it from seed did

95
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,000
you get it seeds from Greenhouse

96
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,959
surprised me because I can't find I try

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,120
to find the same genetics but but I know

98
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,959
some years ago greenhous is Los genetic

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,918
sure because but Greenhouse definitely

100
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,599
worked with Neville back in the day

101
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,120
Neville was hanging out there so it

102
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,199
would make sense that they would have

103
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,038
access to the original Neville T yeah

104
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,120
yeah yeah yeah and I guess after Neville

105
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,599
left I think they got Shanty Baba on

106
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,680
board Scott he made maybe the super Sil

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,039
when Santia work in the in Greenhouse

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,560
exactly

109
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,560
exactly in the mean time somewhere in

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Spain there it is there it is look at

111
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
that guys um I just it was funny cuz

112
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,679
when he handed it over to me it was just

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,800
utterly beautiful but there were like

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,478
four little pieces of contaminant so he

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,520
was like a it's dirty it's dirty but we

116
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,879
cleaned it what I cleaned all the pieces

117
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,959
perfect thank you thank you very much

118
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,759
looks better now maybe one one or two

119
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,159
more but it looks a little nicer right

120
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:39,680
mhm okay all right so I guess it's time

121
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,520
for a dab I of course don't have my

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,720
right

123
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,680
power I don't have my right power right

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,479
now so we're being very careful with the

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,959
whip I don't want to blow the fuse in it

126
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,240
or however you know put too much power

127
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,519
through the whip that is only able to

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,560
put a certain amount of power it's crazy

129
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,439
step down power here from 220 down to

130
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,879
110 that we require but once that heats

131
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,038
up I'm definitely going to hit this and

132

331
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,519

right deep Neville I love that one of

336
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,720
the strains that Javier has chosen to

337
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
work with two of them actually is the C

338
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,120
mist and the Neville's Haze both of

339
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,958
which I think have very special

340
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,239
properties that have been lost to those

341
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:26,558
who grow only kush or only these strong

342
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,679
strong indicas that exotic flavor yeah I

343
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,839
I I think something different I think

344
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,880
the people

345
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:36,240
[Music]

grow more plants for the time like for

347
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,000
the efforts yeah because the the people

348

484
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:17,000
make Prozac proac is lavander gross to

485
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:20,038
Goose lavender okay but it's much close

486
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,278
to Lavender listen when I first blew it

487
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:26,440
out it tasted like soap then it tasted

488
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:29,398
like like lavender gum that weird

489
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,399
lavender gum that tasted a bit like soap

490
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:34,239
yeah I can't remember what they used to

491
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:36,239
call it Thrills I think that is a really

492
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,440
unique tpine so you use lavender and

493
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,399
cross it with Kush Kush which was the

494
