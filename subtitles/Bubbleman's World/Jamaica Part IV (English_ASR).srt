zoos I feel they're a little bit like a

104
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,318
well not even a little bit I feel like

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,120
they're a lot like a jail and it's my

106
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,960
whole life I've never really been big

107
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,439

108
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,279

Zoo

110
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:39,000
wondering why people

111
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,400
see the need to lock up

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,918
animals but there's no doubt about the

113
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,918
fact that it's beautiful grounds really

114
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,719

189
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,760
well I like sunspice seasonings cuz one

190
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,360
of the things that mauricea has in his

191
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,799
future is that he wanted to one day

192
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,159
potentially produce spices that are in

193
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,000
infused used with cannabinoids you know

194
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,319
like the resins taken off of cannabis

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,839
and then put into some of his spices so

196
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,240
I think that's pretty much one of his

197
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,399
basic futuristic ideas where he can you

198
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,360
know not just be doing just spices but

199
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,759
doing you know phyto

200
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,440
canabo yeah exactly no GMOs no MSG none

201
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:22,958
of that crap it's a minimal amount of

202
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,240
salt minimal very

203
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,159
itol this is your thing so this is a

204
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,440
pretty good place for a little like a

[Music]

289
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,639
here

290
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,959
awesome very cool we're going to talk to

291
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,399
these guys later too technosol look at

292
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,958
that they extracted the 100% extra

293
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,440
extraction of

294
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,799
lemass yeah essential oils this is the

295
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,880
no this is the extraction man right here

296
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:39,958
right yeah I do extractions as but what

297
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:42,759
I extract you know ganja what it grows

298
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,838
the medicine on ganja is an essential

299
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,879
oil we call it hash but it's not that's

300
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,399
just a madeup word to make it illegal

301
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,360
now that it's becoming legal really the

302
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,679
hash from Cannabis is just the essential

303
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,120
oil of cannabis and they have many of

304
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:00,638
the same oils present in cannabis oil as

305
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,000
they do in many other plants so it's

306
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,318
pretty interesting okay but um like

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,078
caropine I read something somewhere that

308
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:09,399
they don't necessarily

309
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,039
steam

310
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,278
nool exract well there's many there's

311
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,879
many ways we can extract um with

312
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:20,000
cannabis because the essential oils are

313
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:22,600
secreted out of glandular tricomes small

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,759
microscopic glands crystals that grow on

315
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,278
the plant and so we know through

316
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,480
different um knowledges that we learned

317
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,198
over the years

318
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,480
that we can um I use water and ice I

319
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:37,439
freeze those little glands I'm going to

320
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,720
show it later today and basically they

321
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,600
they when I mix them in cold water and

322
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,240
ice like just plant matter the resins

323
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,680
will break off and because of their

324
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,639
density they'll sink in the water now

325
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,439
that's how you separate the resin from

326
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,720
the plant matter in a whole

327
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,160
unadulterated form without using steam

328
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,720
cuz here's the one thing about steam

329
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:01,278
that you'll learn eventually it has its

330
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,798
place for sure but heat destroys the

331
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:07,119
tpin the the the the volatile oils that

332
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,038
make up the composition of the essential

333
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,918
oil those are affected greatly by heat

334
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,359
and how we know that is when you smell a

335
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,439
flower you can smell it at room

336
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,838
temperature it it smells really nice

337
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,240
those are volatile tpin evaporating out

338
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,639
of the flow that's why you can smell it

339
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,038
so when you heat anything you're going

340
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,759
to change the structure of the oil and

341
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:32,038
so that's why they use cold pressing I

342
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,640
use uh water and ice and dry sifting

343
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,879
methods and uh I think we'll see new

344
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
methods in the future that are involve

345
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,840
cold like a cryogenic process or

346
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,399
something that can preserve the oils as

347
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,319
much as possible but this is really cool

348
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,919
what you guys have set up

349
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,639
here so we have Lemon Grass bitter

350
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:56,170
orange you know Cil orange

351
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,600
yep bit orange very nice that's

352
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,080

353
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:04,359
great all right all right I many need to

354
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,359
one of these thanks guys

355
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:10,139
[Music]

356
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,558
okay well I think it's time to set this

357
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:20,519
up Ash definitely a few so I believe we

358
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:23,279
should be coming to each of the booth to

359
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,960
distribute the launches in addition to

360
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:30,720
that um Minister paulwell who was

361
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,558
scheduled to be on the ceremony uh this

362
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,240
the at the ceremony today is unable to

363
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:40,240
make it so he's popping in at 1:00 um

364
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,319
for our breakout session and we should

365
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,519
be anticipating him in a few so we'll be

366
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,678
inviting persons to come around and

367
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,679
participate in

368
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:56,599
that right so just listen out for more

369
00:18:53,558 --> 00:19:00,720
announcements and just we'll soon get

370
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:00,719
you refreshed in a few all right

371
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,410

00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:16,909
[Music]

373
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,879
would have been nice

374
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,798
this looks good

375
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:53,240
SRC how you guys

376
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:56,639
doing right on uh you're from SRC oh

377
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,839
okay I'm from crd and you can have with

378
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,038
you guys

379
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:04,279
have the booth set up all

380
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,038
nice Hydro

381
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,879
distillation can you tell us a little

382
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,599
bit about Hydro distillation oh okay

383
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,559
it's actually the process by which one

384
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,879
of the processes by which you extract

385
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:17,480
essential oils from plants so it's Hydra

386
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,159
you're using water M and um you're

387
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,240
distilling the oils which are volatile

388
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,320
so what happens is that you immerse your

389
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,919
plant and it can be either fresh or it

390
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:30,079
can be either dried material you immerse

391
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:33,240
it in the water you have a heat Source

392
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,319
when that boils the um essential oils

393
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,880
come off as a vapor they condense they

394
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,798
in the coil yeah right they and they

395
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,679
collect in the bottom jar right this is

396
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:46,519
a Ultra so this is lemongrass it's

397
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,480
lighter than the water so it floats on

398
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,599
top I see I see so that's great and so

399
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,960
what about I'm I'm not a scientist but I

400
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,558
know that anytime we heat something

401
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,600
particularly volatile oils like tpin and

402
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,440
terpenoids that potentially were

403
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,678
changing their structures and producing

404
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,440
artifacts of their true molecules right

405
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,640
so it's the heat source is controlled

406
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,960
it's controlled heating you can actually

407
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,720
adjust the temperature so we we um we

408
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,840
get the oils off at very low temperature

409
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,759
and is this done under a vacuum as well

410
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,359
no it's not it's there's no need to be

411
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,839
it's all just open right okay and you

412
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,599
can always check the quality of your oil

413
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:26,959
when you're finished using DC

414
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:30,158
um or even the proton hnmr I believe

415
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,400
that they have at UI that be amazing

416
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,960
well that's really cool thank you for

417
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,840
explaining that I know the viewers on my

418
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,440
channel will really appreciate that cuz

419
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,959
right now there's a few people in the

420
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,880
community that I live in which is the

421
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,720
Cannabis Community um people are

422
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,600
desperately trying to figure out how to

423
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,558
uh extract the tpin from the plant

424
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,240
matter obviously this is a great way to

425
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:51,440
start the ball rolling and then start

426
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,599
using your head to figure out okay how

427
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,360
can I protect these volatile oils that

428
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,278
are evaporating at room temperature and

429
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,918
now I'm going to apply heat it would be

430
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:03,038
great if we could do it under a vacuum

431
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:06,159
under a much colder uh conditions and

432
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:09,158
still get the same job done that'd be

433
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,159
awesome

434
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:22,180
