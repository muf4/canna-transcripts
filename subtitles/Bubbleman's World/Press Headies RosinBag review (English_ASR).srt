00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,679
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,000
uh it's been a while since I put up a

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,000
video I know I've been pumping out the

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,759
hash churches every Sunday but I have

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,719
been very busy lately and trying to get

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,400
some new products uh on the up to on the

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,640
market uh as well as working out with

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,518
some different Consulting gigs and of

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,480
course constantly trying to promote uh

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,839
the JAMA project that we started last

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,320
year uh along with our partners uh and

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,239
United cannabis so all of these things

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,719
are sort of coming to a head and there's

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,959
you know they beginning here and they're

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,439
beginning there and I finally wanted to

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,039
get this video out uh I got this new

18
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:50,839
product in about a week ago um these are

19
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,719
of course the Rosen bags um I've got

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,559
three sizes here we've got the 4 in x 5

21
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,439
in which you can see right here and it's

22
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,718
just a nice little screen pouch that you

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,679
can put your product in I've got my

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,239
medium size uh which I have at about uh

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:11,519
3 in by 4 in uh this Micron screen is 32

26
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:14,118
Micron so I've moved away uh from the 25

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,679
and I've gotten the 32 Micron uh which

28
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm able to offer at a better price uh

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,560
and of course I don't think people are

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,680
really interested in paying you know

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,600
seven eight $9 a piece for these I

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,200
currently have these up on the site you

33
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:31,199
10 in a pack with the pouch and the

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,520
label and uh it's 40 bucks so they're

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,118
four bucks a piece and of course they're

36
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,478
very very very reusable um and then the

37
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,319
smallest ones which I think are going to

38
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,640
be very very popular this is really the

39
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,839
hair straightener size right here these

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,680
two although I'm sure you could get that

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,759
into a a one of the wider hair

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,159
straighteners just um I find that these

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,680
two are really going to be for the Press

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,880
uh this one for the 5x5 that we have

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,840
right here and this one I would suggest

46
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,959
to use on the larger press all the

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,920
although I might try to fold it up in a

48
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,199
way where we can get off one Press today

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,038
this is also a 90 Micron bag uh the

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
larger style a lot of the people that

51
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,759
will be using this larger style are

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
going to be packing it full of hash uh

53
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,399
those that are going to be using it for

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,480
Bud uh good friend Rufio from the

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,239
advanced rosin Tech group was mentioning

56
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,359
that he prefers a 90 over a 120 maybe it

57
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,200
was a 120 over a 90 I can't really

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
remember now but uh we'll make sure we

59
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,839
confirm with him later we've got custom

60
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,359
sizes available of course if anyone want

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,280
wants uh more than uh 200 singles I can

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,920
do any Dimensions that you want in most

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,199
microns that you would request uh

64
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,759
depending on what you want to do just

65
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:46,158
hit me up at bubbleman bubble bag.com

66
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,799
and make the subject Rosen bags all in

67
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,039
capital and I'll be able to give you a

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,080
quote there so I guess today what I

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,120
really wanted to do was squeeze off a

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,360
couple of batches I've got my new paper

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,360
here that I'm going to be using instead

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,159
of parchment now I don't know the name

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,560
of this yet as I'm still basically

74
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:04,239
researching it along with Tony who sent

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,479
it to me uh it's his release so I'm just

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,680
using the material uh you can ask as

77
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,000
much as you want inside the comments but

78
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,760
I won't be able to tell you what it is

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,840
cuz I still don't know what it is I

80
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:18,039
thought it was a Teflon sheet it is not

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,158
a Teflon sheet uh hit up Tony vura T

82
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,560
verzura on Instagram if you really want

83
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,000
to know he might tell you but uh I think

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,280
we're first going to be making it as uh

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,919
sure as a safe product as possible

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,199
before we let people know the Nam so I'm

87
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,039
going to be doing a squeeze initially I

88
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,598
think we will do uh one of these with

89
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,479
some nice hash in it as well as a

90
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,598
packing it full of herb I think the

91
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,840
majority of people let's be honest are

92
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,158
using these smaller batches uh to

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,799
squeeze herb a lot of people are

94
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,079
squeezing bud and I know that you don't

95
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,879
necessarily need a screen if you're

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,439
going to be squeezing your rosin out of

97
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,840
your bud but it's definitely comes in

98
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,799
handy if you want to have the clean

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,840
clean clean and you don't want to spend

100
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,159
uh a very long time picking out

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,200
particulate from your rosin uh that got

102
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,239
in there from the bud so of course a

103
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,399
small little screen like that is easy

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,920
now it's got a very small hole to fit in

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,760
so what I would suggest doing for people

106
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,639
is you get a business card like this one

107
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:18,680
here my bubble bag business card fold it

108
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,599
in half sort of stick it in like this

109
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,680
and then you'll be able to uh easily

110
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,720
fill that little bag say if you wanted

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,079
to pack it full of some ground up herb

112
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,400
that you had it would uh it would pretty

113
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:34,038
much pack pretty nice like this

114
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:37,239
this there we go I love efficiency it's

115
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:39,560
just my favorite thing so I'm not sure

116
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,160
if I'll pack all of this in here I'm

117
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,439
sure I could if I wanted to I'm not a

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,600
big bud uh squeezer I haven't squished a

119
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,560
lot of buds I really have mostly uh been

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,320
doing hash we'll slide that out right

121
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,280
like that and then you can see you have

122
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,918
a nice little pouch uh full of

123
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,559
Bud so basically why don't we turn on

124
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,560
our press

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
all right so a good thing to make sure

126
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,720
when you turn your uh Dil press on is

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,839
that you have it lowered to the proper

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,360
um

129
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,879
size yeah that should do good for mebe

130
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,199
one little half unscrew you always want

131
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,600
to make sure it's good when you're on

132
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,879
camera especially so a lot of people

133
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,560
were using my uh pressing screens these

134
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,800
are the original pressing screens from

135
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,000
the bubble bag kit and uh that's what

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,639
people have been using

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,879
uh to press out their rosin right now

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,160
but I found that it was more efficient

139
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,399
for us to produce a product for them

140
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,360
make it a less expensive and uh easier

141
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,519
to use with the sewing it is a pain in

142
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,680
the ass when you only have them folded

143
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,198
uh the folds uh can potentially open

144
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,120
quite easily so turned on the denail

145
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,160
Press it's already at 30° C uh it heats

146
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,478
up quite fast this one of course is

147
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,080
going to go to about

148
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:04,199
120 125 and that will be a good 240 to

149
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,439
250 fahit I usually don't really go much

150
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,439
uh hotter than that um we should also

151
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,000
pull out some of going to want to press

152
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,199
some

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,720
bubble we got some

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,038
OG we got some pink so we've got uh some

155
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,280
bubble that we're going to be pressing

156
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,000
as well I'm going to use some more of

157
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,799
this Lindsay OG she got a real nice

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,240
color on her in there you can see real

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,319
light tan color uh a Sol four star

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,639
bubble you know by no means a five or a

161
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,639
six but a solid four real nice enjoyable

162
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,879
flavor and taste and uh while it presses

163
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,478
out unlike uh anything I've really seen

164
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,120
let me see if I can really just show you

165
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,639
a little a little of the cured out

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,399
lindsy OG rosin that I made oh this must

167
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,918
be a couple of at least a couple of

168
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,000
weeks old now so

169
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,799
that's that's the quality that we're

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,279
dealing with right there you can see

171
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,280
that's pretty pretty much the goods

172
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,359
right there squeezed out of one of these

173
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,598
little pressing screens and uh so I want

174
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,720
to show you both today basically I want

175
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,000
to show you um the process being done

176
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,360
with hash and I want to show you the

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,879
process being done with uh some bud now

178
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,080
this Bud here I would wager that it is

179
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,680
not a lot it's very light and

180
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,758
powdery we can throw the one of these

181
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,038
screens on the scale real quick and

182
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,960
that's a04 so we'll tear that and then

183
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:37,000
we'll throw that on and this is 2.5

184
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,758
g 2.5 g of

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,199
cannabis and it's nice to be able

186
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,800
to if you've already got your thing

187
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:48,360
heated up it's not a bad idea to just

188
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,478
just close the

189
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,199
top you can you can see that right there

190
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,598
how it just folds over real nice and I

191
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,520
still have a little bit of room for the

192
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,158
bud to actually expand so we're not

193
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,799
going to be popping anything out

194
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:03,319
and uh we'll just get it on either side

195
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,879
of our sheath

196
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,439
here and we'll do a little squeeze and

197
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,560
we'll see what we can get here off of

198
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,279
uh off of a little uh Bud the bud by the

199
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:18,000
way for those of you that were for sure

200
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:20,598
going to ask is my 20-year-old Bud

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,079
20-year-old seed from Jamaica see if you

202
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,519
can see that without the reflection in

203
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,959
the camera and uh this is from Johnny B

204
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,038
John Bell was such a kind dude he gave

205
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,878
this to me for one of my birthday days

206
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,639
this was the first Bud he grew he was

207
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,839
one of the first people I gave the Clone

208
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,519
to of the 20-year-old Lamb's bread

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,640
Jamaican and uh I have a bag of it it's

210
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,200
you know 100 G or so but it's mostly

211
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,319
been powdered and and broken down so I

212
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,160
thought why not we'll use that uh and

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,879
we'll show them what we can get out of

214
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,360
uh out of that so let me just make sure

215
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,480
yeah this is

216
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,200
closed give it that gentle little First

217
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,039
Press going

218
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,640
in

219
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,639
and here we

220
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:08,399
go it's got a 9C timer on it I love this

221
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,560
little denil press with the

222
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:16,480
timer I can just just starting to hear

223
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:19,199
it now after about 6 to 7

224
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,720
seconds I like to use my ear because I

225
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,720
can really hear what's going on with the

226
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,800
Press I can hear it squeezing out resin

227
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:31,120
and uh let's give that an opening real

228
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,120
quick all right so

229
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,880
oh yeah nice little squish of buds by

230
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,958
anyone's

231
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,559
standards decent little squish I'm

232
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:47,039
guessing there'll be at least a half a

233
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:48,518
gram there uh out of uh our 2 and 1/2 gr

234
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,719
that we put in so it looks like we

235
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,919
should have about a 20% but of course

236
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,079
I'll gather that all up and uh show you

237
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,919
that on the scale here in a little bit

238
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,199
what I want to do is I want to get to

239
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,679
pressing some hat all right guys so just

240
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:08,160
did a quick weigh in uh to show you what

241
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:09,639
I got the tear on this is uh 0.1 sorry I

242
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,838
guess I can't really turn it at an angle

243
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:15,159
like that and so the total was 04 I'm

244
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,920
not sure if you guys can see that or not

245
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,199
kind of hard without showing you the

246
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:24,759
actual kind of hard without taking the

247
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,759
actual camera not 3 it doesn't weigh

248
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,039
three all right here we go tear

249
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,120
so that's at a04 or

250
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,078
3.4 probably squeeze out another tiny

251
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,078
little bit on there if we really wanted

252
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:46,519
to uh as the screen bag still has a

253
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,519
little bit of stickiness to it as you

254
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,078
can see there still a little bit of

255
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,039
stickiness left there if I want it to

256
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:58,359
clean out but uh a solid uh 18% return

257
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,599
on bud like I said I could easily take

258
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,919
that and give it one one more good

259
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,839
squeeze I'm really used to squeezing

260
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,479
hash so uh enough of this squeezing Bud

261
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,839
let's get to squeezing some of the fun

262
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,879
stuff shall we bubble today now some of

263
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,079
these are quite large this one for

264
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,240
instance would

265
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,679
fit easily 15 to 20 Gams of hash so

266
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
that's a substantial squeeze let's start

267
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:24,799
with our little guy and uh I'm going to

268
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,720
use if I can find

269
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,559
it the business card there it is nice

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,480
little business card right there

271
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,399
and a real simple method for filling

272
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,320
this guy up is to get your card into

273
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
there like that and then you can just

274
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,959
drop your hash in there and it fills it

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,200
up real nice and simple I've got my

276
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,039
scale right here as well so we can put

277
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,240
one of these on it and tear it at the

278
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,039
point4 I believe that they

279
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,480
weigh all

280
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,480
right there we

281
00:11:54,159 --> 00:12:00,639
go okay so that's at point four let's

282
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,800
get some bubble has into this show and

283
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,519
squeeze out some

284
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,278
rosin it's a real nice uh return on this

285
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:13,600
particular stuff I should get at least a

286
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:15,879
50% uh possibly 60 if I really kind

287
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,320
of go for

288
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,519
it all right let's see what this little

289
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,519
guy

290
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,839
weighs all right so that's almost 6

291
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,199
G I guess we could put a little bit more

292
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,399
in there just to make sure that it

293
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:37,198
reaches that 6 G marker I always like

294
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,440
working with an even number if I

295
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:43,039
can and uh you can see that it's uh

296
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,199
filled up pretty nice there I'm of

297
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,639
course going

298
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,958
to press it down a little bit all right

299
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,440
so that is 6.1 G now you can hear the

300
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:55,399
denail working away in the background

301
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,560
clickey click clickity click so yeah I

302
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,120
just kind

303
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:04,319
of you know make this as

304
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,360
self press it into a little sort of

305
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,199
Puck oh that feels

306
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,278
nice all right uh one of the things

307
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,679
people have been talking about is

308
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,919
flipping the bags inside out this is

309
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:18,759
something that you can do simply enough

310
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,919
uh with the edge on the outside here you

311
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,399
get a fair bit of um wicking this is

312
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,278
what people have been saying anyway I

313
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,320
haven't noticed it myself and I've

314
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,879
pressed both ways but hey it's a trick

315
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,480
that if you find your screen is uh too

316
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,919
full of resin uh you can flip it inside

317
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,240
out now if you're like me and that just

318
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,919
sort of becomes a pain in the ass I can

319
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,278
also show you a little trick that if you

320
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,679
do have resin soaked into your screen at

321
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,320
the end what I've done is I've taken

322
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,198
this and I've just wrapped it up in a

323
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,160
bowl with nothing in it and pressed it

324
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,838
for a few seconds inside one of my

325
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,838
sheets here the experimental sheet that

326
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,199
Tony sent me and I find that all of it

327
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,880
comes out to the point where you can

328
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,919
feel the screen is dry it has no

329
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,240
stickiness to it so those are a couple

330
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,198
of tips that you can do you can do the

331
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,320
flip inside out if you if you feel it's

332
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,319
necessary and uh even if you're still

333
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,639
finding that there's some resin on your

334
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,800
final screen after You' flipped it the

335
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,759
right side uh or sorry inside out uh you

336
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,319
can do my little trick which uh I'll

337
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,440
probably show you here at the end but if

338
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,839
not just remember simple rolling it up

339
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,519
into a little piece flattening it down

340
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,800
between your parchment or whatever

341
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,879
you're using oil slick pad experimental

342
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,120
sheet whatever it is squeeze it down on

343
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,159
there and you'll see that that resin

344
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,120
will escape quite quickly so we've got

345
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,559
our little guy here our little six

346
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,240
Grammer I'm just going to fold that guy

347
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:44,239
over real nice slap it into our

348
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,240
experimental

349
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,360
sheet I like to give this a little a

350
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,879
little prepress as we call it that just

351
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,519
gets it sitting nicely in place and

352
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,759
uh let's see what we can do with this

353
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,440
little guy here make sure the plates are

354
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,360
lined

355
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,360
up and away we

356
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,399
go oh she's

357
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,958
coming yep I can see her leaking out

358
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,559
here not sure if you guys can catch that

359
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:26,239
but that is rosin just

360
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,239
dripping dripping

361
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,639
out okay

362
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,039
get that opened up

363
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,680
shoom all right

364
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,919
so as you can see we did a nice little

365
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,838
squeeze there with that little that

366
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,799
little

367
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:47,319
screen nice return on that beautiful

368
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:49,919
golden color and a real nice allaround

369
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:52,519
smoke now we can kind of pull this guy

370
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,838
out from the middle I thought those were

371
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,318
actual uh I thought that was a actual

372
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,600
fiber and it was just oil coming off of

373
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:02,958
the thing so you can see this still has

374
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
a little bit of stick and a little bit

375
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,479
of moisture to it and in fact you can

376
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,839
see on the edges what people are talking

377
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,240
about with those edges picking up that

378
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,040
rosin well I'm not done yet and I'm

379
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,360
going to show you how you can refold

380
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:19,240
this up into a a smaller little piece

381
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,120
we'll get that into

382
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,480
a a quarter the size that it was we're

383
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,560
just going to give that one more squeeze

384
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,839
while we can a self press is always help

385
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,159
helpful to keep it from popping back up

386
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:37,480
out of place

387
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,719
and a secondary press so much easier

388
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,319
than a hair straightener it's not even

389
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,839
funny uh nice and convenient to have

390
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:47,120
these sewn up and uh also to have 10 of

391
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,839
them in each pouch is uh is a real bonus

392
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,639
so let's see what we got coming out here

393
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,000
oh yeah I can hear it I'm usually quite

394
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,120
efficient in my first press I have to

395
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,480
admit I've managed to get quite good at

396
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,480
this

397
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,038
all right Shunk so let me just get this

398
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,279
little guy out of here now this guy is

399
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,759
much drier now although I can see a tiny

400
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,519
little bit of that rosin that I'll just

401
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,519
get off there you go and what a

402
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,119
beautiful color on that once again you

403
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:24,359
can see that's just

404
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,359
yellow all

405
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,080
right so that's basically the small

406
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,160
screen in effect what you can do with

407
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,480
this screen is it's very easy to clean

408
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
if you do find uh personally I don't

409
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,240
need to use alcohol at all I find that

410
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,279
the safest way to clean it is to take

411
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,038
the hash out of it once you've squeezed

412
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:46,038
every last golden drop out and merely

413
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,919
clean the screen by pressing the screen

414
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:50,119
fold it into as small of a little chunk

415
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,440
as you can with nothing in it except the

416
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,399
soaking oil that's been trapped and

417
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,200
squeeze that out and you'll see that uh

418
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,159
you will literally get every last drop

419
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,919
out and you'll have a nice nice clean

420
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,799
dry screen with no stick ready to go

421
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,840
again I would suggest you can use these

422
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,759
dozens of times if not hundreds I

423
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,558
haven't personally used any single

424
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,400
screen a 100 times or more yet so I'm

425
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:15,200
not going to claim that but I will let

426
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,720
you know I've got these ones going now

427
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,600
and there's certainly no stopping me um

428
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,240
I'm going to clean up this rosin off of

429
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,558
here I'll let you guys know what kind of

430
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,200
returns we got it looks at least like a

431
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:31,960
50 uh% return and I will come come back

432
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,200
uh in a few minutes for a dab all right

433
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,120
guys so I added that all up I kept my

434
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,519
two runs separately uh I can show you

435
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,918
real quick uh I ended up with 3 G of the

436
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,319
initial press which is right here and

437
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,320
here's my second press right here and

438
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,599
you know I've often had people tell me

439
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,519
oh you know the first press and the

440
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,199
second press should never be mixed etc

441
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,798
etc I agree in certain cases but in a

442
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,919
case like this you would really have a

443
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:59,839
hard time noticing um the color that

444
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,200
came out the the second time was just as

445
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,199
light as the first I've already dabbed a

446
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,120
little bit of each one uh what I total

447
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,679
what I got total by the way was 3 G of

448
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:11,599
one.5 of another uh when you divide that

449
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,720
or uh you you take that and you figure

450
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:19,199
out your six G starting we had about a

451
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:22,640
58.3% return 60% pretty darn good no

452
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,000
complaints there and uh I've still got

453
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,480
this so I can take this hash you can do

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,200
another type of extract on it I

455
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,599
personally prefer to do the coconut oil

456
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,240
extract which of course you can check

457
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:37,158
out on the coconut uh oil hash

458
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,679
extraction uh video that I did also for

459
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,120
those of you that don't know how I got

460
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,559
this hash I have a whole slew of videos

461
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,639
uh under the playlist water extraction

462
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,918
as well as under the playlist dry sift

463
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,440
both of those will show you two

464
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,600
solventless ways of producing an

465
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,038
incredible product that if you happen to

466
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:55,519
have any that isn't so great it's a

467
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,640
little bit lower than your best quality

468
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,720
this rosin process is an absolute dream

469
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,080
for such things so I figured we'd do one

470
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,679
more press like maybe a nice big press

471
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,038
out of this particular bag though it's

472
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,200
going to be quite a bit bigger than the

473
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:13,038
last one we had I'd say you could

474
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,038
fit one and 1 half to two times the

475
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,519
amount that you would press so let's say

476
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,798
we do 12 G this time and see if we can

477
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,519
still get 80 to 90% of our initial yield

478
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,879
in a one squeeze while uh you know

479
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,200
getting that last little bit out of the

480
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,400
second squeeze so I'm going to grab more

481
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,038
bubs first I'm going to tear this to see

482
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,600
exactly what we're dealing with 1

483
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,759
G all right

484
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:40,119
so always happy to uh have such a nice

485
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,759
product to be able to share uh this

486
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:44,158
process with you guys obviously when

487
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,679
you're using something that's so so

488
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,559
which I've had happen I've had many

489
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,840
people ask me to show me the process

490
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,839
with their product and it just ends up

491
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,959
being a real bummer please people

492
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,558
understand that the better the product

493
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,360
you start with the better product that

494
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,359
you will end up with this is uh this is

495
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:03,038
very important all right that's 10 G not

496
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:08,918
too bad two more G in she goes let's see

497
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:11,158
if that's accurate 11.6 just4 G left to

498
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,360
get that up to 12 like I said I really

499
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,919
like having the accurate numbers it's

500
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,918
definitely something to be said 12

501
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,600
exactly and you can see this OG Lindsay

502
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,759
is getting a little bit lower but uh

503
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:27,000
still plenty of Ros and to squeeze out

504
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,119
of that bad bad girl right there all

505
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,880
right so

506
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,038
we've got our 12 G bag this thing is

507
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,080
going to squeeze like you wouldn't

508
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,319
believe want to make it too fat but fat

509
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,119
enough that it's going to really press

510
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,918
that resin uh out of those uh little

511
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,839
shells those little wax cuticle

512
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:51,400
membranes that can that basically hold

513
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:55,079
all of this wonderful profile canono

514
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,880
tpin terpenoids cesa terpenoids the

515
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,879
whole nine yards it all has its place

516
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,880
and and uh let's get this show on the

517
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,360
road I think I'm going to do a double

518
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,960
this time

519
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,119
around give it one like this and one

520
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,400
like

521
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,359
that a double meaning I'm not going to

522
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:18,240
fold the sheets that way I can just do

523
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:21,798
my initial squeeze right like this and

524
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,079
uh still have good success so let's see

525
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,960
if we can't get that in

526
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,960
there all right here we go for 12 G

527
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
press

528
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,200
probably going to see it coming out the

529
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,200
side here so I'll hold it up for

530
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:46,278
you lot of hash it's taking a bit of a

531
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,600
time before it's actually accessing and

532
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:50,519
boiling the majority of those oils out

533
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,798
and you can see them coming out

534
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,038
now here they

535
00:22:52,798 --> 00:23:00,158
come you see that

536
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:01,240
drip there we go rosin drip down for us

537
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,360
that's a

538
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,558
girl that's a

539
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,839
girl beautiful all right let's get that

540
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:13,038
lifted

541
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:16,240
up this is going to be a huge return

542
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,679
absolutely wonderful you get these rosin

543
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,480
bags out of the way it's always nice to

544
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,640
have a nice clean place to work I can

545
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,798
actually see the rosin dripping back

546
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,799
down as I lifted that

547
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,600
up all right all right so there's one

548
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,919
size of our side of our

549
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:38,439
sheet probably a solid four four plus

550
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,000
Gams just sitting there uh we're going

551
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,960
to still obviously press this out again

552
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,599
for a second which you know

553
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,600
what why don't we do that right

554
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:55,839
away fold that up you got to be so

555
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,120
careful as to not you know make any

556
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:02,399
unnecessary mistakes so let me see if I

557
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,399
can get this back on

558
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,519
nicely okay try to keep these two

559
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,278
somewhat apart from one another not

560
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:18,119
necessarily guess it's not the end of

561
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,119
the world if they touch get that back in

562
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:24,000
there give that one more nice little

563
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,798
squeeze I love working with this

564
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,798
material it's real nice to work

565
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,798
with

566
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,919
all

567
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,480
right can hear it squeezing out

568
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,080
beautiful you always want to pay

569
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,839
attention cuz once you start seeing that

570
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,759
rosin come out you really want to be on

571
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,659
the ball otherwise it can really make a

572
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,440
bloody

573
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,600
[Music]

574
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,960
mess all

575
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,959
right oh

576
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,440
yeah

577
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,599
booya so there's another squeeze right

578
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,038
there on the top and you can see it over

579
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:06,599
here as well let me get that little guy

580
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:10,440
out of the way you can see it right

581
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:12,158
there so I am going to go take some

582
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,480
macro photographs of this cuz I see some

583
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,278
real interesting stuff happening here

584
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,839
and I will be back here in a bit I have

585
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,079
found that it's not really the most

586
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:24,519
enjoyable thing to watch people cleaning

587
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,879
these uh off and uh so I just don't have

588
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,278
to do that on camera but I will be back

589
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,360
very soon to show show you some

590
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:32,200
beautiful uh piles I'll let you know

591
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,119
what we got in our first squeeze here

592
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,038
and what we got in our second and

593
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,918
whether or not we're going to have to do

594
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,679
a third squeeze so we'll catch you back

595
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,840
in a little bit hey guys so I'm back I

596
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,200
have squeezed out the last two batches

597
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:49,678
I've only squeezed twice so far I got

598
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,919
about a 57 to 58% return as well I got

599
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,360
almost 6 G right off the first squeeze

600
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,440
and then I got about 1.4 g off my second

601
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:01,798
squeeze for a total of

602
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,360
seven uh about 7.2

603
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:08,319
7.3 still kicking around that 50 to 60%

604
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:10,119
range which uh basically when you find a

605
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,678
material that you know how much return

606
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,239
you're getting it's going to be very

607
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,679
important for you to pay attention to

608
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,159
those numbers because it'll let you know

609
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:22,919
your efficiency so I'm sure I could

610
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,919
probably squeeze these two maybe one

611
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,278
more time I could potentially get them

612
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:30,679
both folded up and squeeze out another

613
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:32,519
batch now if you do such a thing keep

614
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,278
that separate because guaranteed by the

615
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,759
time you do a third press the amount of

616
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:38,839
heat and the amount of Taffy like sap

617
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:41,278
that's going to come out of there it's

618
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,639
just not going to be worth putting in

619
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,240
with your you know really beautiful

620
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,960
stable rosin that uh I mean this stuff's

621
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,079
going to be absolute fire I can tell you

622
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,960
right now I think I might have shown you

623
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,759
already but I will show you again just

624
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,679
in case I forgot here is that same

625
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,919
material uh after oh a couple of couple

626
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,320
of months maybe maybe a month I can't

627
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,120
even remember now but there's that

628
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,119
quality that we've got that's what we're

629
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:10,398
looking for right there really nice

630
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:13,398
transparent beautiful looking

631
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:13,398
bubble

632
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:19,240
and nice and easy with the bubble uh

633
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,839
with the rosin bags uh keep calling them

634
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,880
Bubble Bags mainly because our first

635
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,319
time they've come with a little label

636
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,720
that says Bubble Bags that's going to

637
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,200
change you will see that say Rosen bag

638
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,240
sooner than later and I guess really all

639
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,399
there is left to do is to squeeze out

640
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,880
one of the big guys this is going to

641
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:39,759
require a bigger press um I'm not really

642
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,039
comfortable squeezing it out on this uh

643
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,919
particular smaller press so we're going

644
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,398
to have to do that on a bigger one I

645
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,840
think what I'll do is I'll do a whole

646
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:50,199
show just for these guys right here and

647
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,918
in that show I'll show you both herb and

648
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,519
hash but for today I think we're pretty

649
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:59,399
successful we've made a solid 10 G of

650
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,519
azin uh in a very short period of time

651
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,319
as you saw it was actually quite easy

652
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,038
for me to even collect much easier than

653
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,639
it has been in the past off of this

654
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,079
particular type of sheet and like I said

655
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,038
we're not going to be throwing this away

656
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,839
you can still use it to squeeze out a

657
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,879
little bit more rosin or if you want

658
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,759
your coconut oil to have a nice potency

659
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,760
to it leave that th that third squeeze

660
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,079
uh in there and just run that material

661
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,480
through the coconut oil it really

662
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,960
depends on where your efficiency lies if

663
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,360
you can squeeze the rosin out of there

664
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,880
and get every last drop well then

665
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,639
obviously that's a great idea because

666
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,080
you can take that rosin and put it into

667
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,519
your coconut oil now if you're not as

668
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,119
efficient as you think you might be uh

669
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,640
then the coconut oil will do a really

670
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,000
good job on getting in there and

671
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,519
squeezing out every last little bit of

672
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,640
uh phyto canabo that are left in there

673
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,278
particularly if you do the crock pot and

674
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,240
the water and really kind of boil it

675
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,159
down slowly the water of course

676
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,679
preserving the canabo and the Turpin I

677
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,120
think really we should finish this off

678
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,360
so you can see I have my denail here

679
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,599
pluged PL in to uh the dabinator

680
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,319
actually at

681
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:07,639
105° and what I'm doing is I'm using it

682
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,798
to clean my halo Bowl each and every hit

683
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,519
that I take and you can see if I just do

684
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:12,839
a quick little unplug cuz I'm going to

685
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,720
be plugging it into the other whip

686
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,599
anyway you can see the quality of

687
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,519
cleanliness that uh comes to be on the

688
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,278
Halo when you uh when you get it right

689
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,960
so that's how you want your Halo looking

690
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:26,000
each and every time you take a hit and I

691
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,720
suggest that if you have one and you

692
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,640
have a couple of dnails this is a great

693
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,640
little system uh one turned up to 1,000

694
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,519
one turned up to whatever your

695
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,038
temperature of uh dabbing at I've got

696
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,839
mine I think it's 630 right now I was

697
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,640
hitting at 550 for a while and I felt

698
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:42,798
that it was pooling a little bit I was

699
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,840
getting very nice tasty rips but I felt

700
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,359
like I needed to bump it up a little bit

701
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:51,798
more so why don't we take a couple of

702
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:53,278
dabs here of our freshly made Rosen I

703
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:55,639
think I'm going to hit this six gram

704
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,119
batch right here this stuff is

705
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,320
absolutely just phenomenal

706
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:03,000
uh we're only down to 810 de so maybe

707
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,359
we'll talk a little bit about you know

708
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,880
really what this whole rosin thing means

709
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,558
because for the longest time I've been

710
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,480
teaching people how to make bubble hash

711
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,678
but many people were convinced that they

712
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,919
it was just too far away they need uh

713
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,679
from their reality they needed to get

714
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,320
Bud that they didn't have access to in

715
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,278
large amounts they needed to get the

716
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,599
bags they needed to they didn't really

717
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,960
understand the whole process of water

718
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,678
and ice and I've I've been showing this

719
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,360
for people to people for a long time and

720
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,080
basically what has happened now with

721
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,879
rosin is it's so accessible you don't

722
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,839
need any bags you don't need you know a

723
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,559
little bit of a screen some parchment

724
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:38,599
and a hair straightener and you're in

725
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,000
the game and some people are even doing

726
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:43,519
it without any uh uh screen at all so

727
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,038
this is a very easy game to get into

728
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,759
however I think that you'll notice that

729
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:49,480
as you do get into it you'll realize

730
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,960
that Rosen isn't really necessarily the

731
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,399
be all end all as much as it's a really

732
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,679
amazing

733
00:30:54,398 --> 00:31:00,278
decontaminator for resins and but bud

734
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,519
you know for for accessing dabs from bud

735
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:05,200
in an instant it just can't be beat it

736
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,440
is an unbelievable process uh to for

737
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,360
taking hash that was otherwise a non-

738
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,639
melty grade non dabbable a 45 a 25 a 160

739
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:17,599
a one sometimes 120 sometimes people's

740
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:20,519
90 and 73 are low quality this gives

741
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,719
them another chance to recreate a

742
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,798
product that is actually going to be

743
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,440
increased in quality which is something

744
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:30,158
that you know we can unveil the quality

745
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,840
uh with bubble bags and dry sifting but

746
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,639
this rosin technique is a whole

747
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,918
different ball game of like creating a

748
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,599
quality unveiling to a Next Level

749
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,399
removing that fibrous mat and that uh

750
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,359
cuticle that wax membrane that holds

751
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:46,759
those phyto canabo in place removing

752
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:49,000
that is definitely decontaminating it

753
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,599
further although however I will say that

754
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,798
science will probably figure out in the

755
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,678
near future there's something going on

756
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,319
in that fibrous mat that is where of

757
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,720
course cannabinoids and Turpin are

758
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,918
produced and I think that it's that that

759
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,480
is missing from rosin that you get in

760
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,600
your full melt dry sift and your full

761
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,079
melt bubble has hits that to me gives

762
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,599
the advantage to both full melt dry sift

763
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,038
and full melt bubble has those are my

764
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,719
two favorite rosin is a nice third for

765
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:15,960
the quiver and a great way to clean

766
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,839
things up and I'm definitely uh I'm

767
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,639
stoked on it there's no doubt about it

768
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,918
I've been stoked on my denail press I've

769
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,719
heard all sorts of different things

770
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:24,600
people have been saying about them but

771
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,679
uh mine's just been nothing but a

772
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:30,678
pleasure to work with and uh I think

773
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:33,080
it's time hit the Halo Sapphire rosin

774
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,080
let's do

775
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,278
it beautiful that was a little bit

776
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:55,480
warmer I felt

777
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:58,960
that I haven't said at 7:35 but it seems

778
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,798
like it's at about 6 or 635 I should say

779
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
it seemed like it went up quite a bit

780
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,000
when I started sucking there I guess I

781
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,440
was really cool in the nail

782
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,720
down possibly because I'm hitting with a

783
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,600
a a cold carb cap now I've talked about

784
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,558
this as

785
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,879
well we take so much attention of

786
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,960
getting our product to be as tasty as

787
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,120
possible try this as an experiment leave

788
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,200
your carb cap on the nail just for long

789
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,239
enough that the bottom part gets warm

790
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,080
but the top part is still you know easy

791
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,798
to hold without burning yourself and

792
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,240
take a dab like that you will notice

793
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,960
that the temperature of your nail is

794
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,399
unaltered and does not go down compared

795
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,319
to if you use a cold carb cap

796
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,518
particularly a titanium one it holds

797
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,439
cold uh more uh so than the ceramic you

798
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,558
even cool it down more and I've noticed

799
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,679
it mostly in the sapphire I've never

800
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,558
noticed it in another nail before but

801
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,559
the sapphire is so sensitive and so

802
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,839
detail attentive uh it's a preserver of

803
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,839
tpin you really have to be careful with

804
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,839
it and what I've noticed is a little bit

805
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,678
of a warmer carb cap gives me that more

806
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,519
full flavor that taste was definitely

807
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,798
nice but it was just a little bit

808
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,440
lacking due to the cold carb cap uh

809
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:11,519
we'll finish it off with one more rip

810
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,720
I'm going to take a rip of the second

811
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,480
batch uh from the same press just to see

812
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:18,559
if I can notice any differences in

813
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,440
tastes the texture on this particular

814
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:24,239
second does seem a little bit more sappy

815
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,720
uh than solid and I think you can even

816
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,678
kind of notice that from uh from looking

817
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,358
at the big one is a lot more stable and

818
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,440
the small one is it's a little bit a

819
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:34,759
little bit more sappy so we'll have a

820
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,639
little rip and we'll see how that goes

821
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,839
let's do a little Q-tip Tech real quick

822
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,320
I'm sure you guys are familiar with the

823
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:46,799
Q-tip Tech a nice little couple of rims

824
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,800
around there and cleans out the majority

825
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,560
of that carbon uh leftover and uh allows

826
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,919
me to take another rip without having to

827
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:55,878
heat the nail up to 1,000° uh which I'm

828
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,878
going to do right after this

829
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:58,878
rip

830
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,440
so I will say this about

831
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,240
that I definitely notice a difference in

832
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,760
The Taste now for me I prefer the stable

833
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,519
version uh it was more preserved in the

834
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,800
turine flavor the second batch just

835
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:31,239
feels like it was exposed to literally

836
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,000
twice the heat that the initial batch

837
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:35,598
was uh exposed to and I really noticed

838
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,880
it in the sense that this material is

839
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:42,960
very dry but when I get a really TP Rich

840
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,599
rosin it will Sizzle almost like the wet

841
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,880
Frozen Frozen Frozen whatever John was

842
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,079
calling that um it almost sizzled like

843
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,640
that but differently it didn't pop and

844
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:55,880
crackle but it would literally foam and

845
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,039
like you can maybe hear it when I took

846
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,640
my first hit it was just almost

847
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,880
explosive but really just violently

848
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,078
bubbling and I believe that that's

849
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,318
definitely the Tarpin present in there

850
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,440
doing that without a shadow of a doubt

851
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:11,800
let me put that back on full screen for

852
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,480
you cuz that's just

853
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,920
nice nice to have that in the background

854
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,000
there we go nice little dab of Ros in

855
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,760

documentaries and other little things

878
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,039

my time to the point where I don't have
