see some different weeks going on it's a

44
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,840
lot of California

45
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,239
genetics um we're kind of in a

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,800
transitional phase I'm sure everyone

47
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,200
else is in a way kind of post injunction

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,439
we had uh kind of these buildings were

49
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,439
largely empty

50
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,239
the buildings were largely empty and

51
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,639

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,920
what stands out to me is the weird kind

56
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:22,280
of state F we've got going on yeah um we

57
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,559
ran trellises for years and like that

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,080

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,598
2 by twos and TR everything trellis and

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,200
we went away with that we were kind of

61
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:31,798
thought it was making a bit of a can

62
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:35,039
that we didn't really want we wanted

63

265
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,879

00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,919
certain strains are more susceptible to

272
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,559
things these ones [ __ ] killed us to

273

took a picture of it you'd see it under

362
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,000
a micro lens it looks like little ant

363
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,839
bodies that are connected one little

364
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,200
section to another little section and

365
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,639
they grow in Long strings and these got

366
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,080
affected because we had a cush on this

367
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,799
side that we took down the week before

368
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,158

369
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:29,679
spreading it around oh yeah sanan never

370
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:33,440
used to Happ see we're running uh

373
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,440
these are demo units we're trying to not

374
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,960
in just this one unit to see how to do

375
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,880
it's suppos to between the air but what

376
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,000
what's inside there is there I couldn't

377
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,480
tell you okay you don't know if it's

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,319
using water or if it's using carbon it's

379
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,120
carbon I believe it's a carbon yeah you

380
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:00,000
know the old school guys from the ' 70s

381
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:02,000
and the 80s they were using 55g barrels

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,839
and the whole room before it blew out

383
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,038
exhaust it would go through a 55g barrel

384
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:09,359
drum of water like right to the bottom

385
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,679
like a bong and then it would bubble out

386
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,798
and then he had a top on it that blew it

387
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,960
out no smell like a humidif the water

00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,918
strings he's tried this is the one

656
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:32,759
specifically that is really helpful so

657
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:34,679
not only is he eliminating harsh um uh

658
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,079
pharmaceutical medication that plays

659
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,278
with the chemistry of his brain um but

660
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,359
he's also if anyone has any idea what

661
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,319
cluster headaches are uh take the worst

662
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,599
headache you've ever had and multiply it

663
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:48,759
by like a thousand I used to have severe

664
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,599
migraine headaches with with and I'm in

665
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,960
the same boat migraines I've never had

666
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:55,599
clusters Phil turns white when he gets

667
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,240
his clusters and he just disappears like

668
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,719
this we're going to we want we want to

669
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,200
take this back to uh to BC and we're

670
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,600
going to go and see Phil yeah dude and

671
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200

672
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,359

673
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,319
awesome we're going to do a little

674
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:11,759
continuation on this show and we'll see

675
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,519
if uh maybe uh maybe how this works for

676
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,240
your cluster headaches and we'd love to

677
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,919
see if we could get the Sweat Band out

678
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,319
to these guys to uh pass that on to some

679
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,159
more people out here that are suffering

680
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,798
from cluster uh headaches because

681
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,399
laboratory that can test and do a

682
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,079
comparison you know what true genetics

683
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,479
Phil's company would love that AB

684
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,480
oid test we're looking at all the

685
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,519
different ecies and and this is the one

686
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,240
reason that we're looking at Future

687
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,319
licensed producers and stuff like that

688
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,720
because of the the research that can

689
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,240
actually go behind and what they're

690
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,360
looking at and what actually can be able

691
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,880
to obtain to help patients worldwide so

692
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,519
you know what what I really like about

693
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,480
that is being able to have those tests

694
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,519
done now bringing that to Phil cuz we

695
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,558
know Phil how how you suffer and stuff

696
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,558

00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:11,480
was arrested in a large sting in Quebec

781
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,279
that involved 80 cops and hydroponics

782
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,039
owners and Seed Sellers and Growers and

783
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,160
green houses and houses yeah yeah it's

784
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:23,279
really really deep just full [ __ ]

785
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,039
like full on just just figure you know

786
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,240
they prosecute somebody for four packs

787
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:30,358
of seeds I mean come on four packs of SE

788
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,118
meim emry sold a million of packs of

789
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,199
seeds and he never got charged by the

790
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,880
Canadian government no the most he got

791
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:40,399
was a fine yeah from from us from us

792
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,358
from us from us usually here in Canada

793
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,200
we know how to which reminds me you know

794
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,759
seeds Mark's going to be back in about a

795
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,118
month Mark Emery will be out of yazu

796
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,280
City he will no longer be in Mississippi

797
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,160
as a resident of the US but indeed I

798
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,040
think the US consuming Mark Emory for

799
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,920
those 5 years truly did exactly what

800
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:01,639
Adam Bowen wrote about his song uh

801
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,760
puffing on the Tricom which was Uncle

802
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:07,598
Sam has ingested marijuana in the form

803
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,560
of Mark emie and I think he's going to

804
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,880
start seeing things a little bit

805
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:14,239
differently Mark went into prison and

806
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,280
within 6 months the prosecuting attorney

807
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,759
who prosecuted Mark started to work on

808
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,400
legal cannabis in Washington and with

809
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,319
Jody's help like think about that that

810
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,358
was the guy that prosecuted him and put

811
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:28,358
him in prison he's the same guy that

812
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:31,279
worked on getting cannabis allowed in

813
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:33,078
Washington state so Mark had an effect

814
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,160
just by going into their prison and

815
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,519
being consumed by them he's learned to

816
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,440
