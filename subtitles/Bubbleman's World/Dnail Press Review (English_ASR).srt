[Music]

2
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,919
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,920
and uh today I'm pretty excited to be

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,679
bringing to you a little bit of a review

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,359
on the brand new enail press Rosen press

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,759
so uh they basically this is their beta

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,159
test their first uh batch out the door I

8
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,679
think they made only 100 units uh they

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,000
took an already existing t-shirt press

10
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:50,280
which you might very well recognize uh

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,840
the plates are 5x5 so 5 in x 5 in and uh

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,640
it's a really really well-made little

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,840
unit I mean you could pick these t-shir

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,480
presses up I think for pretty much $300

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,120
or

16
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,358
$400 uh and that is exactly the price

17
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:06,438
Dil is selling it for as well

18
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,280
$350 on a pre-order at dna.com there's

19
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,478
probably only about 40 left so I jump on

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,118
those quick and you can see unlike a

21
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,079
regular t-shirt press which would just

22
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,239
have the one heat press that heats up

23
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,798
one plate the other plate stays

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,199
cool what we know from rosin and guys

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,200
like soil grown who really forwarded and

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,240
started this uh excitement up on

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,600
Instagram with uh when he first squished

28
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,158
a bud uh we know that both plates being

29
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,438
hot are pretty essential for for the

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,880
process to work so denil added a second

31
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:38,158
controller uh these are denil uh units

32
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,839
inside and basically it's just like a

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,280
dil you turn that thing on you turn that

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,200
thing on I have it set on Celsius so um

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,239
I'm looking to press around 200 212° fah

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,399
today not the highest temperature not

37
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,039
the lowest but somewhere in the middle I

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,159
know that I can go around 15 to 180 and

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,039
still you know potentially preserve more

40
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,039
Tarpin I know that I can go a little

41
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,320
warmer uh upwards of 250° and really

42
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,640
make sure I get every last drop I'm kind

43
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,639
of coming at you guys from the middle uh

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,199
when you get your own press by all means

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,479
play with every temperature and every

46
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,639
pressure um right off the bat one of the

47
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,039
things I'll tell you when you get this

48
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,199
unit is there's a big knob on the back

49
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,439
uh this knob when loosened allows this

50
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,719
to move on the wheel and it also lifts

51
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,000
and separates uh the plates higher apart

52
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,039
from one another

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
so uh when you first get it they're

54
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,639
going to have it set so when you've got

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,199
this all the way closed and you put this

56
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,799
all the way down uh it's that's it it

57
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,399
doesn't go any further there's still a

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,680
bunch of press here I'd have to turn the

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,439
unit because it's quite a bit of

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,120
pressure on these Springs that I've that

61
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,400
I've put on there uh and anyway uh what

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,120
you have to do is you have to undo the

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,080
one the top one from its little unit

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,680
right here which is a super simple

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
twist and then unplug it's four pins uh

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,239
I'll leave it plugged in for now cuz

67
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,280
it's heating up but what you do is once

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,158
you unplug that is you can actually spin

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,400
this top lever uh this top plate and

70
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:11,199
bring it down lower to create more

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,400
pressure in your um in your clothes so

72
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,399
I'm going to get this thing into

73
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,000
position just so it can actually show

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,920
you uh the pressure that it takes to

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,158
close this particular

76
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:28,679
one so not a ton of pressure I'd say

77
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:30,919
that's uh nowhere near the 1,500 uh PBS

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,560
per pressure that it's appar able to

79
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,039
take but um I'm sure it's some hundreds

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,199
if not close to you know 8 to 900 lb of

81
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,158
pressure uh once again I could spin that

82
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,280
plate even more and make it even harder

83
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,318
but be careful when you close these four

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,120
Springs down and it really

85
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:50,238
grabs the unit can jump a little bit or

86
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,360
when you go to lift it up it can really

87
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
pop up with some serious pressure so you

88
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,159
know stay within your safety zone

89
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,839
especially if you're a patient you don't

90
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:59,878
need to be hurting yourself be extremely

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,200
careful of these plates as they start to

92
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,318
heat up um the whole thing is going to

93
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,479
get hot even up here will get hot

94
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,719
eventually so uh that's why they've got

95
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,039
the big caution hot surface sticker do

96
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,799
not touch these uh with your the plates

97
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,519
with your fingers you know try to keep

98
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,199
your hands away even from the outside of

99
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,439
the top plate uh I'm talking about after

100
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,639
having it on for for quite some time as

101
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,639
I like to to leave mine on so we are up

102
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,160
to

103
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,280
100 let's see what we got yeah I got

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,960
100° set on the temperature so uh

105
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,879
they've both gone up to about 110

106
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,159
115 and I'll just wait a few minutes to

107
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,680
for that to drop as that is a little bit

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,280
warmer of a temperature than I want to

109
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,439
rock right now um it's because I had

110
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,638
them closed for a while there and I

111
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,079
guess we'll discuss what we're going to

112
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,199
be pressing today um I'll never go back

113
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,120
to the hair straightener I'll tell you

114
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,160
that much right now that thing is a done

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,600
deal it was great for getting us through

116
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,759
the door uh but the Press even if they

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,520
made a smaller version like a little

118
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,960
tiny version which I think Dil is coming

119
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,719
out with uh that'll blow away uh any

120
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,399
hair straightener as well it's really

121
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,720
nice to be able to close it I also like

122
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,839
to use my ear and get close to it as I'm

123
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,120
closing it uh you know for the 5 to 10

124
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,038
seconds and part of me wants to let it

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
sit longer the way Jeff Church the

126
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,159
Cannabis Reverend I always noticed he

127
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,639
would leave it that eight plus seconds

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,120
whereas other people would pop it open

129
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,800
at 5: it's all going to be a personal

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,680
issue of whether uh where people much

131
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,240
like a nail heating up a nail and having

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,840
people tell you that it's too hot even

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,240
if you're enjoying it or telling you

134
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,519
that it's not hot enough because they

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,840
don't enjoy it uh the pressing will be

136
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:44,318
no different um if you overpress you

137
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,279
will overheat up the material um so far

138
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,199
from the bud rosin that I've done it's

139
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,599
come out very very light even when I've

140
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,840
let it left it for 10 plus seconds now I

141
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,960
am going at a lower uh temperature 100°

142
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,198
uh Celsius which is only

143
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,038
212 but um you know the the nug really

144
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,560
squeez squees out beautifully the hash

145
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,159
squeezes out even nicer so I suggest let

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
we look at some rosin real quick while

147
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,439
we're talking about Ros and I I made

148
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,160
these just yesterday um I made this

149
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,680
first one which is very much like a

150
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,840
shatter uh it's very glossy uh it's not

151
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,319
Snappy in the sense that it just breaks

152
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,279
so if I tapped it with my finger it

153
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
would absolutely just shatter and break

154
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,679
and I can I can break a piece off like

155
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,000
that and it's just extremely stable even

156
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,800
when I broke it off it made this

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
beautiful little snapping sound so this

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,800
rosin I made from this bubble and this

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,519
bubble is about a fourstar bubble melts

160
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,280
pretty good definitely doesn't disappear

161
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:45,279
to nothing um smells and tastes great

162
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,478
smokes great um and no surprise there

163
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,559
that It produced a really beautiful

164
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:52,478
quality

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,759
rosin um then I took some of this three

166
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,839
star bubble that I have now this bubble

167
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,960
is was a gift it's it was grown nice it

168
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,839
was I believe an outdoor crop of a

169
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,159
variety of breeder Steve strains and

170
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,000
it's nice it's just not what you would

171
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,039
call a a four five or even a six-star

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,439
it's really just a three star because of

173
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,360
its melt Factor now it has a great taste

174
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,000
it's very aromatic when I open it but

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,280
people aren't excited because it's not

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,720
really a dabbable product um I pressed

177
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:26,038
out some of that

178
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,039
yesterday and we got an absolutely

179
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,000
beautiful product here um and I'll show

180
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,478
that up close up on the camera later as

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,279
well and that came from this stuff right

182
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,680
here so you can really see now this

183
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,839
isn't just putting lipstick on a pig and

184
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,680
and prettying it up what we're doing is

185
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,679
we're extracting the oils that are

186
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,079
present in these thick wax

187
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,680
membranes uh and we're we're extracting

188
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,639
and and pressing those oils out and what

189
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,280
it what it's doing really is is it's

190
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,319
unveiling much like bubble bags unveiled

191
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,878
quality when it decontaminated resin

192
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,039
Heads This is now unveiling quality

193
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,560
that's hidden

194
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,759
amongst a shitty grown triome head or a

195
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,000
wax membrane that was too thick or

196
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,479
something that affected it that the

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,279
resin itself there's still a quality in

198
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,758
there once you decontaminate it further

199
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,878
and this is really proof of that because

200
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,280
I'll tell you anyone that smokes this

201
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,919
and then smokes this I mean it's easily

202
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,799
a three to seven star uh jump and then

203
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,198
just I was playing around and I pressed

204
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,079
uh I pressed some for a friend yesterday

205
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,120
as well so this is just another little

206
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,519
another little little pile of

207
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,759
that beautiful

208
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,158
stuff get that there so I can turn it

209
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,319
around and show you get a little piece

210
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:44,000
of the parchment on there and that's uh

211
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,440
that's the same stuff just really golden

212
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,679
and uh aromatic it's got the the the hit

213
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,600
of those breeder Steve strains I believe

214
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,639
there's Sweet Tooth in there there might

215
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,839
be

216
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,639
Blockhead maybe a little grapefruit

217
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,720
really a nice uh combination of the of

218
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,879
the smells there and of course the rosin

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,160
just uh made it absolute

220
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,759
fire so we'll put those there at the

221
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,078
front on display and then I say why

222
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,600
don't we press up a little some

223
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,359
something why don't we start with a

224
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,720
bud um really easy process here uh I've

225
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,560
been using these raws that Horatio

226
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
Delbert left for me which I got to say

227
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,439
dude like thank you so much I didn't

228
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,838
even realize how essential and awesome

229
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,560
that would be so breaking off a small

230
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,920
square of the uh parchment paper you can

231
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:32,399
also use oil slick if you like like now

232
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,278
people are going to have issues with

233
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,919
both of them you know I'm using this

234
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,480
unbleached you know the best possible

235
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,958
stuff that I could personally find but

236
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,240
who's to tell me that in a year

237
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,719
someone's not going to find out that

238
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,799
something went into making this that

239
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
isn't ideal to be heated up and

240
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,159
transferred to the resin so I urge you

241
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
all to constantly think about these

242
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,719
things don't use just any old material

243
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,879
and when we get to the pressing screens

244
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,839
that we're going to talk to about well

245
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,559
when filtering the hash I really want to

246
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,160
make sure you guys don't cut corners on

247
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,838
these particular things get the best

248
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:06,719
parchment you can unbleached is is ideal

249
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,120
H and uh as well get the heat pressure

250
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,278
uh Heat stamp authenticated uh pressing

251
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,039
screens so you want something that goes

252
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,759
at least to a

253
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,399
300° and then I would want to say a good

254
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:24,399
100° under that so um you know the oil

255
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,399
slick pad I believe goes to 500° but uh

256
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,000
you know you'd have to contact them to

257
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,480
make sure of that so I snapped off a

258
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,278
little Square I bent it in half I've got

259
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,240
a tiny little nugget that was left over

260
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:41,078
from Glenn at the my uh sorry your

261
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,000
medical cannabis uh dispensary in

262
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:45,278
Winnipeg Manitoba I urge you guys to go

263
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,519
check out their Facebook page and give

264
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,838
them any support that you can they're

265
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,399
having a lot of problems with the city

266
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,600
of Winnipeg they're having a lot of

267
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,039
problems with the Winnipeg Police um

268
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,480
they need support they need help and

269
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,319
obviously the people in Winnipeg are no

270
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,560
more or no less Des deserving to have

271
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
access to good clean medicine at a good

272
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,159
price than the people of British

273
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,879
Columbia and we have over a hundred of

274
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,360
these and our City's ready to regulate

275
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:13,039
them so we've got this down to a little

276
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,759
over 100° I'm just going to put this on

277
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,000
there nice and gently and then we're

278
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:26,958
going to do a

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:30,958
squeeze and to use my ear four five 6 7

280
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,958
8 9

281
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,838
10 pop that open after

282
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,800
10 looks like it's squeezed out a

283
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,600
different a decent amount of

284
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,879
resin not a huge

285
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,759
amount but definitely a small amount

286
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,720
I'll come show you guys there in the

287
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,720
camera you can kind of see the

288
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,519
derbs and now that'll probably just

289
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,480
squeeze out to a dab but there very well

290
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,959
may be um a rip left in that butt as

291
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,680
well uh it was a little bit bigger than

292
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,319
what I normally do and it seems like

293
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,879
there might be still a little bit on the

294
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
ends so I could give it another press

295
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,639
but uh why don't we collect what was

296
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,198
there I just used uh a Dabber got this

297
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,120
beautiful little wooden Dabber from the

298
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:20,120
good Folks at Dil uh clean out the tiny

299
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,240
little bits and pieces of the herb that

300
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,000
you

301
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,519
see takes not too long and then uh

302
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
gently scrape it up yeah it's this is

303
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,198
already shatter it's already flipping

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,958
and flicking and got to be careful with

305
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:37,799
collecting of this stuff uh I have found

306
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,399
that it's almost easier to rub the stuff

307
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,919
off the parchment Jeff Church style

308
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,958
that's one of his sort of techniques

309
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,240
that he showed me originally and I

310
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,759
didn't always use it I was more of a a t

311
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,320
like tap and and lift but for certain

312
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:54,919
resins I find that the technique that he

313
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,839
was using was definitely on point for

314
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,879
efficiency uh and just overall ease to

315
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,720
do so yeah this is really nice this

316
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,120
stuff is like really beautiful colored I

317
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,320
think that it's probably going to be a

318
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,720
good idea for us to get a picture so I'm

319
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
not going to pick it all up off the

320
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,360
parchment right now I've got some on the

321
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:19,920
Dabber here area to to work with and by

322
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,919
hand it's just it becomes even more uh

323
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,799
difficult oh yeah this is really nice

324
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,839
once it's been collected you can see

325
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:34,039
that it's a pretty much a clear

326
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,040
white substance that we squeezed off the

327
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,120
bud very

328
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,759
nice very nice indeed oh we'll take one

329
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,839
more shot and then we'll take the dab

330
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,838
and then we'll get back to more

331
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,359
pressing more pressing that's what we

332
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:59,559
need to do

333
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,360
oops woo caught it that's what I'm

334
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:05,000
talking about ninja skills fresh dab of

335
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,839
what I believe was called Grape God out

336
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,839
of the sick

337
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,639
nail so one of the things I found about

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,559
the unit to be extremely uh convenient

339
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,079
uh having it here just in the last

340
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,559
couple of days is that I can find

341
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,120
nuggets of things that I've grown or

342
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,719
gifts that I've been given that I don't

343
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,759
really I'm not that often into

344
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,199
vaporizing I seem to be really much more

345
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,959
into dabbing these days and so to be

346
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,639
able to just take a flavor and press it

347
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,399
through this machine for 8 to 10 seconds

348
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,320
and be able to squeeze out uh a dab or

349
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,480
two dabs I've had some of the congales

350
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,920
squeeze out almost three dabs for one

351
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,959
small Bud uh and I did bring a few other

352
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,399
buds I thought we could go through just

353
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:09,958
as a a sort of test um this was a gift

354
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:14,320
from Horatio as well and I believe this

355
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,559
is the silver haze so it's a nice little

356
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,560
sativa lower off one of these little

357
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,559
buds here and just put that right in

358
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,198
there I'm just going to reuse the same

359
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,159
parchment even though there was a tiny

360
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:30,838
little bit of resin still in there um

361
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,318
overly worried about it and there is a

362
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,720
thing called the pre- squish that you

363
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,719
can do I've heard uh soil grown talk

364
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,759
about and some other people I have done

365
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,199
it most every time uh I mention it now

366
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,879
because I just put this button and

367
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,958
actually didn't do that so um it's

368
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,879
something you can do it makes it a

369
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,879
little bit easier to get

370
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,600
in you can really at one point in time

371
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,000
with your

372
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,000
ear here it's sizzling

373
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:04,679
all right so I'll show you this little

374
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,399
guy this little super silver haze bud uh

375
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,799
squeezed out a little bit more than the

376
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,600
last one nice little uh collection of

377
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:13,919
rosin on the plate there on the

378
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,399
parchment paper and you can see that the

379
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:21,120
butt itself uh I usually just pull it

380
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,120
right out while it's hot and

381
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,600
uh and it comes off real easy I I don't

382
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,199
know if other people have a different

383
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,399
technique if they're letting it dry or

384
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,039
whatnot but but uh yeah there's all

385
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,120
sorts of different way really

386
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,159
no I'm sure a lot of different people

387
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,560
are going to come up with a lot of

388
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,480
different ways to tell you how to do

389
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,439
this I'm just trying to give an my own

390
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,759
honest little opinion and review on this

391
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,880
machine so far I absolutely love it um

392
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,318
that is enough Bud collecting what I

393
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,519
wanted to do real quickly was show you

394
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:53,159
guys um a

395
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,440
collection collecting using uh a

396
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,078
pressing screen I'm going to actually

397
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,480
cut a piece of this pressing screen

398
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,479
down we'll just go like

399
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,000
this like

400
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,438
this so there's a nice little piece we

401
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,000
can make a nice little envelope with

402
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,439
that simple like that like that close it

403
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,279
on both ends you know put maybe a a gram

404
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,000
or two of hash in there and we're going

405
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,879
to press it through uh through the

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,558
machine here and show you guys what it

407
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,200
what it's like to press hash so um we'll

408
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,798
start with the better stuff might as

409
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,038
well do a little bit of each one this

410
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:40,440
stuff is bone bone dry and has really

411
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:40,440
congealed itself into this um tupperware

412
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:49,799
container all

413
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,038
right so I wanted to use my scale I

414
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,639
don't see it

415
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:56,720
anywhere we'll go by eye I can tell you

416
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,400
from this stuff as I have already done

417
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
it this stuff here will yield

418
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,559
50% uh this stuff which I thought was

419
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,319
only yielding about 33% I squeezed it a

420
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,519
few more times and actually brought that

421
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:12,119
up to about a

422
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:15,119
45% so this is almost giving 50% as this

423
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,719
is giving easily 50% and I've never even

424
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,199
gone back to repress this because uh I

425
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,558
was so happy with the 50 particularly

426
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,960
because it's like I said it's really

427
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:27,200
only a four star so uh getting that 50%

428
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,679
is uh pretty

429
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,038
nice all right so let's throw a bunch of

430
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,400
hash in here now I just did this

431
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,798
yesterday and weighed it out quite a bit

432
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,200
uh quite a few times so I'm going to

433
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,279
guess that uh I'll probably be pretty

434
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,400
accurate with a couple of grams and uh

435
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:50,720
we probably be left with a gram Patty of

436
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,360
hash afterwards and a gram of rosin so

437
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,200
uh another thing that I noticed was I

438
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:58,359
used a few screens that were dirty that

439
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,200
had these uh these oil marks in them

440
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,959
from you know the rolling the ball and

441
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,360
doing it with the hair straightener and

442
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,000
what I found was I took one of those

443
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,558
screens and I wrapped it up like this it

444
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,159
was all dirty and I the first press I

445
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:12,279
put it through the denail press the

446
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,559
thing basically cleaned the screen uh so

447
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,798
that was pretty

448
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,200
interesting all right let's see what we

449
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:19,279
got

450
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,640
here I think we could put a little bit

451
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:26,319
more in there think I'm way

452
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,120
low there we go so basically just

453
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,439
folding it up like a joint upon itself

454
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,439
and folding it back and instead of doing

455
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,840
the the ball technique that people are

456
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,200
doing I've kind of Fallen uh grown

457
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,839
accustomed to this tube or

458
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,679
rectangle and uh it's interesting it

459
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,359
definitely leaks very nice all right so

460
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,080
for this piece what I'm actually going

461
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:54,439
to use is a larger piece of parchment

462
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:57,519
that I pulled off yesterday when I was

463
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,279
doing this very same thing and uh it

464
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,359
just gives more room for the oil to

465
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:06,480
press out and uh it was a little bit

466
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:14,038
easier for me to load as well so here we

467
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:24,360
go this is the bubble hash two three

468
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:24,359
four 5 6 7 8 9 10

469
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,640
so what I usually do with this now is I

470
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,200
take it and put it in the freezer just

471
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,080
for a quick shot let it harden up open

472
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,919
it up and collect the resin and then

473
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,399
repress again we're back we've got this

474
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
should be usually able to open it real

475
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,798
quick quick and most of the resin will

476
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,720
stay on one side of the uh of the

477
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,798
parchment now it's just a matter of

478
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,440
collecting it so I lift out gently the

479
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:10,440
the pouch in the

480
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:16,278
middle a little bit of resin's going to

481
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,159
always sort of stick to it but we'll get

482
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,720
that in the next press because we're

483
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,480
definitely not done pressing this and

484
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,558
then just collecting with this really

485
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,360
simply I just

486
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:32,440
gently collect it upon itself now first

487
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,599
I'm going to make sure that my piece is

488
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,320
absolutely as clean as a whistle because

489
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:39,079
I did dig it around in that hash and

490
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:41,599
there's a bunch of little grains of hash

491
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:42,359
remnants on there so now we'll collect

492
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,719
it

493
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:48,519
up nice and tappy tacky very sort of

494
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,400
sappy

495
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,400
stuff got to be careful with it at first

496
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,519
uh if you're using a a tool like this is

497
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,759
you don't want to tear through the

498
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:00,558
parchment paper so you just have to kind

499
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,359
of gently pull the stuff off the top by

500
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,879
you know collecting it basically with

501
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,639
itself as mostly anyone that's collected

502
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,360
this rosin uh for a short period of time

503
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,159
has learned that it becomes very easy to

504
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,639
collect when you use the rosin itself

505
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:19,278
and not the actual tool of course that

506
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:22,720
takes getting some on your tool first so

507
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:24,079
nice press here actually real nice press

508
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
uh when you get larger amounts it

509
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,199
becomes even easier in my opinion cuz it

510
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
just you can hear it it just rolls right

511
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,720
off

512
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,159
you hear that just collecting upon

513
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,919
itself quite nice uh very very beautiful

514
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,760
stuff uh I do have some photos that I'll

515
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,720
share with you that are of basically

516
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,839
this exact hash uh pressed and rolled

517
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,319
through yesterday uh that way I don't

518
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,119
have to spend most of the time on this

519
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,879
video uh re photographing the resin for

520
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,278
you guys but I while we're talking about

521
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,960
this I can show you what this resin's

522
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:58,839
going to look like or at least what it

523
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,840
looked exactly like yesterday in the

524
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:03,480
photos that I took and you can see that

525
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,199
the honeycombing effect is very

526
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,519
pronounced and very strong uh as it

527
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,440
boils out of the uh pressing screen and

528
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,400
out of the hash you really get this

529
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,080
shatter like

530
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,038
honeycomb um look to it and it's it's a

531
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,519
pretty cool effect you know I'm I myself

532
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,679
am glad that I really just stuck with my

533
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:27,480
guns and my belief systems that I didn't

534
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,200
want to do solvent extracts and I I just

535
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,400
I waited all these years years for all

536
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,400
these people enjoying and I for what I'm

537
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,240
happy to say that for the last 10 to 15

538
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,919
years I haven't been inhaling solvent

539
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,919
extracts it's not something that's uh

540
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,038
you know and hoping that the person that

541
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,799
is making them was doing a good

542
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:49,558
job so we got a nice little ball right

543
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:52,000
there in fact I did get my scale so even

544
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,879
though we didn't weigh it at the start

545
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,919
we can weigh it

546
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,799
now let's do that

547
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:05,120
boom do a little tear it's about a05

548
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:08,720
just for those out in YouTube land and I

549
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:11,558
love how the rosin just literally will

550
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,159
pull right off the

551
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:19,480
stick nice little dab right

552
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:23,640
there and that is .9 of a gram so let us

553
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,640
press it again and see what we can

554
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:28,759
squeeze out of it

555
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,440
at about the 7c mark there I could hear

556
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,440
it starting to sizzle and it sizzled out

557
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,519
a little bit but certainly nowhere near

558
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,399
what we got it's probably 0.1 or2 which

559
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,918
will bring this up to uh a little over a

560
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:56,839
gram and then we'll uh we'll open that

561
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,840
up and we'll see we'll see what we

562
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,360
got so I'd also like to press some of

563
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,359
this hash for you guys just to see uh a

564
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:06,359
different press in effect I'm not going

565
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:09,359
to put quite as much in that way we can

566
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,278
actually use um uh the parchment paper

567
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,798
that I've already pulled out just some

568
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,480
smaller pieces I will do like a gram or

569
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:17,639
something and you can see the ease and

570
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,120
the wonderfulness of this unit where you

571
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,960
can just sit here having fun and in a

572
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,839
few seconds pull off a gram of rosin now

573
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,399
I do have the large unit this is the

574
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:31,599
small one 5x5 I have a large one that is

575
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:32,918
three times the size size 15x 15x 15 uh

576
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,000
it is in the other room and it's going

577
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,919
to be my next review I'm not sure I'm

578
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,960
going to be getting that up uh before I

579
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,278
go camping so I wanted to really push

580
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,319
this one through and make sure you guys

581
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:44,919
saw how cool these units were and if you

582
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,200
have the opportunity get yourself on the

583
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,880
pre-order if you're on dils page and

584
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,880
you're looking to buy anything else uh

585
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,720

586
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,760

587
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,399
little discount on your order the

588
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,440
pre-orders of this unit are already so

589
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:03,119
cheap there is no discount available

590
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,640
through that code so please don't bother

591
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,959
and uh yeah let's collect some more

592
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,960
resin here let's see what we've

593
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,359
got yeah each time I lift it up it's

594
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
cleaner and cleaner and cleaner there's

595
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:19,918
still some resin on there but we're

596
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,359
definitely getting

597
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:27,520
cleaner all right so let's collect

598
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:31,240
this nice collection o it's already

599
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:34,278
quite quite hard some stuff I find bud

600
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,038
in particular that is very dry or has

601
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:39,880
been quite long cured I find that the

602
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:43,519
rosin from that even at a low heat and a

603
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,559
low press it comes out like like dust

604
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,759
like literally you go to collect it and

605
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,480
uh I find it a little bit easier to heat

606
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,759
it heat up the tool a little bit to to

607
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,798
get it up there because it's just like

608
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,720
dust and you go to click on it and it

609
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,918
just flicks and flies away so yeah I

610
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,278
think this is easy easily going to be

611
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:05,240
another point on here maybe a point

612
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:08,079
two decent amount definitely more than

613
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,120
uh what I would take on a dab but uh I'm

614
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,079
no mountain man not sure if you guys

615
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:14,558
have seen that guy do his like 20 G dabs

616
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,240
and stuff although you know what all

617
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,038
these guys that are taking huge dabs I'm

618
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,519
super impressed that you can circular

619
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:21,879
breathe but uh I don't know for me if

620
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,918
you're going to impress me and take a

621
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,080
huge dab I'd like to see all the smoke

622
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,919
go into your lungs in one shot and then

623
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,199
come out I I think that would be

624
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,720
something to work for if I was uh

625
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,000
personally in the uh big dab game so

626
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,000
let's see what we added to

627
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,918
that let's see what we added to

628
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,440
that nice parchment too I'm amazed it

629
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
doesn't just rip but it

630
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,319
doesn't without barely even touching

631
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:58,319
this

632
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,278
like barely touching it I just get a

633
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,519
nice beautiful well done piece and uh

634
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,398
I'm going to guess that it is over a

635
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,919
gram

636
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:17,239
now

637
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:18,519
1.7 and this was .5 so it's 1.2 G and uh

638
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,079
oh you know what just for shits and

639
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,359
giggles let's give it another tiny press

640
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,599
and and see uh if we're able to squeeze

641
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:28,359
anything out we will leave it even a

642
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:31,158
little bit longer this time

643
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:31,158
like over 10

644
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:51,679
seconds well it sizzled out a bunch more

645
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,679
there's no doubt about

646
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,278
it smells great doesn't have a burnt

647
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,880
popcorn taste the color is still really

648
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:05,398
beautiful Amber Amber esque I wouldn't

649
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,399
say it's any darker than the last

650
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,159
two and let's just keep raising the

651
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:14,079
limits I think we're going to find that

652
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,559
we have uh more than two well that we

653
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,960
had more than two gram of hash in there

654
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:21,079
it'll be interesting to see if it's only

655
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,519
a gram of uh husk left we'll see here

656
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,798
soon I'm going to weigh that for you

657
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,278
guys as well and give you that idea um

658
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,440
the pressure on these things because

659
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,319
you're going to ask and I'm going to

660
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,720
write it in the comments comments is uh

661
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:35,519
between 1,200 and 1,600 lb of pressure

662
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,519
depending on how tight you set it up and

663
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,399
there's four Springs one on each corner

664
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,240
of the plate and it's uh they definitely

665
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:45,719
each have a decent amount of pressure I

666
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,960
personally haven't found the need to go

667
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,798
much harder uh I like the idea that it's

668
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,919
not super hard to close and open uh I

669
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:56,038
don't really like the idea of catching

670
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,080
the thing in my mouth and then otherwise

671
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:59,679
uh yeah it's just been a really great

672
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,960
unit temperature- wise I think it goes

673
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,120
up to

674
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,798
400° Cel I could be wrong I haven't

675
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,518
tried to raise it but I heard that the

676
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:11,359
the temperature range is quite nice it's

677
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,919
that of a t-shirt press so I would think

678
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,119
like 0 to

679
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,080
400° um it could it could be Fahrenheit

680
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:21,278
I'm really not sure I haven't gone I

681
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:23,599
personally don't want to go over 200

682
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,159
plus fit so I'm really trying to keep it

683
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,719
low and there's another nice little ball

684
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,159
of that and what I did the other day

685
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,278
easily enough I just opened it

686
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,278
up and closed it back

687
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:42,640
upop pulled a little out there right at

688
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
the end just a little bit of the

689
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,278
circle good to give it a little spin

690
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,640
actually now you don't have to do what

691
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,599
I'm doing right there if some of you are

692
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,759
like oh he's exposing it to more heat by

693
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,000
all means if your [ __ ] is ping tarpine

694
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:02,480
so much uh you don't have to do that

695
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,359
last little bit you can do what I just

696
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,038
did with a very low low temperature and

697
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:07,959
I'm kind of just being lazy to do it in

698
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,240
the moment what I did how I did these

699
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,079
ones was once I turned the unit off and

700
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,038
it went down down down down down in

701
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:16,319
temperature and they were very much just

702
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,398
warm I then just put it on and gave it a

703
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,879
little bit more pressure and uh pressed

704
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,959
them out so that's an option that you

705
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,000
have to do as well but keep it in mind

706
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,278
if you do have material that's uh

707
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,759
already lacking in tpin or the water

708
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:31,038
hash washed most of the those tpin away

709
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:34,398
or for some reason you're not really

710
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,558
rocking a ton of tpin uh then you know

711
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,719
something like that could only diminish

712
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:43,319
them more uh avoid doing it so let's see

713
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,319
where we're at should we weigh this

714
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,360
now can see it's quite flat there's

715
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:53,559
still some stickiness to it but it's not

716
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:56,599
very dirty I have to say if I can get it

717
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,638
open enough without without too many um

718
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:01,439
seams you know like little ripples in

719
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:05,319
the screen you can usually pull the hash

720
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,840
off uh in in you know almost a single

721
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,439
piece I'll just grab these sort of side

722
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:13,199
pieces

723
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,240
there there we go let's find out what we

724
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,159
got here is it a gram is it a gram and a

725
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,638
half what do we got it's 1.4 and I'd

726
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,639
easily think we can get it up to

727
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:29,519
1.5

728
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:33,679
so I'd say we had about close to 3 G of

729
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:39,519
hash and we got an almost 50%

730
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:42,399
return so yeah 1.4 or no sorry 1.3 and

731
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,480
1.2 it was about 2 and 1/2 gr and we got

732
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:50,839
about a 50% the the Ros and uh

733
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,919
ways I would say let's see real quick

734
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:56,319
plus the0 five this is

735
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,000
1.9 minus the5 is

736
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:02,000
1.4 so 1 .4 and

737
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,038
1.4 there you go people well it's going

738
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,200
back and forth this one between 1.3 and

739
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:09,798
1.4 but basically what we got there was

740
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,278
a 50% return we took a fourstar bubble

741
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:15,038
and we turned it into a sevenstar Ros

742
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:17,519
and and uh if you guys want to see that

743
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:20,879
up close cuz I know you

744
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,960
do that's what we got right there so

745
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,200
it's quite

746
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,360
nice sappy and pulley and uh I suspect

747
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,038
uh as it hardens it will become more of

748
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,038
a shatter

749
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,799
likee all right and that was what I

750
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,880
called the darker one that was the one

751
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,960
that turned into this when it dried

752
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,480
which is absolute shatter so uh you can

753
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,319
kind of tell at this point that the

754
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,440
Colors oh yeah they're pretty on point

755
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:52,119
this might get a little darker yet cure

756
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,159
out uh it was a dark water hash it was

757
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:58,079
quite dark now this one had a more of a

758
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:01,159
blondish tinge to it uh it's still is a

759
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:05,278
dark water hash but uh it squeezes out a

760
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,440
very golden kind of nice material and uh

761
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,559
let's see what we're going to do here

762
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,398
we're going to squeeze out one more uh

763
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:14,239
batch of the screen here we can even

764
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:16,279
weigh the screen it also weighs about5

765
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,479
if I can get some of this excess bubble

766
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,720
off tiny little bits that have squeezed

767
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,358
themselves into

768
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:25,638
the oh well we'll call it

769
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:28,960
six so we're going to weigh it this

770
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:32,079
time and uh try to do like 2

771
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,240
G unless it's just way too little and

772
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,280
we'll bump it up yeah that's three right

773
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,719
there so let's just do three

774
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,960
G and see what kind of returns we can

775
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,559
get on this now this is uh like I said

776
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,800
three star bubble uh mostly because the

777
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:50,398
Canadian sun I don't want to diss it

778
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,599
resin wise it's very hard to produce

779
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,719
really high quality dabbable product uh

780
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,119
in a lot of the parts of Canada because

781
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,879
the sun's just it just doesn't have the

782
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:04,079
power of those The Tropical Sun or the

783
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,079
you know the Californian

784
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,559
Sun all right so that's all kind of

785
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:13,199
loose in there luckily the edges of

786
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,239
these are now sticky which I find very

787
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,399
convenient that I can just push them

788
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:19,159
closed and uh I'm going to collect it in

789
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,760
the same piece of parchment I've gotten

790
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,920
it pretty clean already in the past so

791
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,560
we're going to go for an 8C one for the

792
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:34,159
first one so count it with me one

793
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:35,719
two 3 4 five

794
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:41,679
6

795
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:41,679
7 eight Just Hear It giv her couple more

796
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,879
seconds we got a nice little uh splotch

797
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,039
come out

798
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,318
there like I said I usually like to put

799
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,239
it in the freezer but I'm not going to

800
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:59,039
run back and forth each time what I will

801
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:02,519
do is is I will

802
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:04,079
dab um another sh another little bud

803
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:06,759
let's squeeze out another bud and see

804
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,000
what we can find that one is empty this

805
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,440
one is

806
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,199
not all right here we

807
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,960
go that's I can't wait to actually dab

808
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:20,118
the sativa Bud that we hit the haze but

809
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,639
let's try one of the other ones which I

810
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:28,079
believe was chemo yes the chemo here we

811
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,838
go of course he's a big chunky nuggets I

812
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,280
can just use even a small one and that's

813
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:36,039
more than enough I do find that uh with

814
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,960
the Ros and once again soil grown with

815
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,199
all the the tips it's good to break the

816
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,039
buds up uh into smaller pieces and he

817
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,439
finds that he gets uh he finds he gets

818
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,440
better yields when he's brok broken a

819
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,559
butt up into a few smaller pieces than

820
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:56,720
if he just uses uh one large piece of

821
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:58,799
Bud so let's try it out soil grown I'm

822
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,279
going to press these three little buds

823
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,720
one after the

824
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,720
other and I'm going to give it the pre

825
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,318
squeeze we

826
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,119
go

827
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,920
two all right so we look at this one you

828
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:32,719
never know what you're going to see when

829
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,000
you open one of these it really can go

830
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,000
any

831
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,358
way and as you can see we got some

832
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,680
derbs so the

833
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:54,559
chemo was good good

834
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:57,159
producer as was the Super Silver Haze um

835
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,880
I'm a super silver haze guy a haze guy

836
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:03,920
of any kind really so I'm going to go

837
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,280
for that and uh it's also quite nice I

838
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,519
will uh collect some first and then

839
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,720
photograph it with the macro lens so uh

840
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,719
we can see what we got

841
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,960
here clean that off a little

842
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,960
bit titanium clean so nice not a bad

843
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,799
idea to have the nice uh the the the

844
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,440
sorry the the the tool a little bit warm

845
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,560
too it's picking up beautifully but I

846
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,159
can tell you if I didn't put this in

847
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:39,239
with that little bit of heat from the

848
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,318
denail uh this would be shooting all

849
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:45,799
over the place so this is the super

850
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:49,599
silver haze gift from

851
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,039
Horatio much appreciated brother always

852
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,680
uh I always know when Horatio passes

853
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:56,960
something my way that it's gone through

854
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:59,719
it's he won't just give something that's

855
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,159
not great great he seems to always give

856
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,039
his best and uh it's one of the things

857
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,118
you got to love about the guy anyone

858
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,679
that gives their best you have to have

859
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,880
an appreciation for AKA

860
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,719
compassions uh the soil grown and of

861
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,559
course all the uh people many many years

862
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,318
before that that were probably pressing

863
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:20,759
hash and old

864
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:24,440
Barnes and uh you

865
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,760
know squeezing oil out of these giant

866
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,960
you know tonnages of hash I'm sure that

867
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:33,480
was considered uh quite a special treat

868
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,079
so super silver haze out of the sick

869
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,079
Mothership

870
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:03,318
combo definitely has a very strong

871
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,318
sativa taste right off the bat very

872
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:10,160
uh like spicy and

873
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:12,960
exotic more towards you know the sandal

874
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:16,358
woods and less towards the sweets and

875
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,280
the and the flavorful uh fruity ones

876
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:24,159
really appreciate

877
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:26,319
that and uh yeah we've got our piece

878
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,598
cooled here trying to remember where we

879
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,279
were for a second I was like did we

880
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,318
press that or did we press not press

881
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,640
that I'm going to leave these other two

882
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:36,639
little chunks of

883
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:39,598
nugs uh to go with the chemo here on the

884
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,480
side and get back to collecting uh of

885
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,400
this

886
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,639
resin which has now uh been cooling for

887
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,160
a bit here

888
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:50,920
oops got all baked you can see that it's

889
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,078
really quite nice right there and I bet

890
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,480
you I could peel this

891
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,480
yeah look at that

892
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,279
not too

893
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,679
shabby you really start to learn the

894
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,079
resin when you start to get involved

895
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,598
with it and play around with it and uh

896
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,240
it's another thing about rosin that I

897
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,119
really appreciate that it's uh it's

898
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,239
really educational for people to

899
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,880
understand when they say oh I put a butt

900
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:26,519
in and I didn't get anything you know

901
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,760
was it the wrong temperature was it the

902
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:31,280
wrong pressure you know possibly but a

903
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,000
lot of times it's not going to be the

904
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,160
wrong pressure or the wrong temperature

905
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
what it's going to be is the wrong bud

906
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,199
and for people to be able to be told

907
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,599
that or see that for themselves without

908
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,078
taking it as like an affront or an

909
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,039
assault on their own personal ego but

910
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,000
allowing them to swallow that and say

911
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,719
you know what just find better and

912
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,400
knowing the difference when you find the

913
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,399
better it's quite something with the

914
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,039
buds to just press a single Bud

915
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,720
sometimes a bud will literally squeeze

916
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:03,159
out four four to five times more resin

917
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:06,358
than another bud and uh that says a lot

918
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:08,559
about the genetics and the grower and

919
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:11,000
what was used and and all of those sort

920
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,759
of variables so there's a nice little

921
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,199
Clump we got there out of our first

922
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,200
first

923
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,838
batch collect that on there get rid of

924
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,880
those little guys put that back on the

925
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,679
collection plate

926
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,680
see what we got

927
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,720
here let's see what we

928
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,280
got all right that's 8 so guaranteed

929
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,159
there's more to be had uh we'll squeeze

930
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,680
this out a couple more times and if you

931
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,920
guys have any questions about the Press

932
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:55,358
um I urge you you know I I do know some

933
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,519
things but definitely hit up denil they

934
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:02,199
are the guys uh - nail.com uh you can

935
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,440
hit up Stevie you can hit up Willie you

936
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:06,598
can hit up Brian they're all great guys

937
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,838
over there and they're definitely into

938
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,599
customer service and helping and you

939
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:14,119
know keeping the dialogue going so

940
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,240
they're good that way we got a little

941
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,760
bit more squeezed out

942
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,358
there definitely not a ton it seems like

943
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,280
with myself I get about

944
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:27,679
80% in my first squeeze but then uh you

945
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,119
know that last 20% or even sometimes

946
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,639
less than

947
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,280
20% the quality of it looks exactly the

948
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,400
same as the First Quality it doesn't

949
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,920
look any less quality and it would be

950
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,639
interesting to find out about where in

951
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,720
the resin head the oils and the

952
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:43,480
cannaboids are existing and which ones

953
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,558
squeeze out first and if they always

954
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,440
squeeze out you know the same quality

955
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,640
each time because it's all the same oil

956
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,358
in the sack or if the the quality that

957
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,118
goes out first is better than the

958
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:56,318
quality that comes out last or vice

959
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,640
versa uh these are things that really

960
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,800
interest me and I I I think that we'll

961
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,679
find answers to these things in the

962
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,800
future as more and more people play and

963
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:08,000
I really I really could see licensed

964
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,920
producers and the bigger companies

965
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,480
starting to figure out that this is an

966
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,920
amazing alternative to uh Hydro uh

967
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,519
carbon extraction particularly the um

968
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,159
butane hydrocarbon extraction uh as

969
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,880
myself I don't have a problem with the

970
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:26,000
delemon one it seems like a pretty solid

971
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,000
way to uh produce an incredible quality

972
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,880
medicine without the worry of of course

973
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,599
burning or blowing yourself up very

974
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:39,119
badly so rosin is definitely going to

975
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,720
take a hits uh on butane it's it's going

976
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,680
to it's it's hit hard and it's great

977
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:47,759
because it's who who wins in the end are

978
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,239
the people that are no longer inhaling

979
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,839
uh non-quality product now are there

980
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,399
going to be problems with Rosen

981
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,318
absolutely we've already talked about

982
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,800
this people using bad pressing screens

983
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,558
people using too much heat too much

984
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,920
pressure pressure uh people passing uh

985
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:05,640
chemical uh molecules onto the actual

986
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,119
oil through the transference of heat

987
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:09,199
it's definitely something we're going to

988
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,559
have to pay attention to and not act

989
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,078
like it's the end all be all uh I'm

990
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,119
always going to have a place in my heart

991
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,800
for full melt wet washes and full melt

992
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,599
dry sifts that's just the way it is uh

993
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,839
it'll always be like that and uh this is

994
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:25,240
just one more thing to fill the quiver

995
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:29,199
uh of solventless quiver so yeah we've

996
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:32,719
got about a gram of oil here what did we

997
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:34,558
put in we put 3 G in so yeah this one

998
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:35,519
was the one that was 40 that I brought

999
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,240
up to

1000
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,440
45% by squeezing like many times so we

1001
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:42,598
will

1002
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,400
squeeze

1003
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:48,318
until she's no longer

1004
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,599
giving anyway so that is rosin in a

1005
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,679
nutshell that is the denail rosin uh

1006
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:54,680
press love the fact that they've got the

1007
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:56,199
two digital controllers to control each

1008
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,118
plate you can keep the temperatures

1009
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:00,239
accurate it's got a decent amount of

1010
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:01,960
pressure here that you can produce more

1011
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:05,959
if you're interested by just simply

1012
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:09,318
turning that plate around and uh as you

1013
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,400
can see the ease of use uh it's hard to

1014
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:12,679
deny uh it's definitely a lot easier

1015
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,079
than sitting around with a hair

1016
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:19,078
straightener I think uh I guess I'll

1017
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,519
probably laugh at myself one day for how

1018
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:22,000
long I did the hair straightener and I

1019
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,880
never even got a big hair straightener I

1020
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,920
had the tiny little one that was absurd

1021
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,920
and ridiculous and I might just take

1022
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,200
that hair straightener put it into here

1023
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,200
and press that hair straightener just to

1024
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,399
get rid of it once and for

1025
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,679
all all right collect the last little

1026
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,480
bits of

1027
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:41,399
this like I said if you guys got any

1028
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,719
questions throw them in the comment

1029
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,639
section I'll try my best to answer them

1030
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:48,078
uh if they are a question that I need to

1031
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:49,440
forward you onto dmail uh don't take it

1032
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,359
personally I'm not trying to pass the

1033
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,240
buck I just know that they'll answer the

1034
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,119
question way better than me my um

1035
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,558
experience with this so far is very

1036
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,838
limited I just got my unit the other day

1037
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:05,040
as did uh soil grown you can check his

1038
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:08,000
Instagram at soil grown and uh yeah

1039
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:10,920
check us out squishing buds squishing

1040
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,400
hash and uh this is the first of many

1041
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,119
videos that you're going to see I'm

1042
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,039
going to be making water hash in the

1043
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:18,920
near future as I have quite a bit of

1044
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:21,519
material saved up in my freezer and dry

1045
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,800
sift we're probably not going to see

1046
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:26,000
unfortunately uh until the weather cools

1047
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:30,119
off a little bit and it has been very

1048
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,199
very warm uh here for the last uh oh

1049
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:34,880
jeez I don't know three months it's been

1050
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:38,000
a warm one let's just

1051
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:42,400
say all right get that up to

1052
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,679
1.1 G so we've got uh what did we have

1053
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,000
three Gams we're just above 33% right

1054
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:50,078
now about

1055
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
36 and what I'm guessing is cuz I did it

1056
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,839
the other day if I just continue to put

1057
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,239
it in the press and press it down uh now

1058
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,880
the nice thing about the large large one

1059
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,000
which we'll talk about in the next video

1060
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,559
is that you can really put a big amount

1061
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,159
with a big giant piece of pressing

1062
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,000
screen just go to town and literally I'm

1063
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:11,879
going to go for maybe like a 30 G like

1064
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,559
an ounce of bubble press and see uh see

1065
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:18,200
how that turns out you can hear it

1066
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:21,800
sizzling a mild Sizzle will do you don't

1067
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:22,879
need to cook it but uh it's a good idea

1068
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,119
when you hear a little bit of that

1069
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,920
Sizzle cuz you know that it's

1070
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,680
traveling it is TR traveling out of the

1071
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,400
hash and it just keeps uh you know like

1072
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,879
I

1073
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:37,358
said returning now smaller amounts each

1074
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,880
time but this is definitely more than

1075
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,639
like right there is a dab that I just

1076
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,440
collected and that's another

1077
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,358
dab know here's here's another dab right

1078
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,079
there

1079
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:52,358
collected and maybe another one here and

1080
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,559
one last one all along the bottom here

1081
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:57,838
so four or five dabs collected uh or

1082
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,880
like I said if you're you know insane

1083
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,920
and just love to hit monster monster

1084
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,798
dabs then this is one dab or half a dab

1085
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,200
you know it all depends on how you look

1086
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:12,519
at it uh I think of it in a medicinal

1087
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:15,358
aspect as something that uh is going to

1088
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:17,679
give relief to people and uh some people

1089
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,318
need more and some people need less and

1090
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,399
I respect

1091
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:23,599
that all right this will be the last

1092
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,440
press that we do on this love the ease

1093
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,079
of use um I can't say enough about it

1094
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,240
really pressing buds pressing different

1095
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:35,318
types of hash surrounded in rosin and

1096
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:38,598
super happy about it go get yours at

1097
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:40,639
dna.com pre-orders 350 bucks they are

1098
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,960
going to get more expensive probably 400

1099
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,118
450 I have no idea but uh they're

1100
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
basically selling them for less than you

1101
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,599
can get a t-shirt press for and they've

1102
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,640
put more work into them so it's uh it's

1103
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,119
pretty cool they've done a great job I

1104
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:57,519
appreciate what you guys are doing as

1105
00:49:53,119 --> 00:50:00,400
always and uh still squeezing out rosin

1106
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:04,199
from this bubble I think uh this last

1107
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,200
one might be a hit what do you say take

1108
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,719
it take us out with a

1109
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:12,118
hit these are the uh breeder Steve

1110
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:14,318
strings so yeah at first when you try to

1111
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,200
collect them just at first they'll be a

1112
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,239
little bit too liquefied and they they

1113
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:22,239
they just want to smear but you give it

1114
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:25,000
just a few seconds in the open area and

1115
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:27,679
quickly uh they start to harden and you

1116
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,159
get that more Snappy feel and if I leave

1117
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,159
it even longer what'll happen is as I

1118
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,879
hit it with the tool it'll literally

1119
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:38,159
flick the hash away so thanks for

1120
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,119
watching Bubble man's world guys uh I

1121
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,039
will have all these links and different

1122
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,039
things that we discussed uh in the

1123
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,039
