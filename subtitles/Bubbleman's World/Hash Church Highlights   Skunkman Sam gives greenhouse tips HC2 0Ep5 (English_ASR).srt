howdy howdy howdy everybody in hash

14
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:33,349
Church yeah my experience with green

15
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,620
houses was I built my own green house

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,800
about 40 years ago and then I moved to

17
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:42,349
the Netherlands where I ran many many

18
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,049
many professional green houses with

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:49,939
computerized darkening computerized

20
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:54,399
watering and and my favorite way to grow

21
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:54,399
is greenhouses although there's

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,330
but IIIi I've been there I've seen most

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,620
of the changes we were one of the very

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,170
first in the world to use darkening for

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,030
to mature cannabis flowers in the when

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,849
we were in the northern environment in

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,150
the greenhouse and if anybody has any

28
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:21,299
questions I'll be happy to step up to

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,920
the box but except for that I am what I

30
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:32,129
am and I think pretty much everybody

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:33,420
knows me Sam I don't know you I would be

32
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,399
interested to hear about your

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,740
progression of you know greenhouse

34
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,340
growing and some year maybe your light

35
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:44,118
deprivation experience yes is it on it's

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,859
on howdy howdy

37
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,810
I've been grown in greenhouses ever

38
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:55,618
since the first year I grew cannabis in

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:58,618
Santa Cruz that was in maybe 70 72 or

40
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,950
something route like that and that was

41
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:04,109
just a homemade primitive greenhouse

42
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,799
what's and friends of mine were doing

43
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,780
darkening for sexy not for flowering but

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:15,030
for sexy and that was in northern

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:17,280
California but one of the problems with

46
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,629
the sexing was at that time they didn't

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,789
really understand what they were doing

48
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:23,419
so they would darken it for two weeks

49
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:26,370
until the plant showed sex

50
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:28,169
whereas well the research that I found

51
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,539
when we were doing the research in

52
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,000
Holland was that most indica varieties

53
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,489
you can darken for one day and then two

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,150
weeks later they will show sex they and

55
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:42,959
they were not staying long and with with

56
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,909
vege with a uh excuse me with sativa

57
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,950
varieties sometimes they need to be

58
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:49,560
darkened two or three days at the very

59
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:53,519
most but then two weeks later they show

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,560
the sex gist and so it's I mean I had a

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,290
friend who produced thousands and

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,110
thousands of seedlings and then darkened

63
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:08,159
them off just for sexing to sell early

64
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,850
known female plants to people and a few

65
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,740
times he because

66
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,409
darken up for two weeks they would not

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,960
come back so the customers were rather

68
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:19,180
irate that they had these little plants

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,099
that were you know two feet tall and

70
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,590
flowered off and they would not return

71
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:26,919
veg can you also tell the story of how

72
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:31,780
you discovered like greenhouse light

73
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,759
death in greenhouse light depth what

74
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,310
happened was I went into a course anthem

75
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:40,060
of greenhouse cuz I was interested in

76
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,409
building my own greenhouse or or buying

77
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:47,469
one or renting one or whatever and so I

78
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:51,699
saw the chrysanthemum darkened to induce

79
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:54,129
flowering and I a light went on in my

80
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:57,129
head and I went Jesus Christ I mean I

81
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:02,169
had seen people darken plants with a

82
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:06,699
tarp in the late 70s and early 80s but I

83
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:09,909
wasn't interested because I I wanted a

84
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:12,549
greenhouse it was multiple acres and you

85
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:13,840
you can't hand Arkin multiple acres well

86
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:19,060
actually you can if you have enough

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,850
labor but it's so that's I saw what

88
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,680
darkening could do I instantly

89
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,550
understood what this was for cannabis

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,550
and so that was I don't know maybe

91
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,910
eighty six or something like that and

92
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:36,970
but what once I saw that yeah I never

93
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,390
stepped back for for the Netherlands you

94
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,390
need darkening because you you can you

95
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:48,360
can grow multiple crops a year or you

96
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:51,909
can grow one big good heavy crop and

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,699
darken it and get it out before the cold

98
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,189
it comes and your heating bills are ten

99
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:00,339
thousand not what it's a day a week and

100
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:03,040
can you also comment Sam on earlier Mick

101
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,539
was talking Michael was talking and he

102
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,580
mentioned how he kind of likes to keep

103
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,530
them a little bit smaller which might be

104
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:10,839
perfect for what he's doing and and

105
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,789
producing super high quality flowers but

106
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,439
you came in as a sort of like oh I'd

107
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,960
like to have really big greenhouses and

108
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,629
maybe just talk to wire that is well the

109
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,668
main reason is is I like big plants love

110
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:22,610
the work I'm doing is not commercial

111
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:25,698
production

112
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,848
it's breathing work and for breeding

113
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:31,550
work I start seeds thousands and

114
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:36,529
thousands of seeds and then what I do is

115
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:39,620
I I want to pick the best plants and

116
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:42,679
2bic the best plant from seed it's very

117
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,019
difficult to do with a little 1 or 2

118
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,180
foot plant you grow at 12 feet tall you

119
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:50,658
get a really good idea of its positive

120
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,750
and negative qualities and for for a

121
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:56,990
breeder it's it's really required so I

122
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,089
that's why I had a very high ceiling my

123
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,340
ceiling was well maybe 20 feet or so and

124
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:04,519
I could grow 15-foot tall plants if I

125
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:09,288
want get 3 4 or 5 kilos of dried

126
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:11,389
material let me ask you Sam about the

127
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:14,478
sexy one more time you know for people

128
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,668
that are you know maybe don't have a lot

129
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,098
of power still in Humboldt or you know

130
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,168
these Kraft farmers if they were to sex

131
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:23,538
their plants like you were saying how

132
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:25,490
long if it was it's depending on strain

133
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:27,259
you would say but if somebody was to do

134
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,000
it would you say to darken it for a day

135
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:31,879
or two instead of the two weeks like

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,218
your yeah and because I experienced the

137
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,838
same thing I've seen plants that didn't

138
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:38,149
come back out of the veg and it was a

139
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:39,649
huge pain in the ass could you talk a

140
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:43,579
little bit more about that like your

141
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:47,538
recommendation is my mic on okay then

142
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:51,348
the main thing is that cannabis will

143
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:54,348
take two weeks to express its sex but

144
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:57,079
one or two days of darkening is enough

145
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:58,788
to trip the expression two weeks later

146
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,848
that's the main thing you have to

147
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:05,288
understand with earlier varieties only

148
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:07,759
one day if it's a very late late

149
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:10,009
equatorial variety maybe it takes two or

150
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,800
three days at the very most and then

151
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,710
when you put them back on a long cycle

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,848
two weeks later they sex but they don't

153
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:21,408
stay flowering face are totally veg and

154
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:22,908
you grow them really really big and then

155
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,740
fly them off and you know what sex they

156
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:27,050
are that's almost like at the end of

157
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,150
that you should also say you're welcome

158
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,150
because that was a gem right there

159
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:40,939
absolute GameChanger thank you for drop

160
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:42,529
that knowledge I think we hope that you

161
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:44,269
know what I mean like can we can't we

162
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,009
quantify things with lab tests sometimes

163
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:47,899
because I know that I've talked to a few

164
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,610
lab companies that have said over the

165
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,889
course of time some of the greenhouse

166
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,819
material they've been testing has has

167
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,560
tested higher in the THC CBD and even

168
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,240
the terpene percentages and I know that

169
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,089
the terpene companies bubble man maybe

170
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,980
you might know something about that with

171
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:05,659
greenhouse material and the terpene

172
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:12,920
production that you might have heard

173
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:14,330
about or known yeah okay yeah

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,370
you know right through Toni's mouth

175
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:18,649
almost always the light that the

176
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,310
greenhouse is going to produce like a

177
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:24,799
way higher level of terpene production

178
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,410
you know not just a smaller amount but

179
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,300
like a substantially larger amount and

180
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,550
not to change the subject completely but

181
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,549
while I have the mic one of the things

182
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,250
Sam was mentioning about greenhouse

183
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:40,000
triggering flowering as well

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,590
particularly in I guess it was in like

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,379
close to the equator countries where

186
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:48,320
they have 12 hours and 12 hours of light

187
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:51,379
and darkness and often people are trying

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,700
to grow with added lights additional

189
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:54,379
light they'll maybe put it on for

190
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,940
another five or six hours Sam have an

191
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:59,419
interesting bit of information to share

192
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,170
on that tropical cannabis growing yeah

193
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:05,899
that's basically what we found is that

194
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:08,929
we eat in the Netherlands when I would

195
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:12,350
grow big giant plants at 1012 feet tall

196
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:18,219
over the winter I could give as little

197
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:23,420
as I was using these little 60 watt blue

198
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:26,540
incandescent agricultural balls from

199
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:29,209
philips and so they were geared towards

200
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:31,279
but but they were only 60 watts and i

201
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,230
would use one of those for every 10

202
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,129
square meters so that's a hundred square

203
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,850
feet and it absolutely prevented

204
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:44,240
flowering and not not only that but you

205
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,190
could use as little as just in the

206
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,430
instead of giving them six or eight

207
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,480
hours of flight to keep them veg but you

208
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,009
could do is just in

209
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,050
the middle of the night give them two

210
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,049
hours of light that's all they needed oh

211
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,500
yeah I've been doing this for 30 years

212
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:02,360
that's a big one for people that have

213
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,070
been especially in countries where you

214
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,079
know he was mentioned like only having

215
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,820
one generator only being able to turn on

216
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,649
enough light in one section of the

217
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,120
greenhouse if you do a quarter here a

218
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:14,778
quarter there a quarter there and

219
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,120
instead of leaving it on for that I'll

220
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:19,909
just tell you how severe I've done it

221
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,578
I actually was storing trance under

222
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:25,039
refrigeration at about plus three four

223
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:29,149
degrees so they're in a frigerator with

224
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:32,659
lights and all's I gave them was 15

225
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:36,259
minutes of light four times a day so

226
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:38,419
every five hours I'd give them for five

227
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:40,399
or six hours I give them 15 minutes of

228
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:42,439
light totally prevented flower and they

229
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,539
stayed veg they also weren't growing

230
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,250
because it was so cold all I was trying

231
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:49,099
to do was keep the plants alive as the

232
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:53,120
library did you see that there was any

233
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,850
reduction in actual growth Oh bro

234
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,209
practically they'd under under three

235
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,639
degrees there's practically zero growth

236
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:04,669
mmm I wasn't trying to grow them I was

237
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,560
trying to maintain them yeah yeah but

238
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:08,750
Mike I guess my question is is you know

239
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,159
I think some people would argue will

240
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,740
they keep all these lights on because

241
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,719
not only do they want to keep the photo

242
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,698
period going but they're also trying to

243
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,379
have the plant grow at the same time so

244
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:21,559
I'm just curious if you saw any

245
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:24,169
difference at any point in your in your

246
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:27,349
experiences where there you could see

247
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:29,750
like a difference in growth growth rates

248
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,040
the more lumens and the more hours of

249
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:36,230
course you're going to get more growth

250
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:39,708
of course but that wasn't my goal my

251
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,329
goal was to I had big plants in the

252
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,018
ground which I could served in my

253
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:45,289
greenhouse

254
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:49,490
I had a small collection on on fo tables

255
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:53,230
under under halides and just as a

256
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:58,220
library and I had a third collection in

257
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:02,269
I had specially made like a refrigerator

258
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,899
with lights built into it which and in

259
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,940
those I

260
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,289
I gave them as little as an hour a day

261
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,480
if broken up in 15 minutes so that they

262
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:16,969
never received really long periods of

263
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,970
dark at any one time awesome information

264
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:22,949
yeah I just met a guy in Humboldt a lot

265
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,590
of my research comes from old old-school

266
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,660
growers in Humboldt County and they said

267
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,600
the same thing Sam was saying as far as

268
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:33,179
keeping the plants and veg the guy came

269
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,129
here recently and did a greenhouse tour

270
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:37,109
and he goes no I only have my light on

271
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,049
in the middle of the night for one hour

272
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,659
in the wintertime to keep him in veg and

273
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:44,729
I thought one hour and so yeah to save

274
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:47,279
on generator and power and all these

275
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,070
things that people deal with they can't

276
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,990
use all this electricity or access to it

277
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,600
maybe in the middle of the night you

278
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,850
know so when he told me that in the veg

279
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,980
period he that he only uses the light

280
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,500
for one hour in the middle of the night

281
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,000
I was just like holy crap and now I'm

282
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,669
starting to hear little bits and pieces

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,559
of it and then of course now Sam is kind

284
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:10,199
of confirming that whole thing too so I

285
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,609
mean I'm gonna try it you know like I

286
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,830
think it's pretty cool I want to try the

287
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,480
sexing stuff and play around with all

288
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:26,220
those things I like doing experiments

289
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:31,800
and less time less lumens maybe two

290
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:33,480
hours to prevent flowering right so keep

291
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:38,189
that in mind is your sort of recipe as

292
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,840
you get into it well yeah because sorry

293
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,710
so that I'm just want to make sure I'm

294
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,600
hearing you're right so the thought

295
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,240
process is don't don't give him a long

296
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,730
period of no light you're saying just

297
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,909
break it up and you're turning the light

298
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,620
on for 15 minutes every hour yeah I've

299
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:54,559
heard that and I know Sam was saying

300
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,700
that for his library and part of his

301
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,889
experimentation was to keep these plants

302
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,259
from growing but to keep the library and

303
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,480
so he said he'd dosed him in a couple

304
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:06,299
times 15 minutes at a time if I heard

305
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,220
you right Sam and then at two hours and

306
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:12,740
what he were just confirming was the two

307
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:17,790
hours for a low lumen light right

308
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:22,110
exactly thing you wanted to share

309
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:24,899
about talking about lumens but basically

310
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:28,500
what we found is that absolutely need

311
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:32,279
lots of the lumens to produce biomass

312
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,860
and vegetation is flowered halfway or

313
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,419
more and pretty much all so it's going

314
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:42,060
to do then is fill out the flowers and

315
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:45,419
maybe add a lot of weight from resin and

316
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,919
stuff I found lower light levels I'm

317
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,439
talking about from the Sun or from

318
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,439
artificial lights actually produce

319
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,590
superior product also what I found is

320
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,800
that the high temperatures associated

321
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,810
with flowering really high temperatures

322
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,509
it's not really positive because it has

323
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:06,509
a tendency to vaporize terpenes right on

324
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:08,610
the plant so lower temperatures a little

325
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:12,779
bit lower lumens I found produced

326
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,669
superior product here when we were on

327
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:20,759
mute that will do you want to mention it

328
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:26,039
Sam I just wanted to mention that when I

329
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:28,350
grew the denti-cal clone big small even

330
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:31,199
in vitro so that the flower doll plant

331
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,899
was only maybe an inch or two tall when

332
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,110
it was completely flowered in agar agar

333
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,870
in vitro in a test tube the resin is

334
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,810
much smaller the resin individual resin

335
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,970
heads on that plant when you grow it to

336
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,519
3 feet tall like you're talking about

337
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,910
four C green or something the the resin

338
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,850
is is quite a big a bit bigger but when

339
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:58,519
I grew my same clone and it was 12 feet

340
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,519
tall the resin was again a little bit

341
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:05,278
it's important it's important to me we

342
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:07,759
we missed that last that last little

343
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,558
part but

344
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,999
well the the last little part was that

345
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:16,588
if your plant is 12 feet tall and you

346
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:19,019
flour it off and then you collect the

347
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:23,160
resin from that it's again a little bit

348
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:25,379
bigger than the 3 foot plant the each

349
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,149
individual resin head is a little bit

350
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:29,688
bigger and for hash makers that's

351
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:29,688
important
