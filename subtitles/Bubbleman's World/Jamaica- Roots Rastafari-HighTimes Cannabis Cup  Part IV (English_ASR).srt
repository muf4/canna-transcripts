229
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,560
it ladies and gentlemen this is a

230
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,399
historic occasion for us here in Jamaica

231
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:13,159
this is the first such event to be put

232
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:16,799
on in this country in April of this year

233
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:19,000
the parliament here passed um a law

234
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,919
which made a number of changes to the

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,559
way in which ganja is treated in this

236
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:27,198
country um and did a number of things

237
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,039
I'm not going to go into the details of

238
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,479
that at this stage Maybe on another

239
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,639
occasion during the festival however one

240
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
important thing living and living at one

241
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,759
with

242
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:41,439
nature so all of us I think should take

243
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,839
advantage of the opportunities to learn

244
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,880
more about this religion about the

245
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,279
spirituality and when we leave here

246
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,958
eventually we will I think have a much

247
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,600
more fullsome understanding of that it

248
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,879
is also been an opportunity for High

249
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Times magazine to partner with the

250
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:01,159

251

High Times Cannabis Cup in the rasa far

260
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,279
Roots fest and that of course has been

261
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,759
the Catalyst that has brought many

262
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,200
people from outside of Jamaica to come

263
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,879
to N Grill to experience this unique

264
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,720

like any other that has gone before it

266
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,558
is my hope that this Festival will help

267
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,839
to provide economic opportunities for

268
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:52,918

and it was a domino reaction and

318
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,119
parishes all over groups came up all

319
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,720
over because they

320
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,399
realized that with the

321
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,519
amendment within the laws as it regard

322
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,519
to her ganza

323
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:23,240
marijuana it opened the

324
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:26,200
door for people foreign investors and

325
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,679
other people to come into

326
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,080
Jamaica and we REM do not have any

327
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,280
problem with

328
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:37,839
investors where we have a

329
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:40,279
problem I do not want to see this

330
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,639
industry being

331
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,038
manipulated by people with money foreign

332
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,960
investors are local

333
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:51,079
Jamaicans there are certain people Rari

334
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,640
and grassroot people who have gone to

335
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:56,639
prison who have paid a heavy price to

336
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,400
keep this industry alive and if there's

337
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,159
money to be made out of this this

338
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,140
industry I am saying that these people

339
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:07,319
should also benefit

00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,759
otherwise that will be coming through so

349
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,880
the A and objective is to really make

350
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,519
this like I've said before into a real

351
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,840
educational

352
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:48,759
program learning in different

353
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,759
ways now why I took the stand as a

354
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:54,919
youth as a youth growing up I have I'm

355
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:59,359
from a grad

356
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:02,799
background working class background

357
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:05,240
and being a youth who I had a

358
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,278
privilege I got a common entrance

359
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,200
examination at at the age of 11 plus at

360
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:13,079
end live to go to Manning High School

361
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,600
the second oldest educational

362
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,480
institution in the

363
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:20,399
isand and as such it has helped I to

364
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,200
develop my educational

365
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,038
ability but as a youth I never feel

366
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,640
satisfied watching police coming amongst

367
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:31,960
my grassroot people my working class

368
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,000
people and harassing them in any way

369
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,880
whatsoever so the fact that I had the

370
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,079
educational ability I took it as a

371
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,000
pleasure to confront police to confront

372
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,359
the government and as such like sister M

373
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,880
said we have arranged marches marches

374
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,959
upon marches letters upon letters until

375
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,360
today give thanks we are here we can

376
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,038
bring we can travel with herb we get

377
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,319
permit that we can go and pick up herb

378
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:02,679
we can travel with even 10 pound of herb

379
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,798
I mean those who have the permit but

380
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,240
again I have to give thanks for the work

381
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,038
of The Honorable Mark Golding because

382
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,480
there

383
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:16,200
are I remember we had written to a prime

384
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,000
minister seeking an audience with him to

385
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,798
discuss the issue of marijuana the

386
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,319
educational system the issue of

387
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,400
reparation and repatriation we never got

388
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,558
an

389
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,159
A but honorable marking is a man like

390
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:33,399
that like anytime calling he's

391
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,440
there the only way this minister is not

392
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,600
there if is if he cannot be

393
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,640
there and I think that is a good sign

394
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:46,038
because if you are a leader you must be

395
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,680
prepared to sit with your people and

396
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:51,140
talk with

397
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,140
[Music]

398
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,158
them A House Is Never built from the top

399
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:01,640
go down is always built from from the

400
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:06,559
bottom up and the people of this

401
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:10,120
country descendants of enslaved African

402
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,798
people we know what it is to

403
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:16,399
suffer the chain were on our hands and

404
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,759
our feet the chain has been moved it has

405
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,200
been placed

406
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,640
psychologically but more so it has been

407
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,798
placed

408
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,240
economically because even when we

409
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:29,158
liberate ourselves mentally like Bob

410
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,038
sing the song in man at yourself from

411
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,440
mental slavery nothing but ourselves can

412
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,720
change our

413
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,600
mind even with that we still have the

414
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,880
economic situation to face so this is an

415
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:47,558
opportunity that we can utilize this

416
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,000
product to help uplift the economic

417
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:52,038
condition of

418
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,319
Jamaica we know that the United States

419
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:58,558
is there and they are there with a big

420
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:01,439
stick over our head but for years they

421
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,558
have sent helicopters come to Jamaica to

422
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,080
cut down the marijuana that was grown

423
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:09,599
here they have sent they it has been

424
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:12,199
spread with chemical such as paraquat

425
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,678
now the US Affair is doing what more

426
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,519
than half the states have now legalized

427
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,320
and decriminalized ganja not only for

428
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,960
medical uses but also for recreational

429
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,839
uses and I think that's very

430
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,319
hypocritical of the United States of

431
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:31,199
America if we cannot do

432
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,079
what we think is

433
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,360
right and if we cannot be

434
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,759
allowed to plant her to utilize it

435
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,839
medically and economically then the

436
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,579
United States of America should not be

437
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,189
allowed to do that

438
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,189
[Music]

439
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,158
either now the United States of America

440
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,519
is doing that because they realize the

441
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,240
medicinal potential and the economic

442
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:03,000
potential of her

443
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:07,000
and I think we as black people and as a

444
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,038
nation in Jamaica should also be allowed

445
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,200
to use marijuana to develop our

446
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,000
economy it is a fact that for years

447
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,519
research and research has been carried

448
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,240
out not only in the United States but

449
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,440
other places of the world and when I and

450
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,640
I rest fire I used to say her to the

451
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,919
healing of the

452
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,799
nation when I and I used to tell them

453
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,200
about veget and we life when I and I

454
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,200
used to tell them that Africa is the

455
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,038
Cradle of mankind and the cradle of

456
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,798
civilization we were laugh at we were

457
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,440
mocked we were sconed but today it is

458
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,440
all been proven so if the rest of man

459
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,360
was right in saying those things it will

460
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,640
be proven that the rights of man is

461
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:53,000
right in everything that he

462
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,799
said we are we hope to use this Avenue

463
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,038

464
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:00,918
