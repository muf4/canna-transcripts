a Pegasus Hotel so there was another uh

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,280
ganja conference and I guess this one

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,000
involved quite a few ministers uh quite

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,840

informed the best we can with what's

49
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,798
going on and uh uh you know in regards

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,478
to the project that we're trying to get

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,680
going here and in regards to even the

52
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,599
amendments to the laws and in regards to

53
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,039
updates on what's going on I I just read

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,078
the uh Observer myself I guess there

55
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,640
probably kind of rumors out on the

56
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,319
streets as well as the things that are

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,960
being said out of the public yeah yeah

58
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,199
and so what's the feeling for you it's

59
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,639
going to be another month or two another

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,919
week or two um I think you know I think

61
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,199
it'll get done probably probably by the

62
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,799
next month or so I guess looking

63
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,959
probably at 30 to 60 days isn't too bad

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,519
that's a good uh I think that's you know

65
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,479
I'm I'm also in the guessing game of 1

66
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,200
to 6 months because I just you know it

67
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,000
just seems kind of too good to be true

68
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,759
that this is really happening that

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,919
they're amending this Drug law and that

70
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,000
Jamaica a country that is so I mean not

71
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,359
the whole country but definitely like a

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,158
good chunk of people from this country

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,560
have represented cannabis in in in my

74
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:47,959
opinion in one in a very impressive way

75
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,560
yes you know reggae culture and rasa

76
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:55,080
culture um just promoting the sort of

77
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,000
love and peace and this Vibe of you know

78
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,360
we use cannabis not alcohol we use

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,759
cannabis not cocaine we canis not you

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,599
know all these other drugs so I kind of

81
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,639
really I agree with that sort of

82
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,039
philosophy the sort of the ital

83
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,679
philosophy of uh it's a pure rasco bot

84
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,120
down here yeah absolutely it really is

85
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,599

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,200
here we should probably have a denail

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,480
rip let's do it yeah so we're uh I guess

91
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,560

background that sometimes for me often I

150
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,800
feel that it's almost well for instance

151
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,000
for this for the video we did with your

152
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,240

153

if you guys haven't seen that on Bubble

154
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,879
man's world go give that a check and

155
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,840
share it in your social media cuz it's a

156
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,478
real cool thing we're we're monetizing

157
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,239
it and we're making some money for

158
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,159
prophecy on that video 100% of the

159
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,160
monetization goes to prophecy and uh as

160
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,479
well as it should cuz it's a killer song

161
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,400
yeah you know I did that song when I did

162
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,680
that song sometime you know something s

163
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,159
ah of the time but I think the

164
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,319
intelligent side of we was always scene

165
