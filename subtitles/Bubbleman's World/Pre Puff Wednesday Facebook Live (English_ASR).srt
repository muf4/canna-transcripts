titanium going into the new Corner yeah

100

I don't want the titanium getting moved

101
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,199

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,839
wall and then gently pull it out what

103
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,600
temp did you press your rosin okay well

104
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,359
we pressed uh the first batch was at

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,199

about

107
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,120
180 so we had like a 40 degree

108
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,079
difference between the the flower rosin

109

like a leaf or something wrapped all

234
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,399
around it so I guess in a sense that was

235
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,360
kind of like the closest I've come to

236

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,160
out of all the rosins John um come on we

264
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,839
tested the flower rosin versus the dryy

sift rosin that I DRFT rosin was the

266

kill dude come on 80 80% heads dry sift

267
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,719
rosin is more

268
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,839
intense tasting like the flour than the

269
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,839
flower rosin is I'm telling you most

270
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
people have just never cleaned dry sift

271
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,320
up to that level and then run it but I'm

272
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:54,039
telling you it is by far the most

273
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,040

us as well what is the solution it's a

328
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,320
natural um mostly uh non-chlorinated

329
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,199
water Kanga oil processed coconut

330
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,440
extract processed kelp extract and

331
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,519
process extract of sugar cane those

332
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,040
three extracts how they're extracting it

333
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,919
and what they're doing with that those

334
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,559
three combinations I think is also an

335
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,439
important part when the quartz is really

336
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,439
hot and you put it on the Q-tip and you

337
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,720
drop that in there it's the water that

338
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,720
steams and it's very much like the way

339
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,240
the steam from bud and hash is steaming

340
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,800
out the resin from azin press this

341
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,039
process seems to very much so Steam and

342
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,639
create this you know agitation that

343
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,360
carries the the the dirt resin or

344
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,159
whatever away from the glass and if you

345
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,680
check out DC glass on his Instagram he's

346
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,919
got a couple of videos where he Heats

347
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,559
this stuff up like he gets it real hot

348
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,919
and then puts glass into it cuz it

349
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,919
doesn't work cold and basically he gets

350
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,278
this really really incredible product

351
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,120
you see the oil dripping and moving away

352
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,759
from the glass I was sold the second I

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,480
saw it hit my courtz Banger Anyway full

354
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,919
Madness going on outside of my house I

355
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,120
think my dog's barking there's kids

356
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,679

361
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,240
this [ __ ] I can honestly say it works

362
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,838
like nothing I have ever seen and how

363
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,000
easy it is I don't know if you're

364
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,959
hitting quartz bangers but if you are

365
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,120
it's just so easy it's super inexpensive

366
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,919
I'm definitely giving it a two thumbs up

367
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,399
I put it in little vials and carry it

368

489
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,679
the sasquash rosin press um yeah that's

490
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:39,119
what we're doing we're taking some macro

491
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,679
pictures of the caked out buttery

492
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,119
battery goodness over here and uh we're

493
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,759
of course going to share it with you

494
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,599
people as we can maybe through the

495
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,240
Facebook maybe through YouTube maybe

496
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:55,038
through this live chat I'll see what

497
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,200
happens it's not easy let me tell you

498
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,440
just trying to get this guy

499
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,960
to oh my God just as it just as I was

500
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,960
about to get

501
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
it well right off the bat you know what

502
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,558
I can see through it I can see that

503
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,359
there's a little hair on

504
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,440
it that's just settling of the dust in

505
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,879
the room that's where it's coming from

506
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,600
you got to keep all your stuff covered

507
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
up so that way you don't get anything

508
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,359
particulars are definitely going to just

509
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,200
run right towards your resin so always

510
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,399
make sure you have it covered up and you

511
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,880
know what just sitting up for like

512
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,200
five minutes yep that's all it takes

513
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,720
it's okay we got rid of it real

514
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,679
quick we don't need

515
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,480
it so this is definitely like a

516
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,919
challenge of challenges I'm change the

517
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,759
lighting can I do that and put it

518
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,320
towards the resin need to turn in and

519
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,440
down there you go that's better I just

520
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:53,319
don't want to

521
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,919
touch I think I'd rather shoot from this

522
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,319
angle not easy what we're doing here I

523
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,600
can see the work trying to give a little

524
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,599
bit of you know little

525
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,320
all right so here we go right over top

526
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,919
of

527
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:10,918
it it's not

528
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,919
easy

529
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,080
me tell you what I'm going to photograph

530
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,719
this you talk to those guys that way

531
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:20,480
we're both not focused on the same thing

532
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,600
so you know what is actually pretty cool

533
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,400
to sit here and watch how he's just how

534
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,759
how how the camera work works and how

535
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,240
actually can see it through the eye cuz

536
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,158
I get to see it personally all the time

537
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,880
which is kind of cool right

538
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,760
you know definitely it was pretty cool

539
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,760

540
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:39,000

to you guys you know what well what

569
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,839
basically what this was it was a resin

570
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:55,558
that came from a trim bin um and that

571
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,959
was freshly trimmed just yesterday or

572
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:00,599
like it was yesterday it was gathered up

573
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,840
and put into a little plastic bag and uh

574
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,119
then I uh proceeded to come over here

575
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,439
today because I left the little bag of

576
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,879
buff death Bubba here last week and uh

577
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,159
we were going to squish that out so this

578
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,679
is actually from the bag itself the weed

579
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,320
that I left behind and the rest that

580
