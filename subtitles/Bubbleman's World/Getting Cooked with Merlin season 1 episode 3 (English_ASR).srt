couple of big nuggets there hey

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,200

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,000
gas is i think some people smell sativas

18

and terpenoline and they call it gas

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,878
that ain't gas it's not gas gasoline is

20

kush smoked knock you out right it's

21
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:06,239
that smell right there this is gas yeah

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200

23
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,079

vivo gets stoned yeah i like that idea

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
people get stoned why am i using the

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,280
german accent because we're going to be

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,118
cooking a german specialty today que

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,959
spetzla otherwise known as mac and

52
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,878
cheese but a little bit fancied up it's

53
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,479
a old-timey dish i've been having since

54
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,799
i'm a little kid that's awesome like

55
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,560
from mom and grandma exactly that was

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,239
like all i wanted from when i was a kid

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,800
when grandma came to come and see us it

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,520
was make questions you know i love the

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,719
aspect of food um

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,560
how it connects generations

61
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,120
you know and how we like everyone's got

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,439
grandma's recipe of course no one being

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,039
able to do grandma's recipe or a recipe

64
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,560
similar to it something that merlin's

65
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,400
got a history with

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
it just makes it that much more cool i

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
love mac and cheese connects it with a

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
memory too which is which is crazy

69
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,199
there's almost nothing else that can do

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,200
that like a certain smell or a taste

71
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,719
that connects you to a memory of yours

72
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,719
that's pretty cool truly as you light

73
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,560
that cush joint i'm like flooding with

74
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,959
crushed memories

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,479
of the good days

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,158
awesome well we're gonna hit the ewok

77
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,399
classic have you been up how many years

78
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,439
since you smoked a joint

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,039
um okay well i usually say about 20 but

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,039
then there's always people i try you

81
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,120
light a joint it's like okay yes someone

82
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,799
did come up to me like four years ago

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
with the karma cup and they had a

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
canadar

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
and they were like oh would you mind you

86
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,000
know lighting this it was like an honor

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
thing right it was it was mostly it was

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
tons of hash it was like 80 hash but

89
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,359
then it was wrapped in some leaves and

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,280
there might have been some weeds so i

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
said you know what sure i'll light it

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,479
for you i lit it passed it on didn't

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,319
really smoke it you know and that was

94
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,158
true and now people are like you smoked

95
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,000
joy and i saw you i was like well i lit

96
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,120
the can of garbage the last time i

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,799
smoked a joint for sure was 20 years ago

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,878
we tricked people on the last one too

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
with that hashtag it looked totally like

100
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,639
a choice i love it too because some guy

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
from humboldt was like that's not a

102
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,878
unique one-hitter we've been smoking out

103
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,199
of those for 20 years yeah but not like

104
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,280
paper ones yeah they're the glass ones

105
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,958
exactly the glass and the ceramic and

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,158
they conduct heat and they're just very

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
different they're not going to be as

108
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,560
convenient and ease of use as you know

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,479
being able to pick up and it's not like

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,719
the problem is the glass ones

111
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,039
unfortunately because of like other

112
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,799
drugs that made it they look bad right

113
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,079
you pull out a glass pipe like that

114
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
people are thinking you're not smoking

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
cannabis right so i like those paper

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,839
ones it looks more like a cigarette it's

117
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,399
almost like when i'm drinking my water

118
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,839
and everyone thinks i'm drinking vodka

119
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
we were talking about that off camera

120
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,198
before but i'm sure you guys have seen

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,879
my memo bottles these very flat bottles

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
this is the one that looks the least

123
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,879
like an alcohol container yet it still

124
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,198
does have a little bit what kind of

125
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,639
vodka you got there okay it's like i got

126
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
the h2o

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,879
version

128
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
berry flavor

129
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,399
you've got the dabber or did you put

130
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,319
that away already

131
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,159

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
watching the cooking with merlin's

140
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,560
merlin series

141
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,959
uh he's close we're good friends it's

142
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,199
kind of easy and so we're gonna try and

143
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,959
keep pumping these out on the weekly on

144
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,400
the sundays and just

145
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,879
i know a few of you have said oh it

146
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,478
would be great if he used measuring cups

147
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,918
well it's not how we do you have to

148
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,839
follow the recipe you just gotta throw

149
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,839
stuff in maybe what we could do is add

150
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,359
the recipes at the end of it there you

151
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,279
go exactly

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,879
yeah i like the idea you know but i do

153
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,918
love the fact that you don't measure

154
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,918
things

155
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,079

the other day

close to so when i'm in germany you can

209
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,560
imagine i'm eating a fair amount of

210
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,079
casts or kids you got nothing else to

211
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
eat

212
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,159

10 20 trips to germany

219

i'm probably right along at 10 to 20 as

220
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,280
well i started going to dortmund

221
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,519
originally in the late 90s

222
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,679
for the can of business

223
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,279
and i would go to that quite a bit

224
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,680
and then i became really good friends

225
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,079
with martin from roar

226
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,160
and he's in franken paul

227
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,918
really like little like one of those

228
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
neighborhoods where you really like this

229
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,959
is germany totally you're not in a big

230
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,959
city

231
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,279
all the streets are like without gps

232
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,120
forget about it forget about it you

233
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,198
could get locked into dead ends like

234
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,038
every it's like a maze no it is and it's

235
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
because it's so old too right it used to

236
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,038
be horse carriage

237
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,959
definitely not designed

238
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:19,120
for like mercedes 500 sls no so my my

239
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,038
cousin actually lives in uh in this

240
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
little town called bibarak which is your

241
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,959
classic tiny little german town oh yeah

242
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,520
they've been he's been in the packaging

243
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,318
business for i don't know 30 years they

244
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,240
do most of the food packaging across

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
across europe and they just recently it

246
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
was a super conservative and i asked my

247
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,080
mom about cannabis packaging since

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,080
that's what we do pretty much all day is

249
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
i make sure that i can bring products

250
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
like yours to the market as cheap as

251
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,799
possible with good packaging right so i

252
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
don't know if we've mentioned it before

253
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,519
but

254
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,479
merlin works with canmart formerly

255
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,240
namaste technologies yeah

256
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
he's kind of been a

257
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,000
i've been involved since he kind of went

258
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,320
over there and he's grown himself into a

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,200
nice strong position and in fact

260
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,040
you know my company embark and kanmar

261
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,879
have recently

262
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,559
kind of created a little synergy and

263
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,278
we'll we'll tell you more about that in

264
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,879
the future as we announce yeah so it's

265
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,439
really fun and we get to work together

266
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,360
as well so it's even even more fun right

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,720
it's awesome dude get some good hash

268
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
products that you know that's what's

269
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
really lacking in the canadian market

270
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
right now i think is like good products

271
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,278
people don't understand what good

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,879
products is

273
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,639
they're just listening to what other

274
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,799
people are saying well and let's get

275
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,759
into the real conversation because

276
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,039
you know we know the very people who are

277
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,958
you know basically mocking and

278
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,120
belittling the canadian regulatory

279
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,439
framework and i i can understand where

280
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
they're coming from it's it's it's

281
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
difficult and it's it gets to me

282
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,600
sometimes but

283
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,360
trying to bring great products to market

284
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
in a regulated

285
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
environment it's not the same

286
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,719
it's not the same

287
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
and so it's almost like we're rewinding

288
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,278
and starting back over with like okay

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,120
now all of these new people who have

290
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,439
you know and i think the thing about

291
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
cannabis is that it was so

292
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,000
removed from everything for so long and

293
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
now that group of people

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
as much as they may have thought they

295
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,440
wanted it open for everyone i think

296
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
they're having a hard time with it yeah

297
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
and it's like oh who the [ __ ] is this

298
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,480
guy who does he think he is he's like

299
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,199
he's everyone dude like we wanted

300
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,639
cannabis to be for everyone not locked

301
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,879
in well that's what i think about this

302
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,120
micro program is gate is but the problem

303
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,360
is is that those very regulations we

304
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,039
talk about are holding back these micros

305
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
if you look at anyone's business plan

306
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,879
this do a micro based on the square

307
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,959
footage and the amount of investment

308
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,559
especially here in bc you're looking at

309
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,399
a four to five year runway before you

310
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,078
start seeing a penny that you have to

311
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
have a complete passion and have bank in

312
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,399
the

313
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
in the pocket yeah they put the right

314
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,639
steps in place i think with farmgate and

315
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,559
all of that but what they're missing is

316
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,919
that the regulations for these small

317
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,078
guys just don't make sense they don't

318
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,439
have to bankroll to lose the money to do

319
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,039
it and that's what we need to be honest

320
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
they don't make much sense for even some

321
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,759
of the

322
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,760
medium and bigger players yeah like the

323
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,759
regulations

324
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,838
it's not just crushing small companies

325
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,079
and i get that yeah like let's protect

326
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,440
the most vulnerable players but there's

327
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,679
a lot of people in the middle of the

328
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,760
board who really need protecting too

329
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,000
yeah like they're just as likely to get

330
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,838
eaten but the reason that i say that the

331
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,600
small that fight for the small guys is

332
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,959
because the big guys have such big rooms

333
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,278
that they can't show enough love to

334
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,719
their cannabis and grow good product and

335
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,958
for the products that you and me want to

336
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,800
see in market it takes the smaller guy

337
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,399
that's this is his life if he doesn't

338
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,159
have this crop come through as nice as

339
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,759
possible yeah he's not going to be able

340
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,078
to keep surviving but they they can't be

341
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,519
growing bad cannabis on purpose you know

342
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,679
that they're not so that's what i'm

343
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,839
saying and they have people like

344
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,519
there are people like that know how to

345
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
grow cannabis that are involved with

346
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,078
these companies like these companies

347
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,800
have you know like i mean dna was

348
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,638
involved with canopy why can't canopy

349
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:56,958
because growing

350
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,959
herb that good on that

351
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
it's a big difference between 20 lights

352
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,639
and 400.

353
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,519
it probably should have been grown

354
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,959
pragmatically small like everyone starts

355
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
out as a micro

356
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,000
and the ones that gain milestones and

357
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,879
success can apply and become maybe

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,799
bigger

359
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,720
i don't pretend to know the the cure for

360
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,799
it i think no matter what you suggest

361
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,000
someone would have a big [ __ ] problem

362
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,439
with it

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,078
like they always do and so i just try to

364
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,160
navigate it the best that i can from a

365
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,399
hashmaker's perspective

366
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,719
it's really difficult good and good it's

367
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,879
got to be the recipe for you to ask yeah

368
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,560
right of course but trying to find great

369
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,039
material i'll be i'll be honest some of

370
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,638
the first material we found

371
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,719
like it was maybe our second or third

372
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,879
batch it was tropicana cookies and that

373
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,240
[ __ ] was like cookies it came back like

374
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,159
81

375
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,320
wow like one of the microns we tested

376
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,000
all the microns the 25 micron that

377
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
people are like oh that's just food

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,078
grade throw it away but the question is

379
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,240
70 did the supplier have to have another

380
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,039
batch for you the next time that wasn't

381
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,600
really the question no no not in this

382
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,480
instance and so it was regulations that

383
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,759
have has kept and still

384
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,159
is keeping

385
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,360
that hash from market and it's not ours

386
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:16,000
we uh we told it yeah but it's

387
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,278
unbelievable it's been over a year and

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,278
it's still not released no

389
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,600
i no say it's at least a five-star

390
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,200
bubble oh man i remember seeing pictures

391
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
it was purple on the

392
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,879
picture that you took it was a little

393
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,720
bit chop cookies is definitely in my

394
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,559
like i love cushions but if i want to

395
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,879
taste something fruity i love chocolate

396
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,599
stuff yeah really nice tastes like

397
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,360
smoking oranges it's true yeah it's just

398
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,480
lovely and in the concentrates it's even

399
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,639
it's like the best yeah that's true yeah

400
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,039
i love that calio you know the first

401
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,680
real orange flavored cannabis for me was

402
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:53,278
calio and when i saw calio

403
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:56,958
everything since tangerine and the vel

404
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,799
what any orangey flavor yeah it reminds

405
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,439
me it always is first

406
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,679
it's got that calio in it yeah

407
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
those were a big fluffy orange yeah that

408
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,078
was good stuff yeah really nice and the

409
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,559
nicest girl i've ever been in in my life

410
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,799
it belonged to shanti baba uh scott

411
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,799
blakey and it was in switzerland in

412
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,740
belzona and it probably would have been

413
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,919
like 2000 or 2001.

414
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,399
[Music]

415
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,399
and i i drove down to bellenzono with

416
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,480
bushy older grower

417
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,360
and gypsy nirvana

418
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,560
and we drove down to bellenzona and we

419
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,519
met

420
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,278
shanti baba and he walked us through a

421
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,240
greenhouse

422
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:39,679
of six foot tall

423
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,198
one or two days away from finishing

424
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,679
monsters

425
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,198
for like an acre like it was a huge

426
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,519
greenhouse or a half an acre i don't

427
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,399
know it was really big for real

428
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
um nicest smell that i never smelled and

429
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,799
it was neat that i got to share that

430
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,279
with a bushy older grower and gypsy

431
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,639
nirvana wow that's a great story

432
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:03,519
oh dude and i asked him i said

433
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,759
how did you do this like how

434
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,759
who's growing this and he said

435
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,159
rose farmers i don't hire smokers he's

436
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,160
like i don't hire people

437
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,240
from the cannabis it's

438
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,278
rose farmers rose farmers he's like they

439
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,480
are like

440
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,720
disciplined

441
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,360
meticulous aware

442
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,120
and it was their first crop of cannabis

443
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,680
and he said the only difference

444
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,759
was instead of getting poked

445
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,159
don't get the resin in your eyes that's

446
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,079
the only real thing they had to consider

447
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,078
after that it was just like botany learn

448
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,399
about the plant i mean i think what

449
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,758
happened to a licensed producer world is

450
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,360
that it was

451
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
how many grams can you produce per

452
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,519
square foot and that was your evaluation

453
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,278
in the public markets and it just ruined

454
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,679
everything instead of how much quality

455
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,360
can you pull out a square foot right

456
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,758
instead of these guys what did they say

457
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,680
i saw an article the other day 18 of

458
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,000
total cannabis grown since legalization

459
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,919
has been sold like that means there's a

460
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,559
ridiculous amount of crap that's being

461
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,639
written down destroyed or used for god

462
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,679
knows what oh my god those horrible

463
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,839
tasting pre-rolls that some people face

464
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,799
there should be a a

465
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,160
like a

466
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,799
you know

467
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,439
a facility that's like

468
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,278
you know not for profit but that takes

469
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
all of that

470
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,679
and just processes it into cannabinoids

471
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,199
as just

472
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,239
ingredient

473
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,958
and then not affect the market but just

474
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,039
like allow whoever has the best overview

475
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,919
probably the government health canada to

476
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,360
figure out where this should go but not

477
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,198
ever allow it to be destroyed because

478
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
it's too high of a value i think i think

479
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,719
what happens is for companies it

480
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,639
probably ends up being cheaper to

481
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,199
destroy it than right down to the loss

482
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,198
of profit

483
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,838
unfortunately

484
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,399
but you should be able to like instead

485
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,039
of destroying you should be able to

486
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,120
choose to donate where it gets donated

487
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,838
it would be so good

488
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
that's a good change like wouldn't it be

489
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,959
amazing and then just be like i don't

490
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,839
know like if you're worried like make it

491
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,240
free

492
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,519
to people who don't have access to it at

493
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,838
all like homeless put it for the

494
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,679
medicine the most vulnerable yeah just

495
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,639
make it like if you don't want to profit

496
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
off of it

497
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
and you're making companies destruction

498
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,759
should go to health canada labs to make

499
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:25,599
it permanent free medicine for the world

500
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,599
let someone benefit from god

501
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,038
imagine

502
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,119
all right we went a little bit deep if

503
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,960
we did and that's okay we were talking

504
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,439
about maybe doing this

505
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,600
um i think it's time to make some uh

506
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,038
goosebumps

507
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,359
let's do it

508
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,919
kitchen bound all right

509
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,678
all right so serious so uh we should

510
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,759
introduce our next friend

511
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,759
mike's here hey what's up dude

512
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,439
all right so i think the first step is

513
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,400
to add

514
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,038
onions to a hot pan

515
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,720
[Music]

516
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,640
which is not hot

517
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,079
really

518
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,679
yeah

519
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,678
it looks pretty red underneath yeah

520
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,320
and then we're gonna have to caramelize

521
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,319
these

522
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,469
[Music]

523
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,038
yeah there's uh we're going to go

524
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,640
through that cheese for sure because

525
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:29,599
there's like four or five different ones

526
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,600
get a little saltine

527
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,919
man don't sweat the onions bro

528
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,558
this guy's always sweating the onions at

529
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,559
least they're white

530
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,038
yeah they deserve it they do

531
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,639
soon to be

532
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:58,639
caramelized and delicious

533
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,519
all right here's our cheese collection

534
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,400
we got fontina

535
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,200
uh

536
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,150
carlsberg aged parmesan

537
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:16,319
truffle gouda

538
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:19,038
[Music]

539
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:22,480
just some cheese huh

540
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:25,440
when you're lazy you use the machine

541
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,000
yeah last week we were here with patty

542
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
who's who's cooking with us okay

543
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,880
at once turning into a cooking channel

544
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,279
yeah all the cheeses at once

545
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,280
well as much as we can fit i like it

546
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,839
makes it easier faster on high

547
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,558
damn just like that

548
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,400
this [ __ ] doesn't really mess

549
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,918
around

550
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,720
it's just like

551
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,799
no fair warning or nothing

552
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,480
just like fully homogenized five

553
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,400
different cheeses

554
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,440
that's the way to do it

555
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
we'll go for the pasta next

556
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,279
so

557
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,960
two cups of flour

558
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,399
you recognize you can stir this now you

559
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,279
want to let them just sweat a little a

560
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,440
little bit more stir in the second one

561
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,879
if you don't mind it'll be great

562
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,880
crack four eggs in this thing

563
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,240
is that first you know especially with a

564
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,389
cast iron that first like caramelization

565
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,200
that gets made on the pan

566
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,440
[Music]

567
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,440
and um

568
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,000
that's what you let it say yeah exactly

569
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,000
so four eggs in

570
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,960
here real quick

571
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,990
we're going to add in a half a cup of

572
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,359
milk

573
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,079
[Music]

574
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,399
you could use a vegetable based milk too

575
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,480
or if you wanted to do this i don't know

576
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,159
you can maybe use linseed

577
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
you didn't see the water that replaced

578
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,159
the egg have you ever tried that no it's

579
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,159
like a vegan egg oh okay

580
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,879
that's nice and stirred up

581
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,740
put it into the two cups make a little

582
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,400
well in there

583
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,200
[Music]

584
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,720
just a little well

585
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,720
and then we can start mixing this

586
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,960
and

587
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,960
made pasta right

588
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,679
yeah these are really cool it's really

589
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,600
different from most pastas it's like a

590
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,120
special german pass so these they're

591
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,319
super light and airy and fluffy you'll

592
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,759
see it's a

593
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,038
special machine

594
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,038
you can get to make it

595
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:01,359
interesting so now i'm intrigued i think

596
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,759
we'll add in here now a little bit of

597
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,759
salt

598
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,599
[Music]

599
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,959
the real secret to this pasta to get a

600
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,839
lot of flavor

601
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
is nutmeg

602
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,100
that's the touch right there

603
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,759
exactly what i said

604
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:23,279
[Music]

605
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,279
just a couple little scrapes in

606
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,798
there pretty yummy

607
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,880
a little nutmeg

608
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,639
you want this dough to be a little bit

609
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,159
runny actually so if it's not runny

610
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,038
enough would you mind grabbing me some

611
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,039
milk out of the fridge

612
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
it should be in the door

613
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,960
right here

614
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,600
perfect thank you just add like a little

615
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,279
another dash of milk

616
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,439
get it a little

617
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,279
moisture just a dash

618
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
because you'll see when it has to go

619
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,879
through the pasta machine you almost

620
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,440
want it like a wet

621
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,720
wet dough gotcha i feel like that's a

622
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,759
very old statement a dash

623
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,600
like how long have people been saying

624
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,679
just a dash

625
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:21,439
it might have been replaced by just a

626
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,240
dab it's the dab that's the 2021 version

627
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,279
we do our dabs before our dashes yeah

628
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,640
that's the order a dash of a dab

629
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,960
there's a lot of similarities here with

630
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,000
hashmaking actually of you absolutely

631
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,279
just your preparation the sop

632
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,720
you know the awareness and the

633
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,639
cleanliness

634
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,319
i know i do feel that as well the pasta

635
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
is done and mixed

636
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,119
we're just gonna let that rest for like

637
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,599
15 minutes 10-15 minutes awesome

638
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:51,558
add some butter in there ooh

639
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,558
butter makes everything more delicious

640
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,558
these onions are a big part of it you

641
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,880
don't want to go too hot and you want to

642
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,879
get them all nice and

643
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,880
caramelized

644
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,319
i just like the sound and the look of

645
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,359
things cooking

646
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:14,079
the asmr aspect of it

647
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,839
the asmr is picking up didn't burger

648
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:20,079
king just do one for the sizzle with

649
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,759
asmr oh i'm sure i feel like they've

650
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,399
done they started doing that a long time

651
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,000
like i i can't i haven't had cable since

652
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,120
98.

653
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,759
they were definitely doing it in

654
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,239
commercials before that

655
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,759
this you know just those sounds you want

656
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,440
to know what one of the greatest sounds

657
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,240
would be is the damage you should do an

658
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,519
asmr of just the damage totally the

659
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,640
sucking of the

660
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,918
bomb yep we'll turn our heat on for this

661
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,840
as well

662
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,520
and this is the contraption believe it

663
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,918
or not this is what we're making pasta

664
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,400
with yeah exactly it's pretty simple

665
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,400
interesting

666
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,678
um

667
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,558
let's try some mushrooms to put on top

668
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,440
of this oh i like that idea

669
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,918
want to fry some mushrooms bricks then

670
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,120
it's probably smelling my dog

671
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,120
get this pan done

672
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,360
your mushroom cooking

673
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,079
butter

674
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,439
what's that your mushroom cooking butter

675
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,918
got a cookie with butter and then you

676
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,759
can put a little grapeseed oil on it

677
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,759
and it goes for a higher heat

678
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,599
so patty was saying oh no it was shawn

679
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,038
my friend sean who was saying um you'll

680
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,959
get a lot more mushroom flavor if you

681
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:33,119
don't uh fry it with uh garlic

682
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,679
the garlic overpowers the mushroom

683
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,239
flavor like the mushrooms

684
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,240
but garlic is so good i don't know i

685
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,839
think the mix of them both is good oh

686
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,839
i'll take it that way that's for sure

687
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,400
i guess it's a neat way to say if you

688
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,000
wanted to prepare a dish to have a more

689
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,278
earthy

690
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,038
fungus based flavor yeah you could you

691
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,400
could do it like that you know what

692
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,400
actually we're going to cancel this

693
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,000
brown right here oh yeah and we're going

694
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,919
to cook the mushrooms in this pan to get

695
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,519
the flavor of the onions in there as he

696
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,320
spoke like that i think that's a great

697
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,319
idea perfect

698
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,159
so that's the garlic yeah a little bit

699
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,159
of extra garlic in there

700
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,199
with the butter the onion smells so good

701
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,079
did you walked into it bro he had me at

702
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,079
gruyere

703
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,319
yeah

704
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,159
the truffle gouda is the one that smells

705
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,278
the strongest smell the smell this is

706
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,320
cheese it smells so good

707
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,960
you can smell the truffle right away

708
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,960
that's awesome

709
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,679
we got the water going there we're gonna

710
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,480
want to put some salt in water too

711
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,360
salt that [ __ ] like the sea

712
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,120
shell

713
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,119
start that [ __ ] like to see huh

714
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,839
these come along

715
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,880
pretty good

716
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,038
ready

717
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,039
onions are pretty much ready

718
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,480
they look great

719
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:03,919
i'm gonna put them in the bowl yeah

720
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,599
let's just put them off to the side for

721
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,960
right now while we cook the noodles

722
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,879
because you want everything hot at once

723
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,000
so it melts all the cheese

724
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
ah yes of course

725
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
and

726
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,798
like you were saying with all the flavor

727
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,320
that we have left in this pan from the

728
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,960
onions

729
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,038
we'll cook our chanterelles

730
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,759
okay a little bit of onion in there get

731
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:25,839
them

732
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,038
fried up a bit so

733
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,720
it just went in

734
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,480
yes sir

735
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,480

736
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,679
i'd love to see the chanterelles

737
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,840
look at that one yeah this is a this is

738
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,519
a yellow i think i don't know it's not

739
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,000
no that's a yellow

740
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,398
a giant yellow yeah it could be a very

741
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,398
small gold

742
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,798
so

743
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,798
you don't want them to move too much

744
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,578
oh that's the sound

745
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,578
[Music]

746
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,798
[Music]

747
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,799

748
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,798
side just because they're so amazing

749

whiskey this time yeah

751
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,558
instead of gin

752
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,349
instead of gin we will do whiskey

753
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,519
um

754
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:29,519

these look great man

789
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:06,398
you want them to spread out again evenly

790
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,799
yeah that'd be perfect

791
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,839
a little dressing up of the salad a

792
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,839
little olive oil

793
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,480
[Music]

794
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,360
olive oil

795
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,360
some white balsamic

796
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,360
some classic balsamic

797
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,839
and then the secret to every canadians

798
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:38,158
oh yes pantry is maple syrup right oh

799
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,158
yeah

800
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:45,479
who doesn't want maple syrup

801
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,480
we had some of sean's uh

802
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,558
a little bit of

803
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,360
and salt

804
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,960
a bunch of maple syrup is good in there

805
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,959
it really cuts the acid right

806
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,678
i don't like when it's too

807
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,480
too acidic a salad dressing but a bunch

808
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,720
of maple syrup or any really sugar will

809
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,679
make it a lot softer it balances the

810
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
acid

811
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,200
and then

812
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,600
a little bit of dijon mustard or a nice

813
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,880
amount as an emulsifier

814
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,879
and that'll be our salad dressing

815
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,600
so that's on the side let's start our

816
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,600
mushrooms

817
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,839
this is the whiskey portion now they're

818
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,599
nice and fried

819
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,759
so we'll put a little bit of that in

820
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:47,480
there a little bit of tamari

821
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,480
for the saltiness

822
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,159
you can see there's a whole bunch of

823
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,919
flavor left on the bottom of that pan

824
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,720
from the onions

825
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,399
from

826
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,399
from this and smell that tamari right

827
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,678
[Music]

828
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,158
let it boil a sec

829
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,159
then go

830
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,760
puts a nice little crisp on them

831
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,278
not for the paint for the faint of heart

832
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,200
yeah be careful

833
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,200
do it a few times before you know it's

834
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,360
very nice do it with a high ceiling if

835
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,798
you're gonna do it anywhere right

836
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,359
not condoning

837
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,319
that was a one time one try

838
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,319
you know

839
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,798
and now that puts a nice caramelization

840
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,439
on these things and delicious yeah they

841
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,440
look beautiful

842
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,000
that now our water is boiling

843
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,000
making pasta

844
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,480
so one last spin let's see the

845
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,240
consistency in here that is nice and

846
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,599
runny

847
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,759
you want to make sure that there's no

848
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,918
lumps and that your pack the gluten is

849
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,000
really binded you can see now that the

850
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,759
gluten's binded together and that's why

851
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,679
you want to wait and let it rest did you

852
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,079
put extra gluten in there for me extra

853
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,120
gluten just for you my friend thanks all

854
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,240
right let's

855
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,239
switch places here

856
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:05,358
[Music]

857
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,959
you're just gonna

858
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,278
scoop a bunch in there so now we slap

859
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,480
this on top of here so that's nice and

860
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,319
straight

861
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,038
now this is where it gets kind of crazy

862
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,879
because it's boiling water and the pasta

863
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,839
is cooking while you're putting it in

864
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,600
but we'll do our best on this

865
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,558
oh my goodness

866
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,558
manual madness

867
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,719
as you can see it's very very sticky

868
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,480
it looks very sticky

869
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,600
now you kind of want to just get that in

870
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,440
there

871
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,839
would you mind sliding those mushrooms

872
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,840
off uh slide it off the heat slide

873
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,159
and then as we get in there this is

874
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,239
where you want to start sliding this

875
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,000
thing back and forth and if you can see

876
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,640
in the pot look at those nice noodles

877
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,038
being made filled with air

878
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,640
so they're super fluffy

879
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,200
jesus

880
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,840
yeah and then now we load in some more

881
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,840
that's crazy

882
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,559
this is a trip dude

883
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,358
and make while i'm doing this would you

884
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,119
be able to uh

885
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,559
grab this and put those mushrooms in

886
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,200
there so we don't overcook them though

887
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,960
so they go in and then they like form

888
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,799
with like bubbles in them so they're all

889
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,960
fluffy yeah

890
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,720
so they're hollow on the inside like i'm

891
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,559
like a macaroni a little bit almost

892
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,000
right wow

893
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,759
it's almost like they're hollow it's

894
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,199
like they're very very fluffy because

895
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,200
it's an egg noodle right yeah yeah

896
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,878
and then that last bit of dough always

897
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,119
gives you a hard time

898
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,078
to do the best you can get it all off

899
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,480
there

900
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,839
not at the expense of wasting your other

901
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,320
noodles

902
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,358
because you don't want them overcooked

903
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,119
okay

904
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,199
but look how beautiful those things are

905
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,720
yeah those are some nice little

906
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,799
they're actually really long this time

907
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,759
they're usually uh shorter than this i

908
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,440
did a

909
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,240
we did a stellar job here and they're

910
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,599
like actual pasta noodles

911
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,719
usually they come out a little bit

912
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,680
shorter

913
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:25,118
i appreciate the wii merlin but we did

914
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,118
it man i don't know what i did

915
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,639
you like uh maestro that [ __ ]

916
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,879
it was like some mastery and i was like

917
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,639
this is jean-luc

918
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,240
french kitchen

919
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,759
all right those are pretty much cooked

920
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,799
because noodles don't take long

921
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,800
especially fresh ones

922
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,869
strainer here

923
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,869
[Music]

924
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,039
here we go

925
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,880
and now i know a lot of people

926
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,200
like to run it with cold water to kind

927
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,440
of get those starches out but you want

928
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,039
to keep as much heat as possible because

929
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,880
that's going to be expense

930
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,559
essential to make it

931
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,800
melt all your cheeses

932
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,599
next stage here

933
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,720
that was quick too

934
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,359
yeah

935
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:28,239
super easy pasta to make

936
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:31,358
so now we get our nice pot here

937
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:34,639
get our pasta in there

938
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,639
get our onions in there

939
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,239
with all that butter and onion

940
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,839
deliciousness

941
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,679
this is gonna be the best mac and cheese

942
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,199
you guys have ever had yeah i was coming

943
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,679
over for mac and cheese i heard you know

944
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,679
this happened

945
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,720
so we're gonna mix in those onions get

946
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,879
all that flavor and butter distributed

947
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,879
in there

948
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,719
now it's some delicious oniony noodles

949
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:06,199
now we start with the cheese

950
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,199
get it in there

951
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,760
can smell right away the terps of those

952
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,680
cheeses coming off especially that

953
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,400
truffle cheese cheese

954
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,399
cheese terps

955
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,118
it's probably the first terps when

956
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:23,679
people started fermenting stuff

957
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,200
oh man

958
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,279
oh yeah

959
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,159
that's insane that little more cheesy

960
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,760
but you gotta get that cheesy

961
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,239
over the top

962
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,400
over the top

963
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,559
let's put another cup of this in but

964
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,320
which one was that last one mozzarella

965
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,480
is just to have the stringy i think that

966
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,480
we're gonna should we mix that in ah you

967
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,480
know what i think so i think the way you

968
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,920
just did that with everything was like

969
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,920
let's get this let's make this next

970
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,440
level special for the bubble for bubble

971
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,240
man's world

972
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,000
it's a mushroom special

973
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,919
mushroom special just for bubble man's

974
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
world food that you hand-picked the

975
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,720
mushrooms for

976
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,280
us and we hand-made the noodles for

977
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,519
this one's all done special

978
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,599
look at the cheesy goodness in there

979
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,119
just smell you can see you can hear it

980
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,160
oh yeah yeah look at it it could just

981
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,200
get like

982
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,440
goopy

983
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,279
and now it's gonna melt this is the key

984
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,000
why you wanted to keep the heat straight

985
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,680
out is because this next few minutes

986
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,358
turns it into a sauce kind of then we

987
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:27,838
want to hit it up

988
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,838
a bunch of pepper peppers delicious

989
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,719
we're gonna have our own food network

990
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,920
marcus

991
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,919
cooking with merlin yeah

992
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,279
whole bunch of water

993
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,800
damn

994
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,040
a bunch of salt

995
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,280
oh yeah

996
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,079
we're gonna go gluttonous right

997
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,000
i think we're well on our way maybe

998
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,680
we've passed gluttonous like three

999
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,159
milestones back

1000
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,480
we don't have string half a pound occur

1001
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,920
uh half a pound of cheese back we passed

1002
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,079
uh

1003
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,599
that there we go

1004
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,200
and then we're gonna do some of this

1005
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,599

you'd expect them to be a little bit

1045
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,440
more subdued but

1046
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:46,399
the texture of the mushroom is nice it's
