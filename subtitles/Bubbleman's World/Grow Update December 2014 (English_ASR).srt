00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,480
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,160
and welcome to my little tent uh you

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,118
guys may have forgotten but I do still

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,759
have a grow although uh my mother's

6
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,558
definitely took a major hit when I went

7
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,439
away for almost a month there um they're

8
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,799
they're they're still alive I've got the

9
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,439
majority of them still going and the

10
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,519
ones that I did lose which was only a

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,399
few of them um I had given them away so

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
many times that there's not even a worry

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,679
of getting them back and in fact already

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,879
John here has given me three new plants

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,640
to go into uh bigger pots today and then

16
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,159
I got d420 K who I gave all the cuts to

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,640
him and his buddy are going to be

18
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,159
cutting me just a couple of each one and

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,558
it's it's helpful that way cuz I'm not

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,280
really in a position to be holding 35 to

21
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,000
40 moms I was able to give them away to

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,719
enough people that they are all secure

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,118
in multiple locations that's what I

24
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,920
consider secure and today I just really

25
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,438
wanted to do a tiny little video with

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,560
you guys on um on I guess some

27
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:19,319
transplants so Johnny B has been so kind

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,359
to bring me back two of my great

29
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,319
Gardener favorites which is the um Barb

30
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,200
Barbara Bud as well is his Afghani which

31
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,000
we now will call the

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,920
gg1 so this is uh it's been worked by

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,680
him uh quite a variety he's crossed it

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,960
here and there and he's changed the

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,680
fenos and whatnot he's done some

36
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,719
breeding with it over the last 10 to 15

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,040
years so he really considers it more of

38
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,438
a gg1 a great Gardener one than just

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,920
your standard Afghani and uh finally

40
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,398
last but not least we've got our old

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,159
favorite the Astro Boy the Apollo 13

42
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,200
male pollen smacked to an Ortega crossed

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,880
with a

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
c99 um I'll tell you it wasn't a mistake

45
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,319
it was an accident making this plant but

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,159
I'm really glad they made it some of the

47
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,519
best things come from accidents wouldn't

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,479
you guys agree so I guess we'll get

49
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,400
right to it we'll bring this guy forward

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,160
oops little Barbara Tipp there if you

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,200
guys caught that I'm not sure kind of

52
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,519
got you off camera here but so really

53
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,719
quite simply put oh he's got multiple

54
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,959
Barb stickers on this one nice can't

55
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,919
make a mistake that way can you so this

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,920
Barb is definitely not the healthiest of

57
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:34,000
the three but it is um um still got a

58
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:37,079
few roots not very many at all wow

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,080
better make sure that

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,158
we got a nice cube of dirt out of there

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,319
that's going to come in handy for the

62
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:53,039
transplant all right pull a little dirt

63
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,878
out of there those was like to be

64
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,598
somewhat meticulous even though really

65
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,840
the easiest way to do this is to be able

66
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,799
to get

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,799
dirty we'll just drop that in there

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,799
and fill her

69
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,040
up kind of break off the sides that of

70
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,480
the of that particular pot that we're

71
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,280
barely holding together and then if you

72
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,639
want you can kind of go around the rest

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,759
of the

74
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:21,598
pot and fill up that Earth that non-ear

75
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,158
I guess that soilless

76
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,719
mixture so that's that one little clone

77
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,639
I usually like to just Pat it down the

78
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,560
tiniest bit and it's also why I leave a

79
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,759
good

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,640
inch uh out of the pot so when you when

81
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,359
I fill them up you can see this one here

82
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,958
has almost an a full inch of space

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,480
between the top and the dirt and I do

84
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,799
that so that when I add that extra

85
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,759
little bit of Earth or soiless I have

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,760
the room to do it I would really love to

87
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,438
get myself going in a more professional

88
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,919
um grow this really is just a a home

89
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,239
sort of unit and I I do it this way to

90
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,839
try and show people that you can grow

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,959
on a small level and still produce

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,799
enough resin for yourself it's hard I'm

93
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,079
not going to lie to produce one gram of

94
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,438
full melt resin for every single day of

95
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,840
your existence 365 gr almost a pound uh

96
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,439
3/4 of a pound of resin per year you

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,720
have 365 days to do it and with a couple

98
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,319
of tents um I'm going to show you how

99
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,240
you can do that so that's really my

100
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,319
whole purpose on sharing my garden is so

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
that you guys can learn some things by

102
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,519
no means do I consider myself a grow

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
expert I'm not really the IDE person to

104
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,000
ask um if your leaves are curling or if

105
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,038
you've got this sort of bug or that sort

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,319
of I've got little tips when it comes to

107
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,319
this but I'm really not an expert I'm

108
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,000
learning all along with the rest of you

109
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,399
guys so uh I always encourage people to

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,839
join a good grow Forum um International

111
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,159
canag graph. comom was pretty good when

112
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,279
I was still around there I'm sure it's

113
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,720
still got some good people there and

114
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,000
it's best to post in a forum like that

115
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,880
and and you get so many people who see

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
it and these people that really just

117
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,478
can't help but share their knowledge

118
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,319
they're the first ones to offer you

119
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,038
great advice and those grow Farms are

120
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,279
the best place to get them so let's see

121
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,599
if we can't pull out a cube of dirt from

122
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,599
this

123
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:20,159
guy all

124
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,159
right put him over there for a

125
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,120
sec all

126
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,478
right bring this guy over this is The

127
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,079
Afghani the

128
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,519
gg1 and I'll tell you the gg1 what it

129
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,478
really reminds me of more than anything

130
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:38,038
is the old school

131
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,599
Romulan now this one's got some just thr

132
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,599
had a nightmare there this one's got

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,039
some Roots sticking out here it's these

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,400
are really freshly rooted so I got to

135
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,839
thank John for that um big root tap rout

136
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,079
coming out there but they haven't quite

137
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,439
um you know really started pushing I

138
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,198
suspect in the next couple of days of

139
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,439
these guys being transplanted we're

140
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,439
going to see a really nice growth spurt

141
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,839
come out of them so

142
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,680
we'll try to just release

143
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,439
that so so much for my idea of keeping

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,240
the grow area clean you guys can't

145
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,199
really see but I spilled a little bit on

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,038
the floor there that's okay we'll get

147
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,319
over it all right so we've got the

148
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,519
Afghani and the Barb transplanted I

149
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,919
thought I was showing you the

150
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,560
transplanting on the watermelon but I

151
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:23,879
guess my video camera turned off when I

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,639
grabbed the camera to show you the

153
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,959
little bit of spillage that I did here

154
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,680
so um the watermelon transplanted

155
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,318
perfectly it is the healthiest of the

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,079
three clones I wish I could have had it

157
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,400
on video cuz I showed you the roots it

158
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,399
actually had a nice formation of roots

159
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,318
uh not so many but definitely a few

160
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,439
where I'm uh definitely confident that

161
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,879
this one's going to stand up and stay

162
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,680
stay tall and stay strong for the

163
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,560
transplant it's possible that I get a

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,360
bit of droop on these guys but uh we'll

165

Afghani and watermelon um they're small

168

169
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,479

171
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,719
size and I'll grow them all together as

172
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,879

8 foot tent downstairs and I've got the

174
