183
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,958
incredible it was the undertone Taste of

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,639
the train wreck that I got on my tongue

185
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,639

187
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,439
Clementine I would say that's a that's a

188
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,399
good combination you know what's going

189
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:05,000
to be nice is when we have it set up so

190
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,559
that the we have our vapor lounges at

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,159
our nightclubs day clubs whatever

192
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,399
smoking areas that that we allowed to do

193
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,039
this like so legally that it's just like

194
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,759
going to a a winery or whatever listen

195
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,519
it'll be when you don't have to bring

196
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,278
can you imagine as a Wine Drinker having

197
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,799
to bring your

198
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,200
glass how absurd that is so it's like

199
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,120
imagine you get to the point where you

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,879
go to your joies and you order your food

201
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,200
but afterwards you order up your mother

202
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,439
ship it's like you know what I want to

203
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,278
hit a Taurus sub n in if you don't mind

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,839
like it would be a cool thing the way

205
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:44,559
these places have money invested in wine

206
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,079
and wi and alcohol

207
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,119
culture get it invested into cannabis

208
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:54,199
culture because we we're a legitimate

209
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,399
economy we're a legitimate Marketplace

210
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,440
man this economy [Â __Â ] would change

211
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,200
everything well look we did it anyway

212
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,000
you know Mothership exists regardless of

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,959
whether what about the places where

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
you're wine you can bring your own

215
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:10,319
bottles of wine yeah and pay corking

216
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,078
fees and pay a corking Fe which I would

217
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
pay to bring my own rosins or my own

218
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,399
turs I would pay that fee but I don't

219

want to have to bring my glass I really

220

248
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,159
have been a little bit too big I thought

249
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,559

250
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:44,078
too I I can do it two Big's better than

251
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,399
two small let's be honest that was

252
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:50,559

00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,278
hit

273
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:57,039
turps that was well usually when we get

274
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:59,879
together we're hitting turps ring or

275
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:03,159
hash and pigging out almost seemed like

276
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,958
a bowl of of of

277
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:09,519
Bud like more than a hash or oil or an

278
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:12,759
extraction it seemed like a full bouquet

279
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,159
of flowers that I just somehow and I

280
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:17,439
can't say that I vaporized it or or

281
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,559
smoked it cuz it doesn't taste like that

282
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
it tastes like I ate it like I just ate

283
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,078
a couple of ounces of

284
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,159
Bud we the [Â __Â ] stuck in my teeth but so

285
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:31,559
I can see it dare we uh finish it off

286
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,159
off with a lavender stunk and an OG of

287
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,958
course I mean we might as well I'm not

288
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,838
going to hit this one as large as I did

289
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,599
the last one I me cuz I just don't think

290
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,920
it's necessary you know the one thing

291
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,399
the one thing I'll say it's always fun

292
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,799
to hit big rips but I will say that

293
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,000
while filming and trying to make each

294
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:53,479
scene happen especially with TP dips I'm

295

298
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,519

turps oh yeah that lavender skunk is

316
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,120
very unique it reminds me of a bud I

317
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,560
can't remember remember the name of but

318
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,679
I absolutely grew it no I know I did too

319
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:10,439
that's what it reminds me of just that

320
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:12,399
it's so trippy Bud that we were touched

321
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,399
that that that history of our history

322
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,159
was you know it's still there in the

323
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,879
memory of the smell and whatnot but too

324
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,919
bad we didn't have the gc's and we

325
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,240
weren't testing for the turpine profiles

326
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,000

00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:22,318
combination of two or three common ones

359

00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:56,759
it's the newest one that I just loaded

490
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,720
up I mean you've already hit um the Jack

491
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,879
Frost the lavender and the Clementine

492
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,679
and

493
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,919
stardog is the last one I didn't have

494
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,519
another Dabber to fill this one up so

495
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,559
we'll have another we'll have to find

496
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,480
one more clean Dabber at one point but

497
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,079
uh I do have one

498
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,880
on in the meantime let's get you star

499
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:22,399
dog up oh my

500

gosh perfect thank you so much there's a

501
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,440
little rip for

502
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:29,879
you this Tangi and then our last one is

503
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,558
Tangi so how's that for a nice little

504
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,400
end

505
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:35,399
flavor can't go wrong with

506
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,480
that all right Tangi

507
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:56,119
up they can balce those little

508
00:23:52,319 --> 00:24:00,439
caps keep that right

509
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:00,439
there how's that

510
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:11,840
star

511
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:14,919
hog it's nice subtle yeah it's not a not

512
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:17,599
as a citrusy flavory it's a it's coming

513
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:20,240
in late yeah but it's

514
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,879
cushy it's got some deep tones I can

515
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,120
smell it I'm about to hit it right now

516
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,399
actually you know what that

517
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:31,479
cushy earthy dirty but like good dirt

518
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:34,479
taste yeah that's what smell stank

519
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,120
[Â __Â ] earthy that's what I taste now

520
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,399
it reminded me when I opened it a little

521
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,839
bit of the Long Valley Kush in the sense

522
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:45,918
of how just

523
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:48,519
utterly deep it is in those

524
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:52,559
tones so let me try a little star dog

525
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:55,918
with a little rosin rip because why not

526
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,918
[Â __Â ] yeah

527
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,799
[Â __Â ] good smoking good smoking this

528
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,480
stuff yeah there it

529
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,839
is almost no taste on the exhale on my

530
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,839
second

531
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:25,719
breath get that earthy

532
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,038
gness yeah it's quite different quite

533
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,038
different I I think if I did an evening

534
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,480
for people of

535
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,960
tpin it would be important to start off

536
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,240
with the subtler ones earlier yeah and

537
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,679
hit with the really powerful dessert

538
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,359
ones I mean I guess it's why we don't

539
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,440
eat the chocolate lava cake for the

540
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:49,719
entree or for the appetizer well I'd

541
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,278
like to ask the world why why not why

542
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,960
not dessert first well we just expl we

543
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,880
just explained exactly why with the

544
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,720
tpping metaphor which is that if you

545
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,600
blow your senses with Jack Frost Tangi

546
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Clementine lavender skunk and then you

547
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:10,719
go and hit subtle ones you're like [Â __Â ]

548
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,679
I it just wasn't quite as like mhm I

549
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,960
think that it's I think that we would

550
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:18,120
have gotten more flavor from them prior

551
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,679
to say although that star dog is strong

552
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:24,038
in my mouth right now like very strong

553
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:28,960
and that rosin we were hitting is sfog

554
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:31,960
Hash Rosen oh FR OG yeah kind of a Fran

555
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,399
ogre good mixture with the star dog but

556
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,159
uh what do you say to Tangi my friend

557
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:39,319
well I say let's [Â __Â ] do her should

558
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,720
we Tangi up and Tang up I love breakfast

559
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:45,278
for dinner I do breakfast for dinner a

560
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,679

562
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,720
much I honestly for breakfast I don't I

563
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,558
it's happened a few times well maybe

564
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,159
maybe left over Chinese food that's

565
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,918
exactly fried up heat it up for

566

567
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,038

568
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,399
breakfasty it's always sort of

569
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:08,919
breakfasty I love breakfast for dinner

570
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:11,038
breakfast for dinner yes I used to love

571
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,600
this bacon gravy my buddy's mom used to

572
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:17,000
make break bacon gravy and pancakes for

573
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:20,038
dinner interesting was one of my faves

574
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,759
that's a good one yeah it was

575
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,759
good all right let's get this Tangi in

576
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:32,240
it want to try this other rosin this

577
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:34,879
Ultra rosin 25 micron stuff yeah also

578
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,720
very nice gold color to it it looks very

579
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,720
golden very golden

580
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:48,119
color it's pretty I think it'll dab

581
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:52,038
nicely with a little turn and that's 25

582
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:54,839
micron bubble hash yeah Rosen pressed

583
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:57,879
into that

584
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:00,079
right it's good now is now we were

585
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,159
talking talking earlier and about the

586
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,599
kushes and all the different resin size

587
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,360
heads and all that sort of stuff and

588
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,759
what were the best and what are the

589
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:10,678
worst and you know but really there is

590
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,798
no best or worst no it just depends on

591
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,480
the strain and it depends on the person

592
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,158
and what they like yeah cuz some people

593
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,319
I mean like with anything right some

594
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,799
people want their steak well done and

595
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,639
some people want their steak medium rare

596
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:27,038
they're very different I don't eat steak

597
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,679
period but I know the people that do are

598
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,278
very pissed off when it doesn't come the

599
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,640
way they want it so let's just say

600
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,640
people are

601
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,640
particular

602
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:45,319
no so that was the

603
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:45,319
Tangi tped up on the MK Ultra hash

604
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,440
rosin very

605
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:54,839
nice very nice I'm going to dessert down

606
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,679
too that uh little dessert that makes

607
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,959
you just close your eyes I noticed you

608
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,200
did that I

609
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,720
think just wow I really like that those

610
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,480
ones that do that to me that close my

611
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,319
eyes sure now it's beautiful what I was

612
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,839
getting at with the the different Micron

613
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,398
sizes would it be more sativa likes that

614
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:21,079
are the smaller heads that are really

615
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:24,518
good or is I I think the generalization

616
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,918
has not been as easy to find I think

617
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,120
that because originally the first time I

618
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,399
saw really small heads was from sativas

619
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:35,398
or narrow Leaf drug cultivars grown

620
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:38,918
outdoors in Australia under a Tropical

621
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,759
Sun and the 25 and 45 Micron hash were

622
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:41,960
like the best it was like that's where

623
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,640
they got the most and that's where it

624
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,759
was the best and it was like the

625
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,759
intensity of the Sun the heads were just

626
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,480
smaller but they were still killer still

627
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:54,640
killer still proper I didn't see that in

628
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,038
sativas that were grown indoors they got

629
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,080
bigger so I wouldn't say that it's SA

630
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,319
saas I would say that it was some

631
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,960
sativas that were grown in a tropical

632
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,639
Sun that I you know what I mean cuz

633
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,000
that's basically what happened I started

634
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,559
I started saying to people I think it's

635
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,720
from like sungrown sativas and that

636
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,558
dropped to it's sativas sativas have

637
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,278
smaller heads and indicas have larger

638
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:21,599
heads and I was kind of like as the

639
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,720
years went on I was like you know I'm

640
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,359
not sure that's really super I think we

641
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,000
might be generalizing a lot in that b

642
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,879
too much yeah maybe it and maybe

643
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,398
creating the wrong assumptions that

644
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
people are like oh I don't even use that

645
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,959
bag cuz uh you know I'm do I'm using

646
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,398
just these certain cultivars and I

647
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,399
shouldn't get anything and it's like no

648
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:40,759
no no just use all the bags every time

649
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:42,278
it'll teach you what you're doing and

650
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,919
it'll show you what's going on you won't
