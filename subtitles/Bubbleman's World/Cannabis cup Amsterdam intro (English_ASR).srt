5
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,000
Square on the main

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,039
Canal uh can't even remember the name of

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,679
this particular Canal but I've been

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,679
staying on it for over 10 years you'd

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:42,320
think I'd know it it's the same street

10
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:44,000
that uh uh the greenhouse is on and

uploading still trying to get my

14
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,320
Jamaican videos up so I thought I would

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,600
just touch base with everyone and let

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,119

18
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:01,878

22
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:11,639
tur melts is Tony's able to extract uh

23
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,280
pure Turpin from the cannabis plant not

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,320
from any other plant not using any

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,280
chemical solvents he extracts it and

26
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,839
then he Recon constitutes it small

27
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,359
amounts of it there's some pure Turpin

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,159
right there moonshine this is like a

29
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,280
ridiculous amount um there's another one

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,680
that's a Jil Bean that he's let cure a

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,200
little bit and so it's gotten a little

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,840
bit of a different color and this one

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,399
also has a little bit of a different

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,600
color so I'm going to hit a little rip
