Whistler Gondola this is the uh I don't

89
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:19,359
think it's actually the original

90
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,278
original Creek Side Gondola I think they

91
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,560
replaced it once since the 70s or twice

92
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,399
maybe but we're in the Creekside Gondola

93
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:28,278
and uh the gundula as some of us like to

94
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,879
call it locally here and we're going to

95
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:31,879
have a little puff come when puffing in

96
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,799
the gondola I always implore you that

97
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,799
it's might look cool to blow your head

98
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,799
out in your friend's face but just blow

99
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,120
it out the window and that way when you

100
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,559
know kids or moms or whoever wants to

101
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,720
get on they don't have to smell it and

102
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,359
you still get to enjoy the uh the

103
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,680
goodness of uh a small

104
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,278

CH we know that of

191
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,440
heroin alcohol can produce long lasting

192
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,000
changes in the neurochemistry of the

193

194
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
really

195
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:03,038
exp it is because it has been

196
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,400
high THC content which is boosted by

197
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:09,240
being grown under lights how many young
