am here with longtime local Vancouver

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,278

just a Vancouver activist you've been

including a variety of uh pretty funny

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
yet educational books which is the

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,920
reason we're here talking to him today

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,599
you may have seen the post I put up on

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,359
Instagram a couple of days ago of the Dr

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,079
SU parody book uh green Buds and hash

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,560
well Dana of course is the author of

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:12,000
such parody yes hilarious there we go I

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
actually read it to my eight-month-old

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,759
child the other day along with the help

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,519
from my 14 and 11year old and uh I was

25
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,560
surprised at how really I mean the

26
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,399
Rhymes are awesome it's definitely Dr

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,280
Seuss like but it's actually quite

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,400
educational yeah like you're really

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,239
giving education in regards to a and the

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
way cannabis can help I I thought it was

31
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,359
pretty

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
brilliant well thanks yeah I wrote this

33
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,040
a few years ago actually I wrote the

34
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,478
poem about four or five years ago and

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,240
just put it online it's floating around

36
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,879
on a lot of different websites now but

37
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,319
uh but the art my friend I I he's a very

38
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,839
talented artist and uh the artist

39
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:52,118
definitely helps make it's a beautiful

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
beautiful book and uh yeah I'm really

41
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:54,680
pleased sometimes when I'm writing stuff

42
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,599
it's really hard to get it out but this

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,360
all just kind of came out in a big yeah

44
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,559
blurb a big thing and um the art is

45
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,000
definitely on point yeah it's very Susi

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,039
and so much on point that you know there

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,560
could be a chance we'll be facing some

48
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,759
kind of uh can you see that there I

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,400
don't know if I think it's to oh there

50
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,359
you go uh uh that's is some of the stuff

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,200
but yeah I I'm a little worried about

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
the Seuss estate coming down on us in

53
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,799
some way about the art and stuff but uh

54
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,120
all the more reason to get your copies

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,879
now before they have any legal problems

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,560

how to make a payment but uh and we're

82
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,920
actually reprinting the first Harry

83
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,119
pothead book again in a couple of weeks

84
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,119
as well so that'll be fun to have both

85
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,560
which is probably your most well-known

86
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,438
par yeah and that's been over for quite

87
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,280
a few years I'm working steadily on the

88
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:31,959
second

89
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,959
the sequel to it but it's taken me a

90
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,560
long time because there's so many other

91
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,680
projects I got going on but uh but the

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,878
green Buds and hash is lovely I'm glad

93
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,879
uh your your children are enjoying it

94
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,239
there yeah I think it's legitimate dude

95
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,438
at first when I saw it I really thought

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,878
it was more of a a haha thing and then I

97
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:53,158
saw it as like this is an

98
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:56,479
actual this is a really important factor

99
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,719
of how we can educate children without

100
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,078
the sort of I mean I'm watching

101
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,959
throughout the media how they're going

102
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,560
through all the years of propaganda and

103
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,959
brainwashing and how they're now slowly

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,158
trying to retract and pull back a lot of

105
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,479
that I think things like this are

106
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,919
extremely helpful to start early yeah I

107
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,478
mean I'm not you know and for kids I

108
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,358
mean I kind of see this as an adult

109
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,120
thing in a way like you know I mean an

110
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,918
eight-month child is going to be amused

111
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,000
by anything you're read no matter what

112
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,039
obviously right they just like the

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,560
sounds but normalizes it is what I mean

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,800
yeah know to me it's just a fun thing I

115
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,720
mean I don't see anything wrong with

116
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,240
kids talking about cannabis or being

117
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,120
told cannabis is a good medicine or

118
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,840
things like that in fact I think that

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,000
probably creates a healthier attitude

120
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,159
towards cannabis than seeing it as this

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,839
forbidden thing that you've got to try

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,360
in secret and and maybe not in the best

123
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,000
context you know just like I think it's

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,639
probably better for kids to try alcohol

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,279
with their parents perhaps for the first

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,199
time oh yeah uh I think having a

127
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,799
normalized attitude about cannabis is is

128
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,400
similar as well and uh and that but this

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,319
is fun for all ages certainly and

130
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,799
grown-ups can enjoy it as well I think

131
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,240
and definely I read it and laughed my

132
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,919
ass up yeah yeah and I justes have a

133
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,000
little more there as well so I've got

134
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:04,319
and I actually got a whole bunch of

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,519
other uh fairy tales and parodies and

136
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,959
things that I've written that are about

137
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,799
this length so we've got the pie-eyed

138
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,159
piper that was actually published in

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,079
cannabis Culture magazine quite a few

140
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,080
years ago say that going way and a lot

141
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,639
of this stuff's been sitting around for

142
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,439
a while it takes to getting the artists

143
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,360
in line is challenging getting the money

144
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,439
and the talent and and getting them to

145
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,038
to spend the time doing it but I've got

146
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,319
the pad Piper coming out in a couple of

147
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,759
months we've got another one called the

148
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,199
girl who could turn hemp into gold and

149
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,360
that one actually hasn't been published

150
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
anywhere publicly at all uh and so I'm

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
hoping to put out a series of these

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,199
things and in another year or so hoping

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
to have about five or six of these kind

154
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,720
of books out in a similar format uh but

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
the other ones aren't Dr Seuss parodies

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,840
they're just fairy tales so there

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,160
shouldn't be any lawsuits over those

158
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,799
ones I'm hoping and hopefully not on

159
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,600
this one either you know satire and

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,120
parody and Canada are allowed uh so I

161
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,639
feel we fall under those things uh but I

162
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,918
admit I'm just a little nervous that

163
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,680
that the Susa State might decide to feel

164
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,318
differently or something who knows but I

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,639
certainly you know I love Dr Seuss like

166
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,919
everybody else

167
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,519
andal respect to him or any means and

168
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,799
hopefully he would enjoy this and think

169
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,519
it's a fun Riff on his work well you got

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
to think that if he ever enjoyed

171
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,839
cannabis in his life that he would

172
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,038
definitely find enjoyment in this

173
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,560
particular parody of his work absolutely

174
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,000
I think it's done with class nonetheless

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,360
so MH ah good to be here smoking with

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,240
you well there's so much going on these

177
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,240
days unel been uh yeah I'm in the news

178
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,720
like on the media is calling me non-stop

179
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,759
for comment on all these things that are

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,280
going on pretty much since 420 from

181
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,840
about 419

182
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,679
every day I've had at least four

183
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,159
reporters calling me for stuff and like

184
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,720
uh and some days it's really crazy but

185
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,720
we've had the dispensary thing happening

186
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,160
in Vancouver and all the kafuffle and

187
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,160
Chang around that Victoria today just

188
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,280
voted like an hour ago 8 to1 to follow

189
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,439
the Vancouver model and basically

190
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,799
legalize dispensaries in Victoria

191
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,478
probably some kind of rules it was

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,720
possible that they were going to maybe

193
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,478
yeah we weren't sure we thought we had

194
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,120
support but it was an 8 to1 vote so we

195
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:59,839
were looking for you know to get at

196
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,639
least five of those nine votes but uh uh

197
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,318
8 to one is really solid on the one vote

198
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,000
against wasn't even really that strongly

199
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,520
against he was more just sort of like

200
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,680
this is ottawa's problem we shouldn't be

201
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,120
fixing their problems for them so that

202
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,680
sounds that sounds really good yeah it

203
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,879
wasn't like he wasn't like marijuana's

204
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,360
cancerous or bad and we should you know

205
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,160
but uh so that's very positive and with

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,280
the two biggest cities in BC now

207
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,919
basically telling the Harper government

208
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,399
to get lost we're going to regulate

209
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,198
cannabis dispensaries in the province uh

210
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,198
that is a huge influence and I think

211
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,919
that many other smaller cities and towns

212
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,038
in BC and across Canada are going to

213
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,478
start following that model as well and

214
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,120
it gives you an option you know you

215
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,800
can't just say as a mayor now well the

216
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,519
law is the law and we have to shut them

217
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,439
down because that's the law we don't

218
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,318
have a choice well you do have a choice

219
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,879
and so that makes it a lot more

220
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,199
interesting you know in Colona I've been

221
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,360
talking to the folks there they've got a

222
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,840
dispensary they were raided in January

223
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,360
they just reopened now the police came

224
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,000
in two days ago and said you have 24

225
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
hours to shut down and the city

226
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,199
inspector actually came in with the

227
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,199
police officers with them okay it

228
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,598
started off being called the Kaya clinic

229
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,960
and then they got raided and shut down

230
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:05,399
down they reopened as the okay clinic

231
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:07,079
now okay yes and uh and so they're got a

232
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,318
thing going weeds has also opened one

233
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,639
there and they're also getting pressured

234
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,120
to shut down in the same way but um but

235
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,680
yeah but yeah so this means whereas in

236
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
West Colona and Vernon they've got a

237
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,079
couple of dispensaries each and the city

238
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,759
councils are more favorable so we're

239
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,399
going to see this playing out City by

240
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,360
City And town by town all across the

241
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:26,519
country as these places continue to well

242
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,879
I got to give props to our mayor for

243
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,680
disagreeing with Amber Rose and disagree

244
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,320
with uh the things that were said which

245
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,158
was basically that I believe she made a

246
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,760
quote and I was it your quote that said

247
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:41,679
maybe she maybe I'm misquoting her or

248
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,120
maybe she meant to say this wrong I

249
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,079
remember reading someone's words about

250
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,759
it that she said there was no medical

251
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,399
value absolutely she said that over and

252
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,000
over again she said that what she

253
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,919
basically said was that the we have to

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,240
provide cannabis to patients because the

255
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,360
courts have ruled that patients believe

256
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,759
that it helps them and so we have to

257
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,959
provide it because they believe that it

258
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,679
helps them but Health Canon knows that

259
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,239
marijuana is not an approved medicine

260
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,679
it's not a valid medicine and and so by

261
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,440
extension basically it's all a hoax and

262
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,120
if you think marijuana is helping you

263
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,040
you're actually deluded and this is the

264
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,720
health Minister this is the health

265
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,639
Minister who runs the medical marijuana

266
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,000
program so obviously you're not going to

267
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,759
have a successful program when the

268
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,679
person who whose Department it is to be

269
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,559
in charge of it uh says it she doesn't

270
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,879
believe it works it's a big hoax and you

271
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,719
just believe it helps you but you're

272
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,919
wrong and so we're actually sponsoring a

273
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,360
week of action against Rona Ambrose this

274
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,838

275
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,399

293
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,919

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,159
able to call any reporters or anything

295
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,199
and then there's one more number as well

296
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,039
but basically we're going to be flooding

297
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,759
their office we did the similar thing

298
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,199
last year when they were telling medical

299
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,039
patients to mix their cannabis with

300
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,920
kitty litter and throw it away on the

301
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,439
curb uh and so we did a one day day of

302
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,919
action last year and it was very

303
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,440
effective and you know if you're mad

304
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,039
about this stuff this is your chance to

305
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,560
vent and to all vent together and if you

306
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,759
have if you're upset about the way

307
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,479
things are going you don't like what the

308
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,958
conservatives are saying and you want to

309
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,440
tell somebody off well this is your

310
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,000
chance to do that to get that get that

311
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,600
uh uh uh energy out there uh direct it

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,159
where it belongs to be at the federal

313
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,000
government at the minister of health and

314
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,078
health Canada and the terrible job

315
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,320
they're doing with the program so uh and

316
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:56,679
if you can do it in the most

317
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,079
intellectually and articulate manner

318
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,039
that is respectful and not uh you know

319
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,399
you can't be phoning up and and and

320
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,719
threatening and and being you know don't

321
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,958
threaten anybody and remember you're not

322
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,200
going to be talking to Rona Ambrose

323
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,479
you're going to be talking to staff

324
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,040
members who work at Health Canada they

325
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,278
they are probably just people who are

326
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:16,399
there just to do their job and get paid

327
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,519
and they might not even agree with what

328
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,600
their Department's philosophy is so you

329
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,519
want to be firm you want to be clear but

330
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,680
don't be calling and swearing at them or

331
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,480
threatening them or or anything phoning

332
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,599
in bomb threats or any crazy stuff like

333
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,759
that just talk about why but keep them

334
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,040
on the phone don't don't let them hang

335
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,838
up on you don't let them put you off

336
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,480
explain to them why cannabis helps you

337
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,680
why you believe it's important try to

338
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,440
keep them on the phone as long as

339
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,838
possible and uh and just bring these

340
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,519
things forward and we really want them

341
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,560
to hear personal stories about this we

342
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,000
want that whole department buzzing all

343
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,679
week and talking to each other about

344
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,720
holy crap I got another 100 phone calls

345
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,439
today you know this is really bad

346
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,600
clearly people are upset about what's

347
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,240
happening here and we got to make a

348
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,240
change and these are effective tools for

349
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,278
activism in in different cities that you

350
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,879
may live in uh you might not even be

351
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:02,799
from Canada and you might have you might

352
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,679
be elsewhere in the world these are

353
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,799
effective tools for for moving your

354
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,479
activism forward there's good ways to go

355
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,399
about it and there's not so good ways to

356
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,199
go about it and Dana himself here has

357
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,120
been going about this I mean you're what

358
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,958
are you 20 years in now yeah I'm over 20

359
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,600
years now 20 years in now so exactly I

360
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:22,958
myself I'm also over 20 years in started

361
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,240
as an activist in pins or something 20

362
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,559
year pin 20 years yeah yeah 20 years

363
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,799
proud absolutely well it's the good work

364
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,759
you know it's uh we're fighting for a

365
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:36,359
plant that we believe in and not just

366
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:39,039
for our own uh personal uh agenda

367
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,000
personal reasons to for profit or

368
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,039
anything like that it's really and it

369
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,559
always has been at least for me

370
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,240
particularly for people that don't have

371
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,278
a voice for themselves for the people

372
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,440
that really really need this plant or

373
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:55,639
need access to it which is why I am a

374
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,320
firm supporter of both LPS and

375
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,879
dispensaries I love the idea of

376
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,240
dispensaries available to people right

377
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,480
now there's not a shadow of a doubt that

378
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,959
dispensaries are saving the Canadian

379
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,159
people from the lp system at this point

380
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,719
in time the lp system cannot provide

381
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,639
enough medicine they're not providing

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,440
Edibles they're not providing salves

383
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,440
they're not pro providing the creams

384
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,279
they're not providing extracts that's a

385
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,680
huge hole considering that is the

386
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,879
medicine that's a pretty giant hole to

387
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,078
leave your your patients with so I mean

388
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,559
to me the dispensaries are

389
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,120
I mean they're picking up a lot of slack

390
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,439
right now with that said I still believe

391
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,560
the LPS have a place I still believe

392
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,800
that LPS are important and if I love the

393
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,198
idea of Standards that's what I love I

394
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,759
for that I don't I haven't heard any

395
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,039
dispensary owners saying you want LPS

396
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,399
shut down no I want a better system for

397
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,759
LPS I feel kind of sorry for them in a

398
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,919
way not too sorry because none of them

399
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,560
are really stepping up or helping an

400
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,679
activism in any way but I got to it's

401
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,559
got to be frustrating to have invested

402
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,078
all these millions of dollars be waiting

403
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,758
most a lot of are LP wab be haven't got

404
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,799
their permits yet they've invested a

405
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,919
bunch of money and they're waiting and

406
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,278
even the ones that have are under a

407
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,679
regulatory scheme run by a minister who

408
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,799
doesn't believe marijuana has any

409
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,278
medicinal value the bureaucracy is very

410
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,120
hostile the rules are keeping changing

411
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,039
it's very expensive and challenging and

412
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,198
the patients mostly hate them I see a

413
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:24,120
lot of very negative LP comments on the

414
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,599
internet and uh and so you so you've got

415
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,320
a lot of challenges there trying to run

416
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
this and I think some of them are people

417
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,759
who are just in it for the money others

418
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,519
I think people who Canabis and want to

419
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,120
help people and are trying to do the

420
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,240
right thing and are frustrated you know

421
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,519
by this process and a lot of those good

422
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,278
folks are ones who haven't got their

423
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,679
permits yet actually is what I found the

424
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,838
people that are my friends are the ones

425
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,039
that kind of they're waiting yeah

426
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,600
they're waiting there's a few folks from

427
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,519
the dispensary community that have made

428
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,240
it into the lp like Philip Lucas uh is

429
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,799
working with till Ray and he originally

430
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,879
was one of the very first dispensaries

431
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,399
in Canada back in the day in vioria and

432
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,879
uh and so there is that but what we need

433
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,600
ultimately is a better regulatory system

434
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,120
uh and one that works differently and

435
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,519
one that you know people say would do

436
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,560
you want to buy all your marijuana from

437
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,240
LPS at your dispensary and I say well if

438
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,559
most of my suppliers could become LPS

439
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,198
fairly easily then yes and they should

440
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,958
be able to they're making a high quality

441
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,799
product there should only be some

442
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,319
oversight and some some testing and

443
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,958
things like that as long as they can

444
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,879
fall through the standards as long as

445
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,399
they make it through this I think the

446
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,919
standards is what will

447
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,120
separate the you know the heads from the

448
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,599
stocks so to speak but the standards to

449
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,839
be something that's not limited that's

450
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,759
not those only we're only going to allow

451
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,319
a dozen people it's got to be a fair

452
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,440
system reach yeah a a standard is

453
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:40,639
keeping a certain bar High a standard is

454
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,639
testing for microbials and making sure

455
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,720
that the Cannabis has not been sprayed

456
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,120
with chemicals which would could involve

457
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,079
just like organic uh testing and farming

458
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,360
does is having someone come and make

459
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,399
sure that you're not doing that yeah

460
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,919
absolutely those are standards not

461
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,000
saying hey only 10 people can play

462
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,439
that's completely absur bad thing no

463
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,839
don't support that at all but you know

464
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,560
my long-term vision for what

465
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,800
legalization really means is that it

466
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,518
should be Farmers growing marijuana by

467
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,039
the thousands of hectares and so it

468
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,440
wouldn't be so much in that kind of

469
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,360
model some people are still going to be

470
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,399
into their perfectly manicured buds for

471
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,600
smoking joints and whatnot but that kind

472
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,720
of stuff I think would fall by the

473
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,120
wayside because you don't need to start

474
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,440
off with the perfect Bud to make a

475
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,480
perfect extract at the end of the

476
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,319
process you can if you're growing it by

477
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,440
the by the hectare and you've got you

478
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,039
know thousands of pounds of resin with

479
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
which is rich in the cannaboids you can

480
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,958
tweak that and develop it or or grow the

481
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
right strains to have whatever cannaboid

482
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,000
profile you want you know I'm not a big

483
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,639
fan of of some of the extracts that are

484
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,559
made because of the being made in

485
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,159
people's homes bubble hash obviously is

486
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,838
very safe and pure and clean like that

487
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,759
uh but yeah exactly we only use a water

488
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,480
extracted resin for our our uh our our

489
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:56,399
MJ creams there a nice little right on

490
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,319
the bottom there made with pure water

491
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,159
extracted marijuana resin and that's the

492
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:04,639
MJ MJ creams. CA uh we've got a number

493
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,199
of different kinds and we're in about 25

494
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,959
stores now and a lot more to come and

495
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,240
there's a lot of research and personal

496
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,078
experience that uh topical salves and

497
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,078
creams that are marijuana infused work

498
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,159
really well for all kinds of stuff we've

499
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,838
been selling these things for a few

500
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,600
years we've added a few essential oils

501
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,480
to diversify them a little bit and it's

502
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,078
got a great ingred in their uh increase

503
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,599
their potency and Effectiveness

504
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,759
medically and uh yeah there's some good

505
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,078
products I think and so we've been

506
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,359
selling them at the dispensary for a few

507
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,918
years now but

508
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,959
but yeah outdoor cannabis grown by the

509
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,880
hectare none of this growing buds in a

510
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,038
basement and everything that's under

511
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,240
artificial and it's a lot harder to like

512
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,960
grow keep to keep buds safe from mold

513
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,240
and mildew and things because it's such

514
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,960
an organic living thing whereas if you

515
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
have an extract that you can make at any

516
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,480
potency any level of Purity with any

517
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,120
level of tpin and flavonoids grown in an

518
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,759
outdoor environment that I think is the

519
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,959
long-term future of marijuana and what

520
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,319
I'm working for people can still grow

521
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,880
some in their backyard like they grow

522
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,678
tomatoes or whatever and that should be

523
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
out and people will still do that but

524
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,320
it' be more of a hobbyist kind of a

525
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,079
thing than a big moneymaking kind of

526
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,480
thing you know I think that's that's the

527
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,960
future in the long term but it's going

528
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,279
to be a while before we get from here to

529
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,558
there also so no I agree outdoor is

530
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,240
definitely fields and Fields is where

531
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,519
it's it's got to be going the only thing

532
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
that put us underground and inside with

533
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,158
lights is prohibition and once

534
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,440
prohibition is lifted there's really no

535
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,640
more reason to follow prohibition based

536
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,120
models I think it will be a slow

537
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,000
transition uh one that potentially in

538
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,798
Canada I think here could potentially be

539
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,880
solved by offering a third type of

540
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:38,359
license let mm patients have their

541
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,440
licenses let LPS have licenses but don't

542
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,719
limit them keep the standards high and

543
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,279
offer a third type of Licensing for all

544
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,960
those Growers who are currently growing

545
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:49,399
under an mm license but growing to

546
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,319
produce cannabis for others so that they

547
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,159
sell it let them have another type of

548
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,000
license where okay if you're growing for

549
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,600
yourself you don't need to test for

550
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,960
microbials and all these different

551
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,798
things but if you're putting it on an

552
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,558
open market and selling it then perhaps

553
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,319
those standards should be put into place

554
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,960
to protect the end user no I agree

555
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,158
absolutely like how we do wine on other

556
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,400
things right if you want to brew wine in

557
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,440
your home and share it with your friends

558
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,280
and family without cost there's not

559
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,880
really much oversight no one's

560
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,000
inspecting your wine or anything like

561
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,640
that if you want to sell it in a store

562
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,200
yeah I want it to know it's pure and

563
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,080
it's not going to contain toxic things

564
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,840
and I want to know that if it says

565
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,319
organic on the label someone's actually

566
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,879
checking to make sure it's actually

567
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,240
produced organically and things like

568
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,080
that but the wine market

569
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,720
has got small scale Mitch producers that

570
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,199
just do very limited amounts it's got

571
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,919
medium grow medium producers it's got

572
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,600
really giant companies that make you

573
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,360
know millions of gallons of wine a year

574
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,879
and there's room for all of those and

575
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,119
that's what we need for cannabis room

576
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,520
for everybody who wants to get involved

577
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,839
and who can produce a high quality

578
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,119
product uh they should be able to to

579
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,519
participate in the market if they want

580
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,719
to that that's the kind of future we

581
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,000
need absolutely I agree well thanks for

582
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,558

597
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:40,279
huge difference with the little hole too

598
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,640
it just what it feels like after a while

599
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,519
when you put the dab in and you start

600
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,200
taking your rip without this it starts

601
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,720
feeling like you're you're pulling down

602
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,120
this really big straw like instead of

603
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,319
