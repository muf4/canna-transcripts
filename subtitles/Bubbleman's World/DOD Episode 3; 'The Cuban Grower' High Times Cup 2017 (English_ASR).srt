00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:13,380
[Music]

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,670
[Music]

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:34,120
full

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:36,399
[Music]

5
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:38,878
so this is some drive that's been out in

6
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,239
the sun for like two days it's been hot

7
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,799
as [ __ ] and it's still nice and glittery

8
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,878
oh wow yeah so the voice that you're

9
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,799
hearing could only be one man yeah who

10
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,759
that the one and

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:56,959
onlyest finest that's right grower

12
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:59,320
that's right so we just left sasquash

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,198
and he showed us some cool rosin but you

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,079
know I feel wrly there's only one person

15
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,438
in the game that's doing like really

16
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,640
when you talk about hashish and you talk

17
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:12,679
about resin I mean this is what

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,799
99% looks like it's just perfect little

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,159
heads they look like little Bubbles and

20
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,960
this has been in the Sun for a while and

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,280
that little gooiness is just the the

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,719
heads kind of melting and and becoming

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,719
like

24
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,959
uh part of this uh process where the

25
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,439
heads are breaking down and the tpin and

26
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,280
everything are coming together for the

27
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,959
first time uh but the preservation for

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,359
that to be for hours is incredible I

29
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,919
actually uh have bought three G myself

30
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,920
yeah in the street we call that

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,439
greasy like the diamonds so we these

32
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,040
have been out in the sun for 2 days it's

33
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,398
been really hot I the surface of this is

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,600
right here like 100° or something um

35
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,280
it's been out in display all of this

36
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,359
hash right here is vacuum dried not

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,079
freeze dried

38
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,399
it's a technique that I've been using

39
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,319
since I started making hash uh it's

40
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,840
similar to freeze drying where I use a

41
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,719
backing pump to pull a pressure and I

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,239
have a cold trap in line to capture the

43
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:18,318
Ice uh but it's a lot more I don't know

44
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,759
cheaper you can get a 1.9 AI oven for

45
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,238
like 700 bucks and a good vacuum pump

46
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,719
put two or three in line and you can dry

47
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640
a lot of hash for day so these here we

48
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,400
put them out uh have you ever taken a

49
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,159
really turpy uh rosin and put that under

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,080
vacuum seen what that does I've done

51
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,400
that before if you yeah that's why I

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,160
don't rosin my or vacuum my rosin more

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,439
so what I do with these rosins here I

54
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,439
press them at a temperature where they

55
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,479
already start to nucleate and because

56
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,239
it's five star it I don't know I almost

57
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,840
think it's because I'm in Oregon as well

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,000
in my cold room it's just a natural

59
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,439
higher humidity when you press it it

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,560
will come out uh shatter sappy and then

61
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,239
have some nucleation and what I use is

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,479
just a little bit of heat and just a lot

63
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,759
of whipping to agitate the oil I'll

64
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,479
stick it in the back and the back will

65
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,679
be I don't know 110 degre or so it's

66
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,719
already waxing up by itself pretty hard

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,879
and uh I'll pull it back at like 15 and

68
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,439
shut off the valve just to Puff it up

69
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,318
and what happens is all those little

70
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,318
bubbles they end up waxing yeah and they

71
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,119
get they gave it like a fat texture but

72
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,598
because I don't pull a long back it's

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,519
like the shortest part of my process it

74
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,238
doesn't lose a lot of but yo you don't

75
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,158
know how many times I've had

76
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,319
loudes and I [ __ ] it up yeah without a

77
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,519
c trap straight going into like a vacuum

78
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,839
po well when I made the uh vitamin CBD

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,680
oil in the emerald cup when I first came

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,640
out to California I had uh you know 30%

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,200
tpine uh content it was all this crazy

82
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,719
unbelievable flour oil and flow rosin

83
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,798
and I had so much of it I actually put

84
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,959
that under vac like what you just said

85
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,959
and tried that and it white muffined and

86
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,680
I was like and I shut it off and it like

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,959
left in this like perfect white like

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,239
muffin you know cuz there's so much tury

89
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,719
stuff like that and it just no it just

90
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,959
stayed like that and then what happened

91
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,359
was I let that stay for like 12 hours

92
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,519
just in its place and I slowly

93
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,920
decompressed it and when it came back it

94
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,000
was like this crazy consistency that was

95
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,479
um like the solventless sa that's where

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,279
we kind of got that from um and then

97
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,199
it's funny cuz I I was trying to now do

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,439
that without um doing that cuz like you

99
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,319
said if you go too far everything's gone

100
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,199
yeah well with cold traps you can always

101
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:31,959
re it but I try to to preserve it as

102
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,199
long as I can you know so all this resin

103
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,478
here besides the collaboration with the

104
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,160
dryft and the rosin was all grown by my

105
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:43,519
wife indoors from our first crop in

106
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,840
Oregon and um washed my meat I was happy

107
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,159
it was the first time I've washed in

108
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,758
months oh that's why you have such uh

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,439
the motherload here yeah yeah it was

110
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,000
like you came out you're like you know I

111
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,038
haven't watched any resin in a while I'm

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
going in well the the thing with

113
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,360
California is that it it cost a lot of

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
money to build a cold lab to have a cool

115
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,639
bu the proper size AC electricity and

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,959
[ __ ] like you have to be pretty die hard

117
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,000
about making hash and a lot of cats like

118
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,079
with this type of temperature they can't

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,199
really wash you know they're like winter

120
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,519
washers but I have a pretty good lab I

121
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,759
can wash whenever hottest days of the

122
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,560
year and I take advantage of it man I

123
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,160
come out here and I try to offer the

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,160
fire to people that would normally buy

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,360
it at Shops give them direct wholesale

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
price and bring us much as I can so I

127
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,759
can have a good selection yeah you get a

128
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,120
lot of good feedback we a lot of people

129
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,439
that came through patience that came

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,560
through they were like really excited as

131
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,759
as I was uh to grab you know different

132
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,680
different types of sift that you have um

133
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,319
there's a lot of people even in the sift

134
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,720
world where I like oh I got 99 right and

135
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,680
there's like so many people that claim I

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
got 99.99 it's like you just take a

137
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,959
macro camera now I have a little

138
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,240
keychain that does 20 on my iPhone you

139
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,359
just go and look at it you're like if

140
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
you see any contaminants you're like you

141
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,240
don't you're not even close like 85 to

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,960
like 90 you but you could taste it you

143
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,319
can taste it yeah so when I first

144
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,918
started making dry SI I never had like a

145
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,319
scope so I would like I remember the

146
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,959
first time I would get like cleaner and

147
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,598
cleaner and cleaner the color of the

148
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,359
hash would change and stuff it got to a

149
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:20,319
point where it would melt just like

150
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,960
water hash and any contaminant or stocks

151
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
or things like that I like acquired like

152
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,079
like a taste for it you know so in my

153
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,400
process it's a pretty stony one you like

154
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,359
make hash and test daab and uh you get

155
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,879
pretty high in the process but you find

156
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,960
out you know you got a quality

157
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,360
controller well the first time I did get

158
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,198
a scope it was beautiful what I saw for

159
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,680
sure recently I went to uh to a buddy's

160
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,800
house and he had like one of those uh I

161
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
don't know if it's an electron

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,280
microscope or whatever it is it's like

163
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,720
some crazy microscope and he put the

164
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,439
hash on there he was super psyched right

165
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
and what he saw just blew his mind and I

166
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,240
looked at it it was blown up no just all

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,960
heads just

168
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,918

soft eggs you're just

174
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,038
like it's a good type of hash to make

175
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,638
but that's still your proprietary type

176
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:21,478
of tent right yeah you know I just try

177
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,879
to keep it lowkey cuz when I um won my

178
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,079
first Cannabis Cup I really came up out

179
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,840
of just hard work you know didn't really

180
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,120

185
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,239
through and stuff and you know and it

186
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,680
made it kind of sour to me and I'm like

187
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,759
I don't know I'm like a private person

188
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,000
so I taught a lot of my family and my

189
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,199
close friends like people that really

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,360
love me they know how to do Cub Tech but

191
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,038
other than that I just like to share the

192
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,759
joy adive to people and I give them a

193
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,120
lot of tips like people that are often

194
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
coming in the game if I there's a screen

195
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,598
that they can use it to like you know

196
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,799
improve their quality by a lot or a

197
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:10,279
drying process a curing process I almost

198
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,960
gave it my all my techniques out in

199
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,758
pieces and parts you know yeah I'd say

200
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,638
the same thing when everyone's like

201
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,560
talking about tures I'm like well I mean

202
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,720
the industry is Cutthroat you know and

203
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,680
like when you work really hard and you

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,280
do have a family around you you kind of

205
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,400
do have to hold on to what you can to be

206
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,000
able to survive first you know so you

207
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,079
don't get swallowed up so people have to

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,240
respect that part in the in the

209
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,079
particular game and it's Cutthroat right

circle and then try to you know I can

213
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,959
imagine when you first started making

214

quality it has a very high yield and

306
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,720
it's hard to find that you know in hash

307
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,720
