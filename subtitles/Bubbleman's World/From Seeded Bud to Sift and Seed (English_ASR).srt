9
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:55,759
dry racks down at the

10
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,759
end oh yeah went

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,039
through and what kind of temperature and

12
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,840
humidities are you looking for in

13
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,640
here uh because it's open on either end

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,478
it's tough to control mhm uh it doesn't

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,200
feel muggy in here at all it definitely

16
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:16,118
no no that if it gets too hot we have

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,118
fans that we I'm more concerned with the

18
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:22,519
air blowing down and just keeping a

19
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:26,560
constant air flow on them uh still

20
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:29,199
takes 7 to 10 days for them to dry here

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,478
and then they'll go into bins and then

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,879
from there World treat them flip them

23
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:39,158
get the moisture out and then from them

24
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:43,118
destock them and then back into

25
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:46,040
bins okay so good process all the all

26
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,478
the shake is put on screens now that's

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,479
what I'm talking about right there this

28
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,599
is what I want people to see this is how

29
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:54,078
you do it people you don't have to go

30
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,879
and buy uh expensive racks from

31
00:01:54,078 --> 00:02:00,199
restaurants you can build your own this

32
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:04,000
is perfect he's got them dated

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,478
and named this is really nice to see

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,318
this is just so much resin lost when not

35
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,280
done this has been sitting on here since

36
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,119
December

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,759
13th wow it's ready it's ready no we

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,319
it's ready for the ready to be and do

39
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:22,318
you have a you have catch trays on the

40
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:25,399
bottoms or the very bottom we have a

41
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:30,039
little trays that clip onto here M so it

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,159
Clips onto here and then you pull it out

43
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,598
uh and then you flip it beautiful and

44
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,680
then you move it down and then you pull

45
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,598
the next one out flip it only ever it

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,920
gets flipped once uh and that's it cuz

47
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,000
then from there it's scooped up

48
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,238
and excellent either put through the

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,199
Tumblers through the Tumblers to the to

50

Bakers yeah this still has you can see

53
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:06,280
see it's it's sort of dry to the touch

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,650
but if you squeeze it in the middle yeah

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,808
so it still a couple more days to

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,808

crystally well there's a

65
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,078
cake and this is why you do this over

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,438
screens cuz he just literally knocked

67
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,879
off

68
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,120
83,000 gland heads when he did that and

69
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,120
we're catching and we're catching them

70
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,599
all

71
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,239
absolutely but everything they wouldn't

72
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,158
be caught without those

73
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,759
screens so you can see if I if I just if

74
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:20,839
I just bang these a little bit you can

75
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:23,319
see the seed oh yeah do you have a seed

76
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,239
separator that you guys use or um just

77
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,478
do it a couple sort of again homemade

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,519
machines that you know just run them

79
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:33,879
through holes no not even I use I use

80
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,439
more sort of gravity and and air flow

81
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,360
you've seen those laser perforated hole

82
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,478
sheets though those are pretty good with

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,439
a little vibrator I've seen a few I've

84
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,038
seen the one with the um blows the air

85
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,199
up and blows the Sha up right yeah

86
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:49,159
that's nice through the tube or whatever

87
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
yeah those are pretty impressive

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,880
too

89
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,638
Ingenuity nothing beats these seeds I

90
00:04:53,879 --> 00:05:01,639
love eating them so basically the work

91
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,639
here is to deed these uh destock them

92
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,599
uh and because it's C you don't really

93
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:10,959
have to do this stage but because of the

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,000
fact that we we we want

95
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,239
to uh capture the tric Combs right

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,680
always want to keep the surface in front

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,199
of you clean cuz when you cut it off it

98
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,000
hits the screen thousands of tricomb

99
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,080
have just fallen off that butt we

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,959
collect that so you sit here you know

101
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,839
it's you know it's dry when I could sit

102
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,399
here and use my fingers

103
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,239
don't even need the fiskers don't need I

104
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,560
don't need these scissors I I I can I

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,400
can operate this whole thing with just

106
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,720
using my scissors but but this butt

107
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:48,038
itself is still if you squeezed

108
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,039
it it's it's good so we'll sit here

109
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,840
and do a little debing do a little

110
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,560
debting I'm going to take a few macro

111
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,839
shots of that resin to show people the

112
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
quality that you're working with and

113
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,758
then once you have a little pile in

114
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
front of you just slly push it forward

115
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,000
you always want to make sure that the

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,000
bud falls directly on the

117
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:14,918
screen be

118
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:22,560

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560

yeah if you dump it too fast I won't

171
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,039
dump it all

172
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,320
just slow

173
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,320
M we'll uh throw the whole batch in the

174
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
tumbler

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,079
and we're going to do it for 30

176
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,039
seconds 10

177
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:11,759
minutes and then we'll do a 1 hour

178
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,958
run at which point we'll take it and

179
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,799
then go and then go get the seed out of

180
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:19,199
it and then after we got the seed out of

181
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,958
it we'll bring it back and we'll bring

182
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,120
it back for a 24-hour

183
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:29,958
run uh and then we'll put it in for a 24

184
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,639
to 48 hour run and then we put it in

185
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:39,078
for like two days 48 to 72 hours of run

186
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,079
wow uh making sure you getting it

187
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:55,439

it's

194
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,680
fluffy it's that high

195
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,399
well within my storage limits of my mm

196
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,399
license yeah mine

197
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,639
too so put it in

198
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,090
[Music]

199
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,198
here it starts getting on the outside

200
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:58,879
smell that's

201
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:58,879
crazy that is a nice smell

202
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:12,078
not so much on the outside but after the

203
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,079
24-hour

204
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,360
run so this and

205
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:33,078
take and you saw that when it was Bugg

206
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,519
when we put it in that would have broken

207
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,559
it all

208
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,839
up

209
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,518
mhm does a lot of work for you

210
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,519
especially over

211
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,889
[Music]

212
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,680
seeds sorry Kirk yeah good good time

213
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,039
to that the pile got so deep

214
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,039
you can see the

215
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,039
screen where the screen was hitting

216
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,360
at that looks like some hundreds of

217
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,240
grams you might want to get

218
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,078
some e

219
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,499
[Music]

220
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,198
let's

221
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,278
see that's a good

222
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:12,879
amount it's a good amount of weight

223
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:16,198
right there for sure and it is dense

224
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,360
you're right it's uh it looks denser

225
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,879
than you think or it is denser than you

226
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,159
think it's denser than it

227
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,159
looks good

228
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,639
color all right so you've gotten to the

229
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:33,318
point where Barbara's been well sifted

230
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,799
we sifted it for an hour and those big

231
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:40,240
fluffy buds we had are now just sort of

232
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,799
like this but you got to get the seed

233
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,480
out so what we do

234
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:49,198
is we take put it onto this screen so

235
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,000
all the seed and everything that's will

236
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:58,679
already fall

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,679
through and then this a small grinding

238
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:10,638
breaks up all the bud and get in

239
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:13,638
particular it gets out all the seat so I

240
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,318
usually do this with gloves

241
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:20,000
but all that loose stuff all the seed

242
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,000
that's over harvested

243
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,198
see

244
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:45,198
just all the loose stuff let it fall

245
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:45,198
through

246
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,838
and then after you after you do it

247
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,199
all you end

248
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:14,078
up end up sort of with

249
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,079
that and then from in

250
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,720
there you get the seed

251
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,318
out try to get

252
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,038
them but they're in

253
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:32,038
there let separate those further using

254
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,359
SC SE screen separators or pull them out

255
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,879
by hand yeah no we have a couple other

256
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,159
wind machines that'll blow the blow the

257
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,200
chaff

258
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,798
away and then uh one more after that one

259
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,038
more uh system after that that uses the

260
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,599
Angles and lets the seeds roll down

261
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:51,359
perfect and then you put a fan on there

262
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,719
blows off the CH so good amount of sift

263
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,918
came off of that

264
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,120
uh off of that barber it looks pretty

265
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,159
good so that's the 1H hour r run so then

266
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:06,199
after we get the seed out we'll actually

267
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:09,200
put this back in back in the sifter and

268
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,720
do a 24hour run okay the last little bit

269
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,038
and then a 24h hour to 48h hour run and

270
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:21,279
that stuff will go to Edibles tinctures

271
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:21,279
and things like that awesome awesome
