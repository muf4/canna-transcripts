spring than they were last year we had a

134
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,240
later winter and then even though we've

135
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:50,560
had fluctuations it's been a slow spring

136
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,720
so I don't feel too behind fantastic

137
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,839

and yeah my bulbs are all up uh but we

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,240
also have a really late spring and wet

143
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:12,400
very very wet what comes out it's happy

144
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,720
to come out and then it gets like uh

145
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,079
smashy

146
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,520
moldy but

147
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,639
um yeah so we also have a really cold

148
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,079
winter a little bit Frost here and there

149
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,639
which is

150
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:29,839
absolutely uh not acceptable but we take

151
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,360
it yeah can you do it's like last year

152
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,399

154
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:43,560
for our Regent and um I'm going to the

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,680
garden and see what has died or not

156
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,199
coming back so that's for me that's the

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,918
first thing I'm going around and see all

158

my babies who comes back welcome them

159
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:57,478
and not it really hurts in the heart but

160
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,318
um what can you do it makes room for

161
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,079
something new I mean um then it goes out

162
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
and it gets replaced with something else

163
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,959
it's like okay you didn't do well anyway

164
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,800

276
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,120
garden with all sorts of different wild

277
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,079
flowers and Edibles and and things like

278
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,799

279
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,919
season

280
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,919
goes not sure if I'm frozen

281
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,319
again sounds about

282
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,680
right in the northern Michigan

283
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:30,480
Appalachia and it's

284
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,439
basically lots of Lakes lots of water

285
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,360
it's all glacial tilt and uh they're

286
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,920
called Kettle holes so it's

287
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,639
basically um you know the glaciers

288
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,399
receding and scratching the Earth

289
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,959
leaving behind uh a bunch of lower areas

290
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,480
um so yeah I'm again on the same boat

291
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,078
with the the melting in the ton of water

292
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,399
um but the it seems like a lot of my

293
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,958
Mounds are kind of drying out faster the

294
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,958
sun's hitting them the water's kind of

295
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,039
pouring aside and there's some action

296
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,119
right at like you know the tip of those

297
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,759
points uh so it's going pretty well over

298
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,240
here awesome we've been seeing some

299
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,919
pictures and I know you're getting a lot

300
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,039
of seeds in and everything and you got

301
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,799
any uh favorite varieties that you're

302
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,039
putting in um I'm curious about I'm

303
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,198
running some stuff from turp Wizard

304
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:24,159
who's another Michigan uh organic farmer

305
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:26,198
and uh regen family I would say um so

306
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm running a couple of his

307
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,278
varietal uh you know again stuff that I

308
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,320
saved from California from you know the

309
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,240
Swami days and everything like that from

310
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,000
hanging with Swami and all that um you

311
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,360
know but mostly I'm kind of open right

312
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,440
now I haven't really thought about

313
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,720
popping too much stuff because I'm a

314
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,639
little bit uh you know probably a month

315
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
out from that kind of time frame but uh

316
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,079
but yeah it's starting to come down the

317
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,759
pipeline and you traditionally did I say

318
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,879
traditional but like all you like to do

319
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,320
on your land uh start them a little

320
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,958
later and and have like a smaller depth

321
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,519
in the back SA correct are you gonna do

322
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:05,638
that again this year yep I do well I try

323
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,919
to dry farm so I don't irrigate my stuff

324
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,680
up there at all it's all rain waterer um

325
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:14,599
so I set up my hoop I plant small plants

326
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,758
a little bit later um into Hogle H they

327
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,278
holes I dig a hole and then bury a bunch

328
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:22,159
of carbon and plant inside there U and

329
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,919
that seems to hold enough water to keep

330
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,600
the plants happy throughout the year

331
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,039
they're small easy to manage and I don't

332
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,079
end up covering them until super late

333
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:35,240
into the season mostly just to keep the

334
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:37,359
rain off of like the finishing nugs um

335
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,000
so uh but this year I might try to do a

336
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,519
little bit different supplement with

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,198
extra water uh to try to get slightly

338
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,679
larger plants um yeah thanks but we'll

339
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,278
see how it goes nice when it's always it

340
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,399
seems like the whole state of Michigan

341
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,318
could be a dry Farm State because the

342
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,318
whole there so much water all around

343
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,759
easily yeah oh easily for sure and I

344
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,759
mean you know it's just it's one of

345
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,079
those things where it's as soon as you

346
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,959
kind of find out about it um you know

347
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,000
this was or three seasons ago was my

348
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:13,000
first season kind of doing hul cannabis

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,639
cultivation and it's it's remarkable how

350
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,679
well that works here specifically in

351
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,639
catching all that water and you know I

352
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,078
would walk up to my hoop houses past the

353
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,919
orchard everything's raging I turn the

354
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,359
corner thinking that they'd like you

355
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,439
know some water and and they just never

356
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,440
really asked for it so I was like fine

357
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,920
serious I'll tell a story later because

358
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,319
we're going to introduce people about

359
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,719
that but that's pretty amazing what what

360
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:39,318
water retention can happen in the hug

361
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,519

Emy yeah um down here it's really hot

374
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,639
like we are each like the last three

375
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,160
years I've started noticing it's just

376
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,640
gotten hotter and hotter where I've

377
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,160
started having to grow like in desert

378
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,038
conditions and because it just gets so

379
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,959
hot in the summer and um this last year

380
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:30,160
I planted a month like two behind when I

381
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,759
was like usually on my target goal

382
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,840
whereas like by the end of May all my

383
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,679
veggies and all my medicinals are in and

384
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,959
stuff it was too late it was so hot this

385
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,320
past year we're just kind of having to

386
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,120
speed up a lot of our planting and um

387
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,119
learning how to like really go

388
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,839
underneath

389
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,519
trees and any kind of shade that we can

390
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,480
do and creating more natural shade so

391
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,400
that's kind of like our appalation now

392
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,679
and we're excited to work with like um a

393
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,038
lot more sativas as well because we know

394
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,120
we can do those long term those you know

395
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,519
long flowering plants out here and um

396
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,798
I've had them go

397
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:12,000
until I think the longest one I ever mid

398
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:14,400
January and I finally cut it but it was

399
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,640
more rainy in that time and now we don't

400
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,759
have some of those rains so it's like

401
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,120
okay how do we adjust and I think we can

402
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:23,720
yeah we're going to try some more

403
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:26,279
long-term ones this year and uh but yeah

404
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,440
that's our that's our

405
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,158
appalation I'm just arriving here from

406
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,720
late as a lot of you guys know um we're

407
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,799
uh shutting down our farm up there in

408
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,000
lonville unfortunately due to you know

409
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,000
just Market

410
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,400
yeah we're regrouping yeah regrouping us

411
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,079
too because we've I've been in licensing

412
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,159
and trying to do this since 2016 when it

413
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,918
like first all like came about and I was

414
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,320
in talks with our County and this last

415
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,600
year I kind of had this like meltdown

416
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:33,158
cuz I was like I'm got TSD from thinking

417
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:36,119
about permits and Licensing and like I

418
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,679
just can't do it right now we when we're

419
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,678
going to do the hemp farm this year and

420
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,200
we just all decided you know what let's

421
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,200
just take a year and breathe and we're

422
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,480
building the medal Garden and we're

423
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,319
doing commercial herbs which we need for

424
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,000
the products for heal thyself Gardens

425
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:56,038
and uh we're excited about that she's uh

426
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,480
she's you know loves her coffee she's

427
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,798
you know the most intensive Barista you

428
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,400
know it's like hard to take her to

429
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:05,599
coffee shops because she's like you know

430
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,320
but she's amazing you know about like

431
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,759
the detail of like quality and making

432
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,759
sure the beans were you know sourced

433
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,759
properly and uh you know they're roasted

434
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,839
properly all those kind of things so she

435
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,720
had the idea of uh starting up a coffee

436
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,000
cart and we're going to do some trips

437
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
down Central and South America and go

438
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,319
and talk to some of these different

439
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,038
farms and do some sourcing and really

440
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,720
trying to help out some of these uh you

441
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:29,640
know more regenerative coffee farmers

442
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,279
and help push them in that Direction

443
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,880
maybe even do some Consulting and stuff

444
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,119
like that so we could be able to bring

445
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,080
back beans and start roasting here and

446
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,279
uh start setting up a a mobile coffee

447
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,839
truck a big 20 foot trailer with a big

448
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,839
deck on it and all kinds of reading

449
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,918
material and regenerative F push the

450
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,959
message of how important sourcing uh you

451
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,440
know products from the right people is

452
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,640
so uh yeah that's that's a whole new

453
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,400
mission that I think that she's going to

454
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,600
thrive at and you know so I've been

455
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,679
helping her out and we're getting that

456
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,959
going we have a buddy building a

457
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,159
beautiful trailer right now and uh and I

458
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,440
feel like we can integrate that with

459
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,480
like the events and really you know

460
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,080

471
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:38,918
yeah yeah I just wanted to say that here

472
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,599
we are you know cannabis Farmers we've

473
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,960
been playing these games we've been

474
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,959
playing a lot of papers we've been

475
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,480
pushing a tremendous amount of Licensing

476
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,919
we've been pushing a tremendous amount

477
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,679
of money you know there was a time when

478
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:59,000
Legacy farmers in California Oregon

479
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,240
Washington DC Colorado

480
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,839
Europe were able to feed their families

481
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,720
were able to keep Homestead were able to

482
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:12,079
put in crops every year and now through

483
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,200
legalization basically it's it's the

484
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,879
idea of legalization is to take out

485
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,759
those Legacy Farmers to take us out

486
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,679
right in front of our face and I and I

487
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,278
don't I don't want to you know sugarcoat

488
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,320
it or anything I don't want to make it

489
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,480
sound like oh well you know we've got

490
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,480
some place here and up here in in Canada

491
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,919
a lot of the micro Growers I know Shay

492
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,200
is going to be talking here he's on

493
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,120
Rosebud Farm talk about pushing papers

494
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,960
and everything that we're trying to do

495
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,439
for legalization up here but what we're

496
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,440
really starting to realize is that when

497
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,240
things become legalized with the federal

498
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,798
government When Things become legalized

499
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,240
with a province or a state that means

500
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:50,879
that it's more up for big corporate man

501
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,839
and the big corporate entity to take

502
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,520
over so the reason why Dem pure is Dem

503
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,918
pure is because we're here to support

504
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,759
each other we're all on the same page

505
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:07,080
with regenerative Community regenerative

506
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,278

just in the flower the quality is in the

00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,960
community and the quality is in the

532

548
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:02,240
to where we are if you look between Rio

549
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,200
and Katie through that uh rectangle tall

550
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,759
window that is precisely where Katie is

551
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,919
pointing where my farm

552
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:15,359
is that mountain is called Reed mountain

553
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,840
and it is historically known locally as

554
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,599
weed Mountain it was it's one of the

555
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:23,199
taller Peaks right outside of

556
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:25,519
Garberville and has uh you know every

557
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,798
single one of those ridg lines has

558
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:31,440
Legacy historic Groves that have been up

559
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:33,679
there for you know 30 40 maybe even some

560
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,960
50 years uh you walk those ridg lines

561
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,840
you're going to find some water line

562
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,319
you're going to see some boards nailed

563
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:42,158
to trees where pots were grown in the

564
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:44,439
trees like it's it's pretty much ground

565
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,880
zero Southern humble you've got you know

566
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,000
Salmon Creek Reed mountain and some of

567
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,159
these other little uh micro communities

568
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,359
um but we are about 11 miles as a crow

569
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,399
flies from the

570
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:01,079
ocean and we are at the Confluence of

571
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:03,879
Two Rivers uh the South Fork of the eel

572
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,558
and the east branch of the South Fork uh

573
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,200
the Confluence is right there so we get

574
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:11,240
this really nice air exchange at least

575
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:16,480
twice a day um where the valleys will

576
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,480
pull in the ocean fog but we

577
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,599
and we kind of get this Oreo cookie

578
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,519
effect where we're the cream in the

579
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:35,759
middle because sometimes you know if

580
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:37,918
you're if you've been around mountains

581
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,519
at all they they get a little Cloud on

582
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,640
the peak too so it's really nice we get

583
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:45,759
a lot of beautiful sunrises and uh Rio's

584
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,120
Farm gets the beautiful sunset so we

585
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,038
have a nice little balance in our

586
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:54,639
ecosystem um but yeah we've been facing

587
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:58,879
a lot of challenges with uh legalization

588
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,000
and the county and over Taxation and and

589
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,480
uh that's where my partner Melanie has

590
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,720
been such a a rock and such a voice she

591
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,120
actually has a master's in communication

592
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,519
and has been delivering these amazing uh

593
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,519
three minute comments to the Board of

594
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:18,558
Supervisors and um just taking her

595
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,720
public speaking to really support the

596
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,440
the farmers and one of our last uh

597
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,278
rallies in front of the courthouse she

598
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,519
we delivered a very moving speech and we

599
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:34,319
were able to take our taxation from um

600
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:36,278
uh uh down 85% so we pay 15% of the tax

601
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,558
we did last year give you an idea so for

602
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:42,440
a farm of 10,000 square feet like ours

603
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,440
that went from 10,000

604
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,480
to legitimize our lives in in the in the

605
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,519
greater world right we we knew who we

606
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,558
were and we were legitimately conducting

607
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:16,000
good business and parts of our community

608
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:18,119
and um paying taxes um but but now with

609
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,720
legalization when it first happened at

610
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,278
least locally we were excited to pay for

611
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,200
our roads and pay for our schools

612
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,839
through that system we always did it on

613
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,038
a volunteer basis and we gave more than

614
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:32,000
our share and uh built schools and built

615
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,000
hospitals and did all

616
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:50,079
these F like it was just phenomenal like

617
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,440
and over overbearing and the way

618
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,960
California built out their supply chain

619
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,038
they built it such a fractured line so

620
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,000
no one could really participate in all

621
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:02,480
features and that fractured supply chain

622
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,440
is really part of the demise of the

623
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,440
entire California system you need a you

624
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,600
need a permit a separate permit to do

625
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,278
anything for me to drive a plant off my

626
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:16,480
property to move a plant from my light

627
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:19,960
depth to my full term that takes another

628
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,919
license like it's crazy so we're working

629
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,319
hard to push on that melan's been a big

630
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,600
help with all that and our entire

631
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:31,278
Community is is really working forward

632
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,599
to uh to with all that so I appreciate

633
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:37,558
everyone here today and you know

634
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:41,240
everyone has a unique skill and a unique

635
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:43,639
um strength and together we're really

636
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,399
able to pull something together that can

637
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,240
support each other so I appreciate you

638
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:50,599
all thank

639
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,240
you awesome Craig yeah you know I think

640
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,119
that inevitably we're going to get into

641
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,120
the conversation today on you know how

642
00:29:56,119 --> 00:30:01,278
we can uh support each other a lot of

643
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,398
countries now are starting to come into

644
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,000
legalization they're going to be dealing

645
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,839
with a lot of this licensing they're

646
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,079
going to be looking at exactly what

647
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,959
we've been dealing with and they're

648
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,839
going to see the straight up takeover of

649
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,480
Legacy farmers of Legacy Growers as well

650
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:19,439
breeders so I feel like we can really be

651
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,558
offering them education forward on how

652
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,038
we can join together so that really

653
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:26,480
doesn't happen um and we're going to a

654
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:28,119
cannabis Summit in Colona um next

655
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,919
weekend I think it's next weekend and

656
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,678
it's going to be a really a policy type

657
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:33,960
Summit where we're going to be you know

658
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,960
creating

659
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,720
new laws and new verbage for maybe

660
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,519
creating a new license and just working

661
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,798
on the federal licensing up here in

662
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,679
Canada so I would say in Colona uh which

663
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,359
is in British Columbia for those of you

664
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,000
don't who don't know is a big cannabis

665
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,918
summer we're going to be speaking at and

666
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,359
involved in along with First Nations

667
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,399
groups from British Colombia

668
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,599
and Canada which they have the ability

669
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:02,079
to form their own laws which I think is

670
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:05,319
really powerful and so do they um just a

671
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:08,000
matter of education so these panels are

672
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,439
part of that education everyone talking

673
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,200

everybody on this panel I appreciate the

701
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,519
invite for the opportunity to learn from

702
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,440
a lot of you guys over the years so it's

703
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,079
pretty cool to be sitting here next to

704
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,440
you yeah we're um

705
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,558
regenerative cannabis producers near

706
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,320
Nelson not too far from arenta where you

707
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:31,200
guys are we're LP or a standard we're

708
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:33,558
probably the smallest standard is really

709
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,840
but here with a really small canopy for

710
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:38,599
micro it's 200 meters it's extremely

711
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,079
hard to be profitable at those numbers

712
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:42,759
so we felt we had not much choice but to

713
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,079
go LP or

714
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,398
standard yeah Rose Bud Lake as you

715
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,359
mentioned that's where we are we're this

716
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:52,000
magical beautiful

717
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,519
ecosystem sort of a Wildlife Reserve on

718
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,839
one side and uh Crown Land

719
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,038
surrounding it's a real Wildlife

720
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,918
corridor beautiful everything from loons

721
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,720
and Eagles and wolves and all that sort

722
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,559
of stuff so it's really balanced really

723
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,600
diversity healthy ecosystem so what a

724
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:11,200
great place to do regenerative cannabis

725
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,839
production I think if a synthetic

726
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,519
operation moved in here it would really

727
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,519
have a negative imp

728
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,559
than weed and Community mixed with music

729
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,240
and celebration we're just kind of like

730

this year 500 people expected the judges

743
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,159
um we do a comparison there is not a

744

Cannabis Cup in Canada yet so what we do

746

747
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,000

762

time sh you really put on something

786

787
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,318
last time that we had been social with

788
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,559
people so we've been holding it close to

789
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:06,719
our hearts and lots of demonstrations

790
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,078
everything for wild crafting to building

791
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:13,598
you know Forest Gardens to washing hash

792
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,200
to freeze drying to tinctures to

793
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,440

survive it's it's it's a

795
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,079
self-reliant cannabis plant medicine

796
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:25,920
Festival everything goes we're trying to

797
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,400
create an

798
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,559
open atmosphere one of the most

799
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,358
oppressive socities on Earth we live in

800
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,440
one of the most oppressive societies on

801
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,279
Earth

802
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,280
crazy but we're free because we live in

803
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,319
the mountains and we live on the land

804
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:46,599
that's the message consider moving out

805
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:48,599
to the country living on the land or

806
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,800
working on a community garden in the

807
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,519
city or a lot in your suburb or an area

808
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,680
where you can connect to the Earth

809
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,679
because that's where you're going to

810
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:01,399
have some some buffer from Madness and

811
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:03,879
it's also your point of health or if all

812
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,639
you can do is work and you can't do that

813
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,640
and you're really caught up in this

814
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,879
system and you're on a whole another

815
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:12,639
path you can go and spend all of your

816
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,599
money at the farmers markets where all

817
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,318
of those people are doing regenerative

818
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,720
stuff so then that is you supporting it

819
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,960
so whether you are planting your own

820
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:25,159

913
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:54,599
this should we start yeah um I'll start

914
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,800
uh this with the market collapse I just

915
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,000
had this Epiphany moment that I was just

916
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,720
done

917
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,559
and for me it's like keeping up with the

918
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:07,439
Joneses I was always like one foot in

919
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,719
one camp like trying to keep the farm

920
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,519
alive and one foot in the

921
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:14,559
region ideas of just the whole intention

922
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:17,679
of this land was to build a permaculture

923
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:20,400
Oasis and use cannabis to fund it when

924
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:23,838
that funding just got harder and harder

925
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,800
I was like I give up [ __ ] it and I had

926
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,679
this moment that just after harvest it

927
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,800
was kind of a shitty Harvest last year

928
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:34,679
and I was like all right I'm just doing

929
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:39,519
what I most care about I'm done was

930
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:44,318
always and Katie came on board and uh we

931
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:47,519
had a plan we Sorry Mario M your can you

932
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:49,159

933

934
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:56,000
right after uh Rio love you keep so this

935
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,199
winter I spent the whole winter working

936
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,880
and we just we had a plan we developed a

937
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,679
plan together and she's really into

938
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:09,079
plants which she has the Deep you know

939
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:11,318
knowledge of plants and so that was an

940
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:15,640
asset for me because I'm you know still

941
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:17,880
learning um so I we landscaped and came

942
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:21,000
up with some plans for a new market

943
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:24,960
Garden Katie we filled in a pond that

944
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
was never very useful and so now we have

945
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:32,000
a big flat with Market bed and a whole

946
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:36,318
Hillside that's sted with food and fruit

947
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,519
and nuts and berries and all hles with

948
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:44,000
an old uh the Windstorm blew over a um

949
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:47,719
Live Oak so that one tree built like a

950
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,880
100 by 100 square foot area of hles so

951
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:52,558
we're just making it super spongy and

952
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,760
absorbent so anything that flows down

953
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,680
just catches and then we have a big

954
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,280
cannabis patch under there where we get

955
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,199
to do a lot of

956
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,200
fun sativas and things it's a great spot

957
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:09,118
the cover crop is really abundant and

958
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:14,799
she we developed a yeah a nut and a

959
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:18,240

mixing our own soil for the nursery mix

970
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:43,279
instead of bringing in bags this year we

971
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:47,079
borrowed a cement mixer from Craig and

972
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:51,280
um have just making cacus Coots recipe

973

for soil and uh using soil blockers so

974
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,559
we don't have to use plastic um

975
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,519
containers so we're just soil blocking

976
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,480
everything

977
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:04,159

00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:10,598
the im4 going LA and inoculations I know

980
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,358
our soil's lacking in a little bit of

981
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,559
fungal bacterial activity so the cover

982
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:18,679
crop looks good now we're bringing in

983
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:20,920
the compost and building the and spin

984
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:24,480
chiaki logs from our friend Mike who's

985
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,519
the mushroom cultivator and so he's just

986
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,559
got you know bringing the dump trailer

987
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:31,559
it's amazing amazing he's so beautiful

988
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:38,039
compost give thanks to mushroom Mike as

989
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:40,079
always yeah he just keeps providing for

990
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:42,358
so many people and any of you all out

991
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,240
there who are listening getting a hold

992
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:48,078
of anybody organic mushroom cultivator

993
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,239
in your zone or area because mushroom

994
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,800
blocks are just amazing St mushroom

995
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,479
blocks are great for soil building the

996
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,680
only public service announcement on

997
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,639
mushroom blocks is uh you know make sure

998
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:01,759
that the substrate was organic when it

999
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,358
started right because mushrooms are

1000
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,040
smart they're not going to you know they

1001
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:08,799
yeah they have the power to transform

1002
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:12,800
but really do you want to support like

1003
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,240
non organic substrate no you don't so it

1004
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:20,240
always encourage you know your uh

1005
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,239
mushroom farmer to start with Organic

1006
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:34,558
glyphosate is not just used in the

1007
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,599
agriculture industry or the cut flow

1008
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,800
industry it's uh in the forests and

1009
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,559
they're killing berries like service

1010
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,000
berries which I like to call sarvice

1011
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:46,960
berries because my

1012
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,639
sarice but the the or the Saskatoon

1013
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,240
Berry if you're in Canada superfood but

1014
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:52,838
anyway it's the huckleberries all these

1015
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:55,558
berries that supposedly get in the way

1016
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:57,880
of tree growth and I have you know this

1017
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:00,559
thing like everyone's you know with

1018
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,559
anyway there's a lot to that but so big

1019
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,160
love to you guys on on diversifying

1020
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,040
we've been doing soil blockers too but

1021
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,920
I've been just digging up the soil out

1022
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:11,279
of my garden and mixing a little compost

1023
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,358
in it and just using garden soil for the

1024
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,559
soil blockers yeah just really I want

1025
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:20,000
the seed to wake up and know my garden

1026
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,240
right away rather than some foreign you

1027
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,280
know like made soil type thing that's

1028
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:28,000
just our thought process on it so we're

1029
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:31,559
just like seed wakes up radical root

1030
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,559
comes out they're like

1031
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,880
whoa aren't doing regenerative they're

1032
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,440
indoor their underlights or something

1033
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,079
and it might not have that type of

1034
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,240
intelligence and truly our microbiology

1035
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,880
just eats it alive it never really gets

1036
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:02,759
the opportunity to sprout so another

1037
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,920
reason why you want to be getting seeds

1038
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,640
from breeders like a lot of these people

1039
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,760
that you see on here because we're

1040
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:12,039
growing it

1041
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:15,359
regeneratively to to to have that Gusto

1042
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:16,880
Lala what kind of uh things oh oh wait

1043

00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,920
eastern Potter Valley in the middle

1055
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:00,399
Mountain appalachi

1056
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,960
um I'm almost to Lake County we're in in

1057
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,639
Potter Valley and and even in our little

1058
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,159
region here we're in a little banana

1059
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:11,358
belt at like seven between 23 and 2500

1060
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:14,358
feet you go down 500 feet and it's it's

1061
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:16,078
colder you go up 500 feet is

1062
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:19,759
colder

1063
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,079
um yeah it's uh you know my dad settled

1064
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,599
there kind of the end of the road and it

1065
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,798
turned out to be like a nice little

1066
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,200
micro climate for growing breeding camp

1067
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:31,119
anab you

1068
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:34,679
know we also can you know get stuff to

1069
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,440
go in a hoop in January I harvest like

1070
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:40,719
my last seed run I I start Auto flowers

1071
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,400
in the fall and harvest them in like the

1072
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,118
middle of winter and occasionally have

1073
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,960
to run like a couple nights of heat when

1074
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,400
it gets down to like 20 for a couple

1075
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,159
nights but that's that's rare where

1076
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,599
we're at um the babies are doing good

1077
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,598
yeah number three I'm I'm definitely

1078
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,599
sleep

1079
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:03,798
I'm not drinking I just have three small

1080
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:06,000
children you know because the brain it

1081
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:11,280
it definitely doesn't work like I want

1082
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:15,920
it to work and uh I lose a lot of things

1083
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:18,400
there um yeah what a and this is yeah

1084
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,720
glyat [ __ ] you know that's like the the

1085
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,280
DDT of Our Generation I see it around

1086
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,598
the valley all the time and to some of

1087
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,119
these farmers

1088
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:30,920
and to change their their their

1089
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:32,680
ways she told me to mind my own business

1090
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,440
and I said I am minding my own business

1091
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:37,598
you're spraying poison where my children

1092
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,960
play and she stopped you know and and

1093
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,920
it's like these things like these people

1094
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,280
who do it because it's easy wouldn't

1095
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,880
they wouldn't like be putting a small

1096
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,720
little Drop of Poison into the water or

1097
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,760
their kids food but they will put it

1098
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:52,480
onto their farms and it's wild that

1099
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,440
disconnect there you know that and it's

1100
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,280
just it's just a matter of time you know

1101
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,798
before it's not being used but

1102
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,240
but it's

1103
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:05,280
crazy I would say it almost seems like

1104
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:07,838
it's getting like more common if you if

1105
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,519
that sounds like even possible but yeah

1106
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:10,519
they just to this

1107
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,240
whole maybe maybe because it's like a

1108
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,400
household's kind of stopped doing in Cal

1109
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,919
because it's B so it's got to go

1110
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,480
somewhere else you know there you go

1111
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,119
there that's what it is what are we G to

1112
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,400
do with all these War chemicals oh I

1113
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,440
don't know that's s them to Farmers yeah

1114
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,798
let's put it in the food and I guess

1115
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,720
since the gly has come up a couple of

1116
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:37,159
times we really encourage anyone

1117
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:39,439
listening out there to find out where

1118
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:41,039
glyphosate's being sprayed know that

1119
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,880
when they're roads spraying the sides of

1120
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:46,519
the roads or train tracks near you

1121
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,720
glyphosate is being sprayed um really

1122
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,679
get educated on glyphosate because the

1123
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:54,078
real problems with gut glyphosate is not

1124
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,000
necessarily in your soil yes it's huge

1125
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,200
because soil is the very beginnings of

1126
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,400
life and it holds the very valuable

1127
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,639
microbiology which holds you know

1128
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,039
valuable life forms for plants to be

1129
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:08,639
able to grow but also for our own

1130
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:11,279
microbiome to be able to be healthy or

1131
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,759
our genome and our genome and the these

1132
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,519
type of chemicals actually attack our

1133
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,280
DNA along with our

1134
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:22,199
microbiology which changes way that our

1135
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,760
health and well-being is defined well

1136
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,798
you know now and into the future so we

1137
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:31,040
would recommend

1138
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:31,039
important in in the ADV

1139
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,119
and that's not including daa and all the

1140
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,200
other defoliant there there's thousand

1141
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,200
things but glyphosate is the easiest one

1142
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,879
to talk about but there's many of them

1143
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:15,039
so our recommendation is when building

1144
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,920
indoor gardens either ask the company

1145
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:19,719
that you're getting those leafy products

1146
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,720
from

1147
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:25,558
a or text it yourself and that's going

1148
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:26,959
to be the way that you know that you're

1149
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:29,680
intelligent

1150
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:33,039
Dynamic accumulating sentient being

1151
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:36,159
ganja isn't sucking up that stuff into

1152
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:38,239
its body and into the classic the head

1153
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,558
of the Tricom where which is what we all

1154
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,078
are looking for in some cases we want

1155
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,640
the roots and the seeds and everything

1156
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,440
but anyway Big Love and uh best friend

1157
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,118
Farms Brian out in Maine what's

1158
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,519
happening you're getting to introduce

1159
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,318
yourself and then we're gonna find out

1160
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:56,358
more Tech from the fam and your

1161
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,358
Appalachia where you at

1162
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:07,079
we can't you

1163
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:10,680
there can you hear me

1164
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,680
now can you hear me

1165
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:19,440
now he I'm up in the Foothills okay

1166
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:22,798
sorry I'm in the foothills of main I'm

1167
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,798
at about 600 feet um nestled between the

1168
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:30,039
Atlantic and the the White Mountains I

1169
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:33,880
guess and and yeah so plenty full water

1170
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:37,159
I think there's 14 like 14 or 15 lakes

1171
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:41,079
and ponds in this town so it's kind of

1172
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:43,159
you know a lot of Hills among water and

1173
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:46,079
yeah we're just starting to open up with

1174
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:48,358
the Snows all gone and we get really

1175
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,880
good Sun here so I get great exposure

1176
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:53,598
it's more of a South Southeast sweep I

1177
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,880
think which is really good for Maine I

1178
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,079
bring up too because of the uh the Frost

1179
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,880
potential in the late season and the Dew

1180
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:04,240
so if you get an earlier burnoff and

1181
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,358
exposure to the sunrise Southeast side

1182
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:10,879
of the Hill kind of thing here

1183
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,880
so that's where I

1184
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:17,480
sit and uh you're making really

1185
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,760
incredible hash you know too and what

1186
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,798
are some of the uh maybe some of the new

1187
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,440
varietal you're excited for this

1188
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,199
year yeah actually we're we're making

1189
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,159
hash all the time and I'm just like uh

1190
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:32,960
been constantly breeding to try to find

1191
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:35,759
the best hash making plants so we're

1192
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,199
we're focused on traditional form but

1193
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,440
we're getting some pretty greasy good

1194
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:42,598
air dried traditional stuff out there

1195
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:46,318
and you know kind of following in the

1196
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,440
ways of Frenchie with the same form and

1197
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,558
enjoying it and then uh yeah I've been

1198
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,400
doing a ton of breeding I just went back

1199
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:57,039
to uh my gas mask clone mom with a with

1200
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,599
a bunch of more like fruit forward

1201
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:02,520
uh gas back stuff here so some cherry

1202
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:06,079
chem and some pineapple fields for

1203
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:10,000
additions to the gas mask and I actually

1204
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:12,920
cracked some uh Dominion seeds I I see

1205
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,079
Duke Diamond so I got a friend gifted me

1206
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:19,559
some Dominion G and some local skunk so

1207
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:22,280
the local skunk went in first so yeah

1208
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,319
I'm I'm stoked about those and I got

1209
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,000
some AK Bean brains gear going too the

1210
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:29,920
same friend gifted me some nice stuff

1211
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,838
um yeah I got some super skunk over

1212
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,280
there from you know Andross with a Black

1213
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:38,639
Domina I'm really excited about I got

1214
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,880
some cough bx1 with same with Dave fop's

1215
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,798
help I believe right in with Relic I

1216
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,119
believe was behind it so I've got some

1217
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:50,159
cough which I've been really really

1218
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:51,680
hoping to get back into um classic stuff

1219
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:53,318
and kind of going for it with some

1220
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:55,239
really cool genetic stuff this year I've

1221
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:57,679
even been talking to Colin from vessel

1222
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:59,879
life and we're planning some interesting

1223
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:02,879
project uh breeding projects here on the

1224
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,280
farm which will tie in some more I guess

1225
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,559
land race types even some Moroccan and

1226
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,079
some nepes have been brought up to to

1227
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:11,640
bring back into some lines here in

1228
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,720
theory that are producing really good

1229
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:16,598
hash and go with some more land race

1230
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:20,959
hash oriented uh genetics to see what it

1231
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:24,000
kind of mixes up and yeah

1232
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,679
so I love that that's just candy to the

1233
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,599
ears just hearing about all this stuff

1234
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,798
maybe you can tell us about your hash

1235
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,240
here in a sec but because it's really

1236
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:33,679
interesting what you've got going on

1237
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:36,479
with some of your your

1238
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,558
uh Mis connections and and I also wanted

1239
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,280
to touch on some regenerative things

1240
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,519
that we can talk about a lot of people

1241
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,440
are dealing with toxic environments and

1242
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:47,798
how can we help people in uh uptaking

1243
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,559
some of that toxic material so that's

1244
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:53,519
gonna that's people are asking those

1245
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:55,720
questions microbiology eats toxicity

1246
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,880
cover across microbiology more of it

1247
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:59,239
Mario what's happening in your in your

1248
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,160
neck of the woods tell us something

1249
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:02,558
about your appach your Appalachia your

1250
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:08,159
farm and some of

1251
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:10,559
your hey guys nice to see you happy

1252
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,960
spring can you hear

1253
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,280
me hey can you hear

1254
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:20,318
me cool

1255
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:23,000
um well everything's kind of going well

1256
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:25,920
here for some sheep I got a herd of

1257
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,358
sheep coming in soon and a couple of

1258
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,639
week weeks and uh so I'm building a

1259
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:33,279
little

1260
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:35,759
manger I got a a new flock of ducks that

1261
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,680
I just reared up and today's their first

1262
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,599
day free ranging it's really cool it

1263
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:44,159
feels really good they were ready to get

1264
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:46,599
out I got some M scovies if you guys

1265
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,759
don't know about those they're

1266
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:52,838
awesome and I kind of like read about

1267
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:56,200
them and thought that they would be

1268
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:58,960
awesome but now that I'm like actually

1269
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:04,118
holding one compared to like other

1270
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:06,240
domestic duck breeds their structure is

1271
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:09,760
so much stronger like their bone

1272
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:13,879
structure and muscular and their nails

1273
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:17,599
are sharper they fly they forage better

1274
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:21,039
they're like the ultimate Homestead duck

1275
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:24,318
I'm so stoked on those so I feel like

1276
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:28,039
all the Ducks here are going to be Movis

1277
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:30,759
eventually are those the running

1278
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:32,960
Ducks what's up are those the running

1279
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:36,680
ducks that like don't need the water as

1280
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:40,159
much no ducks they're a totally

1281
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:44,838
different uh type of duck in fact it's

1282
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:48,279
kind of like a horse and a a donkey like

1283
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:51,519
if a if a horse and a donkey have have a

1284
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:54,960
a baby it's a mule but it's infertile so

1285
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,960
if a mcoi and a regular duck have babies

1286
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,559
they're infertile too they're not

1287
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,199
compatible that way so anyway you either

1288
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:06,680
got the Movis or you got the other ones

1289
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:09,118
I'm all about the Movis right now um

1290
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:13,679
yeah the Farm's at, 1300

1291
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:16,280
feet uh I'm here in in Willets right in

1292
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,838
the middle mesino about 45 minutes from

1293
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,359
the coast in the

1294
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:23,199
Foothills

1295
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:27,038
um uh flat land in the valley I've got

1296
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:29,558
uh really nice exposure and great water

1297
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:34,240
um I've been on this site for eight

1298
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:36,798
years now and um from the moment I got

1299
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:40,679
here I kind of like did a permaculture

1300
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:43,599
design of a um like a a livestock

1301
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:47,798
laneway around the whole place and then

1302
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:49,599
planted accordingly to feed livestock as

1303
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:53,280
they pass through and I haven't had

1304
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:56,200
livock until except for like ducks uh

1305
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,000
until until this season with the Sheep

1306
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:00,719
coming in so I'm pretty excited it's a

1307
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,159
huge transition happening right now I'm

1308
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:07,439
thinking just as much about that kind of

1309
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:09,798
stuff as I am of the herb because it's

1310
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:15,280
really about like being able to like

1311
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:18,038
sustain like uh certain lifestyle and um

1312
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,400
and live in in in in this place that we

1313
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:23,440
love to live and pay the bills so right

1314
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:28,119
now the herb isn't really paying the

1315
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:32,440
bills so I'm like staying is fluid and

1316
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:34,960
flexible as possible um you know

1317
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:38,159
diversifying and one of the things that

1318
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:41,440
I'm really focused on is building

1319
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:43,038
alternate income streams with

1320
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,280
existing

1321
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:50,160
infrastructure like like how many like

1322
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:52,720
returns can I get from that 2inch line

1323
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:54,960
that's running through my field or you

1324
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:57,399
know what what kind what kind of

1325
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,599
resources do I have on the land that I

1326
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,920
can like

1327
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:07,680
like kind of like do as little as

1328
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:11,119
possible to get return from you know and

1329
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:14,679
and and keep it all like fertile and

1330
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:17,920
abundant and keep the fertility on site

1331
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:20,919
as much as possible you know so I'm

1332
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:25,480
giving a lot of thought to that kind of

1333
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:30,639
stuff any question or I just I just like

1334
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:33,400
to that emotion and say many DM farmers

1335
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:36,920
are realizing and part of the demm

1336
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:40,318
certification is other crops the whole

1337
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:42,599
entire thing is to be that you don't buy

1338
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,400
products and that you have a polyculture

1339
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:48,760
and that polyculture is not just with

1340
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:51,200
plants it's with people and seeds and so

1341
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,079
lots of farmers are diversifying jaw

1342
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,159
Gardens move had to move and he's

1343
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:57,160
planting hundreds of fruit trees you

1344
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:58,798
know and it's it's amazing you know to

1345
01:02:57,159 --> 01:03:01,318
see what people are doing I remember

1346
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:04,079
Terry Willard telling me uh you know

1347
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:06,199
that the the eonia farmers were making

1348
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,920
tons of money you know back in the day

1349
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,759
and then all of a sudden eonia just got

1350
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,440
flooded from everywhere in the world and

1351
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:15,559
all of a sudden eonia farmers were just

1352
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:18,960
lost and the point is any one thing can

1353
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:21,960
go away so the more that we have you

1354
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,960
know

1355
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:40,558
prodcts as tertiary products at quadri

1356
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,480
products whatever squary I don't know

1357
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:46,039
where I'm going but we're having a lot

1358
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:49,000
whatever it is and we always have said

1359
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:52,799
it isn't about you being in business for

1360
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,798
two years about are you going to be here

1361
01:03:52,798 --> 01:04:00,679
with a brand that matters with an ed

1362
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:00,679
educational force that matters in 10

1363
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:08,440
that's something isn't making money

1364
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:10,960
we're gonna go to something else so I'd

1365
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,720
love to hear from everybody what are you

1366
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,240
diversifying with that's gonna keep you

1367
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:20,118
here what what's what's working for

1368
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:23,679
you I would say I can go on

1369
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:26,000
that I would say just on a short thing

1370
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:29,078
perennial crops

1371
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,400
just I like things that you can put in

1372
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:34,760
that are going to keep giving you

1373
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:37,278
returns with very little input that's

1374
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,720
that's really what I'm focused

1375
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:40,760
on I agree with that you could do things

1376
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:45,000
like

1377
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:47,599
blueberries or things like uh you know

1378
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,440
fruits and stuff those never really I

1379
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,119
mean people like the sugary sweets and

1380
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,278
those things kind of return for years

1381
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,880
and years and years which is pretty cool

1382
01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:56,318
but I've been diversifying I mean if you

1383
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,160
look at my instagam

1384
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:01,558
I post a lot of a decent amount of car

1385
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:03,199
stuff from vws and Audi's and it's just

1386
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,119
you know I've kind of had a knack for

1387
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,199
automotive mechanics and the used car

1388
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,400
Market's pretty hot right now so I've

1389
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:12,078
been kind of saving these old uh you

1390
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,920
know 20-year-old Volkswagens and Audi's

1391
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,599
resurrecting them and then you know

1392
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:19,358
moving them along to kind of um stay

1393
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:22,240
afloat after you know kind of a hard

1394
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:24,798
season and a hard winter um so I think

1395
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:29,479
that like using any other skills you

1396
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:31,759
know that we pick up from you know our

1397
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,760
various experience throughout life you

1398
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,960
know kind of taking taking a step back

1399
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,960
and reflecting on those things and then

1400
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:43,760
trying to um you know to to Pivot to

1401
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:47,440
Pivot into a more diverse network of

1402
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,599
like income streams or or or whatever

1403
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,599
you

1404
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:56,599
know and have you looked into electric

1405
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:59,078
conversions for old VW I'm seeing a lot

1406
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:01,880
about like how easy it is to to convert

1407
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:04,000
like an old VW bus to Electric like

1408
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,358
drive it in and then that day you come

1409
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,440
out with an electric bus type thing have

1410
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:09,598
you heard of is that interesting to you

1411
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,960
I was just wondering what your thought

1412
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:15,720
is and then we'll move on you can

1413
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:17,559
definitely do that that is like that's

1414
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,399
definitely doable but with my

1415
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:23,278
infrastructure here at the cabin um you

1416
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,639
know I have very rudimentary electricity

1417
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:27,880
um and I don't have like a garage I have

1418
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:29,480
one structure on my land and it's pretty

1419
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:33,640
much the room that I'm sitting in right

1420
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:35,838
now um so you know with but my thoughts

1421
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:39,679
on the electric batteries it it's kind

1422
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:41,558
of a hard thing to uh to balance in my

1423
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:45,038
mind you know with like the Mind

1424
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:46,599
minerals the cost um you know the

1425
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,799
difficulty in wiring and different

1426
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:52,278
servos and stuff like that I I'm just

1427
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:52,278
you know I'm not I I wouldn't say I'm

1428
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:59,400
familiar agreed we would have to go back

1429
01:06:56,358 --> 01:07:01,199
to what is everybody else more common

1430
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,200
just yeah more products I want to hear

1431
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:06,480
about what people are doing for

1432
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:08,519
secondary things I bet there's a way to

1433
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,798
you know create an alternative energy to

1434
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:12,960
do the electrical in the cars I mean I

1435
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:17,038
know I'm in Crest Creston is doing some

1436
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:19,920
amazing work with um biofuels and like

1437
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:24,160
there there must be a way to to do this

1438
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,159
anyway that was a thought

1439
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,719
excellent yeah it's super cool stuff I'm

1440
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,519
really uh I'm really interested in that

1441
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:34,278
engineering side of things because it's

1442
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:36,000
kind of you know overshadowed with a lot

1443
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:39,199
of stuff and I think it's also important

1444
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:43,199
to get your engineer on uh as a farmer

1445
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:43,199
as a you know as a human

1446
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:52,199
being in talking to a lot of uh people

1447
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:54,838
in the California market like canos

1448
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:56,519
Market it's like manufactured products

1449
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:59,480
seem to be

1450
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,278
much more stable so our tinure product

1451
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,519
is actually the one that's getting us

1452
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:04,719
through this

1453
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:09,079
spring because that's the only income

1454
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:10,399
we're really that's Reliant um so we're

1455
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:15,199
looking for

1456
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:18,719
more ideas to develop on farm value

1457
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:18,719
added you know with

1458
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,199
Elderberry get package products and get

1459
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:28,000
that

1460
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:31,559
out yeah older berries are an amazing

1461
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,000
crop to grow um they just produce and

1462
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,440
they're so stable um we actually have

1463
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,439
like six

1464
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:55,119
differentopic farming years ago and ever

1465
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,119
since he did I've been going down so

1466
01:08:55,119 --> 01:09:00,519
many rabbit holes on you know creating

1467
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:01,719
these and you know it's Sim similar to

1468
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,279
what we've all been talking about with

1469
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:05,759
regenerative farming and all that but

1470
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,880
it's really using biomimicry and you

1471
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,838
know even before indigenous agriculture

1472
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,279
just like the way that nature compiles

1473
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:13,158
things and us being able to learn from

1474
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,679
that and be able to create these

1475
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:17,719
self-sufficient systems that are going

1476
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:21,239
to just keep growing and evolving into

1477
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:23,480
these beautiful things um and eventually

1478
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:26,000
just become you know its own stable

1479
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:29,000
source of everything that it needs needs

1480
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,719
and uh we've actually been yeah that's

1481
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,479
what we're we're kind of excited about

1482
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:37,640
right now is that um where our medicine

1483
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:37,639
Garden um had

1484
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,480
under

1485
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:12,000
stor and elderberries are a big part of

1486
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:14,319
that elderberries and then some other um

1487
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,158
just really easy ones to kind of things

1488
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:18,399
that are drought resistant things that

1489
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,879
be able to create shade layers so other

1490
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:21,879
things could be able to get established

1491
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,239
and grow through into you know more

1492
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:27,679
stable canopy and where we just have

1493
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:29,238
continuous different crops coming up and

1494
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,960
and that's one of ours is like we're

1495
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:32,718
looking of how like a permaculture

1496
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,679
teacher told me like every Farm should

1497
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,719
have seven different incomes seven

1498
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:38,359
streams so I've been trying to work

1499
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,119
towards that for a while and now with us

1500
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:43,759
all like combining forces there's four

1501
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:45,238
usdm Farmers out here I'm really excited

1502
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,320
about you know we all have different

1503
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:51,079
ideas and figuring out our um different

1504
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,920
paths and we're all alined but it's like

1505
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:54,359
what we really love is the Copic is

1506
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,640
going to be able to provide all my

1507
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:58,599
commercial herbs but then also we'll

1508
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,039
either have hemp or cannabis in it this

1509
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:04,280
next year we'll have tree layers berock

1510
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:06,840
yeah yeah lots of berock ashas you know

1511
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:08,359
these ones that I need a blot of um for

1512
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,480
the products and then we also all

1513
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:13,158
different kinds of pollinators and

1514
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:17,359
copsis and dianis

1515
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:20,079
and yeah you guys have a top three like

1516
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:22,880
uh perennial

1517
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:24,319
Berry list that you could kind of shout

1518
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,480
out right now because I'm looking to

1519
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:28,238
plant like three more different types

1520
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:32,879
I've got the previous owner of this

1521
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:35,039
Homestead had what's that Cape

1522
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,119
Gooseberry it's more of a self- seater

1523
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,800
it's not a perennial but you know you

1524
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:41,439
grow one and it's going to keep coming

1525
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,760
back and it's it just spreads and the

1526
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:45,439
amount of berries that you get off of

1527
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,840
just one plant is just it's absolutely

1528
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:50,479
amazing and it's such a delicious thing

1529
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,760
to be able to you know experience it's

1530
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:54,479
such a unique flavor and it's fun to get

1531
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,320
down there and kind of harvest every day

1532
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:58,279
for your berries and whatnot and it's

1533
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:59,479
very low-lying the way that it I mean it

1534
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:01,238
could grow tall depending on if it's

1535
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:03,439
reaching for light light or not but if

1536
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:06,718
it has a nice open area the way that the

1537
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:10,279
arm spread is just it's it's so unique

1538
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:12,319
and beautiful the Goji I GOI because you

1539
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:14,119
can use the leaves for teas you can also

1540
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:15,840
use the berries and I just like how it

1541
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:17,319
spreads and it can be done in many

1542
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,960
different climates and if you have a

1543
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:21,319
little bit of shade yeah I was going to

1544
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,319
say Works in Michigan or not yeah

1545
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:26,920
blueberries be depending on your you

1546
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:29,439
know it grows here

1547
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:32,719
I I know there's some folks in Ohio that

1548
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,719
was doing that so has

1549
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:38,679
anyone has anyone done aonia berries yet

1550
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:40,960
are awesome for a system yeah oh my God

1551
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:44,158
the me that comes from those I've read

1552
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,520
done aronia it does really good here

1553
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:48,000
yeah it's one of my favorites and it's

1554
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,880
in col so Colorado is kind of rough on

1555
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,760
some things but aonia berries do really

1556
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,960
well here awesome yeah yeah so there's

1557
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,440
so there's so many I mean it really just

1558
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,760
depends on where you live right what

1559
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:59,479
your news are raspberry for me is a

1560
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,480
really big crop here because I use a lot

1561
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:03,919
of raspberry leaf and our smoking Blends

1562
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:05,519
and teas does really well and it's yeah

1563
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,600
it's great and it's just like always

1564
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,239
producing so my little one just always

1565
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,960
goes and eats the berries and we're

1566
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:13,039
harvesting all the leaves and chopping

1567
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,760
and drop in it and it comes back so

1568
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:17,920
vigorous so yeah it's also it always

1569
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,360
depends on what your kind of user needs

1570
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,119
are as well as what's going to grow

1571
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:27,158
around that area yeah Alexandra I know

1572
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:32,880
an other one which is called

1573
01:13:27,158 --> 01:13:37,920
jberry and that grows even in um Alberta

1574
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:40,760
like uh Calgary area it's very tough um

1575
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,800
a bush and uh you can always make

1576
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,039
cutting so easily of it and it's a it's

1577
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:51,639
a hybrid

1578
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:55,800
between uh a black currant and um uh

1579
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:58,760
Gooseberry and I and a really nice big

1580
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,279
uh blueberries and you can freeze them

1581
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,000
or whatever but I would recommend that

1582
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:06,198
for wherever you

1583
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:09,560
live especially for tough areas

1584
01:14:06,198 --> 01:14:12,119
absolutely great I'm really excited have

1585
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:14,360
produced them over and over again I will

1586
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:17,000
this year have SE already a whole bunch

1587
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:19,599
of flowers on

1588
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,119
it oh beautiful perfect well I have that

1589
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,719
written down nice we should figure out a

1590
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:27,920
way to share all these resources like

1591
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,010
like little bit um you know we have

1592
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,189
it

1593
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:32,189
[Music]

1594
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:47,600
have page and a private one for for de

1595
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:49,039
and pure family the private one no one

1596
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,600
uses anymore but it could always be

1597
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:54,519
activate at any time one Barry I would

1598
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:57,719
add would be the C Buckthorn C Buckthorn

1599
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,920
has been really good for us and it's an

1600
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:03,000
incredible uh you know one to make

1601
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:06,920
medicine and products with it's super

1602
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,679
spiky and weird and it like continues to

1603
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:11,719
grow it like propagates itself

1604
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:14,760
throughout the the ground uh we also you

1605
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:17,399
know yeah and it can be put in a lot of

1606
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:20,679
skin it's not it's not very tasty but it

1607
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:24,359
can be put in skin care products and it

1608
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:25,600
just is super beautiful for really high

1609
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:27,920
vitamin C

1610
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,840
so anybody out there who has the the

1611
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:34,079
freeze dryers or they do dehydration at

1612
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:36,800
all they're just really amazing to grind

1613
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:39,479
up and put in for vitamin C and also I

1614
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,880
would add one more the has cap Berry

1615
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:44,279
which is I believe it's Japan I may be

1616
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,960
wrong about that but uh uh it's like a

1617
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:49,158
blueberry but it BL it blooms super

1618
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,800
early it's actually it's actually from

1619
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:54,198
the honeysuckle family there you go and

1620
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,880
um it was created up here off of a

1621
01:15:54,198 --> 01:16:00,479
hybrid H suckle in the Calgary area so

1622
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,719
it's actually Northern and it just

1623
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:05,119
continues to go and go the only problem

1624
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:08,679
with it birds love it birds love the

1625
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:11,319
berries as well as deer love the leaves

1626
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:14,440
so in the winter time if you have a lot

1627
01:16:11,319 --> 01:16:16,960
of uh snow you you have to cover it so

1628
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:20,599
the deer don't get to it but they are

1629
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:23,319
delicious and they're a true red fruit

1630
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:25,039
and they are so plentiful you know how a

1631
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:27,559
blueberry is not quite blue it's it's

1632
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:30,238
just the skin is blue it's a white fruit

1633
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,320
but this is red on the outside and red

1634
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:35,158
all the way through so when you work

1635
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:36,840
with it and you eat it it's just so red

1636
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,559
really beautiful fruit and also the

1637
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:42,800
dwarf cherries we have this medicinal

1638
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:45,679
cherry tree that's like it tastes so

1639
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,800
like weird and bitter but it's dark

1640
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:51,239
red and so I think I've seen those in

1641
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,840
Hawai somewhere maybe not though I don't

1642
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:56,399
know Lala please put these in the chat

1643
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,319

1644
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:02,039

more you know those were some great

1655
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,480
ideas with with perennials and with

1656
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,480
berries because they're great on the

1657
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:39,638
market anybody else has been doing some

1658
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:41,678
amazing things for some secondary income

1659
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:43,560
I wanted to also say like uh different

1660
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:46,279
deer resistant crops and things like

1661
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,039
that to be able to do bordering around

1662
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:50,279
uh your plants and things that are

1663
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:52,039
really uh you know drought resistant

1664
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,399
that could like different allows and

1665
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:55,238
things like that and being able to use

1666
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:57,119
that as uh you know you could sell it as

1667
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:58,479
an input or use it for your farm I mean

1668
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,158
the amount of oxin that you're able to

1669
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:05,119
get out of it is absolutely amazing um

1670
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:05,119
if you're you know reproducing and you

1671
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:18,800
s it's so beautiful the you know

1672
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,679
biodiversity that you can create with

1673
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,360
just within that you know species just

1674
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,319
keep telling us really it's like we're

1675
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:27,799
only limited by our imagination

1676
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:30,279
you know because we can grow we can do

1677
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:32,840
so much with what capable if you have a

1678
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:35,238
piece of land and you really are it's

1679
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:38,199
like it depends on your interest and you

1680
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:40,839
really are only limited by what you can

1681
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:43,559
really create and conceive and that's

1682
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,239
when we smok in a joint really great it

1683
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:48,199
comes in you can go sit in your garden

1684
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:50,439
and ideas just come and flow and like

1685
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:52,719
one of ours is right now our other

1686

01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,239
seed production like we've been waiting

1744
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:22,319
our whole lives for this the rest has

1745

01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:35,599
at night I do it in the winter it's it's

1751
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:37,678
definitely my part-time job that became

1752
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,239
the only money that I really saw this

1753
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,840
winter you know was from from seed sales

1754
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:44,479
and it you know without that I would

1755
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:48,600
have had to uh you know gone to for

1756
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:52,399
somebody else uh to get get through the

1757
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:55,000
winter and yeah it's been such a

1758
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:57,000
blessing and I'm converting some of um

1759
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
the farm to a little more seed

1760
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
production

1761
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:19,719
um expressing 25% autof flowering and

1762
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:23,039
I'll be doing three types of Autos per

1763
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:25,480
bed but one breeder and if I'm

1764
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:28,039
successful I'll make aund 120 new

1765
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:31,599
Autoflower hybrids

1766
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:34,479
and uh I'm excited I'm growing some haze

1767
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,520
from Noble from Golden fig Gardens

1768
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:39,238

1769
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,760
there and and yeah we're we've been

1770

planting we have a lot of fruit trees a

1771
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:45,760
lot of food but the drought's been so

1772
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,480
hard on us as a mountain Farm you know

1773
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,199
uh I don't have the rain catchment in

1774
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:54,119
storage that I need to farm in a drought

1775
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:56,158
so you know we look forward to in the

1776
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:58,599
future to be able to increase that so

1777
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:01,719
that I can really dial in you know more

1778
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:03,960
of the poly culture and just I got a lot

1779
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:05,279
of holes to to fill in for you know the

1780
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,198
rest of my life once we get a little

1781
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,559
more

1782
01:23:06,198 --> 01:23:11,879
water and this is

1783
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,880
saraphina oh

1784
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:25,559
baby Jay do you want to say something I

1785
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:27,840
saw you coming in

1786
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,719
sure yeah I'm I'm likeminded with you

1787
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,719
all here about

1788
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:48,679
diversity we do a lot of mushroom

1789
01:23:46,279 --> 01:23:52,960
production we got about 10,000 plugs

1790
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:56,158
going right now uh Rishi Lions man

1791
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:58,079
shitake and some big big hles U we did

1792
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:01,439
some land clearing and so we made use of

1793
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:05,719
that that Lumber it's about our big one

1794
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:08,000
we call the the wall it's about 150 feet

1795
01:24:05,719 --> 01:24:11,119
and about 17 feet high it's sort of a

1796
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,039
sep Holzer kind of takeoff massive hugle

1797
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:15,760
bit we do a lot of food production in

1798
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:18,679
that mostly for our staff and ourselves

1799
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:20,920
at this point the big idea though is to

1800
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:23,920
here in Canada if you can make 10,000 a

1801
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:25,279
year in uh traditional agriculture

1802
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,239
because of course cannabis isn't

1803
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:30,679
considered agriculture for some crazy

1804
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:32,559
reason then you can claim Farm status so

1805
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:34,119
we've been working towards that every

1806
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,600
year adding more and

1807
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:39,079
more and just building more and more

1808
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,679
gardens the the value added line the

1809
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:44,399
product line that's super key so that's

1810
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:47,199
where we make our profit the uh the

1811
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:49,879
biomass market right now is is really a

1812
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:52,000
tough situation so I think it's super

1813
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:54,440
important to diversify into value added

1814
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,238
products if it's possible because that's

1815
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:58,479
see what's going to add stability to the

1816
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:00,399
company Long

1817
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:01,678
Term having that's something else we're

1818
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:03,000
doing trying we're working with our

1819
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,920
community here we got this thing called

1820
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,079
The Rose buddy program we're finding

1821
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,359
micros shutting down all over the place

1822
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:12,800
right now because of that issue with

1823
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:15,639
trying to sell biomass on a saturated

1824
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,960
market and there's not a lot of interest

1825
01:25:15,639 --> 01:25:20,079
in small Lots because a processor takes

1826
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,679
on more risk in that scenario theyd

1827
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:24,039
rather just buy a Big Lot thousand kilos

1828
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:25,719
so the people that are getting it the

1829
01:25:24,039 --> 01:25:27,679
harsh I are the micros and they're the

1830
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:30,158
ones that need it the most because they

1831
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,440
have such a small amount of biomass for

1832
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:35,238
sale so what we're doing is we're

1833
01:25:32,439 --> 01:25:37,439
providing genetics one of our strains

1834
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:40,118
are really excited about this really

1835
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:43,158
climatized well to our region and

1836
01:25:40,118 --> 01:25:46,639
support we do a a regenerative Health

1837
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:48,599
Canada Canada Revenue just support call

1838
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,840
once a week or excuse me every second

1839
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:53,000
week just to kind of navigate through

1840
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,360
all these things and then the idea is

1841
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,639
although we're still not quite there yet

1842
01:25:55,359 --> 01:26:00,599
is to buy the biomass back from these

1843
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:03,880
farmers at a fair market value and we'll

1844
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:05,159
put that into our own product line um we

1845
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,079
can't of course we can't do this

1846
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:08,599
regenerative on mass scale and so in

1847
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:11,359
order to get into the stores we need

1848
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,520
more biomass we've capped our site at a

1849
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:17,198
fairly small footprint to keep that

1850
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:19,320
regenerative and high quality craft and

1851
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:21,559
in fact craft is a new category here in

1852
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:23,319
Canada too are pretty excited to have a

1853
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,639
lot of input on the creation of that

1854
01:26:23,319 --> 01:26:28,519
category but that's another opportunity

1855
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:29,840
to help us uh survive in this market as

1856
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,880
small

1857
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,600
producers so yeah some of the other

1858
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,520
things we're we really just keep looking

1859
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,159
at stacking functions diversifying what

1860
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:41,760
I'm actually excited about we're bit

1861
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:44,039
away is um te we one of our Guild one of

1862
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,239
our support species do a lot of mint do

1863
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:47,238
a lot of

1864
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:21,799
very cool man well

1865
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:23,319
said thanks friends I love what you're

1866
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:25,639
it's important what you're doing up here

1867
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:28,158
Shay and and people really appreciate

1868
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:30,880
you and all the rose buddies are all you

1869
01:27:28,158 --> 01:27:33,439
know part of our family and and

1870
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,520
stuff and pure certified too and I think

1871
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:36,279
that we'll probably do more of these

1872
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:38,199
hash churches with other pure certified

1873
01:27:36,279 --> 01:27:40,960
Farms that you know aren't on here now

1874
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:43,759
so they can tell their story as well but

1875
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:46,039
I also think that some regen camps uh

1876
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,719
would be good at your spot you know for

1877
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:52,319
the for for this area for for British

1878
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,319
Columbia because

1879
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,079
to do something you know in our bio

1880
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,880
region and I want to continue talking

1881
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:08,118
about regenerative practices like

1882
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,800
farming too oh I didn't want to cut you

1883
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:12,359
off go ahead shade you had something to

1884
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,400
say I just be all into that like this

1885
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:16,359
diversity overlaps beyond our business

1886
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:19,319
but into our community and that's really

1887
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:21,519
the big like this plant is a power plant

1888
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:23,639
it's super duper key and important but

1889
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:26,280
it's just one plant but it's part of a

1890
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:28,840
big closed loop system which is our

1891
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:30,840
community small and large you know our

1892
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,440
world community so if we can do things

1893
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,880
here to support people to support

1894
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:38,000
themselves and support their Community

1895
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:41,199
uh just like regenerative classes but

1896
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,520
food production and you know all of the

1897
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:45,279
things all of the things and how they

1898
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:47,159
all connect together body mind and soul

1899
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,679
you know from meditation and how you

1900
01:28:47,158 --> 01:28:50,519
take care of yourself to how you take

1901
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:52,520
care of your land and how you take care

1902
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,440
of your community that's really what

1903
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,280
this is all about and I'm super excited

1904
01:28:54,439 --> 01:28:58,719
that we're all joining together and we

1905
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:01,519
have beautiful place like where we live

1906
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:03,439
to demonstrate these things to actually

1907
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,320
not just talk about them but demonstrate

1908
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:07,599
them and collectively we all have our

1909
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:10,079
niches we all have our powers and we can

1910
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,840
show our one or two or five amazing

1911
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:15,039
things we've done that the next Farm

1912
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,159
hasn't but so collectively we can date a

1913
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:19,679
better world pretty easy in my opinion

1914
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:21,799
I'm stoked to be part of

1915
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:23,440
that me and Craig were just talking

1916
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,480
about that the other day how much you

1917
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:28,158
know we've all vibed off each other over

1918
01:29:25,479 --> 01:29:31,118
all these years and I've Just Seen

1919
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:32,799
everyone's Farm come up including our

1920
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:35,799
own you know we've been doing this a

1921
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:39,119
long time and all that 15 16 years now

1922
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:41,000
on this Farm you know a lot of bounty um

1923
01:29:39,118 --> 01:29:42,639
but every single time I have a

1924
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:47,118
conversation with someone I feel like I

1925
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:49,239
pick up uh you know support so yeah

1926
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:51,679
communication something I'd like to

1927
01:29:49,238 --> 01:29:53,678
address uh the chat there was someone

1928
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:56,520
that said that they have a hard time

1929
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:58,000
getting seeds well that would be a great

1930
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,080
time to address this right now because

1931
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,479
we do have a breeder on the panel lots

1932
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:05,238
of breeders on this panel that I know

1933
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:09,039
and they all ship seeds all over the

1934
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:10,359
world I think um so Reach Out DM them um

1935
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:11,840

01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,079

01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:14,360
from you know growing their own and

2007

01:34:22,118 --> 01:34:25,880
like they they can't do it it or some

2031
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:27,399
people just don't have the time or

2032
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,520
whatever so the products available you

2033
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:31,799
can get it from you but yall never had a

2034
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,800
problem with the the sharing of that you

2035
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:37,360
know they all were like so awesome about

2036
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:39,159
just uh teaching people and you know

2037
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:42,359
just like you know it's awesome things

2038
01:34:39,158 --> 01:34:44,599
so uh I've always told people like okay

2039
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:47,039
here's here's how you mix this so yada

2040
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,639
yada but you know like I don't have room

2041
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:52,359
for that man it seems like a lot of work

2042
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:55,118
so I figured hey for those folks you

2043
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:57,279
know take a from Josh and Kelly make it

2044
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:59,839
available to people you know otherwise

2045
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:02,920
you know they can just make their own so

2046
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,279
that's kind of kind of what I'm doing uh

2047
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:07,960
for my

2048
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:10,639
multiple revenue streams like the sav

2049
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,639
business folks

2050
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:20,559
say um

2051
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:22,399
I I um the the way how I grow I always

2052
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,480
make sure that I'm collecting my own

2053
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:27,479
seeds not just from the cannabis of

2054
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:30,439
course but also from everything else of

2055
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:33,079
the vegetables and of course I noticed

2056
01:35:30,439 --> 01:35:35,719
as you BBY did too your own seeds are

2057
01:35:33,079 --> 01:35:37,920
always much more full of life they come

2058
01:35:35,719 --> 01:35:42,000
up and like almost

2059
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:45,039
100% um for me it's also super important

2060
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,118
that people uh know how to grow their

2061
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:52,079
own food it doesn't matter how whether

2062
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:55,599
it's in a farm or in a small space um

2063
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:58,279
years and years ago um I was told to

2064
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,000
make sure to educate people that they

2065
01:35:58,279 --> 01:36:05,039
are growing their own food because we

2066
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:08,039
will come to a point where that will be

2067
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:10,880
uh not available anymore and we see that

2068
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:13,519
already how it happened whether it's now

2069
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:17,079
through the virus what happened but I

2070
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:20,000
also know it from my family in Germany

2071
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:24,039
uh because of whatever happened in in

2072
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:28,479
the Ukraine um suppli or certainly not

2073
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:31,158
happening anymore um but also the nature

2074
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:34,479
itself tells already uh it's a diversity

2075
01:36:31,158 --> 01:36:37,238
it's not only one thing and uh in my

2076
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:39,079
many years of growing gardens there's

2077
01:36:37,238 --> 01:36:40,919
always something that doesn't doesn't

2078
01:36:39,079 --> 01:36:43,519
turn out and something else that turns

2079
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:45,520
out much better the way of nature saying

2080
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,080
hey this year you need much more beads

2081
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:53,760
or you need much more beans blah blah

2082
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:57,920
blah uh but what I wanted to ask you um

2083
01:36:53,760 --> 01:37:01,960
do you have any uh experience of keeping

2084
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:03,840
your seats a long terms are you uh

2085
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:07,279
including the canabas of course but also

2086
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,520
other seeds are you just put them into a

2087
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:11,840
cold storage or do you have any

2088
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:15,239
experience with

2089
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:20,279
freezing freezing the the the seeds to

2090
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:22,678
yeah absolutely uh one thing that like

2091
01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:25,039
it was like a common mistake was people

2092
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:27,039
were starting to put things in a in a

2093
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:30,960
freezer way too early right there's

2094
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:30,960
still moisture there and

2095
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:50,839
um eight weeks like extrem dry time I

2096
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:52,679
don't uh I don't bundle things up like

2097
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:55,199
I've seen some people put them all in a

2098
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:57,920
jar right away that's that's no good so

2099
01:37:55,198 --> 01:38:00,000
like a turkey pan you know or whatever

2100
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,319
you got uh something that's not going to

2101
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,639
hold moisture and lay them all out nice

2102
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:07,599
and uh nice and flat and making sure

2103
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:10,719
that they got that good long dry time um

2104
01:38:07,599 --> 01:38:15,639
once you're once you're good and dry

2105
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:18,840
um so from pollen to to seeds and

2106
01:38:15,639 --> 01:38:20,480
everything I personally I like to break

2107
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:23,800
everything down into like what I'm going

2108
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:26,359
to use so instead of putting you know 5

2109
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:28,440
or 100 or whatever seeds together I'm

2110
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:30,559
looking like what is a single use for me

2111
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:32,479
like what would I be taking out to use

2112
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,679
that way I'm not bringing the whole bulk

2113
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:36,799
in and out of the freezer you know

2114
01:38:34,679 --> 01:38:40,760
condensation and everything can happen

2115
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:42,880
too so um something freezer safe uh

2116
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,880
container wise but within that I like to

2117
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:47,880
break everything down into like what I

2118
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:50,079
would use so uh individual pack of say

2119
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:53,039
cannabis seeds you know I might have you

2120
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:55,079
know 15 together or something like that

2121
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:58,960
um and then I can break out exactly what

2122
01:38:55,079 --> 01:39:00,840
I need um so for your long-term storage

2123
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,158
that's good uh if you know like you're

2124
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:05,920
going to be using it you know

2125
01:39:03,158 --> 01:39:08,759
respectably in the near future uh I like

2126
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,319
just the refrigerator uh refrigerator

2127
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,079
does good for like what you know you're

2128
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:14,559
going to be getting into and then the

2129
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:16,198
freezer for long term and then you're

2130
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,159
kind of like replicating that

2131
01:39:16,198 --> 01:39:20,598
stratification you would see out in

2132
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:22,638
nature anyway with you know you know

2133
01:39:20,599 --> 01:39:24,960
summer going into fall winter and then

2134
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:28,279
back to Spring and I've always had real

2135
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,279
real good results like

2136
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:35,638
that and how long do you think can seed

2137
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:39,880
blast in a

2138
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:42,960
freezer oh a really really long time um

2139
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:45,039
I know uh somebody brought up uh AKA

2140
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,760
Bean brains uh at the beginning of the

2141
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:49,880
show he's a good friend of mine um you

2142
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,360
know he's he had stuff in there well

2143
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:55,560
over 20 years and broke them out and

2144
01:39:52,359 --> 01:39:57,960
germinated them and you know no problem

2145
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:01,520
yeah definitely keeps them keeps them

2146
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:03,760
keeps them well like I said the trick is

2147
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,400
you know keeping it keeping it like that

2148
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,880
you know so and like he hasn't moved you

2149
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:10,679
know he's been living in the same place

2150
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:12,199
forever so that makes it easy too but

2151
01:40:10,679 --> 01:40:14,440
once you got it frozen you know keep it

2152
01:40:12,198 --> 01:40:16,598
frozen till you need what you need and

2153
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:18,559
when you're storing just make sure that

2154
01:40:16,599 --> 01:40:20,440
you're putting in there like sizable

2155
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,960
like what you what you need and not

2156
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:26,000
going you know back in and out and yeah

2157
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:27,800
that's pretty much it in a nice

2158
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,599
container you know something freezer

2159
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:33,400
safe you know and uh yeah you're you're

2160
01:40:30,599 --> 01:40:35,880
good to go and uh label label everything

2161
01:40:33,399 --> 01:40:38,479
accordingly like to put dates on things

2162
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:41,520
so you kind of you know have an

2163
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:43,399
idea that's that's great thank you and I

2164
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:47,880
think that's also a good information for

2165
01:40:43,399 --> 01:40:49,559
everyone else because um when I do like

2166
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,840
carrot seeds I did my own carrot seeds

2167
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,080
it was amazing but I have so much of

2168
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:57,719
course from one little plant to get

2169
01:40:54,079 --> 01:41:01,599
abundance so to keep it because Kos

2170
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:05,079
seeds also can be really quickly not be

2171
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:08,199
viable so I will put all those um into

2172
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:11,719
little packages and and then have your

2173
01:41:08,198 --> 01:41:15,118
own um seat um

2174
01:41:11,719 --> 01:41:18,319
security yeah absolutely and if you go

2175
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:20,759
to like um a place that sells like beads

2176
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:22,439
and things like that normally they uh

2177
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,679
they have like little small containers

2178
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:27,399
that are good or if you can find like

2179
01:41:24,679 --> 01:41:30,199
the vials or something like that that's

2180
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:32,118
cool too um yeah you can find like

2181
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:35,359
little small packages to keep your stuff

2182
01:41:32,118 --> 01:41:38,039
in y um and there was a place I used to

2183
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:40,000
order my bags from my seed packs like

2184
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:42,840
you can get like the the friendly

2185
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,520
biodegradable bags too you know you take

2186
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:48,119
it up a take it up a notch it's got the

2187
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:50,400
little green seal on it and everything

2188
01:41:48,118 --> 01:41:53,439
um and they're like the same price as a

2189
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:56,238
normal plastic baggie or whatever yeah

2190
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:56,238
so yeah that are

2191
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:04,920
def are going you know um it used to be

2192
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,319
like so like my father he he grew up

2193
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,359
through the Great Depression and

2194
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:11,759
everything farmer and all and that was

2195
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:14,519
always instilled from me early on um

2196
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,560
growing you know vegetables and uh some

2197
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:18,480
fruit trees and canning things for the

2198
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,679
winter like that's just kind of like

2199
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:22,718
what we did then when I traveled around

2200
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:24,920
and got away from there it's like like

2201
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:28,480
wow no body else really does this you

2202
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:33,118
know so it's it's good and you know if

2203
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:35,399
you're running a farm um hell man like

2204
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:37,319
you if you can cut costs you know

2205
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:40,118
because like you know bringing money's

2206
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:41,920
in but saving money is even better and

2207
01:42:40,118 --> 01:42:44,439
you know if you can grow your own food

2208
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:47,679
you know you're not you know spending

2209
01:42:44,439 --> 01:42:49,519
out canning things and you know go to

2210
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:52,000
farmers market sell your jellies your

2211
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,679
jams uh like people were talking about

2212
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,118
your teas and everything

2213
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:58,399
then you're you know cutting cost on you

2214
01:42:56,118 --> 01:43:00,639
know living in general so that's always

2215
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:06,839
a great way to make some money that and

2216
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:06,840
efficiency you know yeah I like things

2217
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:21,679
mean you put my seats in there and write

2218
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:24,439
it on uh that's the way how my recycle

2219
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:26,960
works and maybe put a little something

2220
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:30,919
into make sure it's not getting moist in

2221
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:33,439
in that I understand that thank you nice

2222
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:35,000
um Katie and Rio I saw you guys were

2223
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:36,919
wanting to say something but Rio walked

2224
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,880
out Katie did you want to jump

2225
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,000
in so I have a question because someone

2226
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:44,000
asked in chat in our chat here about

2227
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,840
freeze drying seeds like maybe that's a

2228
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,439
good topic to talk about does anybody

2229
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:51,079
know about that or no don't freeze dry

2230
01:43:48,439 --> 01:43:53,279
seeds you can't freeze dry seeds no

2231
01:43:51,079 --> 01:43:54,880
makes them inv

2232
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:56,399
spores I think is the only thing that

2233
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,319
you can like fre freeze dry and it'll

2234
01:43:56,399 --> 01:44:01,679
live that I know of yeah you just want

2235
01:43:59,319 --> 01:44:05,000
to replicate what the plant is going to

2236
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:07,719
do in its ultimate optimal conditions

2237
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,198
and for it to come back year after year

2238
01:44:07,719 --> 01:44:13,279
just like Duke was saying you know you

2239
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:15,678
really want to dry that out so um I know

2240
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:17,639
for us we've been doing some secondary

2241
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:19,239
things we just got involved in all the

2242
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:22,639
Saturday markets we've done Saturday

2243
01:44:19,238 --> 01:44:24,519
markets in years past and uh this year

2244
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:27,319
we deed Ed that we were going to jump in

2245
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:31,159
and do all Saturday markets and get our

2246
01:44:27,319 --> 01:44:33,639
crew on making sure to get you know our

2247
01:44:31,158 --> 01:44:35,238
salads and and some secondary product

2248
01:44:33,639 --> 01:44:37,199
you know whatever we've got excess in

2249
01:44:35,238 --> 01:44:39,718
the garden because so much of it goes to

2250
01:44:37,198 --> 01:44:43,079
our chickens so much of it goes to our

2251
01:44:39,719 --> 01:44:45,760
compost that we really want to make a

2252
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:48,599
really concerted effort because we also

2253
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:51,840
put away a lot so because we have so

2254
01:44:48,599 --> 01:44:54,319
much abundance I also really want to

2255
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:57,039
talk to people who have abundance on

2256
01:44:54,319 --> 01:45:00,079
their Farms is to let's start hooking up

2257
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:02,960
with people who can take it to Market

2258
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:05,800
because so much of it is is just being

2259
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,520
composted and there's a lot of youthful

2260
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:10,199
people that want to be involved in this

2261
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,719
regenerative culture so you know people

2262
01:45:10,198 --> 01:45:13,960
who want to get a hold of people who are

2263
01:45:11,719 --> 01:45:15,960
growing foods and say hey if you all are

2264
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:18,560
wasting any we'd like to come out once a

2265
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:21,719
week and get that to Market or get it to

2266
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:23,480
the homeless I know that everybody is is

2267
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:26,639
seeing what's going on we have more

2268
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:30,879
homeless people in North America in the

2269
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:34,719
world than ever it is absolutely insane

2270
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:36,960
and to know that regenerative Farms have

2271
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:39,719
access this is also where licensing just

2272
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:42,039
makes me so [ __ ] pissed off we used

2273
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:47,399
to is that there's cannabis that's even

2274
01:45:42,039 --> 01:45:47,399
being like burned because it's

2275
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:05,118
you can donate it for the maximum value

2276
01:46:01,719 --> 01:46:05,118
of that and it's a tax write

2277
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,719
off so you can donate it and get it to

2278
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,479
these people

2279
01:46:09,719 --> 01:46:13,480
yeah well that's people

2280
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:21,000
who and can't even get it to a processor

2281
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:23,040
to get it out or have I've seen I've

2282
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,719
seen people like burning it on Instagram

2283
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:26,519
just thr I think that's more just like

2284
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:28,079
you know those people who burn sports

2285
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,719
jerseys because someone got traded to

2286
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:33,840
another team you know it's like I don't

2287
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:36,279
quite yeah I don't know you know

2288
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:39,679
honestly we've definitely composted a

2289
01:46:36,279 --> 01:46:42,279
tremendous amount you know in the past

2290
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:45,319
maybe because you know

2291
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:47,920
whatever and and just in years and years

2292
01:46:45,319 --> 01:46:50,880
and years you look at like our outdoor

2293
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:54,480
crops from time ago and changes in

2294
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:57,118
markets and changes in politics and just

2295
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:59,598
you know when you're in the industry for

2296
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:02,598
30 years all we're saying is of

2297
01:46:59,599 --> 01:47:04,400
different values in different medicines

2298
01:47:02,599 --> 01:47:07,199
there's different values like what Josh

2299
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:09,198
had mentioned in eonia you know if you

2300
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:10,960
put all of a sudden maybe everybody is

2301
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:13,359
starting to grow blueberries well then

2302
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,198
the price of blueberries in your area

2303
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:17,039
grows goes down tremendously and then

2304
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:19,479
you have to make a secondary product

2305
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:22,238
with those blueberries so just really

2306
01:47:19,479 --> 01:47:23,359
thinking outside of the box and that's

2307
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:25,598
mean vinegar

2308
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:27,519
and alcohol are something that we could

2309
01:47:25,599 --> 01:47:31,239
really look into making more of I mean

2310
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:33,800
vinegar is really easy to make and it's

2311
01:47:31,238 --> 01:47:36,079
a really useful extract for medicines

2312
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:39,800
even psychedelic mushrooms can be

2313
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:42,319
extracted with vinegars and um it's

2314
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,960
really healthy for you um it's it's a

2315
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:47,279
fermentation that lasts throughout the

2316
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:50,439
winter you can clean with it um I think

2317
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:52,920
having your own dis your own still what

2318
01:47:50,439 --> 01:47:54,359
legalities is whatever you know having

2319
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:56,158
your own still makes all the sense in

2320
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:57,960
the world you know you're making your

2321
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:59,719
own alcohol you're making your own

2322
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:01,158
tinctures now you're making your own

2323
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:04,480
medicine there's a reason why it was

2324
01:48:01,158 --> 01:48:07,079
made illegal it's too useful anything

2325
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:09,279
that's been made illegal start learning

2326
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:11,880
about it that's what you should be

2327
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:13,719
doing because there's the whole point is

2328
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:17,840
it's empowering you and that's not what

2329
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:17,840
they want so this is a

2330
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:23,359
empowerment yeah learning how to make

2331
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,400
alcohol is very useful and vinegar is

2332
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:28,960
like now CNN's going to take that one

2333
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:28,960
little clip amazing

2334
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:35,679
like they already forgot about us don't

2335
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:37,158
worry we talking about the ethers as

2336
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,480

1994 and when we came back from Costa

2415
01:52:05,238 --> 01:52:11,158
Rica we took our stuff from Guatemala

2416
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:13,359
and sold it in Boulder on the street and

2417
01:52:11,158 --> 01:52:16,719
got a house in Steam we got a sweet

2418
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:18,679
condo the Bas but the weed wasn't good

2419
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:22,118
enough at that time we had to bail we

2420
01:52:18,679 --> 01:52:23,760
had to go I couldn't work I couldn't

2421
01:52:22,118 --> 01:52:28,158
work Steamboat Springs because I had

2422
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:30,840
earrings and long hair so at first at

2423
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:33,238
first I tried putting my hair up

2424
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:36,000
earrings out and I even passed the weed

2425
01:52:33,238 --> 01:52:38,598
test because I did the the I did the

2426
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,679
niin and a bunch of golden seal and I I

2427
01:52:38,599 --> 01:52:42,199
I passed the weed test and then I was

2428
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:44,480
like you know what [ __ ] this they're

2429
01:52:42,198 --> 01:52:46,879
gonna see me with long hair afterwards

2430
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:49,879
hire me so I just did construction all

2431
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,520
year in 25 below weather oh yeah but we

2432
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:53,199
left because the we wasn't that great

2433
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:55,000
then we had we had we used to call it

2434
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:58,359
the Rocky Mountain High for some reason

2435
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,960
it was all swag weed in in uh in a

2436
01:52:58,359 --> 01:53:01,759
steamboat at the time it was all

2437
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:04,279
Mexicans so we were sending out this

2438
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:07,480
purple kush at the time from Southern

2439
01:53:04,279 --> 01:53:12,000
Oregon which was like the craziest

2440
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:13,799
purple like Tara's bright it was fuchsia

2441
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,319
purple when it was I don't know if you

2442
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:17,679
remembers the purple from like the late

2443
01:53:15,319 --> 01:53:19,479
80s and 90s it I don't know why purple

2444
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:21,239
cush you don't really see it the real

2445
01:53:19,479 --> 01:53:23,238
purple same way no one goes like dude

2446
01:53:21,238 --> 01:53:25,198
check out my purple Cush back in the day

2447
01:53:23,238 --> 01:53:27,879
like that was some of the most skunky

2448
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:30,399
gnarly [ __ ] in southern Oregon and we

2449
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:32,199
were sending it out to Colorado you know

2450
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:34,960
and then it was just getting too crazy

2451
01:53:32,198 --> 01:53:37,439
so but Craig were you in Steam wa where

2452
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:42,439
were you at in Colorado yeah I was in

2453
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:45,238
Steamboat uh in 9 like2 to 94 so I left

2454
01:53:42,439 --> 01:53:47,319
right before you guys got there and yeah

2455
01:53:45,238 --> 01:53:49,238
the the herb was all right there was a

2456
01:53:47,319 --> 01:53:51,559
couple folks that had a had a little

2457
01:53:49,238 --> 01:53:53,158
something something going on it produced

2458
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:54,960
some decent herb but for the most part

2459
01:53:53,158 --> 01:53:57,559
it was garbage Steamboat was more about

2460
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:01,800
blow back then it was kind of crazy what

2461
01:53:57,560 --> 01:54:04,320
type of town it was um and uh the the

2462
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:08,599
kind of the the gray cloud that would

2463
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:10,519
hang over it because of that right um

2464
01:54:08,599 --> 01:54:12,400
but yeah I'm glad Colorado got the herb

2465
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:15,079
scene figured out a little bit better

2466
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:16,839
for the sake of the the population in

2467
01:54:15,078 --> 01:54:20,479
all these rural mountain

2468
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:22,480
towns it's not easy to grow cannabis

2469
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:26,039
here it's not easy to grow anything

2470
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:28,279
thing in Colorado to be perfectly honest

2471
01:54:26,039 --> 01:54:30,639
I mean unless you're going to dig up and

2472
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:32,840
replace and do ridiculous things to make

2473
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:35,319
it like limp along until suddenly you

2474
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:36,360
hit such imbalances you're like oh my

2475
01:54:35,319 --> 01:54:38,118
God and then you have these

2476
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:40,880
differentials in temperature that really

2477
01:54:38,118 --> 01:54:43,399
literally swing 60 degrees and you've

2478
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:46,000
got no season like the next season and

2479
01:54:43,399 --> 01:54:47,799
I'm trying to naturalize of cannabis

2480
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,439
here and I've been doing it for seven

2481
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:52,000
years and I actually asked Duke a

2482
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:56,039
question at one of his seed um panels

2483
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:58,760
and he gave me such support and just

2484
01:54:56,039 --> 01:55:00,960
because I was scared of what I was doing

2485
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:02,960
but I've got babies coming up there

2486
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,920
every out there every year and every

2487
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,760
year I get surprised by some little

2488
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:10,599
anomaly and I just keep throwing

2489
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:12,639
genetics at it um I Craig gave me a

2490
01:55:10,599 --> 01:55:15,119
little bag of something at the regen

2491
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:18,039
conference so that's make making its way

2492
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:21,279
out there so anyway that's my

2493
01:55:18,039 --> 01:55:22,880
crazy now I remember doing it now I

2494
01:55:21,279 --> 01:55:27,118
remember and

2495
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:30,000
Expo yeah yep that's when it

2496
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:31,960
was tomarrow did you have a thing to add

2497
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,238
our I we were talking about tinctures

2498
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:37,920
and alcohols and shrugs and vinegars and

2499
01:55:35,238 --> 01:55:39,359
self reliance and you wanted to talk

2500
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:42,078
tomorrow did you want something to say

2501
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:42,078
do you have something to

2502
01:55:44,238 --> 01:55:50,039
say I kind of don't remember

2503
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:52,759
now but there's always something to say

2504
01:55:50,039 --> 01:55:55,719
on self-reliance and um I mean that's

2505
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:58,119
definitely one thing um I have wanted to

2506
01:55:55,719 --> 01:55:59,599
achieve here is like the apple vinegars

2507
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:02,000
and that's why like behind us we have

2508
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:04,000
the apple tree and it's a few years old

2509
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,439
you know I planted in 2017 we have

2510
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,198
another and every year we're getting

2511
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:09,678
more and more but it's like with those

2512
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:11,598
fruit trees you have real abundance it's

2513
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:13,520
like get your fruit trees in first

2514
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,599
that's one tip that I always like to

2515
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:17,239
tell people who are just getting land or

2516
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,239
if you've had land for a while just like

2517
01:56:17,238 --> 01:56:22,479
the best time to plant a fruit tree is

2518
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:24,279
now and you got any um more you got any

2519
01:56:22,479 --> 01:56:28,718
new products you're excited about

2520
01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:30,279
tomorrow oh uh I have a few let's see

2521
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:33,078
I've got the herbal syrup which I

2522
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:37,319
started doing and that's the one where

2523
01:56:33,078 --> 01:56:41,880
it's um I've got uh let's see it's

2524
01:56:37,319 --> 01:56:44,920
nettle horel rose hips eia berock root

2525
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:47,039
and dandelion root and then I've mixed

2526
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:49,359
that together with some local honey that

2527
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:54,078
we have and the local honey has some of

2528
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:56,679
our CBD infused into it and um that CBD

2529
01:56:54,078 --> 01:56:58,319
is coming from the RSO that we create

2530
01:56:56,679 --> 01:57:00,279
and so that's infused into the honey

2531
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:02,679
then the honey gets infused into this

2532
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:07,198
really strong decoction of all these

2533
01:57:02,679 --> 01:57:09,440
herbs and then in that goes an ounce of

2534
01:57:07,198 --> 01:57:11,439
um or half an ounce of like California

2535
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:13,799
poppy I do the whole plant poppy

2536
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:17,078
tincture and then I do a whole plant

2537
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:19,039
dandelion Ure that goes in that as well

2538
01:57:17,078 --> 01:57:20,840
so those are like some of my favorite

2539
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:24,519
things I've been creating lately that

2540
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:28,159
and I do a two to one with THC to CBD

2541
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:31,360
and then the high CBD of like 500

2542
01:57:28,158 --> 01:57:33,359
milligrams um and so and then I'm

2543
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:37,920
working on a facial line right now where

2544
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:40,759
it's like I have the exfoliant a nice um

2545
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:43,679
sugar scrub and then you have your

2546
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:47,119
facial oil cleanser then you have your

2547
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:50,239
facial oil and also in between that you

2548
01:57:47,118 --> 01:57:53,960
have your rose hydrol and then there is

2549
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:53,959
a cream on

2550
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:20,520
those are um what I really enjoy playing

2551
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:23,840
with and uh created heal thyself Gardens

2552
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:26,840
product line to be able to expand as I

2553
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:29,279
expand and grow and add products with it

2554
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:31,639
and um the more abundance that we have

2555
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:34,039
with our herbs as we keep growing our

2556
01:58:31,639 --> 01:58:36,520
Gardens here the more abundance we have

2557
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:41,000
the more the product line can grow and

2558
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:43,760
the more ideas come and uh

2559
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:46,760
yeah thanks for asking

2560
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:48,639
that and Craig you know we were talking

2561
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:50,920
earlier about your farm and we were

01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:11,800
decision a few years back to really uh

01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:19,119
Appalachians and having that taste of

2573
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:20,919
toar um really you have to really start

2574
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:24,639
thinking about what your what your goal

2575
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:29,359
is and that was for to grow resin and uh

2576
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:33,039
and to and to produce um hash with that

2577
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:35,839
and um not only produce hash but we also

2578
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:38,880
wanted to keep the regenerative mindset

2579
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:42,400
or regenerative practices moving forward

2580
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:45,840
so we partnered with uh Nasha extracts

2581
01:59:42,399 --> 01:59:48,439
right here in in Humble County um Baron

2582
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:51,599
uh Lutz is is the owner and operator of

2583
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:54,598
that and and we wanted to bring forward

2584
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:55,520
um nothing fresh frozen you know we

2585
01:59:54,599 --> 01:59:57,119
didn't want to have all these

2586
01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:00,280
regenerative practices to plug a

2587
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:02,880
condenser into it until it's consumed um

2588
02:00:00,279 --> 02:00:06,399
and have it plugged into the grid so

2589
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:07,719
Baron is so supportive of trying to push

2590
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:10,719
this forward through the entire

2591
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:14,198
California Market where we just released

2592
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:16,158
a Black Box series and it is our farm

2593
02:00:14,198 --> 02:00:20,638
cured um

2594
02:00:16,158 --> 02:00:23,679
resin uh rosin and um that's been great

2595
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:27,440
success and the cult we used was guava

2596
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:30,199
gift um and and we worked with um uh

2597
02:00:27,439 --> 02:00:32,559
green Source Gardens and and one thing

2598
02:00:30,198 --> 02:00:35,118
with it with going with the guava gift

2599
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:37,079
you know uh when you're producing for

2600
02:00:35,118 --> 02:00:39,158
resin you know you could go with a GMO

2601
02:00:37,078 --> 02:00:41,960
which would be like an industrial

2602
02:00:39,158 --> 02:00:44,039
standard and it's going to produce

2603
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:46,359
amazing clear resin and it's going to

2604
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:49,238
return it you know over 20% blah blah

2605
02:00:46,359 --> 02:00:51,559
blah but then you have these outliers

2606
02:00:49,238 --> 02:00:54,519
right and the guava GIF came through and

2607
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:57,560
produced you know between 17 and 18% so

2608
02:00:54,520 --> 02:01:00,159
it still produces well um but it has the

2609
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:02,639
tping profile the richness the depth

2610
02:01:00,158 --> 02:01:05,638
that some of these uh more mainstream

2611
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:08,520
cultivars don't have so it's important

2612
02:01:05,639 --> 02:01:12,359
to support these breeders that are

2613
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:16,960
pushing uh the the the boundaries and

2614
02:01:12,359 --> 02:01:21,679
trying to pull uh tricomes out of these

2615
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:23,880
deeper lines and not just grab a GMO and

2616
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:27,078
and you know do some pollen chucking

2617
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:30,078
like uh Duke was saying here and and to

2618
02:01:27,078 --> 02:01:32,479
go deep into their vaults and pull some

2619
02:01:30,078 --> 02:01:34,719
of these land races out and and start

2620
02:01:32,479 --> 02:01:37,039
going for those waxier tricomes so we

2621
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:39,158
can do some extraction around that and

2622
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:41,560
and to be truthful that's really what

2623
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:43,598
has been a differentiator for our farm

2624
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:46,760
is number one going deep into our

2625
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:48,560
regenerative practice uh not scaling we

2626
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:51,039
we learned that scaling is really

2627
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:53,039
failing and and finding that perfect

2628
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:56,719
model for how many people actually live

2629
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:59,679
on your farm and and that's kind of how

2630
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:01,480
big of a footprint you can have close

2631
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:03,199
that Loop within that we see that

2632
02:02:01,479 --> 02:02:05,319
happening on a couple of the Farms here

2633
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:08,198
whether it's he heel thyself or lady

2634
02:02:05,319 --> 02:02:10,439
sativa I went to Lady sativa and you

2635
02:02:08,198 --> 02:02:12,960
know you've got three generations

2636
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:16,399
running around that farm and and re's

2637
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:19,480
trying to look at try to build minimal

2638
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:21,479
minimal housing infrastructure to

2639
02:02:19,479 --> 02:02:23,559
support that because you have the farm

2640
02:02:21,479 --> 02:02:25,319
as your front yard and your living room

2641
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:28,560
so there's no need to have all this

2642
02:02:25,319 --> 02:02:30,238
massive roof space and and you know

2643
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:31,679
industrial footprint on the farm when

2644
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:36,000
you can just utilize what's out your

2645
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:38,399
front door um but I I think I think for

2646
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,238
us like I said it's it's the choosing of

2647
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:43,479
the cultivars and working within the

2648
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:44,959
network um to find what really works and

2649
02:02:43,479 --> 02:02:46,879
the other thing that really surp

2650
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,560
surprises a lot of folks when we talk

2651
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:53,078
about uh our farm in particular and our

2652
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:55,440
model is we're only 10,000 fet 75% of

2653
02:02:53,078 --> 02:02:59,359
that is all from seed sungrown you know

2654
02:02:55,439 --> 02:03:02,000
full season and then uh and from seed I

2655
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:05,000
forgot if I mentioned that um and then

2656
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,238
the uh the second component is 25% of

2657
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:11,719
our farm the 2500 square feet is light

2658
02:03:07,238 --> 02:03:15,279
depth but I should say it's just Su

2659
02:03:11,719 --> 02:03:17,679
grown and we just use an occlusion loock

2660
02:03:15,279 --> 02:03:20,399
some of that sunlight so we get one

2661
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:22,279
extra Harvest a year and it's not really

2662
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:25,000
even a greenhouse it's just a structure

2663
02:03:22,279 --> 02:03:26,840
to support that occlusion tarp um to

2664
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,840
block the Sun and then our second round

2665
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:31,279
is a set it set it and forget it I call

2666
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:34,800
it where we just put the plant straight

2667
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:38,359
in do nothing and that one always goes

2668
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:41,039
whole plant to to resin production

2669
02:03:38,359 --> 02:03:43,639
because we've learned with that second

2670
02:03:41,039 --> 02:03:45,399
second run that um and especially when

2671
02:03:43,639 --> 02:03:47,400
you start growing for resin you've got

2672
02:03:45,399 --> 02:03:50,198
enough going on especially with 75% of

2673
02:03:47,399 --> 02:03:52,319
our production being seed grown Sun

2674
02:03:50,198 --> 02:03:55,279
grown um

2675
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:58,920
and that um takes up a lot of time that

2676
02:03:55,279 --> 02:04:00,800
time of year so we like having that last

2677
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:04,000
or second round of depth even though

2678
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:06,599
we're not depping it to be this uh

2679
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,719
specifically for resin the the bud size

2680
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:12,599
can be small we're not judging the flour

2681
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:16,399
the infloresence of it we're just really

2682
02:04:12,599 --> 02:04:19,360
monitoring the resin and ready for the

2683
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:21,719
peak production and the most flavor and

2684
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:23,039
the the best for extraction so those

2685
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:24,520
those are a little bit you know that

2686
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:26,599
kind of ties into a little bit of what

2687
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:29,239
we were talking about earlier on what we

2688
02:04:26,599 --> 02:04:31,039
can do on the farm um and I I want to

2689
02:04:29,238 --> 02:04:34,359
tie in one other piece to what we can do

2690
02:04:31,039 --> 02:04:37,039
on the farm to revenue stream you know I

2691
02:04:34,359 --> 02:04:40,679
I made brief mention that we did some

2692
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:44,000
activism and activism brought you know

2693
02:04:40,679 --> 02:04:48,000
over $4 million four weeks of work $4

2694
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:50,039
million didn't have to leave our pockets

2695
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,238
in our Humble County you know farmer

2696
02:04:50,039 --> 02:04:55,800
Network and sometimes when we're dealing

2697
02:04:52,238 --> 02:04:58,118
with such a parasitic supply line and

2698
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,520
Taxation how do we protect ourselves

2699
02:04:58,118 --> 02:05:03,000
from those parasites so the other thing

2700
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:05,840
we're doing is we're doing a lot of just

2701
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:09,319
self-education on how to do some of our

2702
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:10,360
own um compliance work and maintenance

2703
02:05:09,319 --> 02:05:12,719
there's so many things we have to do

2704
02:05:10,359 --> 02:05:17,198
with the water board and all these

2705
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:17,198
documents and websites and

2706
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:33,678
and conserve and and work with each

2707
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:36,439
other to get rid of a lot of the

2708
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:39,279
parasites in the supply

2709
02:05:36,439 --> 02:05:41,719
line I just have to say Craig I just

2710
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:43,679
love listening to you you always speak

2711
02:05:41,719 --> 02:05:47,760
so well and I had the privilege of going

2712
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:49,399
to Craig's farm and it is a amazing

2713
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:51,239
amazing and is that the hash that I got

2714
02:05:49,399 --> 02:05:56,158
to smoke the one that you're talking

2715
02:05:51,238 --> 02:05:59,158
about I think I think so I yeah yeah

2716
02:05:56,158 --> 02:06:01,279
fire fire I have smoked some amazing

2717
02:05:59,158 --> 02:06:02,920
fire and that was amazing fire thank you

2718
02:06:01,279 --> 02:06:05,158
for the privilege and the honor to visit

2719
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:07,158
your farm and thank you Josh and Kelly

2720
02:06:05,158 --> 02:06:09,799
because through you I have met this

2721
02:06:07,158 --> 02:06:12,679
amazing family and continues it

2722
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:14,920
continues to grow so thanks yeah thank

2723
02:06:12,679 --> 02:06:18,880
you so much for that Tara and really

2724
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:22,078
want to shine light on on on Baron's

2725
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:24,000
work at Nasha right like in a in the

2726
02:06:22,078 --> 02:06:26,000
California market right now when fresh

2727
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,599
frozen is like it and it's got to be

2728
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,279
purple gas and blah blah blah blah it's

2729
02:06:28,599 --> 02:06:34,078
not interested in that you know he's in

2730
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:36,639
over 300 shops just doing this Farm

2731
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:38,719
cured resin and and how important that

2732
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:41,719
is if you guys check out our Instagram

2733
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:44,880
at alpen glow Farm 707 you can see some

2734
02:06:41,719 --> 02:06:48,840
of these melt shots of the of the guava

2735
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:53,440
gift and it's just this beautiful Amber

2736
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:57,639
and one thing with you know uh res uh

2737
02:06:53,439 --> 02:07:00,078
Farm cured rosin and uh you do get down

2738
02:06:57,639 --> 02:07:02,520
the supply line as it goes out you will

2739
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:05,118
get a little Haze over it and there's

2740
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:08,360
nothing to fret there you know it it

2741
02:07:05,118 --> 02:07:11,479
gets a little buttered looking but the

2742
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:15,000
flavor and the turps are

2743
02:07:11,479 --> 02:07:18,558
solid so as a regular hash smoker I only

2744
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,158
dab um there is a big difference between

2745
02:07:18,559 --> 02:07:24,559
live and cured and what you're talking

2746
02:07:21,158 --> 02:07:26,238
about that cured all that really G

2747
02:07:24,559 --> 02:07:28,079
someone really has a hard time dabbing

2748
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:29,558
and they're like constantly coughing and

2749
02:07:28,078 --> 02:07:31,960
that's the thing that they really hate

2750
02:07:29,559 --> 02:07:33,480
about it because I find as as I go

2751
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:35,399
through the communities and I talk to

2752
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:37,319
people about dabbing they're like God I

2753
02:07:35,399 --> 02:07:38,719
just hate that coughing and I feel like

2754
02:07:37,319 --> 02:07:40,479
I can't breathe and I'm like well first

2755
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:42,439
of all you're taking too big of a dab

2756
02:07:40,479 --> 02:07:43,879
but you know bring that back but you

2757
02:07:42,439 --> 02:07:46,279
know that cured stuff that you're

2758
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:49,520
talking about it's off gas all that

2759
02:07:46,279 --> 02:07:51,719
really really you know cost the mon

2760
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:55,079
Turpin you're talking about mon what

2761
02:07:51,719 --> 02:07:57,599
give you the Harvest hack yeah thank you

2762
02:07:55,078 --> 02:08:00,558
and I I think so people if you if you

2763
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:02,639
get a chance to try them both there

2764
02:08:00,559 --> 02:08:05,199
there definitely is different there's a

2765
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:06,719
difference there so yeah Tara one thing

2766
02:08:05,198 --> 02:08:07,879
one thing that we actually just had the

2767
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:10,920
conversation with Baron we're gonna be

2768
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:13,719
doing a side by side so we're we're

2769
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:19,279
actually gonna do a batch of fresh

2770
02:08:13,719 --> 02:08:22,000
Frozen um not to uplift that market so

2771
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:25,039
much but to just really get some d of

2772
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,599
points around a side by side here's the

2773
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:30,800
same cultivar grown in the same Farm you

2774
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:33,559
know kind of do our own chall and get

2775
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:36,320
the data points from the testing and

2776
02:08:33,559 --> 02:08:37,639
consumers so um that's a really exciting

2777
02:08:36,319 --> 02:08:40,238
and it's going to be a white box so we

2778
02:08:37,639 --> 02:08:42,920
have the white box Black

2779
02:08:40,238 --> 02:08:46,359
Box yeah that's super sweet and I really

2780
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:49,840
it's an amazing point that activism can

2781
02:08:46,359 --> 02:08:51,799
be something that adds to your profit at

2782
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:54,078
the end of the year um you know

2783
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:55,800
especially in Canada it's really it's

2784
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:58,599
really hard Shane knows I mean there's a

2785
02:08:55,800 --> 02:09:00,920
lot of taxes everyone's there's some

2786
02:08:58,599 --> 02:09:01,920
something at everyone so yeah just stand

2787
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:04,039
that's what we're going to do at this

2788
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:06,440
cannabis Summit com coming up is talk

2789
02:09:04,039 --> 02:09:09,479
about you know ways that fars can

2790
02:09:06,439 --> 02:09:12,319
diversify through Farmgate sales and not

2791
02:09:09,479 --> 02:09:14,158
having to go through Distributors some

2792
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:17,519
people like going through Distributors

2793
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:19,479
and Distributors can make sense but in

2794
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:21,639
other cases it's nice when you can

2795
02:09:19,479 --> 02:09:25,000
directly communicate with your cons

2796
02:09:21,639 --> 02:09:27,359
consumers and get products and and and

2797
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,880
also getting rid of microbial testing

2798
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:32,078
which we have here in Canada is an

2799
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:34,279
invasive microbial testing system which

2800
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:37,279
makes it to where you can't actually get

2801
02:09:34,279 --> 02:09:41,719
true herbal medicine to the market in

2802
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:45,679
many cases um so we're trying to is

2803
02:09:41,719 --> 02:09:47,279
doing it Shay is doing it but it is very

2804
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:50,279
difficult but he's doing it through this

2805
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:53,319
in topicals and and always trying to

2806
02:09:50,279 --> 02:09:55,840
make the way through Market you know so

2807
02:09:53,319 --> 02:09:58,279
I just and I don't know if maybe someone

2808
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:01,800
can speak about the California Market in

2809
02:09:58,279 --> 02:10:03,840
the sense of testing like just testing

2810
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,960
for

2811
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:09,719
human

2812
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:13,399
path as opposed to just blanket testing

2813
02:10:09,719 --> 02:10:19,279
for all my cfms or whatever and it seems

2814
02:10:13,399 --> 02:10:21,920
ridiculous that we are still having this

2815
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:24,439
convers how are we still

2816
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,800
having this conversation well we're

2817
02:10:24,439 --> 02:10:30,000
still having this conversation because

2818
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:33,880
the other side the corporate entity

2819
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:36,960
doesn't want to grow good beautiful

2820
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:40,520
healthy medicinal taste good make you

2821
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:43,760
feel good make you be able to elevate

2822
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:47,280
your mindscape all of these things are

2823
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:50,000
what Legacy Farmers regenerative farmers

2824
02:10:47,279 --> 02:10:52,599
are creating inside of the secondary

2825
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,439
metabolites which happen through the

2826
02:10:52,599 --> 02:10:57,559
microbiome of the plant when you have a

2827
02:10:55,439 --> 02:11:00,439
set microbiome of a plant that means

2828
02:10:57,559 --> 02:11:03,760
it's coming from the soil so when we're

2829
02:11:00,439 --> 02:11:06,198
talking about regeneratively growing a

2830
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,639
plant we're talking about regenerative

2831
02:11:06,198 --> 02:11:12,638
soil growing a

2832
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:12,639
plant to the people it

2833
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:19,039
doesn't radiate your weed in order to

2834
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:21,960
get it to the consumer my question to

2835
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:25,840
you all what advice do you have to

2836
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:28,279
Canada and Canadian policy makers having

2837
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:32,599
to do with gamma

2838
02:11:28,279 --> 02:11:34,719
radiation micro testing um and you know

2839
02:11:32,599 --> 02:11:36,960
and get you know and and making it to

2840
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:40,319
where people can sell to Consumers well

2841
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:42,279
we don't even have the ability to put

2842
02:11:40,319 --> 02:11:45,799
you don't even have the ability to put

2843
02:11:42,279 --> 02:11:48,880
your like logo you can say where it's

2844
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:52,039
from but say like Shay can't say all of

2845
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:54,920
the different Farms that he gets his

2846
02:11:52,039 --> 02:11:56,399
biomass from and maybe he can we don't

2847
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:59,000
know and you can tell us if we're wrong

2848
02:11:56,399 --> 02:12:00,359
about on the label it's too small so you

2849
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,439
know you might they have these weird

2850
02:12:00,359 --> 02:12:04,799
foldout labels here in Canada and so you

2851
02:12:03,439 --> 02:12:07,039
know the thing is they took away the

2852
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:09,760
Organic certification for indoor growing

2853
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:11,960
in Canada and they have this invasive

2854
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:14,239
microbial testing which makes it to

2855
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:16,319
where you have to essentially mostly

2856
02:12:14,238 --> 02:12:19,118
radiate the weed to get it to the market

2857
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:21,920
what advice do you have to to Canadian

2858
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:23,719
policy makers we're GNA go

2859
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:26,920
hand because we're going to go hand

2860
02:12:23,719 --> 02:12:30,000
toand and we're doing it anyway we're

2861
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:32,158
going to be doing trade hand toand

2862
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,840
through these relational

2863
02:12:32,158 --> 02:12:38,558
networks that blockchain makes Available

2864
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:41,800
To Us by the way um we get to write our

2865
02:12:38,559 --> 02:12:43,679
own contracts and if I say that my I'm

2866
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:46,039
going to be supported through my

2867
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:48,639
ecosystem and then my ecosystem is going

2868
02:12:46,039 --> 02:12:50,238
to be nested within a larger ecosystem

2869
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:51,960
and everything is linked by that and

2870
02:12:50,238 --> 02:12:53,558
it's relational and I do business with

2871
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:55,719
you because I know you and I see you and

2872
02:12:53,559 --> 02:12:57,719
I love you we're doing it anyway so if

2873
02:12:55,719 --> 02:13:01,198
you all want to get on with the program

2874
02:12:57,719 --> 02:13:03,960
and be loving humans on this planet then

2875
02:13:01,198 --> 02:13:06,678
officials can you kindly with great

2876
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:10,198
heart listen to us because we're

2877
02:13:06,679 --> 02:13:12,639
speaking the language of Earth and we

2878
02:13:10,198 --> 02:13:15,279
have good news we can feed each other

2879
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:19,679
and have abundant thriving livs and

2880
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:19,679
that's exactly what I would say to them

2881
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:35,679
in the common sense approach but you

2882
02:13:32,479 --> 02:13:38,039
know having like you know white papers

2883
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:40,520
and act like scientific stuff and back

2884
02:13:38,039 --> 02:13:42,960
it up and don't give them a dictionary

2885
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:45,559
highlight excerpt parts put it together

2886
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:47,480
well formulated for a DOI that works in

2887
02:13:45,559 --> 02:13:49,760
the government to understand because

2888
02:13:47,479 --> 02:13:52,399
you're not always the sharpest folks so

2889
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:53,920
uh you make it easy spoonfed but you

2890
02:13:52,399 --> 02:13:57,359
site where you get it from where it's

2891
02:13:53,920 --> 02:14:00,039
from and everything and uh you know and

2892
02:13:57,359 --> 02:14:02,519
just show like uh maybe we're somehow it

2893
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:04,920
would be cost effective to them to

2894
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:07,400
eliminate that part so you're adding

2895
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:10,319
like a benefit to them as well you know

2896
02:14:07,399 --> 02:14:12,078
so it's uh fullon reciprocal everybody's

2897
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:13,719
kind of winning you can cite the facts

2898
02:14:12,078 --> 02:14:16,359
like yeah you're not hurting anybody in

2899
02:14:13,719 --> 02:14:19,800
fact you're helping people and uh you

2900
02:14:16,359 --> 02:14:21,359
know give it to them in a nice you know

2901
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:23,880
nice little package that you can just

2902
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:26,078
say here you go on your silver platter

2903
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:28,359
okay and then uh you know it's hard to

2904
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:31,319
fight you know people that are going

2905
02:14:28,359 --> 02:14:33,399
behind that you know from the heart and

2906
02:14:31,319 --> 02:14:35,158
you know just the common sense also

2907
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:38,719
being backed up by

2908
02:14:35,158 --> 02:14:40,719
irrefutable you know just [ __ ] fact

2909
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:42,960
so you give it to them like that you

2910
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:45,158
know they they'd be hard pressed to tell

2911
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,399
a group of people I mean we're talking

2912
02:14:45,158 --> 02:14:49,839
about the same people that cut weed

2913
02:14:46,399 --> 02:14:53,719
illegal right that were refuting facts

2914
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:56,400
however um you know uh maybe uh maybe

2915
02:14:53,719 --> 02:14:59,559
they'll maybe they'll do the right thing

2916
02:14:56,399 --> 02:15:03,439
I don't know that's just my my two

2917
02:14:59,559 --> 02:15:05,840
cents well definitely one of the biggest

2918
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:11,359
um hurdles that we have up here in

2919
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:13,360
Canada and and it isn't a very good um

2920
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:16,198
reflection for the for the rest of the

2921
02:15:13,359 --> 02:15:19,399
world as far as being federally legal is

2922
02:15:16,198 --> 02:15:21,678
that all of our legislation within the

2923
02:15:19,399 --> 02:15:24,638
Cannabis reality

2924
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:28,639
and whole licensing is under Health

2925
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:33,719
Canada that means Health Canada talks

2926
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:37,639
about what we do with our plants so of

2927
02:15:33,719 --> 02:15:39,679
course all of those Reflections are

2928
02:15:37,639 --> 02:15:42,279
going to be more towards the

2929
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:45,840
pharmaceutical Market because it's

2930
02:15:42,279 --> 02:15:48,880
Canada it's not Ministry of a they're

2931
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:51,440
not treating the plants as if it should

2932
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:54,000
be something coming out of the ground

2933
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:56,759
we're actually having to fight to get

2934
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,840
that type of education out that plants

2935
02:15:56,760 --> 02:16:00,520
come from the ground and that microbials

2936
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:01,480
are something that actually helped the

2937
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:05,559
plant

2938
02:16:01,479 --> 02:16:09,558
Thrive I I have no idea on this sort of

2939
02:16:05,559 --> 02:16:12,279
left turn that uh cannabis continues to

2940
02:16:09,559 --> 02:16:15,039
have as well as plant medicine to dumb

2941
02:16:12,279 --> 02:16:16,920
it down by isolating it and putting it

2942
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:19,920
into pharmaceutical hands when we put it

2943
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:22,078
into pharmaceutical hands it is no

2944
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:24,559
longer medicine

2945
02:16:22,078 --> 02:16:26,679
and and and that is not at all what

2946
02:16:24,559 --> 02:16:28,599
regenerative practices are created the

2947
02:16:26,679 --> 02:16:30,639
legalization to begin with because what

2948
02:16:28,599 --> 02:16:32,558
created the legalization to begin with

2949
02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:35,040
was its medicinal

2950
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:37,079
qualities and so when Craig is talking

2951
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:41,399
about all of these

2952
02:16:37,079 --> 02:16:45,959
amazing uh values that you get from his

2953
02:16:41,398 --> 02:16:48,760
Sun grown purely dried gorgeous rosin

2954
02:16:45,959 --> 02:16:51,279
from his farm what you're getting is

2955
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:54,880
you're getting secondary metabolite that

2956
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:57,880
aren't even registered yet we don't even

2957
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:59,679
have the scientific data and I loved

2958
02:16:57,879 --> 02:17:01,638
what you were saying over and over Craig

2959
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:03,120
you know we're gonna get the data on

2960
02:17:01,638 --> 02:17:04,718
this and all I kept thinking was the

2961
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:06,679
Dabba because you're gonna be like

2962
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:09,358
dabbing to do it so you you guys are

2963
02:17:06,679 --> 02:17:14,079
gonna be taking the daa on that

2964
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:16,159
one um but right now the data was a

2965
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:19,558
grandma joke sorry about that um the

2966
02:17:16,159 --> 02:17:22,000
data on that right now is that it's all

2967
02:17:19,558 --> 02:17:24,398
taken from in

2968
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:27,478
a lot of it is from Israel some of it is

2969
02:17:24,398 --> 02:17:30,718
from Canada all over the world it's not

2970
02:17:27,478 --> 02:17:32,599
sungrown it's not soil grown it's not a

2971
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:36,919
full balanced

2972
02:17:32,599 --> 02:17:40,920
holistic um biome that the plant has to

2973
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:42,439
even produce these incredible secondary

2974
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:45,200
metabolites that haven't even been

2975
02:17:42,439 --> 02:17:48,000
studied yet so the data we're getting is

2976
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:50,240
from a totally dumbed down source to

2977
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,519
begin with there is new data coming out

2978
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:53,638
though that I've SE seen from different

2979
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:55,639
outdoor farm but we're having to force

2980
02:17:53,638 --> 02:17:57,679
that data it's not like run by

2981
02:17:55,638 --> 02:18:00,159
governments it's not run by these

2982
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:03,398
Ministries that need to jump onward to

2983
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:05,879
realize the value of putting it in the

2984
02:18:03,398 --> 02:18:07,358
hands of Department of Agriculture

2985
02:18:05,879 --> 02:18:09,920
because they have they're going to be

2986
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:11,519
able to create more value in creating a

2987
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:15,000
holistic plant that comes out of the

2988
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:20,880
ground any thoughts on that D

2989
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:22,398
centralized science Desi Desai Desi

2990
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:26,759
d d

2991
02:18:22,398 --> 02:18:26,760
d I will hook you up with some

2992
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:34,719
dii I was going to say um you know one

2993
02:18:32,359 --> 02:18:37,920
of the things our group is working on is

2994
02:18:34,718 --> 02:18:39,919
we we always evaluate the new bills

2995
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:42,439
coming through and and wondering if they

2996
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:47,120
make sense for our group to support or

2997
02:18:42,439 --> 02:18:47,120
not to support and

2998
02:19:00,879 --> 02:19:04,000
we don't need to look at Arizona we

2999
02:19:02,478 --> 02:19:06,279
don't need to look at these other states

3000
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,679
and have some sort of pack to sell our

3001
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:11,359
products there I think we need to First

3002
02:19:08,679 --> 02:19:12,920
work on our home state and move out from

3003
02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:13,920
there and that would be the one thing I

3004
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:16,760
would

3005
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:19,120
probably um share with the folks in

3006
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:20,200
Canada is to start working with your

3007
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:21,920
your you know I don't know your

3008
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:24,120
government structure but your your

3009
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:26,719
county or your Providence and then move

3010
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:28,840
out from there because the other thing

3011
02:19:26,718 --> 02:19:32,759
that is going to happen here at least in

3012
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:34,840
this country is you know New York is is

3013
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:37,200
building out New Jersey's building out

3014
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:39,519
they're going to have massive taxation

3015
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:41,120
for my product to come into their state

3016
02:19:39,519 --> 02:19:43,159
right and then there'll be States like

3017
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,840
Oregon and Nevada and Arizona that will

3018
02:19:43,159 --> 02:19:45,920
probably want to bring their prodcts

3019
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:48,040
into

3020
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,920
California you know that's not so

3021
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:53,920
exciting for me um so I think there's

3022
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:55,639
something to you know definitely want to

3023
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,559
get the medicine out don't that's not

3024
02:19:55,639 --> 02:19:59,760
what I'm saying and we definitely want

3025
02:19:57,559 --> 02:20:02,159
to share but what's wrong with

3026
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:04,040
experiential cannabis what's wrong with

3027
02:20:02,159 --> 02:20:06,520
having the experience when you come to

3028
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:06,520
that home

3029
02:20:13,239 --> 02:20:17,159
state it's gonna be taxed somebody else

3030
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,920
is going to try to figure out how to

3031
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:21,879
make some more money on it but let's

3032
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:24,159
come as close to the farm to to get

3033
02:20:21,879 --> 02:20:26,318
these products and and have these

3034
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:28,680
experiences with us you know a lot of

3035
02:20:26,318 --> 02:20:30,318
the a lot of the conversation we have

3036
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:34,040
with Soulful at the dispensary we're

3037
02:20:30,318 --> 02:20:36,359
partnered with is is the the dashboard

3038
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:38,280
that people use to purchase cannabis

3039
02:20:36,359 --> 02:20:40,159
right now you're looking at a menu

3040
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:42,840
you're looking at this percent that

3041
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:44,239
tarpine that and if I was out front we

3042
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:47,520
always joke about this if I was out

3043
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:50,280
front 11 jars and rolling joints I'd

3044
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:52,800
sell out every single time every single

3045
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:54,920
time anywhere I went I could be the guy

3046
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:56,478
selling you know the guy selling oranges

3047
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:58,600
on the corner down at the bottom of my

3048
02:20:56,478 --> 02:21:01,199
Hill setting up my weed stand next to

3049
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:01,200
him and I'd be

3050
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:21,800
so arms I think that's where it's at

3051
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,800
keep it in the hands of the farmers and

3052
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:36,120
medical patient and affordable less

3053

agrotain trade

3057
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:49,159
route yeah more events too like I love

3058
02:21:47,478 --> 02:21:52,279
these farmers markets rather they're

3059
02:21:49,159 --> 02:21:54,478
legal whatever you know um it's all

3060
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:56,720
about just bringing the the people to

3061
02:21:54,478 --> 02:21:59,599
the farmer and that's yet we all sell

3062
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:01,079
our own stuff way better you know I can

3063
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:03,920
sit there and tell you all the things

3064
02:22:01,079 --> 02:22:06,398
that my products do and my herb and I do

3065
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:08,478
lots of oneto ones and different CBD ver

3066
02:22:06,398 --> 02:22:10,439
you know ratios but who else is going to

3067
02:22:08,478 --> 02:22:12,039
tell all that who else is going to tell

3068
02:22:10,439 --> 02:22:14,639
the story about how and the hell all

3069
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:16,840
that happened gets deleted yeah it gets

3070
02:22:14,639 --> 02:22:19,719
diluted it just becomes false too if you

3071
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:21,880
tell the same like big story over and

3072
02:22:19,719 --> 02:22:24,119
over and it's like all marketed and it's

3073
02:22:21,879 --> 02:22:26,119
like yeah they were supposed to give us

3074
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:28,520
time as you know Legacy Farmers to

3075
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:30,359
establish ourselves in this transitional

3076
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:31,640
world that we've been going through and

3077
02:22:30,359 --> 02:22:33,640
they didn't you know they open up the

3078
02:22:31,639 --> 02:22:36,119
floodgates and now lenus Valley and

3079
02:22:33,639 --> 02:22:40,199
places like that are you know covered in

3080
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:42,359
50 75 acre lots of you know subar

3081
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:44,800
cannabis that's bottlenecking into the

3082
02:22:42,359 --> 02:22:48,120
industry and it's it makes it tough so

3083
02:22:44,799 --> 02:22:51,000
yeah things coming together more we all

3084
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:52,880
tighten up if we have to go under we go

3085
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,559
under but it's like we do have these

3086
02:22:52,879 --> 02:22:57,920
events we create it where we have people

3087
02:22:55,559 --> 02:23:00,478
can come direct to the farmer and get

3088
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:02,000
their you know what they want and need

3089
02:23:00,478 --> 02:23:04,119
and know that it's grown in these

3090
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,280
beautiful ways and then at the same time

3091
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:08,600
having to keep fighting the fight of

3092
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:10,120
like pushing regenerative farming and

3093
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:12,280
what this does and the data and

3094
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:14,319
collecting it and being like here you

3095
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:17,600
know pushing that but at the same time

3096
02:23:14,318 --> 02:23:20,039
how are we going to make it so that's

3097
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:22,680
that yeah I feel like there's a lot of

3098
02:23:20,040 --> 02:23:24,240
power in gathering together and creating

3099
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:26,439
there too much of a barrier between the

3100
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:28,478
farmer and the consumer you know way too

3101
02:23:26,439 --> 02:23:30,200
much talk to a lot of Bud tenders you

3102
02:23:28,478 --> 02:23:33,199
know unfortunately there's not as much

3103
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:35,800
of a educational curve involved with it

3104
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:38,479
um something that needs to be handled I

3105
02:23:35,799 --> 02:23:40,599
think a lot more um within you know the

3106
02:23:38,478 --> 02:23:43,719
the shop industry and retail industry

3107
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:46,000
and whatnot but um I think that's what

3108
02:23:43,719 --> 02:23:48,760
DM's kind of really you know beautiful

3109
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,439
for and what I really love about it how

3110
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:51,960
it's you know a peer-to-peer Network

3111
02:23:50,439 --> 02:23:53,600
work of people that are on that same

3112
02:23:51,959 --> 02:23:56,559
wavelength that want to push that out

3113
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:58,120
there and um it's What attracted me to

3114
02:23:56,559 --> 02:24:01,719
dragonfly Earth medicine in the first

3115
02:23:58,120 --> 02:24:03,439
place so educat and the people that are

3116
02:24:01,719 --> 02:24:06,159
directly to the consumers could be able

3117
02:24:03,439 --> 02:24:08,000
to help that until you know we figure

3118
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:11,478
out where we're at between County and

3119
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,398
state even you know um yeah that's

3120
02:24:11,478 --> 02:24:15,398
powerful like just like Craig said going

3121
02:24:13,398 --> 02:24:17,199
the tee out you know you walk in the

3122
02:24:15,398 --> 02:24:19,879
garden you're able to see where things

3123
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:22,120
are growing that's so freaking important

3124
02:24:19,879 --> 02:24:24,000
it's so cool to be able to be able to

3125
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:25,120
offer something like that too and it's

3126
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,719
an

3127
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:30,880
experience yeah yeah you use you use the

3128
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:30,879
the

3129
02:24:43,559 --> 02:24:49,318
term also need call each other when

3130
02:24:45,879 --> 02:24:51,719
we're doing really well and and and not

3131
02:24:49,318 --> 02:24:54,760
be shy of that and and feel how we can

3132
02:24:51,719 --> 02:24:58,039
celebrate our successes as

3133
02:24:54,760 --> 02:25:01,079
well yeah absolutely and like I know

3134
02:24:58,040 --> 02:25:03,200
like when it comes to my dollar like I

3135
02:25:01,079 --> 02:25:05,799
would much rather go to like I said like

3136
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:08,040
a farmers market or any any type of

3137
02:25:05,799 --> 02:25:11,318
popup where people are at and like I

3138
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:13,240
said get like some SS and some lotions

3139
02:25:11,318 --> 02:25:16,000
and stuff like this last one I went to I

3140
02:25:13,239 --> 02:25:18,520
got like this really hand sanitizer it's

3141
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,318
all natural and everything super cool

3142
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:24,200
cheaper than what you get in the store

3143
02:25:20,318 --> 02:25:25,799
smells awesome works great um just like

3144
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:27,800
I mean it could be anything but like I

3145
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:29,879
would rather put my money in somebody's

3146
02:25:27,799 --> 02:25:31,599
hands like that because a lot of the

3147
02:25:29,879 --> 02:25:33,639
stuff like it is super quality you're

3148
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:35,559
getting something better than what you

3149
02:25:33,639 --> 02:25:38,119
would you know see in like your typical

3150
02:25:35,559 --> 02:25:40,760
commercial [ __ ] store and also I

3151
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:44,359
don't like going into stores man like

3152
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:46,680
it's just weirds me out you know so like

3153
02:25:44,359 --> 02:25:48,520
farmers markets and stuff like I'm crazy

3154
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:49,840
relaxing and if I got a question

3155
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:51,319
normally I don't even have to ask it

3156
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:53,200
people are willing to share their

3157
02:25:51,318 --> 02:25:55,439
passion their love and the information

3158
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:57,479
and like that's super cool and like if I

3159
02:25:55,439 --> 02:26:00,000
was living like if we were all literally

3160
02:25:57,478 --> 02:26:01,358
living around each other right now and

3161
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,760

3162
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:04,920

02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:35,960
the torch of the back to the land

3193
02:27:34,559 --> 02:27:38,119
movement I mean we are carrying the

3194
02:27:35,959 --> 02:27:41,000
torch of the back to the land movement

3195
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:42,640
and we talk a lot about Landscaping as a

3196
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:48,200
garden you know we watch these French

3197
02:27:42,639 --> 02:27:50,559
gardening shows and uh and the the thing

3198
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:53,560
that people

3199
02:27:50,559 --> 02:27:56,079
uh you know are transformed by seeing

3200
02:27:53,559 --> 02:27:59,199
these beautiful flower gardens and these

3201
02:27:56,079 --> 02:28:02,159
Estates and we're using this back to the

3202
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:04,279
land movement values and regeneration as

3203
02:28:02,159 --> 02:28:06,398
this transformational

3204
02:28:04,279 --> 02:28:09,520
experience where people come here and

3205
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:12,239
they come to Craig's farm and they see

3206
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:13,920
the mycelium growing in the soil and

3207
02:28:12,239 --> 02:28:17,199
they're like totally blown away and

3208
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:17,200
they're transformed

3209
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:34,640
some you know it's a

3210
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:40,079
values war in the Cannabis industry at

3211
02:28:34,639 --> 02:28:40,079
this point it's deep entrenched

3212
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:51,479
values heartful Eco

3213
02:28:48,559 --> 02:28:54,239
gardening and I'm just saying it versus

3214
02:28:51,478 --> 02:28:58,079
this corporate Paradigm that impose

3215
02:28:54,239 --> 02:29:00,000
these mechanical overlays on our life

3216
02:28:58,079 --> 02:29:03,520
and [ __ ]

3217
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:06,279
that and when people come visit us it

3218
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:09,120
should be real and it should be like

3219
02:29:06,279 --> 02:29:11,880
emotional and it should be designed from

3220
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:14,880
our heart that's the transformation I'm

3221
02:29:11,879 --> 02:29:17,239
going through it's like I'm over it you

3222
02:29:14,879 --> 02:29:20,239
know how can we be beneficial organisms

3223
02:29:17,239 --> 02:29:22,719
on Mother Earth exactly it's like

3224
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:25,559
connection to the land is our message

3225
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:30,000
and the land is an expression of where

3226
02:29:25,559 --> 02:29:32,719
we are Rio could you could you share you

3227
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:35,159
you mentioned it's a values war and and

3228
02:29:32,719 --> 02:29:38,079
Rio actually took this huge Community

3229
02:29:35,159 --> 02:29:43,239
leadership role like five maybe six

3230
02:29:38,079 --> 02:29:46,279
years ago and actually performed uh a a

3231
02:29:43,239 --> 02:29:48,398
a work study um and came up with some

3232
02:29:46,279 --> 02:29:51,159
real data you could could you share that

3233
02:29:48,398 --> 02:29:54,278
just a snapshot of that yeah I mean I

3234
02:29:51,159 --> 02:29:57,159
was trained in mediation and and then my

3235
02:29:54,279 --> 02:30:02,120
job in the local government was uh

3236
02:29:57,159 --> 02:30:02,119
developing industry clusters for humble

3237
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:36,318
I developed a whole process from my

3238
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:39,600
trainings on how to you know get

3239
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:41,439
everybody to write out sticky notes of

3240
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:44,239
what their core values are and then I

3241
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:47,398
got tables to come together with what

3242
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:50,199
the table cons thought was the top 10

3243
02:30:47,398 --> 02:30:51,519
and then then we go and we put it up on

3244
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:53,159
a board in front of the group and

3245
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:56,479
everybody voted on their core values and

3246
02:30:53,159 --> 02:30:58,879
we came up with with like the top 10

3247
02:30:56,478 --> 02:31:00,398
core values of Southern humble and I

3248
02:30:58,879 --> 02:31:02,920
think there's a lot of movement right

3249
02:31:00,398 --> 02:31:06,398
now to do it again and kind of reassess

3250
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:08,359
like hey are we living our core values

3251
02:31:06,398 --> 02:31:10,478
how are we doing compared to like what

3252
02:31:08,359 --> 02:31:12,760
we were 10 years ago and like every 10

3253
02:31:10,478 --> 02:31:15,519
years we could check in and see if we

3254
02:31:12,760 --> 02:31:19,359
have that Integrity of

3255
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:22,159
like are we living according to what we

3256
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:23,520
feel and you know to me that's happiness

3257
02:31:22,159 --> 02:31:27,119
it's like when my core values are

3258
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:32,120
aligned I'm in in harmony but if I'm

3259
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:34,960
broken and off of my core then I'm

3260
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:38,079
stressed so I think that's an important

3261
02:31:34,959 --> 02:31:39,278
thing is to like reassess and uh and

3262
02:31:38,079 --> 02:31:45,639
stay

3263
02:31:39,279 --> 02:31:45,640
core with you know and not that comes

3264
02:31:48,398 --> 02:31:51,840
out come in

3265
02:31:54,279 --> 02:32:00,200
anyway but that was a beautiful process

3266
02:31:57,318 --> 02:32:03,318
and thank you every year I get better at

3267
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:04,960
Living my core values a little bit I

3268
02:32:03,318 --> 02:32:07,278
would love to bring in something I'm

3269
02:32:04,959 --> 02:32:09,039
just I'm just now learning and I just

3270
02:32:07,279 --> 02:32:11,520
what you're talking about resonates so

3271
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:13,680
deeply with this I don't know if

3272
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:16,359
anyone's like the domination culture

3273
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:18,920
versus partner ISM it's a have you heard

3274
02:32:16,359 --> 02:32:20,640
of the partner ISM thing yet oh my God

3275
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:23,200
what a beautiful practice and what a

3276
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:25,478
beautiful like lens to because I get

3277
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:28,399
caught in Domination behavior all the

3278
02:32:25,478 --> 02:32:30,799
time and like to learn that conflict can

3279
02:32:28,398 --> 02:32:32,959
be redefined is when any two people get

3280
02:32:30,799 --> 02:32:36,119
together and that literally everything

3281
02:32:32,959 --> 02:32:38,079
we do is by terms of agreement and also

3282
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:40,560
transparency like if we have tensions

3283
02:32:38,079 --> 02:32:43,920
with each other being able toj it in the

3284
02:32:40,559 --> 02:32:47,039
moment and have this kind of reciprocity

3285
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:49,159
and like being real people together I I

3286
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:51,319
can't wait to practice that in my own

3287
02:32:49,159 --> 02:32:54,520
community and have it with my neighbor

3288
02:32:51,318 --> 02:32:56,719
finally and to have it with my dearest

3289
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:58,680
mother who I don't hug often enough you

3290
02:32:56,719 --> 02:33:00,318
know anyway I just love this community

3291
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:03,040
building on this level thank you for

3292
02:33:00,318 --> 02:33:06,278
bringing that and I think what what

3293
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:10,520
we're recognizing is that

3294
02:33:06,279 --> 02:33:13,239
um the structures that we were and have

3295
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:15,800
been living under and we have been

3296
02:33:13,239 --> 02:33:18,959
looking for reciprocity we've been

3297
02:33:15,799 --> 02:33:21,799
looking for hey we're out here we are

3298
02:33:18,959 --> 02:33:24,639
now Rec recognizing that not only do

3299
02:33:21,799 --> 02:33:27,358
they not speak our language but they

3300
02:33:24,639 --> 02:33:30,719
don't want to speak our language they're

3301
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:33,239
not interested in speaking our language

3302
02:33:30,719 --> 02:33:35,398
there was a pretend fraction of wanting

3303
02:33:33,239 --> 02:33:36,600
to speak our language so that we could

3304
02:33:35,398 --> 02:33:40,920
come

3305
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:44,920
into you know uh their field of

3306
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:47,359
sight so but the thing is that they

3307
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:49,200
don't realize when they're dealing with

3308
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:53,920
regenerative Farmers is that we've been

3309
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:56,200
talking aot about seeds and we are seeds

3310
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:58,040
so there's that old line you know when

3311
02:33:56,200 --> 02:34:02,200
they try to bury

3312
02:33:58,040 --> 02:34:04,040
us no problem that works for us like we

3313
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:06,479
can deal with that because what you're

3314
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:09,040
doing is you're showing

3315
02:34:06,478 --> 02:34:10,760
us how you're going to bury us and then

3316
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,680
we're going to be figuring out as a

3317
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:16,159
group in our mycelial Network where

3318
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:18,200
we're going to repopulate and how we're

3319
02:34:16,159 --> 02:34:20,398
going to repopulate and everything that

3320
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:23,960
we're talking about right now

3321
02:34:20,398 --> 02:34:25,559
is the most basic most

3322
02:34:23,959 --> 02:34:28,000
important

3323
02:34:25,559 --> 02:34:31,519
fraction of the

3324
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:34,040
entire Vision like it's actually The Hub

3325
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:37,439
of the wheel and then all of the spokes

3326
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:40,000
go off of that like our happiness and

3327
02:34:37,439 --> 02:34:42,159
our health and our self-love comes from

3328
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:45,040
Community it comes from the people

3329
02:34:42,159 --> 02:34:48,000
around us and that Community is also on

3330
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:51,920
a microbial level and that microbial

3331
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:54,719
level is balanced soil that we also come

3332
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:57,559
from we are no different than that and

3333
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:59,840
if we don't have a true running wheel

3334
02:34:57,559 --> 02:35:03,519
which means that every single spoke off

3335
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:06,559
of it running true you know that Cog is

3336
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:10,760
is definitely the soil and we're holding

3337
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:13,109
that so what we're talking about here is

3338
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:15,159
something that you can start

3339
02:35:13,110 --> 02:35:18,479
[Music]

3340
02:35:15,159 --> 02:35:21,639
everywhere everywhere it doesn't matter

3341
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:21,639
if you're in downtown

3342
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:27,920
you can get together a group of people

3343
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:30,439
to say hey how can we get more beehives

3344
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:32,719
at top all of the all of the different

3345
02:35:30,439 --> 02:35:35,318
buildings here how can we get more

3346
02:35:32,719 --> 02:35:39,398
farmers markets what is it that we can

3347
02:35:35,318 --> 02:35:43,119
do to uplift the frequency that is going

3348
02:35:39,398 --> 02:35:45,760
to hear us because that standardized

3349
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:47,760
frequency the government no longer wants

3350
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:51,079
to hear us they actually can't because

3351
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:53,719
if language is frequency it's not words

3352
02:35:51,079 --> 02:35:56,760
it's frequency and the last two years

3353
02:35:53,719 --> 02:35:58,959
our frequency is Shifting then they

3354
02:35:56,760 --> 02:36:02,200
actually can no longer hear us and we

3355
02:35:58,959 --> 02:36:05,119
can no longer hear them so we have to go

3356
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:07,040
where the frequency is the same and

3357
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:09,800
that's going to happen from us

3358
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:12,840
recreating the soil and nature Vibe as

3359
02:36:09,799 --> 02:36:15,599
mentor and no longer humans being the

3360
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:18,398
mentorship we just commune around the

3361
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:20,040
true the true Mentor which is nature

3362
02:36:18,398 --> 02:36:21,719
sorry I went off on that ramp but I

3363
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:22,800
wanted to bring it together about all

3364
02:36:21,719 --> 02:36:25,199
this

3365
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:28,358
potency that you all are talking about

3366
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:30,000
here and please add anyone jump in and

3367
02:36:28,359 --> 02:36:32,159
our and it is a back to the land

3368
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:34,559
movement and I love that our land may be

3369
02:36:32,159 --> 02:36:37,359
used for tourism in some cases you know

3370
02:36:34,559 --> 02:36:40,359
bringing people to our land you know

3371
02:36:37,359 --> 02:36:40,359
just

3372
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:59,398
maybe uh JJ's got so much water he could

3373
02:36:56,318 --> 02:37:01,239

what you said Kelly with the health and

3450
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:57,640
happiness and self-love and going back

3451
02:39:54,959 --> 02:39:59,719
to what R said about the about the the

3452
02:39:57,639 --> 02:40:02,159
core values all of that it's like we all

3453
02:39:59,719 --> 02:40:03,799
have our own core values and I feel like

3454
02:40:02,159 --> 02:40:05,639
once we are aligned with those core

3455
02:40:03,799 --> 02:40:08,559
values when we find what that is and

3456
02:40:05,639 --> 02:40:12,159
it's like then health happiness selflove

3457
02:40:08,559 --> 02:40:14,639
all that can happen and right now on

3458
02:40:12,159 --> 02:40:17,079
this time it just feels like a lot a lot

3459
02:40:14,639 --> 02:40:18,920
of us are getting shook up like I feel

3460
02:40:17,079 --> 02:40:21,920
for me my whole world is like kind of

3461
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:25,200
falling apart but it's like Fallen back

3462
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:27,559
together it's all fallen into place like

3463
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:29,640
I'm realigning and re-remembering like

3464
02:40:27,559 --> 02:40:31,119
my purpose and I feel like that's

3465
02:40:29,639 --> 02:40:33,079
happening with a lot of us because it's

3466
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:35,079
like so much [ __ ] happened it's like

3467
02:40:33,079 --> 02:40:38,959
wait a minute that this isn't me I'm not

3468
02:40:35,079 --> 02:40:41,120
happy this sucks and it's realigning and

3469
02:40:38,959 --> 02:40:45,879
finding those core values again and

3470
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:45,880
going okay wait this is what feels good

3471
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:55,760
because we are part of it and

3472
02:40:53,639 --> 02:40:57,199
reconnecting getting out of the Cities

3473
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:59,200
getting out of the concrete getting out

3474
02:40:57,200 --> 02:41:01,840
of the pollution and getting back to

3475
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:04,000
touching the soil to seeing color

3476
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:05,960
therapy with our eyes of the plants to

3477
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,159
being able to walk in a garden to even

3478
02:41:05,959 --> 02:41:11,079
touch a cannabis plant to touch a fruit

3479
02:41:08,159 --> 02:41:12,760
tree and taste it and it's like that

3480
02:41:11,079 --> 02:41:15,719
right there is like I feel like when

3481
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:18,079
true like health and Harmony and balance

3482
02:41:15,719 --> 02:41:20,599
can start to happen and how it's so

3483
02:41:18,079 --> 02:41:22,879
important with growing your own food

3484
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:25,880
growing your own medicine or sourcing it

3485
02:41:22,879 --> 02:41:30,920
at a place that it's grown with love and

3486
02:41:25,879 --> 02:41:34,799
loving and like this is evolve humans is

3487
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:37,318
like we heal our we we shift you know

3488
02:41:34,799 --> 02:41:38,959
like we're doing telepathy soon

3489
02:41:37,318 --> 02:41:40,600
hopefully we'll be able to teleport to

3490
02:41:38,959 --> 02:41:42,679
each other soon you know these beautiful

3491
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:45,200
things but all that has to happen as we

3492
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:48,000
evolve this like Humanity like we have

3493
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:49,800
to have more pure thought more you know

3494
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,520
just things that can't be

3495
02:41:49,799 --> 02:41:56,719
hidden and uh yeah I feel like we're in

3496
02:41:52,520 --> 02:42:00,760
a good sense but it's realigning I feel

3497
02:41:56,719 --> 02:42:02,920
like all of us where we need to to be

3498
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:04,680
again yeah it's like recreating

3499
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:08,398
ourselves I just came up with something

3500
02:42:04,680 --> 02:42:11,880
which is the ego The evolutionary stacle

3501
02:42:08,398 --> 02:42:14,439
so I think that you know we can move you

3502
02:42:11,879 --> 02:42:17,559
know keep keep those parts that we need

3503
02:42:14,439 --> 02:42:19,960
but often it is the evolutionary Gateway

3504
02:42:17,559 --> 02:42:23,359
obstacle and what we've been taught in

3505
02:42:19,959 --> 02:42:26,000
this standardized sort of lifestyle that

3506
02:42:23,359 --> 02:42:28,720
we've been living is always look to

3507
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:32,120
someone else for the answers and don't

3508
02:42:28,719 --> 02:42:34,559
share the answers with other people keep

3509
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:38,000
them to yourselves everything in school

3510
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:40,639
tells you don't cheat don't share only

3511
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:44,120
get information from one person which is

3512
02:42:40,639 --> 02:42:48,039
the teacher all of this is like getting

3513
02:42:44,120 --> 02:42:50,279
our brain you know used to something

3514
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:53,000
that is going to take us away from that

3515
02:42:50,279 --> 02:42:56,000
self-love and that self- happiness and I

3516
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:57,959
wanted to mention too you know a as

3517
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:01,079
human beings one of the things that

3518
02:42:57,959 --> 02:43:02,959
we're always running away from is pain

3519
02:43:01,079 --> 02:43:04,520
and I want to talk about like every

3520
02:43:02,959 --> 02:43:07,039
single one of the people that you're

3521
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:10,239
seeing up here has either gone through

3522
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:13,640
tremendous pain to be sitting

3523
02:43:10,239 --> 02:43:15,680
here whether they their Farm or whether

3524
02:43:13,639 --> 02:43:17,398
there's been incarceration for what it

3525
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:21,159
is that they love and what they want to

3526
02:43:17,398 --> 02:43:24,079
do but also you know

3527
02:43:21,159 --> 02:43:26,119
cry having to dig up the money from

3528
02:43:24,079 --> 02:43:28,760
eight years ago that you never wanted to

3529
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:30,960
dig up or or maybe having to risk your

3530
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:33,478
children to still get medicine out into

3531
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:36,278
the market and when you look at this

3532
02:43:33,478 --> 02:43:38,760
type of community we've come from a lot

3533
02:43:36,279 --> 02:43:42,439
of difficulties and in fact in the Dem

3534
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:45,040
piure agreement we agree to get through

3535
02:43:42,439 --> 02:43:48,600
things that are difficult because we

3536
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:51,000
want to delve into what is difficult and

3537
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:52,640
we know that if we don't deal with

3538
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:54,000
difficulty then we are not going to

3539
02:43:52,639 --> 02:43:57,559
arise

3540
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:59,398
to you know reaching what we've always

3541
02:43:57,559 --> 02:44:01,680
been searching for it's like you've got

3542
02:43:59,398 --> 02:44:04,119
to have the compost that

3543
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:07,239
reeks before you can have the soil that

3544
02:44:04,120 --> 02:44:10,439
you plant into so don't be afraid like

3545
02:44:07,239 --> 02:44:12,879
right now is a great day to compost

3546
02:44:10,439 --> 02:44:14,880
yourself and it's it's it's the it's

3547
02:44:12,879 --> 02:44:18,438
okay that it's the first day to come out

3548
02:44:14,879 --> 02:44:21,159
and say [ __ ] I need to re-evaluate where

3549
02:44:18,439 --> 02:44:23,479
I've come from from and start aligning

3550
02:44:21,159 --> 02:44:26,239
with those values and that frequency

3551
02:44:23,478 --> 02:44:27,119
that can hear me and that can that can

3552
02:44:26,239 --> 02:44:30,039
understand

3553
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:32,030
me sorry another rant but isn't that

3554
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:33,880
what we're here for rant and

3555
02:44:32,030 --> 02:44:38,359
[Music]

3556
02:44:33,879 --> 02:44:40,478
Rave I like I like to add to that first

3557
02:44:38,359 --> 02:44:43,520
I really love to be in that group it

3558
02:44:40,478 --> 02:44:47,079
really opens my heart but there is a I

3559
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:50,000
think that um only in the midst of

3560
02:44:47,079 --> 02:44:52,959
stress or difficulty we are actually

3561
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:56,840
growing when we are too comfortable what

3562
02:44:52,959 --> 02:45:00,278
we have uh we just sitting there and we

3563
02:44:56,840 --> 02:45:02,600
roding so to speak but the the the

3564
02:45:00,279 --> 02:45:04,880
challenges that come our life and

3565
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:09,159
nothing is handed to us that we cannot

3566
02:45:04,879 --> 02:45:10,358
um handle then we are growing that's

3567
02:45:09,159 --> 02:45:14,279
that's

3568
02:45:10,359 --> 02:45:16,960
so uh in some way it's sometimes hard to

3569
02:45:14,279 --> 02:45:20,920
welcome the difficulties but if we can

3570
02:45:16,959 --> 02:45:24,039
shift our um way to look at it say okay

3571
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:24,040
there is another thing that's

3572
02:45:37,398 --> 02:45:40,959
been similar

3573
02:45:41,359 --> 02:45:45,960
things and I have a lot of appreciation

3574
02:45:44,239 --> 02:45:47,879
respect for you because of you know

3575
02:45:45,959 --> 02:45:49,959
coming from East Germany and seeing

3576
02:45:47,879 --> 02:45:51,559
everything that you have

3577
02:45:49,959 --> 02:45:54,358
uh seeing everything that you've seen in

3578
02:45:51,559 --> 02:45:54,359
your life and

3579
02:46:06,159 --> 02:46:10,680
then possible for people because a lot

3580
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:13,319
of people talk about what they can and

3581
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:15,200
can't do or themelves being stuck and

3582
02:46:13,318 --> 02:46:17,680
all that and I get it like I don't know

3583
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:20,000
what everyone's going through but it's

3584
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:22,520
stories like yours and other people that

3585
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:25,639
have overcome things and become such an

3586
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:27,720
amazing Beacon you know in the community

3587
02:46:25,639 --> 02:46:29,920
I I really love and appreciate you and

3588
02:46:27,719 --> 02:46:32,398

3589
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:33,680

3590
02:46:32,398 --> 02:46:36,519

3591
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:38,600
visualization uh practice at the very

3592
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:40,720
end of this which is coming up soon if

3593
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:42,200
you're up for that we would be love to

3594
02:46:40,719 --> 02:46:43,478
hear to leave everybody yeah just to

3595
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:45,600
leave us with a nice thought you can

3596
02:46:43,478 --> 02:46:48,119
think about that as we uh yeah you know

3597
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:49,600
start wrapping up but there was somebody

3598
02:46:48,120 --> 02:46:51,000
else that wanted to say something there

3599
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:52,880
Daniel you had a thought and I don't

3600
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:57,359
know if you if it still pertains but

3601
02:46:52,879 --> 02:46:59,879
anyone else yeah you know like Kelly we

3602
02:46:57,359 --> 02:47:03,439
all been through pain and and having

3603
02:46:59,879 --> 02:47:06,799
just been witnessed to child birth

3604
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:10,479
again it's incredible pain here to birth

3605
02:47:06,799 --> 02:47:14,478
life and you know when my wife is coming

3606
02:47:10,478 --> 02:47:16,398
on she goes oh we can't do this again

3607
02:47:14,478 --> 02:47:18,959
and on the it's so deep because on the

3608
02:47:16,398 --> 02:47:22,159
soul level we can't do this again we

3609
02:47:18,959 --> 02:47:25,039
need to keep moving forward in and what

3610
02:47:22,159 --> 02:47:26,920
I love about spirituality and physics is

3611
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:29,200
they're very similar and like in you

3612
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:31,920
know two points if you go from here to

3613
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:34,079
here you're not going backwards you know

3614
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:36,398
there's no going backwards there's only

3615
02:47:34,079 --> 02:47:39,200
going forwards but only if we learn the

3616
02:47:36,398 --> 02:47:41,879
lessons then you know because there is

3617
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:43,159
when you start to repeat that progress

3618
02:47:41,879 --> 02:47:44,599
then you could say that's going

3619
02:47:43,159 --> 02:47:45,559
backwards but then again there's no

3620
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:49,880
going

3621
02:47:45,559 --> 02:47:53,639
backwards and I see us moving forward

3622
02:47:49,879 --> 02:47:55,559
forwarding from what we've exchanged or

3623
02:47:53,639 --> 02:47:58,559
what was stolen what we replace clean

3624
02:47:55,559 --> 02:48:01,719
water in a healthy forest for and it's

3625
02:47:58,559 --> 02:48:03,639
crap it's utterly it's crazy if you go

3626
02:48:01,719 --> 02:48:05,639
into like a supermarket like a gas

3627
02:48:03,639 --> 02:48:10,159
station go it's all we traded this for

3628
02:48:05,639 --> 02:48:10,159
clean water and a healthy Forest like

3629
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:29,240
to you know like they they but like the

3630
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:32,520
rainbow prophecy the Hopey you know it's

3631
02:48:29,239 --> 02:48:34,039
we are here the the the the um the

3632
02:48:32,520 --> 02:48:35,560
rainbow children have grown older

they've become rainbow mothers and

3634
02:48:35,559 --> 02:48:39,639
rainbow fathers rainbow grandmothers and

3635

3639
02:48:48,318 --> 02:48:53,559
here but we're here we we love to do

3640
02:48:50,439 --> 02:48:55,159
stuff we you know we we want to work we

3641
02:48:53,559 --> 02:48:57,239
might never see those goals we might

3642
02:48:55,159 --> 02:48:59,879
never achieve those

3643
02:48:57,239 --> 02:49:01,199
dreams but we like to do stuff so we're

3644
02:48:59,879 --> 02:49:04,879
here in the garden we're going to clean

3645

it up and i' like to leave my little bit

3646
02:49:04,879 --> 02:49:08,278

inspiration it's called mover of

3649
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:15,318
mountains never let anyone tell you

3650
02:49:13,159 --> 02:49:18,159
you're not good enough that you can't do

3651
02:49:15,318 --> 02:49:21,159
it that you're never going to make it

3652
02:49:18,159 --> 02:49:24,439
that it is foolish to follow your dreams

3653
02:49:21,159 --> 02:49:27,159
after all you are an individualized drop

3654
02:49:24,439 --> 02:49:29,238
of the infinite Spirit a

3655
02:49:27,159 --> 02:49:32,279
microcosmos that through the law of

3656
02:49:29,238 --> 02:49:35,520
Miracles contains the very universe

3657
02:49:32,279 --> 02:49:38,079
itself the wave of the sea dissolves in

3658
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:41,319
the sea and there is no obstacle that

3659
02:49:38,079 --> 02:49:44,840
can stop you no storm that can throw you

3660
02:49:41,318 --> 02:49:47,398
off course no matter how insurmountable

3661
02:49:44,840 --> 02:49:50,760

there's there's problems in life but

3675
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,238
there's Solutions you know you just got

3676
02:50:40,879 --> 02:50:45,879
to figure it out and you know there's

3677
02:50:43,238 --> 02:50:48,119
mistakes and then there's successes and

3678
02:50:45,879 --> 02:50:51,358
understanding why the mistake was a

3679
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:52,279
mistake and you know rectifying that and

3680
02:50:51,359 --> 02:50:55,559
you

3681
02:50:52,279 --> 02:50:58,720
know improving it and also understand

3682
02:50:55,559 --> 02:51:01,760
why you were successful like not living

3683
02:50:58,719 --> 02:51:03,559
and operating by happistance like

3684
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:05,439
understanding why you know things are

3685
02:51:03,559 --> 02:51:10,039
doing what they're doing that way you

3686
02:51:05,439 --> 02:51:10,040
can you know become better

3687
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:46,159
uh broken starving you know what I mean

3688
02:51:42,359 --> 02:51:47,600
uh sacrificing for what I do but like

3689
02:51:46,159 --> 02:51:49,000
like that poem says it you know but

3690
02:51:47,600 --> 02:51:50,279
you're going to do it because that's

3691
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,559
what you really want that's what you

3692
02:51:50,279 --> 02:51:53,880

Oklahoma and uh I was going to work with

3739
02:53:38,318 --> 02:53:42,318
this really cool lady that actually she

3740
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:44,478
got in a car wreck when she was 16 she

3741
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:47,920
lost her eyesight and some other things

3742
02:53:44,478 --> 02:53:50,079
happened to her and um and she uh came

3743
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:52,439
to you know a place of healing through

3744
02:53:50,079 --> 02:53:56,799
cannabis and um it really changed her

3745
02:53:52,439 --> 02:53:58,880
life and uh she wanted to um you know

3746
02:53:56,799 --> 02:54:01,238
change the world with it and like find

3747
02:53:58,879 --> 02:54:04,879
people that wanted

3748
02:54:01,238 --> 02:54:06,600
to and um help her grow regeneratively

3749
02:54:04,879 --> 02:54:08,799
and poly cropping and all kinds of other

3750
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:11,120
medicines were finished products and she

3751
02:54:08,799 --> 02:54:12,759
had some really good shops and um she

3752
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:14,640
got taken advantage of by some people

3753
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:17,159
out there and it really crushed her

3754
02:54:14,639 --> 02:54:18,639
business unfortunately you know she's

3755
02:54:17,159 --> 02:54:20,398
really nice person and you know

3756
02:54:18,639 --> 02:54:23,840
vulnerable but she could have done some

3757
02:54:20,398 --> 02:54:26,199
really amazing things and um but at the

3758
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:28,600
same time I you know it it's hard for me

3759
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:30,960
to move away from Cali you know this is

3760
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:32,920
where I this where I grew up this is my

3761
02:54:30,959 --> 02:54:34,639
home this is my stomping grounds all

3762
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:36,079
over Northern California I love this

3763
02:54:34,639 --> 02:54:38,079
place you know and the spirit and the

3764
02:54:36,079 --> 02:54:41,120
culture and the people that I've met

3765
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:45,159
here people I know here it's um a really

3766
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:47,680
unique place um it's changed my life but

3767
02:54:45,159 --> 02:54:50,079
to be able to kind of let go after so

3768
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:52,159
much gone on over the last year and then

3769
02:54:50,079 --> 02:54:53,680
be able to come here and be able to

3770
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:55,600
realize that now I get to kind of go

3771
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:57,318
back to my source and grow cannabis

3772
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:59,359
because I love it you know as like a

3773
02:54:57,318 --> 02:55:01,719
personal plant and work with all

3774
02:54:59,359 --> 02:55:03,520
different types of other medicines and

3775
02:55:01,719 --> 02:55:05,278
um I'm working with Mario from cosmic

3776
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:07,040
Force Farms is helping him building the

3777
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:08,960
house for his new sheep that he's

3778
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:11,479
bringing in and you know he's setting up

3779
02:55:08,959 --> 02:55:13,478
this whole Silo pasture setup and you

3780
02:55:11,478 --> 02:55:15,478
know for rotational grazing and it's

3781
02:55:13,478 --> 02:55:17,799
just all all these beautiful things that

3782
02:55:15,478 --> 02:55:20,199
I you know I love so much and I you know

3783
02:55:17,799 --> 02:55:22,398
I dedicate so much time in knowing and

3784
02:55:20,200 --> 02:55:24,600
that I haven't had as much time as I

3785
02:55:22,398 --> 02:55:27,519
wanted last numerous years because I've

3786
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:30,238
been distracted by things that don't

3787
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:30,238
need to be as

3788
02:55:42,559 --> 02:55:46,799
important kind of took away a long time

3789
02:55:44,799 --> 02:55:50,199
from the point that I started doing this

3790
02:55:46,799 --> 02:55:53,599
in the first place um so I feel like

3791
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:54,920
there's Beauty in the chaos and uh every

3792
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:57,640
day I'm still learning more I'm trying

3793
02:55:54,920 --> 02:56:00,040
to be more perceptive of my surrounding

3794
02:55:57,639 --> 02:56:02,318
environment and you know and really

3795
02:56:00,040 --> 02:56:04,680
listen to the messages and the lessons

3796
02:56:02,318 --> 02:56:07,719
and um I appreciate all you guys for

3797
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:09,439
what you shared today it's you know been

3798
02:56:07,719 --> 02:56:14,318
noteworthy and

3799
02:56:09,439 --> 02:56:14,318
mentionable so yeah I love you

3800
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:22,920
guys I love you guys too and and I would

3801
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:26,359
love to maybe uh it's get about 12:00

3802
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:28,159
and I'm not sure if Marcus here back yet

3803
02:56:26,359 --> 02:56:29,760
but he had to go away for a little bit

3804
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:31,639
but maybe we could talk one more thing

3805
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:35,639
about what you're most excited about on

3806
02:56:31,639 --> 02:56:37,599
your farm from this last win like I I'll

3807
02:56:35,639 --> 02:56:40,039
just say from from from our perspective

3808
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:41,640
we did a really good job of mulching

3809
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:45,239
everything last year and we don't have

3810
02:56:41,639 --> 02:56:47,680
the opportunity to grow crops in the

3811
02:56:45,238 --> 02:56:49,719
winter um because it's freezing and tons

3812
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:51,800
of snow had an extra amount of snow this

3813
02:56:49,719 --> 02:56:54,039
winter so we have to really focus on

3814
02:56:51,799 --> 02:56:56,398
mulching and so what we that's why we

3815
02:56:54,040 --> 02:56:58,399
say mulch love everything is mulch

3816
02:56:56,398 --> 02:57:00,238
without mulch in the dream it'll never

3817
02:56:58,398 --> 02:57:02,478
come true and when we're fancy we like

3818
02:57:00,238 --> 02:57:05,279
to say mche just because that's good

3819
02:57:02,478 --> 02:57:07,639
bone mche yeah but um you know we're

3820
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:09,560
peeling the the garden's covered in

3821
02:57:07,639 --> 02:57:11,879
mulch right now like a blanket and so

3822
02:57:09,559 --> 02:57:15,238
now I'm just sort of using my hands and

3823
02:57:11,879 --> 02:57:17,039
ripping the mulch back it's just filled

3824
02:57:15,238 --> 02:57:19,680
everything's just moving all over and

3825
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:22,560
it's like matted down so there's it's

3826
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:25,318
matting like plastic wood matting weeds

3827
02:57:22,559 --> 02:57:27,439
down and now we're just planting new and

3828
02:57:25,318 --> 02:57:29,680
I just take a little pickaxe and I just

3829
02:57:27,439 --> 02:57:31,600
kind of pick like a pasty or a hodab and

3830
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:34,040
I just pick that line just kind of fluff

3831
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:36,200
up the soil a little bit take my hand go

3832
02:57:34,040 --> 02:57:38,640
like that and put seeds on it and then

3833
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:41,040
we just cover it back up so most of the

3834
02:57:38,639 --> 02:57:43,199
garden stays mulched and then we just

3835
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:45,200
have these little babies coming up and

3836
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:47,200
everywhere around us is covered and

3837
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:49,680
everything's wet right now every the

3838
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:51,520
whole entire Earth is just just

3839
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:55,040
everywhere you walk it's wet because of

3840
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:57,040
the the snow melt um so um I'm really

3841
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:59,880
excited looking at the the health of the

3842
02:57:57,040 --> 02:58:02,359
soil right now and in some cases we left

3843
02:57:59,879 --> 02:58:05,839
the greenhouse on uh Tina was talking

3844
02:58:02,359 --> 02:58:07,880
about how hard it is to grow in Colorado

3845
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:10,719
it's extremely difficult to grow here in

3846
02:58:07,879 --> 02:58:13,039
the cies of British Columbia too and we

3847
02:58:10,719 --> 02:58:15,159
get early Frost and crazy temperatures

3848
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:17,760
so we use green houses and that's why

3849
02:58:15,159 --> 02:58:20,238
we've dug Wall-E penies and things into

3850
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:22,639
the Earth Earth and we have pipes going

3851
02:58:20,238 --> 02:58:25,238
into the ground six feet for like warm

3852
02:58:22,639 --> 02:58:27,719
air coming up and so we do have the

3853
02:58:25,238 --> 02:58:30,199
ability for Passive growth but we still

3854
02:58:27,719 --> 02:58:33,278
don't choose lights in the winter we

3855
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:35,159
just go for Passive so right now as soon

3856
02:58:33,279 --> 02:58:37,479
as the snow melts even though it's

3857
02:58:35,159 --> 02:58:39,398
freezing it's time for us to plant our

3858
02:58:37,478 --> 02:58:42,159
seeds so I'm really excited right now

3859
02:58:39,398 --> 02:58:43,920
seeing the health and the crazy life in

3860
02:58:42,159 --> 02:58:47,680
our soil and the thing that we've gone

3861
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:48,680
beyond making a compost pile now all the

3862
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:51,760
aisle

3863
02:58:48,680 --> 02:58:54,398
and all of the gardens are the compost

3864
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:57,079
any food scraps you can bury in the com

3865
02:58:54,398 --> 02:58:59,478
in the garden or feed to the chickens

3866
02:58:57,079 --> 02:59:01,920
any limbs off the trees get put in the

3867
02:58:59,478 --> 02:59:04,639
aisles any leaves everything the aisles

3868
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:06,520
by by this time I'm looking at my aisles

3869
02:59:04,639 --> 02:59:10,799
from last year and it's an

3870
02:59:06,520 --> 02:59:12,920
incredible wealth of soil so now just F

3871
02:59:10,799 --> 02:59:15,398
if I want I can just fold that aisle

3872
02:59:12,920 --> 02:59:17,719
over onto the onto the thing and to me

3873
02:59:15,398 --> 02:59:20,278
that's what an IMO is that's what I want

3874
02:59:17,719 --> 02:59:23,519
I want my indigenous microorganisms to

3875
02:59:20,279 --> 02:59:25,640
grow in the garden from local materials

3876
02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:27,800
because that's what indigenous is

3877
02:59:25,639 --> 02:59:30,519
because there's life in the plants that

3878
02:59:27,799 --> 02:59:32,478
I'm using there's bacteria fungi and

3879
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:35,399
nutrition in the plants and then that's

3880
02:59:32,478 --> 02:59:38,159
breaking down fusing and S sinking into

3881
02:59:35,398 --> 02:59:40,760
the soil and now the seeds

3882
02:59:38,159 --> 02:59:42,520
just pop through so I I want to tell you

3883
02:59:40,760 --> 02:59:44,840
guys I actually heard you talking about

3884
02:59:42,520 --> 02:59:48,079
this years years and years ago and I

3885
02:59:44,840 --> 02:59:50,559
modeled the last hle bed so it was 2500

3886
02:59:48,079 --> 02:59:53,238
square feet of uh you know three foot

3887
02:59:50,559 --> 02:59:56,278
deep and just you know like a really

3888
02:59:53,238 --> 02:59:58,959
nice lasagna Tech it was so Lush most

3889
02:59:56,279 --> 03:00:01,479
Lush Garden I ever grew and I love that

3890
02:59:58,959 --> 03:00:03,599
model of uh you know that that static

3891
03:00:01,478 --> 03:00:05,799
compost in the aisles and just keep on

3892
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:07,760
taking all that brush and that over that

3893
03:00:05,799 --> 03:00:10,438
overgrowth and piling it in there and

3894
03:00:07,760 --> 03:00:12,680
stomping it down and the mushrooms and

3895
03:00:10,439 --> 03:00:15,000
the life that we'd get out of that space

3896
03:00:12,680 --> 03:00:18,000
would just explode you know and it was

3897
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:19,559
so um so beautiful to see that Garden of

3898
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:23,478
evolve off of you know a lot of your

3899
03:00:19,559 --> 03:00:26,278
guys' teachings and um you know I like

3900
03:00:23,478 --> 03:00:29,840
the IMO right there exactly gra that's

3901
03:00:26,279 --> 03:00:31,319
the easy Farm you know work that you

3902
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:34,120
don't have to go out and capture

3903
03:00:31,318 --> 03:00:36,719
anything or add sugar to it and you can

3904
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:39,079
see right there I just love it I love

3905
03:00:36,719 --> 03:00:41,119
this the Deep mulching so much and once

3906
03:00:39,079 --> 03:00:43,079
you have that you can still get those

3907
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:45,600
organisms from that other environment

3908
03:00:43,079 --> 03:00:48,079
and you maybe may liquefy it and put it

3909
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:49,840
all over all the mulch or you pack it in

3910
03:00:48,079 --> 03:00:53,318
just know it's going to grow so you're

3911
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:53,318
always seeding

3912
03:00:57,840 --> 03:01:04,120
with certainly bringing white rice and

3913
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:04,120
collecting things that

3914
03:01:13,159 --> 03:01:19,359
grow know imos can easily come from your

3915
03:01:17,279 --> 03:01:21,640
imos which is which is your indigenous

3916
03:01:19,359 --> 03:01:23,920
microorganisms which maybe you know you

3917
03:01:21,639 --> 03:01:26,159
can see back behind tomorrow like you

3918
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:28,040
know in your farm there underneath some

3919
03:01:26,159 --> 03:01:30,398
of those trees and in some of those

3920
03:01:28,040 --> 03:01:33,040
zones they're going to be growing like

3921
03:01:30,398 --> 03:01:35,000
pristine plants or something and then

3922
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:37,520
you would pick that little zone or that

3923
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:40,680
little area you know a little tiny

3924
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:45,238
handful of soil and then that's a IMO

3925
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:48,238
for a billion trillion times

3926
03:01:45,238 --> 03:01:50,639
more I I just yeah just makes a more

3927
03:01:48,238 --> 03:01:54,478
sense so that's awesome I love that

3928
03:01:50,639 --> 03:01:56,959
fastest little with Chay and maybe Brian

3929
03:01:54,478 --> 03:01:59,879
did you want to say something yeah I was

3930
03:01:56,959 --> 03:02:01,799
gonna say that's interesting because um

3931
03:01:59,879 --> 03:02:04,000
what I found on this land after it was

3932
03:02:01,799 --> 03:02:05,398
post clearcut we came in and kind of

3933
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:07,279
helped us to be that but it was really

3934
03:02:05,398 --> 03:02:09,278
messy and then I pushed like over a mile

3935
03:02:07,279 --> 03:02:11,960
of trails with help last year around the

3936
03:02:09,279 --> 03:02:14,238
property and even from the trails on off

3937
03:02:11,959 --> 03:02:16,559
the original clearcut the skitter Trails

3938
03:02:14,238 --> 03:02:19,920
there was a lot of deposited humus that

3939
03:02:16,559 --> 03:02:21,920
was turned over an humus and it opened

3940
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:23,639
it up to exposure to the Sun so it was

3941
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:26,439
drying out in portions but I've been

3942
03:02:23,639 --> 03:02:28,358
able to isolate Pockets that are kind of

3943
03:02:26,439 --> 03:02:30,600
getting worked but they're still fresh

3944
03:02:28,359 --> 03:02:33,238
and then I reintroduced like Leaf litter

3945
03:02:30,600 --> 03:02:35,439
and other you know microorganism based

3946
03:02:33,238 --> 03:02:37,398
natural litter and kind of try to

3947
03:02:35,439 --> 03:02:39,120
restore it naturally with fluffing it up

3948
03:02:37,398 --> 03:02:42,199
more and letting it grow but I've been

3949
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:45,000
able to pull uh natural Forest humus out

3950
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:49,000
locally here and we've shifted out of

3951
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:51,120
any type of uh purchase bounty or any uh

3952
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:53,879
ancient humus that's in a bag all the

3953
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:55,800
way from Alaska or anywhere else so

3954
03:02:53,879 --> 03:02:57,639
we're actually like implementing that

3955
03:02:55,799 --> 03:03:00,358
that Forest humus of ours into the

3956
03:02:57,639 --> 03:03:04,119
compost tea that we're we know growing

3957
03:03:00,359 --> 03:03:07,720
our our melum flats from it and really

3958
03:03:04,120 --> 03:03:10,319
just having a great great turn off it so

3959
03:03:07,719 --> 03:03:10,318
want to share

3960
03:03:11,879 --> 03:03:17,358
that and Sh what were you are you doing

3961
03:03:14,879 --> 03:03:19,679
any new tech on the land this year and

3962
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:21,479
and you you have an area of forest that

3963
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:24,439
that's been cleared you're in you're

3964
03:03:21,478 --> 03:03:25,398
you're re re reinoculated and reworking

3965
03:03:24,439 --> 03:03:27,200
things what are some of the things

3966
03:03:25,398 --> 03:03:30,358
you're going to be doing this

3967
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:32,159
year yeah we do hemp up here too it's

3968
03:03:30,359 --> 03:03:33,600
nice to have some high quality hemp but

3969
03:03:32,159 --> 03:03:35,159
really I think the bigger benefit is

3970
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:37,680
actually like preparing the land

3971
03:03:35,159 --> 03:03:39,920
improving the land so we just harvest

3972
03:03:37,680 --> 03:03:42,398
the main colas and then chop and drop it

3973
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:43,920
back in and spreading microbes this is

3974
03:03:42,398 --> 03:03:46,079
the first year that we won't have to

3975
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:48,120
till you know that's a dirty word it's

3976
03:03:46,079 --> 03:03:50,120
something that I don't want to do but we

3977
03:03:48,120 --> 03:03:53,319
actually ended up on basically a glacial

3978
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:56,160
till and sand for our our subsoil here

3979
03:03:53,318 --> 03:03:58,039
we got a couple inches of called so soil

3980
03:03:56,159 --> 03:04:00,639
or Forest findes maybe that we stripped

3981
03:03:58,040 --> 03:04:02,880
off the top but it's been hard to get

3982
03:04:00,639 --> 03:04:04,879
the soil structure and so we've been

3983
03:04:02,879 --> 03:04:07,759
turning back in organic matter a lot of

3984
03:04:04,879 --> 03:04:09,719
clover and Al Alpa and we're finally at

3985
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:12,079
the point now we don't have to to till

3986
03:04:09,719 --> 03:04:14,199
anymore so I'm super excited about that

3987
03:04:12,079 --> 03:04:17,439
it's just a lasagna Tech from here

3988
03:04:14,200 --> 03:04:20,920
forward really really thick Guild or um

3989
03:04:17,439 --> 03:04:23,040
living mulch support species last year

3990
03:04:20,920 --> 03:04:25,520
and so it was nice to to see this spring

3991
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:27,520
there's this heavy mat and the snow is

3992
03:04:25,520 --> 03:04:30,238
laid it all nice and down flat it's

3993
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:32,720
decomposing super quickly because we are

3994
03:04:30,238 --> 03:04:34,199
pretty heavy on the microbes so it's

3995
03:04:32,719 --> 03:04:37,000
great to see the soil really coming

3996
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:40,000
around it's gone from Sand to like this

3997
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:43,079
black lomy crumb what we're what we're

3998
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:45,079
looking for so that's uh that's the

3999
03:04:43,079 --> 03:04:47,159
biggest thing I think the most exciting

4000
03:04:45,079 --> 03:04:48,159
thing of all is to have the best soil

4001
03:04:47,159 --> 03:04:51,279
possible

4002
03:04:48,159 --> 03:04:51,279
because it all comes from

4003
03:04:55,398 --> 03:05:00,840
that and JJ what about you you

4004
03:05:13,238 --> 03:05:19,920
you're situation um so there's like

4005
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:21,120
really especially on my spot there's

4006
03:05:19,920 --> 03:05:25,359
major

4007
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:28,560
drainage so you know my main focus has

4008
03:05:25,359 --> 03:05:29,720
been and will continue to be uh bringing

4009
03:05:28,559 --> 03:05:32,639
organic

4010
03:05:29,719 --> 03:05:34,519
material um so it's just like anything

4011
03:05:32,639 --> 03:05:37,159
that I can grow like I've just set up a

4012
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:40,079
couple gray water systems with comfrey

4013
03:05:37,159 --> 03:05:43,039
planted um so I can like get the uh

4014
03:05:40,079 --> 03:05:46,039
nitrogen from my sink for that uh

4015
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:48,680
specific project um but you know I need

4016
03:05:46,040 --> 03:05:51,239
to get animals on the property still I

4017
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:53,559
have some chickens but my chicken setup

4018
03:05:51,238 --> 03:05:56,439
through the harsh winter wasn't really

4019
03:05:53,559 --> 03:05:58,920
ideal so I had some deaths that in that

4020
03:05:56,439 --> 03:06:00,720
you know Department um but yeah like you

4021
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:03,120
know my focus is definitely going to be

4022
03:06:00,719 --> 03:06:07,199
on organic material either sourcing it

4023
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:09,479
from Neighbors or um you know finding a

4024
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:14,520
way to either grow more things like

4025
03:06:09,478 --> 03:06:14,519
Alfalfa and and things like that

4026
03:06:20,439 --> 03:06:27,120
so on Down the Line Craig how about you

4027
03:06:23,840 --> 03:06:29,159
you had a spectacular Garden last year a

4028
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:31,239
field of giant plants you know looked

4029
03:06:29,159 --> 03:06:33,600
like a field you know you know but still

4030
03:06:31,238 --> 03:06:36,920
it was just and I love the way you used

4031
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:36,920
the straw bales and

4032
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:48,719
every last year was our first year of

4033
03:06:46,318 --> 03:06:51,639
scaling the farm down Again by another

4034
03:06:48,719 --> 03:06:54,278
7,000 square feet um so we're down to

4035
03:06:51,639 --> 03:06:57,039
like 10,000 like I said earlier and that

4036
03:06:54,279 --> 03:06:59,560
was exponential difference you know we

4037
03:06:57,040 --> 03:07:03,560
grew 10 different cultivars nine are on

4038
03:06:59,559 --> 03:07:05,398
a menu at a a local shop and the 10th is

4039
03:07:03,559 --> 03:07:09,559
waiting to be released as our next uh

4040
03:07:05,398 --> 03:07:12,398
Farm cured extraction extracted rosin so

4041
03:07:09,559 --> 03:07:16,159
getting smaller was really beneficial um

4042
03:07:12,398 --> 03:07:20,639
but to answer your specifically Josh we

4043
03:07:16,159 --> 03:07:24,680
we took our our um cover cropping to

4044
03:07:20,639 --> 03:07:26,799
like the next level we wanted to uh

4045
03:07:24,680 --> 03:07:30,479
consider our cover crop or offseason

4046
03:07:26,799 --> 03:07:31,959
crop as as as the main goal of the farm

4047
03:07:30,478 --> 03:07:33,920
you know during the winter time here in

4048
03:07:31,959 --> 03:07:36,959
Humble County we get a lot of rain we

4049
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:39,680
get really nice growing temperatures for

4050
03:07:36,959 --> 03:07:44,318
greens right so we're growing you know

4051
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:47,960
fava Bell vetch um these types of plants

4052
03:07:44,318 --> 03:07:50,799
as and and we made due diligence at the

4053
03:07:47,959 --> 03:07:53,759
end of harvest last year to get in

4054
03:07:50,799 --> 03:07:55,799
immediately and um we grew out probably

4055
03:07:53,760 --> 03:07:58,800
one of the best cover crops we've ever

4056
03:07:55,799 --> 03:08:02,159
produced and and going into a drought

4057
03:07:58,799 --> 03:08:04,000
season um we feel the most uh the most

4058
03:08:02,159 --> 03:08:06,359
beneficial thing we could do and Dr Lane

4059
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:08,799
Ingam was just here about uh the end of

4060
03:08:06,359 --> 03:08:10,279
January and she she really spoke to that

4061
03:08:08,799 --> 03:08:12,879
she gave a whole presentation about

4062
03:08:10,279 --> 03:08:16,600
organic material in your soil and

4063
03:08:12,879 --> 03:08:18,119
organic matter um will really help with

4064
03:08:16,600 --> 03:08:19,559
water preservation

4065
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:21,200
you know that was kind of like one of

4066
03:08:19,559 --> 03:08:23,478
the models you keep hearing me talk

4067
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:25,479
about through the whole process was not

4068
03:08:23,478 --> 03:08:27,920
what are we doing to make more money how

4069
03:08:25,478 --> 03:08:29,760
are we saving the money and how are we

4070
03:08:27,920 --> 03:08:31,840
saving the water how are we saving the

4071
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:35,719
resource how are we working with our own

4072
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:38,880
farm and our own way of keeping that all

4073
03:08:35,719 --> 03:08:42,438
here whether it's the water um and our

4074
03:08:38,879 --> 03:08:45,879
and we're really blessed to have uh

4075
03:08:42,439 --> 03:08:47,880
the uh I gu agriculture we have in

4076
03:08:45,879 --> 03:08:50,199
Humble County so I kind of look at

4077
03:08:47,879 --> 03:08:52,639
closing my Loops within the county um

4078
03:08:50,200 --> 03:08:54,239
we've got an ocean we've got the

4079
03:08:52,639 --> 03:08:57,159
farmlands we we're working with an

4080
03:08:54,238 --> 03:08:59,398
organic Dairy to get their compost uh

4081
03:08:57,159 --> 03:09:01,840
not even their compost it's it's their

4082
03:08:59,398 --> 03:09:01,840
uh raw

4083
03:09:12,639 --> 03:09:21,278
manure we're able to get loads of this

4084
03:09:16,359 --> 03:09:22,880
uh amazing alal Al now um so I our goal

4085
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:25,359
one day would probably be to close the

4086
03:09:22,879 --> 03:09:28,639
loops like within our little region of

4087
03:09:25,359 --> 03:09:29,960
you know us and Rio and Lady sativa but

4088
03:09:28,639 --> 03:09:31,599
at the moment we're working within

4089
03:09:29,959 --> 03:09:34,559
Humble County we mentioned mushroom Mike

4090
03:09:31,600 --> 03:09:37,720
at the beginning he's growing in seeding

4091
03:09:34,559 --> 03:09:40,119
spawn of mushroom into the native tanos

4092
03:09:37,719 --> 03:09:42,799
and then those tanos are producing the

4093
03:09:40,120 --> 03:09:46,359
mushroom to go to culinary and Farmers

4094
03:09:42,799 --> 03:09:48,079
Market U mushrooms and medicinal reies

4095
03:09:46,359 --> 03:09:49,800
and then all those mushroom blocks are

4096
03:09:48,079 --> 03:09:51,600
coming back to the farm so we're

4097
03:09:49,799 --> 03:09:53,639
constantly taking these Forest Products

4098
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:55,559
and and ocean products and and just

4099
03:09:53,639 --> 03:09:57,959
moving them around the county and kind

4100
03:09:55,559 --> 03:10:00,760
of doing what the salmon and the bear

4101
03:09:57,959 --> 03:10:03,438
and the rivers did um but at the moment

4102
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:04,920
we're using a little bit of of uh you

4103
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:07,120
know fuels but we're trying to be as

4104
03:10:04,920 --> 03:10:08,719
efficient as we can to move those

4105
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:12,680
products around and and kind of keep

4106
03:10:08,719 --> 03:10:16,039
that Loop closed within our County and

4107
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:19,079
and again it's like all this knowledge

4108
03:10:16,040 --> 03:10:21,560
share is is like so important and and I

4109
03:10:19,079 --> 03:10:23,079
appreciate everybody you know so many of

4110
03:10:21,559 --> 03:10:27,119
the things we're talking about whether

4111
03:10:23,079 --> 03:10:28,760
it's the genetics or or specific tip um

4112
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:31,319
the biggest tip I would probably share

4113
03:10:28,760 --> 03:10:33,639
with everyone is um one of our ways of

4114
03:10:31,318 --> 03:10:36,238
terminating our cover crop is it's we

4115
03:10:33,639 --> 03:10:39,199
call it skier or grown Tech and I pull

4116
03:10:36,238 --> 03:10:42,199
out these old skis that I have and I

4117
03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:43,880
literally sidestep my cover crop down

4118
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:46,880
and um some people are say well why

4119
03:10:43,879 --> 03:10:46,879
don't

4120
03:11:15,279 --> 03:11:20,680
terminate on my cover crop so having

4121
03:11:18,238 --> 03:11:23,079
that time for the beneficials and and

4122
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:26,279
all my insects to move around is super

4123
03:11:23,079 --> 03:11:27,840
beneficial so I would say uh yeah take a

4124
03:11:26,279 --> 03:11:30,279
moment and think of other ways to

4125
03:11:27,840 --> 03:11:32,398
terminate your cover crop um even if you

4126
03:11:30,279 --> 03:11:35,720
have a bigger Farm sometimes just backd

4127
03:11:32,398 --> 03:11:38,119
dragging the the the loader bucket of

4128
03:11:35,719 --> 03:11:39,840
your tractor if you have that big of a

4129
03:11:38,120 --> 03:11:42,640
farm where you don't have the human

4130
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:46,318
capacity to to do that but just get away

4131
03:11:42,639 --> 03:11:48,439
from tilling as as best you can and no

4132
03:11:46,318 --> 03:11:50,079
judgment you know every everybody takes

4133
03:11:48,439 --> 03:11:52,200
their own process to get to that we were

4134
03:11:50,079 --> 03:11:54,039
in smart pots for the first couple years

4135
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:56,720
we tried taking smart pots to the next

4136
03:11:54,040 --> 03:11:59,279
level cardboard line cover crops

4137
03:11:56,719 --> 03:12:02,079
potatoes all that and then finally you

4138
03:11:59,279 --> 03:12:04,720
know we just dump those out onto Rosa

4139
03:12:02,079 --> 03:12:04,719
cardboard and

4140
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:14,639
so everyone along the

4141
03:12:11,879 --> 03:12:16,519
process I really appreciate that Craig

4142
03:12:14,639 --> 03:12:18,920
so much that was very beautiful and I

4143
03:12:16,520 --> 03:12:20,760
love that your grown Tech where you just

4144
03:12:18,920 --> 03:12:23,238
take your skis and push it over and I

4145
03:12:20,760 --> 03:12:24,880
just want to you know say that that you

4146
03:12:23,238 --> 03:12:28,079
know that can be done on a thousand

4147
03:12:24,879 --> 03:12:29,719
acres you know like rolling and crimping

4148
03:12:28,079 --> 03:12:31,680
is what's you know that is what they

4149
03:12:29,719 --> 03:12:33,278
call it on a on a large scale and it's

4150
03:12:31,680 --> 03:12:35,479
just taking a tractor and putting a Big

4151
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:37,960
Barrel in front of it and just running

4152
03:12:35,478 --> 03:12:40,478
the tractor over the the crop and just

4153
03:12:37,959 --> 03:12:43,119
pushing it over and that's like what no

4154
03:12:40,478 --> 03:12:45,438
till looks like on a thousand acres and

4155
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:48,439
then there's a disc that goes behind it

4156
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:51,639
and just splits the the cover crop and

4157
03:12:48,439 --> 03:12:54,600
then you plant in that spot so that's

4158
03:12:51,639 --> 03:12:57,478
nice to know that something that's so it

4159
03:12:54,600 --> 03:13:00,680
seems like a you know Grassroots Farm

4160
03:12:57,478 --> 03:13:02,599
level can be is also tech for you know

4161
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:04,520
saving the whole entire world thousands

4162
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:06,159
of Acres you know Josh I'm going to drop

4163
03:13:04,520 --> 03:13:09,760
just one little bit of information that

4164
03:13:06,159 --> 03:13:12,119
we've been doing too and that is um you

4165
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:14,719
we brought a trencher on to to trench in

4166
03:13:12,120 --> 03:13:19,120
some some piping and some some

4167
03:13:14,719 --> 03:13:19,119
electrical lines and then I was

4168
03:13:24,079 --> 03:13:27,359
push up anywhere I was remember where

4169
03:13:25,478 --> 03:13:29,079
everything is but then I took it to the

4170
03:13:27,359 --> 03:13:30,680
next level and I started trenching like

4171
03:13:29,079 --> 03:13:33,760
the floor of my greenhouse and my

4172
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:36,279
Pathways and filling it all with wood

4173
03:13:33,760 --> 03:13:39,159
chips and a little bit of compost and

4174
03:13:36,279 --> 03:13:41,279
building all these biological batteries

4175
03:13:39,159 --> 03:13:44,520
within my property and all these sinks

4176
03:13:41,279 --> 03:13:46,359
of biology so um just always think about

4177
03:13:44,520 --> 03:13:49,000
like when you're doing one task how you

4178
03:13:46,359 --> 03:13:51,120
can over overlap those systems and and

4179
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:52,719
when you're going to put soil back in

4180
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:54,439
the earth covering something up what

4181
03:13:52,719 --> 03:13:57,119
could you put back in its place as well

4182
03:13:54,439 --> 03:13:57,120
to to

4183
03:14:00,760 --> 03:14:05,600
buffer so good so good B I guess on Down

4184
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:07,639
the Line maybe briy best friend fars

4185
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:12,079
will go up that's what I'm seeing on my

4186
03:14:07,639 --> 03:14:12,079
screen go Bri what's up

4187
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:30,200
newer pure farmer you've gone changes

4188
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:30,200
you're transforming a clearcut

4189
03:14:37,760 --> 03:14:42,639
you excited about we know that you're

4190
03:14:40,040 --> 03:14:44,399
doing a lot of new stuff up and huge UPS

4191
03:14:42,639 --> 03:14:47,238
to all the main

4192
03:14:44,398 --> 03:14:49,398
Farmers yeah yeah really yeah thank you

4193
03:14:47,238 --> 03:14:51,039
and I same and like really proud of how

4194
03:14:49,398 --> 03:14:53,959
people are doing it here in Maine we've

4195
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:56,920
been able to stay uh medical kind of

4196
03:14:53,959 --> 03:14:59,358
stubbornly but also you know by choice

4197
03:14:56,920 --> 03:15:02,120
so and we're approaching it like a small

4198
03:14:59,359 --> 03:15:04,920
craft and small batch mentality which

4199
03:15:02,120 --> 03:15:08,200
main kind of is anyway so really proud

4200
03:15:04,920 --> 03:15:10,279
of that but um I'm excited about always

4201
03:15:08,200 --> 03:15:12,880
about compost and after we're here for

4202
03:15:10,279 --> 03:15:15,520
our fifth year it's finally starting to

4203
03:15:12,879 --> 03:15:17,679
get uh to the point where it's got such

4204
03:15:15,520 --> 03:15:19,279
a good Continuum and the biomass that

4205
03:15:17,680 --> 03:15:22,520
just comes from the even the smaller

4206
03:15:19,279 --> 03:15:24,439
scale hemp and cannabis is so amazing it

4207
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:28,000
seems like between like the carbon and

4208
03:15:24,439 --> 03:15:30,120
the nitrogen ratio and and the local

4209
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:32,279
cultures or spores that are within back

4210
03:15:30,120 --> 03:15:35,279
to it so we got a great Continuum for

4211
03:15:32,279 --> 03:15:37,680
rebuffing the soil and I think that that

4212
03:15:35,279 --> 03:15:39,960
would be probably the easiest thing to

4213
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:42,800
share maybe or that I don't know a lot

4214
03:15:39,959 --> 03:15:45,119
of in depth anyway scientific based info

4215
03:15:42,799 --> 03:15:47,478
but I know that we can all on any scale

4216
03:15:45,120 --> 03:15:49,359
compost back in the cities in the

4217
03:15:47,478 --> 03:15:51,358
country and really make our own compost

4218
03:15:49,359 --> 03:15:53,960
just from the circular Continuum of the

4219
03:15:51,359 --> 03:15:56,439
Cannabis and the hemp almost entirely

4220
03:15:53,959 --> 03:15:58,278
and we're introducing good like local

4221
03:15:56,439 --> 03:16:00,318
fruit bodies we had a great mushroom

4222
03:15:58,279 --> 03:16:03,040
year so we went out and collected stuff

4223
03:16:00,318 --> 03:16:05,238
that was like dying back and I got you

4224
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:07,279
know multiple different sports to add in

4225
03:16:05,238 --> 03:16:10,559
it seems to be popping up fruit bodies

4226
03:16:07,279 --> 03:16:13,960
even into the organic indoor it's it's

4227
03:16:10,559 --> 03:16:15,680
working there and I would say that I'm

4228
03:16:13,959 --> 03:16:18,119
actually really excited to learn so much

4229
03:16:15,680 --> 03:16:20,559
today and thank all you guys for you

4230
03:16:18,120 --> 03:16:23,000
know paying it back to Mother Earth

4231
03:16:20,559 --> 03:16:26,079
because it's definitely it's needed it's

4232
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:28,120
it's man or humans rather have have kind

4233
03:16:26,079 --> 03:16:30,799
of scarred the Earth in a way that has

4234
03:16:28,120 --> 03:16:33,120
allowed us to live here in subside so it

4235
03:16:30,799 --> 03:16:35,759
just feels like the most important task

4236
03:16:33,120 --> 03:16:38,880
that we're all taking pretty seriously

4237
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:41,040
and um rejuvenating the Earth where

4238
03:16:38,879 --> 03:16:43,599
we've you know cleared to live to have

4239
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:46,040
animals to farm so the regenerative

4240
03:16:43,600 --> 03:16:48,840
Mission just seems so uh needed more

4241
03:16:46,040 --> 03:16:50,640
than ever right now and I'm super happy

4242
03:16:48,840 --> 03:16:53,000
to be part of it and learned from all

4243
03:16:50,639 --> 03:16:55,000
you guys today I would say that thank

4244
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:57,159
you Josh and Kelly like totally answered

4245
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:59,559
a question or not question but like I

4246
03:16:57,159 --> 03:17:01,359
had motivation to fill my aisles after

4247
03:16:59,559 --> 03:17:04,039
we correct our hemp field more this year

4248
03:17:01,359 --> 03:17:06,760
for our rais beds and getting it to the

4249
03:17:04,040 --> 03:17:08,880
no tail point so I'm I'm GNA just fill

4250
03:17:06,760 --> 03:17:12,040
up the aisles with the with the local

4251
03:17:08,879 --> 03:17:13,639
biomass and you know scraps and and the

4252
03:17:12,040 --> 03:17:16,199
wood from the clean out of the stuff

4253
03:17:13,639 --> 03:17:18,039
that's already down and and rotting so

4254
03:17:16,199 --> 03:17:21,520
we're really going to try to just make

4255
03:17:18,040 --> 03:17:25,920
it not as much of the I guess aisle idea

4256
03:17:21,520 --> 03:17:25,920
with it or Rose maybe as much as it is

4257
03:17:38,879 --> 03:17:45,519
building so incredibly potent and uh one

4258
03:17:43,680 --> 03:17:48,040
last thing that I wanted to say before

4259
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:50,040
we and Duke I don't know know I I sort

4260
03:17:48,040 --> 03:17:53,279
of had a feeling that you may know that

4261
03:17:50,040 --> 03:17:55,239
Bukowski poem by heart so if that's

4262
03:17:53,279 --> 03:17:57,359
something that you wanted to recite and

4263
03:17:55,238 --> 03:17:59,039
then we could end with Alexandra in a

4264
03:17:57,359 --> 03:18:00,760
thought that would be really awesome

4265
03:17:59,040 --> 03:18:03,359
because I'm feeling that from you that

4266
03:18:00,760 --> 03:18:05,279
you know that and I have I have a Vibe

4267
03:18:03,359 --> 03:18:07,960
on that but one thing I wanted to just

4268
03:18:05,279 --> 03:18:10,840
say in leaving with everybody is the

4269
03:18:07,959 --> 03:18:13,119
word legacy we've been talking about it

4270
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:16,238
a lot tonight and like this idea of like

4271
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:18,600
Legacy and like leaving a legacy and you

4272
03:18:16,238 --> 03:18:21,639
don't leave a legacy with things and

4273
03:18:18,600 --> 03:18:24,520
stuff you live you leave a legacy with

4274
03:18:21,639 --> 03:18:28,278
heart and soul you leave a legacy with

4275
03:18:24,520 --> 03:18:30,319
fruit trees and beautiful soil so that

4276
03:18:28,279 --> 03:18:31,920
your children have your seeds that they

4277
03:18:30,318 --> 03:18:35,318
can just go out and put them in the

4278
03:18:31,920 --> 03:18:37,920
ground so that they can be taken care of

4279
03:18:35,318 --> 03:18:40,799
you leave a legacy by supporting other

4280
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:44,159
people who are leaving that same kind of

4281
03:18:40,799 --> 03:18:46,438
Legacy so you know the re-evaluation of

4282
03:18:44,159 --> 03:18:48,760
what that word is but uh and one one

4283
03:18:46,439 --> 03:18:50,159
thing just really quickly like to say

4284
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:52,760
I'd like to just give thanks to the

4285
03:18:50,159 --> 03:18:57,079
birth of our granddaughter and I like to

4286
03:18:52,760 --> 03:19:01,159
say as a legacy Kelly as a midwife in

4287
03:18:57,079 --> 03:19:04,000
our home on the land on our own

4288
03:19:01,159 --> 03:19:06,079
terms having our children at home you

4289
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:09,559
know these are the legacies you know

4290
03:19:06,079 --> 03:19:13,238
this is the this is nature this is

4291
03:19:09,559 --> 03:19:15,478
evolution this is regeneration it's it's

4292
03:19:13,238 --> 03:19:17,639
powerful and uh I just feel really

4293
03:19:15,478 --> 03:19:21,438
grateful and thankful giving the

4294
03:19:17,639 --> 03:19:23,799
opportunity for the ultimate optimal

4295
03:19:21,439 --> 03:19:26,120
outcome and that's what we're all doing

4296
03:19:23,799 --> 03:19:28,799
here is we're giving opportunity for the

4297
03:19:26,120 --> 03:19:31,399
ultimate outcome and I just appreciate

4298
03:19:28,799 --> 03:19:34,119
you all so much and I wanted to hand it

4299
03:19:31,398 --> 03:19:34,920
um over to Duke uh because I I'd love to

4300
03:19:34,120 --> 03:19:38,720
hear

4301
03:19:34,920 --> 03:19:41,040
it well I was too afraid to recite it

4302
03:19:38,719 --> 03:19:42,760
off the mind I was like running risk of

4303
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:45,600
butchering it and then I'm going to have

4304
03:19:42,760 --> 03:19:47,199
like some angry Poet Society hunt me

4305
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:52,359
down and beat me up

4306
03:19:47,199 --> 03:19:52,359
so definitely uh I'll just read

4307
03:19:53,680 --> 03:20:01,079
it Charles Bowski go all the way if

4308
03:19:58,199 --> 03:20:04,120
you're going to try go all the way

4309
03:20:01,079 --> 03:20:07,760
otherwise don't even start this could

4310
03:20:04,120 --> 03:20:10,439
mean losing girlfriends wives relatives

4311
03:20:07,760 --> 03:20:13,199
or maybe even your mind it could mean

4312
03:20:10,439 --> 03:20:15,639
not eating for 3 or 4 days it could mean

4313
03:20:13,199 --> 03:20:18,159
freezing on a park bench it could mean

4314
03:20:15,639 --> 03:20:22,680
jail it could mean derision it could

4315
03:20:18,159 --> 03:20:25,119
mean mockery isolation but isolation is

4316
03:20:22,680 --> 03:20:26,680
the gift all others are just a test of

4317
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:29,279
your endurance and how much you really

4318
03:20:26,680 --> 03:20:31,760
want to do it and you'll do it despite

4319
03:20:29,279 --> 03:20:33,840
the rejection and the worst odds and it

4320
03:20:31,760 --> 03:20:36,639
will be better than anything you can

4321
03:20:33,840 --> 03:20:39,040
imagine if you're going to try go all

4322
03:20:36,639 --> 03:20:42,159
the way there is no other feeling like

4323
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:45,239
that be alone with the gods and the

4324
03:20:42,159 --> 03:20:48,238
nights will flame with fire and you will

4325
03:20:45,238 --> 03:20:52,159
ride life straight to perfect laughter

4326
03:20:48,238 --> 03:20:52,159
it's the only good fight there

4327
03:21:07,879 --> 03:21:15,159
is want to give thanks to everyone out

4328
03:21:10,840 --> 03:21:17,159
in the world watching us take this and

4329
