1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,220
hey guys welcome to bum man's world it

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,440
is a very early morning here in bubble

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:09,919
man's world I'm about 7 o'clock in the

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,690
morning just woke up at about 6:30 and

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,759
I'm happy to inform all of you guys that

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,679
we aren't going to see the great

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,289
gardener today we're gonna head on over

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,570
to Vancouver Island and we're gonna make

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,830
our way over to see him and he's

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,829
apparently done all sorts of fun things

11
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:28,259
for us to check out he's got multiple

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:31,768
seed crops that he's had drying for

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,510
weeks that are ready to de-seed and turn

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:37,379
into hash so we're always happy to be

15
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:40,170
there for that he's got some other crops

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,879
I believe in bloom I'm not exactly sure

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,550
of what flowering period that will be

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,229
seen but it's always a pleasure to talk

19
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,328
with Mac he's always got a lot of

20
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,738
information so I figured we get this

21
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,079
video started out the right way

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:58,709
bubbleman style by finding a bottle

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,420
ready so this could be interesting

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,128
there's my lighter from the greenhouse

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,600
it's probably the only one I have I

26
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:06,959
don't use lighters very often these days

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,210
and then I'm gonna have a little beeline

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm gonna grab a little full-mouth

29
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,978
bubble or dry sipped got a little bit

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,259
left on the card here remember when

31
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,640
you're dry sip to stable it's not a big

32
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,368
deal to turn it upside down you're not

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,680
gonna lose your stuff all right I'm

34
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:27,810
going to pull out the Swiss perc today

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,049
because I have packed the mothership all

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,570
right quick little rip I'm not sure how

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,640
much I'm gonna you know spend time on

38
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,868
the ferry videotaping it in the car and

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,079
whatnot today I've had a lot of

40
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:42,060
complaints over there over the videos

41
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,819
that I show too much stuff that's not

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,409
really exciting to see but I'm gonna

43
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,978
show I'm gonna try and see some good

44
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,719
stuff off the coast of the ferry and

45
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:53,670
then we'll get right to it and we'll get

46
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,739

doubtful melt it's probably a couple of

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,818
years old well yeah I think we're gonna

56

58
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,779

59
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,290
an hour going here for the first part

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,449
I'm gonna try and film multiple parts

61

62
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:51,780

00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:56,939
going to enjoy during this video and

64
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,830
let's get this baby started alright the

65
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,930
nasty vegetable boring out there this

66
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,760
morning you know what

67
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,830
we live in a rainforest and we require a

68
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,829
certain amount of water for our trees to

69
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:13,420
stay as big and healthy as they are

70
00:03:08,830 --> 00:04:07,990
on days like today and for whatever

71
00:03:13,419 --> 00:04:16,750
reason they're dolphins which is not

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:21,220
here to trick the mind of that time

73
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:24,839
Johnny's not here to chase the mind he's

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,780
already here to do its purpose of dying

75
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,060
without the driving

76
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,279
20 miles and always Leslie feel I'm a

77
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,269
job wolf at nine o'clock to watch fresh

78
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:39,349
burgers - angry trees and weeds no eyes

79
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:41,990
Pablo watch yeah bleep - hey guys I am

80
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,510
now down in my truck on the ferry here

81
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,949
I've left my driver up to enjoy some

82
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:50,120
breakfast and I figured I would come

83
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:51,620
down have a little session and yeah it's

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,329
kind of miserable out there on the deck

85
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,519
I'll show you guys a little bit more of

86
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,139
the ocean as we get closer we'll

87
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,089
hopefully keep our eyes peeled out for

88
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,389
any type of wildlife out there but I

89
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:04,549
figured it was time to come inside have

90
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,110
a few ribs and I've got my trippy stick

91
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,819
I haven't seen my trip you stick in a

92
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,180
while so I figured I'd pull this out an

93
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:15,019
old the old standby really I mean it's a

94
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,400
nice and small slick little unit got the

95
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:18,399
green button and

96
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:36,110
Trippi sticks anyway that was the end of

97
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,639
that particular batch of it was some

98
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,090
type of a hash plant that was in there

99
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:46,490
was definitely sift you can always tell

100
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:48,469
the sift as opposed to the bubs and

101
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,530
other even you know finger rub or

102
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:55,430
whatnot they definitely have very

103
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:58,279
specific tastes all right so we got a

104
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,269
little bit of sweet skunk so you're not

105
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:01,698
gonna be able to really see that

106
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:06,709
properly don't have the best light here

107
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:11,710
in the truck just a little tag to get

108
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:14,288
some out nice beautiful sift from a

109
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:16,478
great friend

110
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:20,498
a great friend that I'm on my way to see

111
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:25,438
who could my great friend be Coney

112
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:25,439
Island he's great

113
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,439
I wonder who it is I'm sure you guys

114
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:37,519
know who it is

115
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,519
I'm not gonna say until we get there

116
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,960
oh yeah that's sweet skunk

117
00:06:50,689 --> 00:07:01,189
for those of you that know what it's a

118
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:07,560
very wonderful resin lemony sativa spicy

119
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:08,910
light yet it has substance hard to

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,149
explain really grabs you in the back of

121
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,229
the throat oh yeah it's a very light

122
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:17,719
enjoyable smoke that you could almost

123
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:17,719
just smoke because it's so darn tasty

124
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,920
now this being a trippy stick I for sure

125
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,659
could have gotten away with walking

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,220
around up top and taking rips of this in

127
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,170
which case I'll probably do right now

128
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,990
but I just thought I'd come down to the

129
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,750
to the truck have a little session break

130
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,819
up the driving portion of the trip

131
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,079
because while we have a little bit more

132
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:49,459
we still have a little bit of a drive

133
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,599
once we've landed and of course I'm

134
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,969
gonna share a little bit of it with you

135
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,120
guys and then we will be at my great

make one 440 micron under 40 micron so

215
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,529
close to a hundred lines per inch

216
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,420
there's an eighty back there but we use

217

the hundred all the time and you've got

218
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,919

side and nice and smooth surface and

223
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,639
it's raised and then the whole screen

224
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,590
just fits right in this is going to be

225
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,569
good right on top of this woman quite an

226
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:58,110
important factor in this particular

227
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,570
system this one yeah like once I turn it

228
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,000
on you will see you'll see that this is

229
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:07,680
not your average industrial sifter this

230
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,509
thing is the shaker the shaker so tell

231
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,380
the audience ugly YouTube people out

232
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:16,379
there where you found such a device it

233
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,870
was actually a company it was a it was

234
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:23,340
an auction and it was all medical

235
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:26,819
supplies so they use these for keeping

236
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:29,389
solution constantly moving so I was I

237
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,379
started stalking those right away out

238
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,750
[Music]

239
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,910
so a lab to live reading a vibrating

240
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,160
sifter for the screens to put a screen

241
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,940
on top of it it'll sort of do the work

242
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,110
for you

243
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:51,330
so I started bidding flicked up online

244
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:53,939
which cost $3,000 $3,000 minutes so the

245
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:57,178
bidding starts is like ten twenty fifty

246
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,890
hundred hundred and fifty I put my hand

247
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:04,669
up and then the group goes combined sold

248
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:07,890
to the gentleman for 100 or seven hours

249
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:09,990
like I bought - that was crazy and then

250
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,880
I think the word Widow because the next

251
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,339
day is out she went on for a couple of

252

00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:20,879
and by the end of the auction the

255
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,729

00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:16,139
what's the numbers signify on the screen

288
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:20,159
198 so that's our p.m. so right now it's

289
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:23,550
at 198 rpm we went through we went

290
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,590
through all kinds of tests using

291
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:31,859
different rpm because I think it makes

292
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:33,730
it it goes up to 5300 oh yeah choose do

293
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:38,409
you say the sort of thing

294
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:40,349
a little shaky stuff mm-hmm amazing that

295
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:46,690
the butt is all staying in the middle

296
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:48,279
like it's neat that's a little crazy we

297
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,059
like to get a little crazy here at the

298
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,059
house of the great guard

299
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:59,750
get all kinds of experiments on with

300
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,750
what RPM works the best

301
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:07,339
we found right around 200 rpms excellent

302
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:08,569
for how many minutes you do you

303
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,129
sometimes we do it for a couple of

304
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:12,169
minutes just to do a really quick run

305
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,750
yeah but if you're just doing a regular

306
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,580
run you just put the timer on for 10

307
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:23,150
minutes and every 10 minutes and they

308
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:24,319
just sort of change change it out so how

309
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,180
long do you think we've had it on right

310
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,429

time

336
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,079

337
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,269
make sure we smoke it all I look at it I

338

look at it differently I look at it that

339
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:51,879
that but has now been enhanced by the

340
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,420
energy of whoever touched it I try to

341
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,780

00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:00,289
hairs are an incredible shape just like

501
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:06,088
standing straight up

504
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:16,459

506
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,269

507
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:24,199
are the best you always find out good

508
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:26,490
things with absolutely just wait and see

509
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,370
what happens

510
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:34,970

Afghan 73 that looks gooey you got some

nice he lost like a year old maybe six

534
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:37,000
months old that Afghani to me is just so

535
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:42,980
reminiscent of the old-school Romulan

536
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:49,519
piney and tasty strong dense little

537
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:51,349
nuggets delicious yeah come down we're

538
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,769
naming it house of the great gardeners

539
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:57,920
gonna rename the Afghani we're changing

540
00:35:54,769 --> 00:36:01,099
it to the GG number one our Afghani

541
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,480
anyway we've had it for so long and then

542
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:05,859
since we're coming to the European

543
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,829
market we just didn't want to use them

544
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:11,838
the term Afghani mmm-hmm so because

545
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:14,240
we've had it so long we've crossed it so

546
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:17,000
many times that it's no longer the

547
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:20,029
original sort of what it was right

548
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,539
so just to do it justice and everybody

549
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:26,960
got Afghani true now although in Europe

550
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:28,608
I believe that you know it was back in

551
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,619
the day anyway it was one particular

552
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:34,449
Afghani that was really responsible for

553
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:37,930
the majority of those Afghan crosses

554
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:41,649
heard the old story of Dave bringing a

555
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:46,368
thousand seeds to Amsterdam in the 80s

556
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:50,210
and having one Afghani pop and it was a

557
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:53,088
female enough to get him on camera one

be the future home of the house of a

00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,250
dream really once you start getting into

595
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:36,340
dry sick and wet washing to be able to

596
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,619
have a room you know the coolness for

597
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,930
wet washing isn't necessarily the big

598
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:43,299
component it's not it's for dry sifting

599
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:44,949
it's key but for breaking-up wet wash if

600
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,350
you're making bubble and now you're

601
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,969
breaking it up and waking the moisture

602
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:51,369
out of it so you can see Vitt or

603
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:54,519
microclimate seeping to me is much

604
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:56,679
easier in a cold yeah for sure doesn't

605
00:39:54,519 --> 00:40:01,869
get steeper is your essence days loose

606
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:04,659
and it's it's all gonna be about when

607
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:06,519
you take your stuff from the freezer you

608
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:09,699
have to pull it up in the freezer and it

609
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:13,480
starts to warm up right away like it's

610
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:16,449
by the time you finish your bag of fresh

611
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,699
frozen that end stuff isn't nearly as

612
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:20,139
cold as the beginning stuff was even

613
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:23,579
even though you're putting it back in

614
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:25,869
the freezer every time I'm sure right so

615
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,699
you know we're gonna have the washing

616
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:29,710
machine in here we're gonna have the

617
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:33,219
tumbler it's gonna be in here so we're

618
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:37,090
going to be able to take possibly fresh

619
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:39,629
frozen and run it in a tumbler see what

620
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:42,579
happens and yeah like fresh frozen sift

621
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:45,400
if we keep it cold enough is that

622
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:47,259
possible so we're gonna have that there

623
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,050
over over here we'll have this we'll

624
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,590
have to set tables we'll have the you

625
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:57,130
know mark talks about the problems he

626
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:59,260
has with the bar provides being it can't

627
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,970
be it can't be warm it can't be room

628
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:04,240
temperature you can't work with it every

629
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:06,369
step responsible it has to be cold and

630
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,699
they keep it cold at every single stage

631
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:12,279
to the point where you will have to wear

632
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:14,588
to come in here and hit the D mails

633
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,450

we're going to show you the tumbler just

646
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:52,808
so happens we got some of the beautiful

647
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:57,368
freshly seeded in CBD renee it just does

648
00:41:52,809 --> 00:42:00,640
just has a fantastic terpenoid profile

649
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:03,010
it's got a nicer roll not I mean it's

650
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:08,889
not a beautiful structure as well I like

651
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:12,880
the destruction but it's just lowly

652
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:15,400
retains the Renee small little popcorn e

653
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,048
buzz you know I would say there's a

654
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:23,980
little plaster the profile seems to take

655
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:28,900
on the fruitiness of the remain without

656
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:30,969
that sort of funk it's a real high-end

657
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,950
fruitiness it's not kind of brought down

658
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:34,909
by

659
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:38,419
useless our diesel Rene

660
