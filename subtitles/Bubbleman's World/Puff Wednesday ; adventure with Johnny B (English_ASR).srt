medtainer that's awesome of course he's

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,879
like you you could use this for grinding

260
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,120
your garlic if you want to go fishing

261

medtainer I think we count like 150 wow

263
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,919
that well I mean for so many things it's

264
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,759
true true like you can grind everything

265
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,360
with

266
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,759
it it's a grinder it's an air type water

267
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,600
type so think of the jet since in the

268
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,240
future your container there's three

269
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,240
different sizes it comes shooting up to

270
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,600
the like thousandth floor in in the sky

271
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,079
you open it up you pull it your mantain

272
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,560
you put your food in you grind up and it

273
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,479
goes back to the system it's gone it

274
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:52,119
comes back and you order your food

275
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,959
through different I'm I'm just like

276
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,639
Jetson's right now I like it I like it

277
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,039
I'm in full support of all things Johnny

278
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,200
B whatever it is you're

279
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,278
doing I broke my collar bone about 5

280
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,440
weeks ago but maybe I'll try push-ups

281
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:11,200
today at one point in time I'll try you

282
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,480
know I haven't done a pushup in 6 weeks

283
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,680
because the clavicle is pretty pretty

284
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,680
broken got some pain cream for I from

285
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,120
Johnny B oh nice nice Johnny Be pain

286
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,039
cream look at that oo smells potent it

287
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,519
works good that smells potent Johnny be

288
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,319
well listen I always have the little

289
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,959
extras right so then this container will

290
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,639
probably last me a couple years at least

291
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,278
that looks like it would last everything

292
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,879
lost me years right unless you drove

293
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,240
your truck off a highway or something or

294
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,919

295
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,799

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,440
ribs straing around all right well we'll

362
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,039

eat all

364
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,559
right all right guys so this is a little

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,720
bit of a voice over considering I'm an

366
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,479
idiot I must have accidentally clicked

367
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,720
on the mute button of this new phone so

368
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,360
this is our Samosa Journey that John and

369
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,920
I stopped in at chillak these are some

370
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,600
of the best samosas I've ever had

371
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,198
including my samosas in India and

372
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,959
there's another video after this that's

373
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:24,120
5 minutes long so I guess what I'll do

374
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:28,039
is I will record the voice over for that

375
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,639
now as well so yeah this is uh I didn't

376
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,439
want to cut it out because makes up a

377
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,320
chunk of the puff Wednesday video I

378
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,000
can't exactly remember what we were

379
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,879
talking about other than the fact that

380
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,720
we were driving around the area and it

381
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,838
was a beautiful sunny day and it was

382
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,360
just kind of Good Vibes puff Wednesday

383
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,240
always fun hanging out with John look at

384
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,879
that smile he's legitimately like the

385
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,560
happiest guy uh that I've ever met and

386
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,240
uh yeah we're just cruising around those

387
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,119
trees look like they're ripping by

388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,079
pretty darn fast we've had our samosas

389
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,600
and we're on our way to John's house

390
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:02,559
actually um to to have a couple of Puffs

391
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,399
and then to end puff Wednesday for the

392
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:09,838
for the day I am a little bit sore here

393
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,278
having had fallen at Jon's house on my

394
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,040
broken arm my left arm the clavicle was

395
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,759
broken about four and a half to five

396
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,240
weeks ago so it was healing up nicely uh

397
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:23,120
and then I collapsed and and slipped on

398
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,560
uh John's uh the log that sort of frames

399
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,919
his Cobblestone between his grass and

400
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,958
Cobblestone walkway I stepped right on

401
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,399
it it's a nice round little log and down

402
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,399
I went honestly I wish I had a video of

403
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,198
it because it was um well it was

404
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,480
probably pretty funny to to see although

405
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,919
I will say John's uh face was not

406
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,720
looking funny at all you can see the

407
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,958
beautiful Langley abbottsford mountains

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,040
there should have probably filmed more

409
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,479
of that because it is pretty

410
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,919
nice I wish I knew what John was saying

411
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,680
I wish that it wasn't um the audio

412
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,838
wasn't gone but yeah there's a new

413
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,078
button on this new phone and if you hold

414
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,959
it down uh for for a couple seconds it

415
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,399
mutes your phone and it actually turns

416
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:06,559
your your audio off when you're

417
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:10,440
recording as well um which I just

418
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:13,078
learned so yeah shout out to uh iPhone

419
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,480
creating the madness for me um but I I

420
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,559
wanted to share this because it's just

421
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,360
it's still a great video of uh you know

422
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,479
John smiling away and and just going

423
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
into deep explanations I really wish I

424
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,600
knew what he was saying it was probably

425
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,480
all like the most positive [ __ ] probably

426
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,759
talking a little bit about his AI tools

427
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:34,120
that he's been building and uh maybe

428
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,440
even a little bit of uh of of of puffing

429
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,440
so I guess we're getting closer and

430
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,600
closer to his house we were about 20

431
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,480
minutes away where we dropped my boat

432
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,600
off for the for the winter to where he

433
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,039
lives so he's in abbottford and the boat

434
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:53,240
drop off is in chillak but just was just

435
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,958
a beautiful day to um Cruise the the

436
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,079
countryside if you will you know we're

437
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,239
driving by crops we're driving by

438
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,439
mountains here Johnny be's going to give

439
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,078
us a little little shot of the the the

440
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,720
grapes and now the corn got some

441
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,918
beautiful mountains pretty much right

442
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,279
over those mountains is the US so we're

443
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,839
not too far from

444
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:16,678
America which uh funny enough later on

445
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:20,519
in the day I would end up at the Blaine

446
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:23,839
Washington border of Canada and America

447
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,160
and um yeah I had a few responsibilities

448
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,198
to do there he oh I know what he's

449
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,759
talking about he's talking about how the

450
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,919
Yellow Barn is no longer in business up

451
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,759
here and uh that it's been replaced by a

452
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,600
um it's just kind of a couple of older

453
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,720
guys talking about where uh you know

454
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,558
when things were different when oh that

455
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,038
used to be there and this used to happen

456
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,038
like that and yes life is changing as

457
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,599
always what a wonderful thing we

458
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,359

459
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,918
welcome them with open

460
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,599
arms um that being said it was nice to

461
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,600
get back to something uh familiar which

462
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,319
was just getting together with Johnny B

463
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,319

467
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,120
uh in the upcoming weeks it's not an

468
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,880
easy show to film this was really last

469
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,399
minute with no plan it was more like

470
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,640
inviting John along to my adventure of

471
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,240
returning the boat but I'm going to plan

472
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,799
a couple of good puff Wednesdays at

473
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,440
least this winter it'd be good for us to

474
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,119
go out on a little adventure and and

475
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,960
film everything and we just have such a

476
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,439
good time there's the Yellow Barn and

477
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,558
there's the

478
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,558
Triple O's Chevron that has sort of

479
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,798
replaced it back in the day if you knew

480
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,519
CH the entrance to chillak and Yaro Road

481
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:39,480
you would know that this area that

482
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,359
Yellow Barn was like a big thing and it

483
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,240
