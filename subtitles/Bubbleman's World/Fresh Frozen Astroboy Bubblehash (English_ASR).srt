2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,280
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,919
uh today just simply put we're going to

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,960
keep it simple we're going to do a

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,600
little wet washing we're going to run a

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,520
set of the Bubble Bag Originals I've got

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,359
some fresh ice I've got some chilled

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:54,039
water down here and I have two fresh

9
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,960
frozen oh a little piece of ice kind of

10
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,280
trip me out there for a second I think

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,840
we'll just keep that ice smells good so

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,400
we got some fresh Frozen uh Astro Boy

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,478
and I will come up and show you what it

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,159
is we're dealing with

15
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:13,640
here oh let's see if we can get this to

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,080
focus on that camera for you good really

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,478
really nice nuggets I can hear jibs

18
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,959
telling me break those down a little bit

19
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:22,879
more bubble man don't worry Jibber I'm

20
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:25,239
breaking these down brother so this is

21
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,478
extremely Frozen material it's been in

22
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,920
the freezer

23
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,759
for jeez I want to say a couple weeks

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,200
now it's

25
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,719
cracky and uh it's a good amount you

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,799
know this is actually a couple of plants

27
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:42,640
this time so could be anywhere from 50

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,520
to 60 gram of dry plant matter nothing

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,560
nothing monstrous I'm just growing small

30
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,679
plants but it should be a nice amount to

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,000
run for a batch of bubble there's

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,960
actually some substantial amount of

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,879
nuggets

34
00:01:52,959 --> 00:02:01,839
here so just a matter of pulling out a

35
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,839
bag ah going to grab the bags

36
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,840
so just a matter of pulling out the bag

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,920
that we're going to mix in of course

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,719
last time you may have seen that I have

39
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,439
the standard Barrel shaped which was a

40
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,680
design we came up with quite some time

41
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,120
ago uh in conjunction or not conjunction

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,439
but in sort

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,120
of after the pyramid design which was

44
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,318
designed by Acme my manufacturer uh he

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,280
came up with along with our help uh the

46
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,639
design of two uh other bags so I think

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,479
we're going to go with this one today

48
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,318
can't believe how sticky my fingers are

49
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,479
from touching this Bud right

50
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,318
here

51
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,359
so let us jeez part of me wants to use

52
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:51,799
the barrel shaped as well let's

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,080
go let's just do it let's throw a bunch

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,080
of this butt in

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,040
here get this washed this is just like

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,920
top grade butt like as good as the

57
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,679
material gets this is it right here

58
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,039
perfect size material couple of the buds

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,360
are a little bit big and once I get them

60
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,759
all in here if I don't drop them all on

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,440
the floor

62
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:18,639
prior ni save I will uh get back into

63
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,840
this and break up some of those flowers

64
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,158
that are a little bit larger than they

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,158
need to

66
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,280
be be

67
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,359
careful to not let this I am kind of

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,878
insane you know I do this so you guys

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,040
can see I do it so you can uh enjoy the

70
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,318
view but ideally you don't have to be

71
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,158
doing this out in the sun it's why I'm

72
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,158
rushing it's why I'm working very fast

73
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,239
if I was in a cooler environment in a

74
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,479
lab setting um I could have by lab I

75
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,719
mean a hash lab by no means is that on

76
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,719
par with an analytical

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,438
lab oh yeah nice big nuggets in here

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,598
getting broken down into popcorn size

79
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:10,438
they're rock hard nugs this is part of

80
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,719
the the real enjoyment here is feeling

81
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,799
how hard these nugs are even in the

82
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:19,040
Sun and although they are getting a

83
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,680
little bit sticky now just on my

84
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,800
fingers this will be a real joy to run

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,120
so we

86
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,600
will the ice cubes never a shortage of

87
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,959
ice cubes when you're running bubble

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,680
please use as much as you can don't

89
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,359
Sprint out ice is important this is a

90
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,720
mixture of homemade ice and a little bit

91
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,600
of store bought ice but the homemade ice

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,759
is gnarly solid sharp little pieces that

93
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
I jaggedly cut with a knife there's an

94
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,960
enormous amounts of these pieces of uh

95
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,439
ice cubes these are very effective ice

96
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,638
cubes when it comes to fresh frozen I

97
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,399
find I love the density of any type of

98
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,759
dark ice that is opaque and you can't

99
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,159
really see through it

100
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,160
not quite clear but more

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
cloudy all

102
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
right get that done

103
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:23,879
up sit that there and we will load up

104
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:26,680
our bubble now with some chilled water

105
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,680
move this out of the

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:35,639
way put our bucket down

107
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:40,360
all right so nice chilled

108
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:43,360
water this water is probably a solid 4Â°

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:48,280
it's extremely cold I mean

110
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,280
cold and so we'll drop that in top of

111
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,519
there all right and top that up a little

112
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,240
bit okay

113
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,679
simply

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,280
put that's really all she wrote guys it

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,160
is that easy make sure when you're

116
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,839
starting that your nozzle your drain is

117
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,199
attached I mean you want to make sure

118
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,119
that even before you pour the water in

119
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,800
obviously um I'm going to go for

120
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,800
probably a 6 Minute run on this

121
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,919
batch and we'll be back to pull this in

122
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,918
6 minutes

123
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,759
all right guys the bubble now literally

124
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,000
just finished mixing it mixed for about

125
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,680
6 minutes and uh no time like the

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,319
present to get the resin out of the

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,560
water and how do we do that we start by

128
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,479
draining the resin into the bags I've

129
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,598
got the bag sitting down here below it's

130
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,318
a gravity fed unit so gravity works in

131
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,839
your favor here once again uh it is the

132
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,160
gravity that's helping you separate the

133
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,000
resin glands from the rest of the

134
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,520
material by the resin being so dense

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,918
that it's still affected by gravity and

136
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,560
in the water while everything else of

137
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,478
course is not it's buoyant it floats

138
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,000
this is part of the magic of water

139
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,439
extraction

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,279
so not only am I going to filter that

141
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:47,038
material through but I'll also use just

142
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,000
a little bit more water I've still got a

143
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,639
little bit of cooled water here but I'll

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,639
fill this up it's never a bad

145
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:00,158
idea get a little bit of water in the

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,519
face it's all par partial

147
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:04,439
and parcel for the gain here we go a

148
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,519
little bit

149
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,598
more another little

150
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,359
rinse never a bad idea to give it a

151
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,639
little rinse very cold in here so we can

152
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,919
kind of drain that water off into the

153
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,079
corner we will of course do a second

154
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,799
batch and uh what I'll be doing almost

155
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,878
ASAP is taking this material getting it

156
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,199
into the

157
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,439
freezer so that's done oh a little bit

158
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,439
more

159
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,000
little bit more all

160
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,120
right get this guy in the

161
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,120
freezer pass this on to my

162
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,600
assistant all right so we can get the

163
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,039
bubble now off the

164
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,278
table get it into the

165
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,679
shade cuz we will be running it

166
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,078
again it's ideal if it's not sitting in

167
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,559
the sun I'll prob probably run the

168
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,559
second patch ASAP

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,600
so move these plants out a little bit

170
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,639
there we

171
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,560
go get this guy up

172
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,240
here I'm going to do one bag at a time

173
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,000
got my tools in a bunch of ice here

174
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,000
keeping it nice and cool for when we get

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
to

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,360
the micro planing or the Dr uh seing I

177
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,079
should say all right lots of contaminant

178
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,200
in this bag leaf and such that managed

179
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,838
to get through

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,240
oh it holds the bag

181
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,120
well

182
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,680
so pull out my

183
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,480
spoon just sitting here completely

184
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,399
covered in ice how awesome is that you

185
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,399
know your spoon is cold

186
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,078
when

187
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,000
awesome p that back

188
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:56,599
up

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,480
and not using the spray bottle today

190
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,000
could have I suppose but

191
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,560
just going to do a real real

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,958
quick extraction today here we're not

193
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:12,518
messing around usually John and I are

194
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:14,719
giving you guys full explanations on

195
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,120
everything sirens in the background hope

196
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,120
it's not for

197
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,838
me perfect way to clean your

198
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,879
tools make sure you get these bags is

199
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,519
very very clean it's an important part

200
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,639
of the process you don't want to scrimp

201
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,759
out on the

202
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,759
bags getting

203
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:45,278
clean and properly

204
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,958
dried this is the first thing that will

205
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,039
wreak havoc to your bags putting them

206
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,399
away

207
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,399
dirty all right a very small amount of

208
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,399
190

209
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,720
wasn't expecting I probably

210
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,599
ran a total of

211
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,240
60 G

212
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,560
um through the bags in that fro in that

213
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,399
Frozen Bud that you saw there just two

214
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,239
plants my plants aren't huge they don't

215
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,240
average much over

216
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,639
30 all

217
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,239
right bag

218
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,679
220

219
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,679
90 you see in the pattern

220
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,399
here all

221
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,159
right you can keep the resin

222
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,639
cold and get it collected before it

223
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:01,240
heats up on the screen it picks up just

224
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,240
perfectly

225
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,240
perfect to help with the bucket is I

226
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,680
can't say enough about it to have this

227
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,560
little sort of bubble bucket thing as

228
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,919
your tool to help you is definitely

229
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,838
going to come in

230
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,838
handy no out about

231
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,480
it all right let's start getting into

232
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,480
some smokables

233
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,198
here yes nice nice to see a little bit

234
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,198
of

235
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,879
120 nice little pile of

236
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,680
headies it's nice to have that little

237
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,278
bit of water in there it really allows

238
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:10,039
the resin to come off properly without

239
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,039
uh grinding it into the

240
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:18,000
screen there we go this resin is savable

241
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:21,439
we will wash the resin on this bag the

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
120 into the

243
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,120
90 o that water's so cold you know you

244
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:32,720
got it good when you get the water that

245
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,720
cold hose water is of course not that

246
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:47,240
cold nice that it's such a hot day that

247
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,240
this is enjoyable to have the

248
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,159
water all right the 90 I always like to

249
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,399
see a little bit come out of this bag oo

250
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,759
and I like the way it's holding the

251
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,839
water unlike the other

252
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,320
bags never a bad sign anyone that's made

253
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,120
a lot of water has knows that when you

254
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,519
pull that bag and it doesn't release

255
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,240
that's generally a better sign than

256
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,519
not of course we're using just baby

257
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,600
amounts here I want to show you the

258
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,320
amounts I don't want to deceive you and

259
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,839
and show you these huge pulls which I

260
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,120
can do with 20- gall bags no problem but

261
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,880
I'm trying to show you guys what it

262
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,480
looks like if you run a small plant from

263
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,078
your

264
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,039
crop and what it looks

265
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:31,039
like is that

266
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:38,120
there we go beautiful 90 Micron just a

267
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,600
little pile you know really probably no

268
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,720
more than a

269
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,879
gram but the quality of this

270
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,399
gram or

271
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:53,320
two will be extremely

272
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,320
good in fact this

273
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,800
one I will choose to se almost

274
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,799
immediately

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,278
the other ones are still W wet and

276
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:10,480
watery so that's good I don't want to

277
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:13,439
let this resin deceive you it will stick

278
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,360
like you would not believe particularly

279
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,040
if you get it warm right now it's very

280
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,560
cold in this bucket so it comes off real

281
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,078
nice if I sat this bag out for any

282
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,119
amount of time in this

283
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:29,318
heat to give you an idea it's not an

284
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:34,120
extremely hot day it's about maybe 75Â°

285
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:37,000
80Â° maybe at the peak of the day just

286
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,000
getting past that

287
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,679
now all right that's holding pretty good

288
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,719
it's pretty greasy I've got it in the

289
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,719
shade it's a little bit

290
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,039
cold spread it out a little bit we'll do

291
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,799
the 73 and then we'll we'll sip them

292
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,120
both at the same time see them both at

293
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,639
the same time

294
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,399
s ni little quick upper so I can get

295
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,399
that off there even

296
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,399
quicker and once again we're left with a

297
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,399
nice little

298
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,399
pile just blowing the foam off of it so

299
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,600
you guys can see what we got there nice

300
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,600
little pile of

301
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,958
73 and the water present really makes it

302
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,600
easy to scoop it

303
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:47,119
off and to place

304
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,120
it back on the

305
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,560
screen all right so rinse that in there

306
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,559
rinse this in

307
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,480
here make sure that 73 bucket is rinsed

308
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,678
so easy to make the mistake on getting

309
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,720
over excited and wanting to process that

310
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:13,400
bubble that you forget about your dirty

311
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,000
bag to me that's not acceptable you got

312
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,000
to clean your

313
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,279
bags okay so we're going to take the

314
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,918
bubble that we've taken so far that

315
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,918
we've pulled we're going to bring it in

316
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,400
ins side with you guys and we're going

317
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,120
to show the uh seing process we'll come

318
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
out and pull the last two bags and then

319
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,119
we'll do the seing on that and we'll be

320
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,120
done one more video on how to make your

321
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,719
own water extracted resin okay so I've

322
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:48,839
got my pizza boxes all set up my 190

323
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:52,319
through 160 my 120 my 90 my 73 and my 45

324
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:55,199
and my 25 I'm usually able to make do

325
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,599
with these size boxes because I'm

326
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,159
running smaller batches the resin's

327
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,558
still nice and wet so I'm not not overly

328
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,559
worried about it the um

329
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:11,599
strainer the strainer is sitting in ice

330
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,720
a nice big amount of ice to sit the

331
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,399
strainer in so that when we get to that

332
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,319
it's cold I'm going to grab the spoon

333
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,360
and we're going to start

334
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:24,359
straining okay so we are going to scoop

335
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:29,479
out the 70 or the 90 I should

336
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:31,119
say it's uh just that perfect liness

337
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,038
right

338
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:38,000
now comes off on the spoon

339
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,000
nice we get our strainer

340
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:44,480
out and then we will

341
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,319
start straining this gummy

342
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,720
goopy

343
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,720
resin through

344
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,119
here well that's definitely not

345
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,400
working that gummed up worse than

346
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,399
anything I've ever seen

347
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,519
all right so we had a major upset the

348
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,000
resin gummed up worse than we thought so

349
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,400
what we're going to do is when this

350
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,400
happens I guess it was a little

351
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,320
deceiving we will still collect the

352
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,320
resin nothing is

353
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:20,079
lost but we will let this dry by

354
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,038
microplaning it and this is a great

355
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:26,359
thing about microplaning and how it can

356
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:30,640
sort of back you up so we will freeze

357
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,639
the resin we so far have

358
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,520
all right so we're going for the freezer

359
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,079
method you can see I basically pushed

360
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,038
half a gram of that resin into the

361
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:57,359
strainer no loss this resin will dry

362
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,440
perfectly I will allow it to spread

363
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,240
throughout the the screen

364
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,200
and it'll just crack off once I've

365
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,960
heated once I've uh warmed it up so no

366
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,798
worries on that it won't be lost but uh

367
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,919
definitely I'm sure many people have

368
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:14,079
seen this sort of thing and thought Oh

369
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,120
my God I [Â __Â ] myself you did not it's

370
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,720
a little bit of an unfortunate move but

371
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:22,359
uh it'll come off it'll dry and it'll

372
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,720
crack right off beautifully so nothing

373
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,558
lost we'll be back in a bit once we've

374
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,558
got this ready

375
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,558
to microplane

376
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,279
all right so that stuff was a little

377
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,480
stickier than I anticipated it's going

378
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,319
to

379
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,679
uh require a microplane of course I'm in

380
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,158
too hot of an environment too so these

381
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,640
are the little bit of mistakes that

382
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,960
you'll come up with if you're working

383
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
too hot in an environment so it's great

384
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,038
to show you guys this cuz I know

385
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,759
sometimes people are completely baffled

386
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,919
and Confused how these things can happen

387
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,359
to them um here we go nice big 45 pull

388
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,759
on that Astro Boy covered up the screen

389
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,158
real

390
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:09,200
nice so more gooey gooey gooey resin you

391
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:13,120
know what we got to do with this we get

392
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,120
it off we collect

393
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,439
it coming off real nice and then get it

394
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,399
frozen for micr planting really nice

395
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,840
pile of 45 Micron I'd

396
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,720
say easily 3

397
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:28,918
G just on

398
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,679
that so it's good I'm sure you know last

399
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,440
time I was getting four four to five

400
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:37,480
grams off my yields and I think because

401
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,519
I used twice the amount this time that

402
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,519
we're going to see twice the

403
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,640
return always easier to get the resin

404
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,000
off when it's a bit wet

405
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,159
and particularly if it's cold as

406
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,798
well always have your your most

407
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,600
reasonable time with your resin when

408
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:12,319
it's a little wet as that moisture gets

409
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,759
out of it and it starts drying and

410
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,558
spreading

411
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,200
out then you can run into problems so

412
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:22,918
you want to keep it off your

413
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,400
fingers keep it moist keep it wet even

414
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,960
if you got to dip your hand in the water

415
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,960
every once in a while

416
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,759
excellent

417
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:38,199
excellent all right nice pile of 45

418
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,200
clean that 45 bag real

419
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:55,678
quick ask for a nicer setup for

420
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
cleaning perfect

421
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:06,440
all right final bag Mr 25

422
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:10,039
micron this one's always slow to

423
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,840
drain so we do this people tell me it

424
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:14,839
takes them hours to drain their 25

425
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,000
micron bag and I have to shake my head a

426
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,519
little bit at that I mean I'm sure if

427
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,640
you stood here like this it would take

428
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:23,319
hours

429
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,320
but why would you do

430
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,278
that using the air to force the screen

431
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,480
you don't squeeze the screen don't

432
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:32,640
bruise the

433
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,720
fruit can't remember who used to say

434
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,080
that but for some reason I think it's

435
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:42,480
someone it's negative so I won't bring

436
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:44,879
any more of that up 25 micron is

437
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,400
decent also covering the screen much

438
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
like the

439
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,080
45 never quite as Blonde never quite as

440
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,399
clean looking but this is pretty nice

441
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,798
looking

442
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,960
25 Spoonful and a half

443
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,759
anyway I guess that's what they meant by

444
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,079
a l Spoonful I mean isn't that a l

445
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,079
Spoonful right

446
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,960
there all right well

447
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,640
Okay so we've got our tpine Rich water

448
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,120
and that's something I'd really like to

449
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,200
talk a little bit about how do we get

450
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,959
these tpin out of this water how do we

451
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,919
do it without heating up the water which

452
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,360
will affect the actual tpin and produce

453
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,080
what is called an artifact over a true

454
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,599
molecule I want to recapture these Turin

455
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,639
and I want to hear what you guys have to

456
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,439
say about that uh I know they have

457
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,399
different machines at Eden Labs that you

458
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,919
can use for these sort of different

459
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:00,479
processes that are done to essential

460
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,919
oils I don't know much about it but I'd

461
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,720
love to hear from you people that do

462
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,480
know a lot about it um i' you know

463
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,839
something that's not distillation I

464
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,558
don't want to heat up the water too much

465
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,278
I'm not sure I want to evaporate the

466
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,839
water there's got to be a way to trap

467
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,359
these Tarpin that are in this water and

468
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,959
rebr bring them back out I think there's

469
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:20,398
a future in that and uh it's something

470
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,519
that I'm putting my focuses on so I

471
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:23,918
wanted to share it with you guys this

472
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,319
bubble needs to get into the freezer

473
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,159
ASAP as it's sitting out right now just

474
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,158
looking awesome

475
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,719
and the birds want it can you hear them

476
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,079
they're like give me that bubble man

477
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,079
give me that

478
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,000
bubble anyway I'm going to get this into

479
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,798
the freezer we're going to come back in

480
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,720
a little bit and microplan the whole

481
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,519
batch it's going to be a tough one cuz

482
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,759
it is sticky icky but we'll get it done

483
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,519
we'll see you in a

484
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:57,519
minute all right guys it is the next day

485
00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:00,000
my planer has been in the freezer I've

486
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,038
got a little piece of a 120 here and

487
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,720
we're just going to we're just going to

488
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,720
shave her

489
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,759
down there's tiny little pieces but with

490
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,480
this planner that I've got I have to say

491
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,440
it's called the micr planer that's it

492
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,240
just straight name it's got a very very

493
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:27,240
small bump it doesn't have very harsh

494
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,919
holes on it and because of it you can

495
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:35,240
actually plane without planing your

496
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,240
finger off it's actually quite

497
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,759
nice all right

498
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:43,759
so little bit of Chunk here

499
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:47,480
but

500
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:50,798
120 breaking up just starting to get

501
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:54,839
sticky on my

502
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,839
fingers uh the next upep we

503
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:01,799
have 12073 we have 90

504
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,839
so we're going to have to grab that box

505
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,679
or 73 I should said I'd already done the

506
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,558
90 that's

507
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,038
right

508
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:14,678
73 so we'll go grab the 73 and we go

509
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:14,679
microplan

510
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,880
it all right nice little piece of

511
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,919
73 we're just going to grab Ry that down

512
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,919
on the old microp

513
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,359
planer it's going to get gumming so we

514
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,360
got to work

515
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,600
fast The Joy about this

516
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:53,599
is especially with the metal microp

517
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,759
planer that you can release all that

518
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,439
sticky resin this one's releasing quite

519
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,000
nicely due to the fact that it's got a

520
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,519
little bit of moisture I'm going to put

521
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,558
this back in the freezer we're going to

522
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,798
come back here and we're going to do

523
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,119
this last little

524
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,639
chunk all right so we got the last

525
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,479
little bit of

526
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
this Frozen

527
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:30,119
bubble I almost

528
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,120
need a new planer cuz mine is guming up

529
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,038
good coming up with that that 90 Micron

530
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:46,558
love and what a great problem to have

531
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:46,559
right a little bit

532
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,440
of a little bit of gummy bubble

533
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,720
little bit

534
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,278
of oh

535
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
yeah little bit on the bottom you can

536
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:20,919
hear it

537
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,919
just hitting that parchment paper

538
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,119
nicely

539
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,880
awesome you can just bang hang it hang

540
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,319
it through with the one hand and then

541
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,720
flick it off with the scissors so there

542
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,119
are a little bit of chunks here but

543
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,759
because it's so fresh um what I'll be

544
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:43,518
doing with those chunks is I'll just be

545
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:47,319
giving them a small amount of time um

546
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:50,720
probably less than 6

547
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,918
hours and then they will get um uh they

548
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,360
will get reapplied broken up a little

549
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:59,360
more uh for now I got a pretty nice uh

550
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:02,038
even texture on that 90 mic run there's

551
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:06,000
none left

552
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:07,119
so what we do is we shut the box and

553
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,759
this is one of the great things about

554
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,479
the pizza box people have been laughing

555
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,480
about them for years you know you get

556
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,120
certain guys thinking it's fail Tech I

557
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,599
say that it's not fail Tech at all I say

558
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,119
that once you've lined the box with your

559
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:19,759
parchment paper you're covered with

560
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,759
worrying about any type of fibers that

561
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,119
you could possibly get from the box um

562
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:28,079
plus you get the box closing it closes

563
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:31,158
right over the hash so you uh can avoid

564
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:35,240
paper uh you can so you can avoid uh

565
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:37,039
dust and debris and animal hairs

566
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,440
basically keep your hash nice and clean

567
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,720
so easy to transport to once you got

568
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,640
that you can just kind of take it right

569
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,640
over I've got my 120 and my

570
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,759
73 uh we're going to do up the 40 45

571
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,640
next so also if you get yourself some

572
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:56,398
hash on your fingers like

573
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,919
this right real nice easy way to take it

574
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,918
off is with a Dabber

575
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,918
now the trick

576
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,880
is if you want to get it off that

577
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,360
clean is to heat up the Dabber just a

578
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,559
tiny little

579
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:17,638
bit with your torch or with a

580
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,918
lighter and basically you'll get those

581
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:23,519
fingers clean as a

582
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,519
whistle and you'll get your

583
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:32,200
bubble ready to smoke

584
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:36,679
and you'll get your bubble off your

585
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,679
hands just another tip from the bubble

586
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:43,038
man all right so I let a little bit of

587
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,480
time pass I've left the 45 and the 25

588
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,558
frozen in the

589
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,319
freezer they're right here freshly out

590
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:52,678
you can

591
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,480
hear how completely Frozen that is and

592
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,559
I'm going to be using a

593
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,919
different plane this is more of a

594
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:01,038
greater here's my plane here I've gotten

595
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,480
it quite dirty and so I'm planning on

596
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,158
using this this time around so I'll let

597
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,120
you know how that works in about a

598
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,480
second oh

599
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,479
nice really

600
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,798
nice wow just pling super

601
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,038
nice breaking it down into pieces that

602
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,720
first little bit was going real nice

603
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,278
we have to break these little chunks off

604
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,278
later

605
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:43,719
[Music]

606
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:47,519
[Laughter]

607
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,519
here shaving

608
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,879
nicely this is exceptional

609
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,720
quality no doubt about it

610
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:16,839
so getting quite a bit of chunks but I

611
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,839
can break it down

612
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,360
[Music]

613
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,038
further these off to the side a little

614
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:28,359
bit come back at

615
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:32,720
them probably a good half gram or

616
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:35,359
gram of larger pieces

617
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,759
there o I got away lucky I think with

618
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,158
that that is a

619
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:40,158
nice nice

620
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,840
plane able to sort of push this through

621
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,720
the

622
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:55,079
holes it's actually planning quite

623
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,839
nicely right now this is actually

624
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,839
usually a cheese grater it's the first

625
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:02,000
time I've ever used this

626
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:05,918
particular style but the holes are sharp

627
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,320
enough that it's it's giving me a

628
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,200
decent a decent plane on it I mean

629
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,079
really the the whole purpose is to break

630
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:16,279
your your hash up and get that surface

631
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,839
area that's really what you're looking

632
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,359
for not leaving it in

633
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:25,199
chunks it's always easier I'm not going

634
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:27,719
to lie you know once again even this

635
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,799
could be made easier if I were simp

636
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,598
simply in a colder environment even the

637
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,079
warmth from this environment right now

638
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,519
and it's not that warm it's probably

639
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:38,399
around

640
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:40,639
70Â° just warm enough to um cause more of

641
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:44,398
a problem than than create a

642
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,399
help so that's

643
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:52,159
perfect wet wash and this was the 45

644
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,838
Micron so that's

645
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,760
done what I like to do once I'm done is

646
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:59,320
I like to shut that up you can see it

647
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,240
cat just jumped into the view here

648
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,280
there's cat hair there's dog hair

649
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:06,519
there's kids there's other people

650
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,960
there's debris and Dust In the Airs that

651
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:13,880
just float around so I like to cover my

652
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:17,320
[Â __Â ] up and so that's why the box

653
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,320
so that one's

654
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:21,119
done last one on

655
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,160
the that's 25

656
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:45,039
kind of gently rub it off the pressing

657
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,039
screen

658
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,280
here

659
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,079
excellent this one I usually um is the

660
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,000
one that I'll usually break up often by

661
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,119
hand the 25 micron um I find mostly

662
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,639
because it's a

663
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,000
met um also that because the heads are

664
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,239
so small I find it's the one that seems

665
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,880
to be able to

666
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,719
dry properly without the help of being

667
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,880
uh completely powderized every single

668
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,039
time and it's sort of one of the reasons

669
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,680
sometimes people wonder well you know

670
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:24,239
like they they see the 25 micron dry and

671
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:26,399
they figure well they should it all it

672
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,318
should all be able to dry like that and

673
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,079
unfortunately it's not like that I think

674
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:33,358
the 25 micron dries like that because of

675
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,760
the smaller heads and if you put a lot

676
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:39,880
of small balls in a bowl for example the

677
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,839
smaller they are the less um space

678
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,240
there'll be between them and the larger

679
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,279
they are the more space there'll be

680
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,838
between them so the way I look at it is

681
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,880
the larger uh heads are allowing more

682
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,519
water to get trapped in there taking a

683
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,920
longer time to dry and the smaller heads

684
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:59,920
are leaving less so there's the 25

685
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:03,000
micron boom two boxes done got my 120

686
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,800
and my 90 already microplaned and drying

687
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,599
so that's the 120 the 90 the

688
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:13,079
73 and the 45 and the 25 so that's it

689
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,200
Astro Boy Fresh Frozen I'll finish it

690
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,240
off with some macro photographs of each

691
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,039
one I hope you enjoyed the run and uh

692
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:24,199
next up I'm

693
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:27,838
thinking My Little Pony see you then

694
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:30,838
[Music]

695
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,838
