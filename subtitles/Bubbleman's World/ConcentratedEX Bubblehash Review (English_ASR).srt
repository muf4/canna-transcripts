8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,160
in my throat I've barely begun to puff

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,198
and I wanted to give a shout out to our

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,079
good buddy concentrated X who I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,118

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,159
not so it is

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,238
concentrated c o n c n t r a t d e ex

20

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,719
strawberry banana cut and he's got some

25
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,719
some God Bud that he sent to me as well

26
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,879
and some beautiful rosins but actually

27
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,200
that's not what I want to talk about I

28
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,599
want to talk about the latest package

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,960
that came in from concentrated X and I

30
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,640
wanted to photograph it but I thought it

31
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,118
would be really cool to show you

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,879
actually opening

33
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:33,840
it I've got uh some ice water extraction

34
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:35,560
Buble hash 120 Micron always first run

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
really like his packaging and the way

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,478
he's put that together there you can say

37
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,118
he's got DNA genetics and that is the

38
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,959
sour diesel uh Reser of Pata I believe

39
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,519
said it was one of the most unique uh

40
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,239
tasting sour diesels that he ever had

41
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,519
he's got a little bubble man on there so

42
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,920
big shout out to you concentrated X

43
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,718
we're going to open that we're going to

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,039
photograph it and we're going to smoke

45
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:03,399
it here today let everyone know how that

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,920
is and then he sent me a little God Bud

47
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,000
uh flour resin organic God Bud flour

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
rosin so that's also nice little

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,199
packaging that he's got there going

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,920
on I'm sure that uh you could probably

51
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,639
hit him up direct for these sorts of

52
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:20,159
things there's some

53
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,679
PK uh organic pink cush flower rosin

54
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,239
says on the back

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,080
there and then finally some bubble has

56
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,000
rosin so this is a05 of a gram and it's

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,879
his g mix so it says bubble has rosin

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,360
made from a bubble has mix of various of

59
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,079
the strains from our Gardens gmix 100%

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,760
solventless extract so he's got some

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,599
nice little packaging going on there

62
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,759
he's sealed it up real good and I'm

63
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,359
quite excited to open it up for you here

64
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,280
today now we will do the rosins but

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
really what this is all about is this

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,479
Sour Diesel bubble hash that we're going

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,759
to try out so let me get my

68
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:01,280
Dabber he's always got these nicely

69
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:05,000
sealed and I always feel kind of bad

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,080
that I have to uh break the label to to

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,598
get it open I always feel like it's uh

72
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
you know basically it always looks like

73
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,518
that once you've opened it I haven't

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,919
been able to open it much smoother than

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,280
that so here we go we're going to go for

76
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,280
that first

77
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,639
smell oh

78
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,798
damn oh wow that

79
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,079
is I hear what he's saying there that's

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,360
a really unique bot

81
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,480
okay looks like absolute fire in there

82
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,720
not sure if you guys can

83
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,479
see but uh we're going to get in there

84
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,959
with the macro lens in the real near

85
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,959
future

86
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,719
here man does that have a really nice

87
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,480
deep sort of earthy fragrance going on

88
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,359
in the

89
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,759
background that is very unique for sour

90
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,040
diesel all right well what I think I'm

91
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,120
going to do is I'm going to stop the the

92
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,039
recording here for a quick second do

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,840
some wonderful photographing on this bad

94
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,759
boy we'll come back we'll smoke it maybe

95
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,640
do a melt video and uh then we'll see if

96
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,120
we have time to hit up these Ros and so

97
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,679
uh we'll be right

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,720
back all right so I managed to get some

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,280
really beautiful photographs of that um

100
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Sour Diesel and I guess really now it's

101
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,239
a matter of taking a nice rip of it I'm

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,120
definitely ready to do so stuff is

103
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,800
absolutely

104
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,439
beautiful so

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,720
always seems even more beautiful when

106
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:39,319
things are stashed away in half grams so

107
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,320
there's the hash for you guys to

108
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,638
see the camera's going to grab that for

109
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:47,680
you yeah yeah it's quite nice quite

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,439
nice really nice smell too we'll take a

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,360
small dab

112
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,038
because I'm not in a position to be

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,759
taking any huge dabs right now as much

114
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:59,240
as I'd love to just take a nice

115
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,439
reasonable size dab here off some pretty

116
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,439
darn and fresh tasty

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,079
quartz and this one's for you

118

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,879
macro photographs at the end and I guess

123
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,519
uh there's just one thing left to do

124
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,519
let's puff this

125
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,478
hash

126
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,759
hard to describe it's got a really

127
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,000
unique flavor to it for sure nothing

128
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,319
that's overly recognizable as a sour

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
diesel to me but what wonderful tastes

130
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,160
again almost reminiscent of the

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,879
strawberry banana but different quite

132
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,599
different in fact really nice great job

133
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,199

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,120
