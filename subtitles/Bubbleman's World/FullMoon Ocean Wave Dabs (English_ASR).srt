tonight

169
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,788
[Music]

170
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,759
yeah ocean Hot Side di Jabs C be beat

171
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:19,000
now we are under this little Palapa

172
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,679
because a it offers wind protection

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,958
which cools the denail down if we get

174
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,319
too much

175
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,000
wind it's constantly needing to try and

176
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
heat up and it gets really red hot so

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,078
this is one of the reasons we're in here

178
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,240
probably after we have two or three dabs

179
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,439
each we'll head over to the main event

180
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,879
and of course we'll bring the camera

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,880
over there and let you guys dab out with

182
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,639
us I love the Cannabis is becoming so

183
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,199
much more accepted that a legitimate

184
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,240
businessman like Maurice who also

185
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,160
happens to enjoy cannabis doesn't have

186
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,560
to fear for his safety or for his

187
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:58,559
business's safety because he wants to

188
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,039
enjoy a little bit of cannabis on camera

189
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,639
and I think that that's important that

190
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,319
the people locally here understand when

191
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,399
you see someone like Maurice on Bubble

192
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,000
man's world be happy for him he's he's

193
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,839
making strides for the rest of you so

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,159
that one day you too can enjoy cannabis

195
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,120
even on film without feeling that you're

196
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:20,559
doing anything wrong cuz let's be honest

197
