2
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,559
hey welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,278
everybody we are on a beautiful Sunday

4
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,919
afternoon fresh after hash Church really

5
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,320
after quite a hash church today it was

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,160
an epic hash Church you will have to

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,960
check it out hash Church 86 and I'm here

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:39,199
with Samurai Sam from uh I guess uptech

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,320
Omicron uptech is the manufacturing

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,840
company Utopia plena Technologies

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,600
because we're a bunch of nerds and W9

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,399
tech.com would be our website sweet

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,280
brought a couple Vapes by today Mark's

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
been checking out the Omron which is our

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,079
Flagship wax pen it's got an 18 mil

16
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,479
battery inside and has four power

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,518
settings the Omron is our goal to

18
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,439
introduce a really easy to use vaporizer

19
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,679
so you click click it on with five

20
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,319
Taps and you can change power settings

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,600
adjust it three times Twist Off The Top

22
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,359
to access our coil which has a grade 2

23
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,839
titanium wire wrapped around a black

24
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,079
porous ceramic Wick we also have other

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,159
heating options available ceramic Donuts

26
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,239
we discussed today on the church yep so

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,359
there's all kinds of different things

28
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,919
you can do with the Omron it also comes

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,359
with the glass globe yeah I've got the

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,320
glass globe on mine right there rocking

31
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,438
the glass globe so you can see your

32
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,118
Vapor production super easy uh learning

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,879
tool really nice to learn how to use the

34
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,478
unit pretty important for this unit I'll

35
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,078
have you guys know because it's not just

36
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,519
a vaporizer that you're going to buy and

37
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,798
just use out of the box they're sort of

38
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,759
trying to create a little bit of a

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
better product something longer lasting

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,959
something a little bit more sustainable

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,759
and non uh you know constantly replacing

42
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,839
and so one of the important things about

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,920
this unit which Sam just really told me

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,960
about today was the actual cooling of

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,799
the unit once you've hit it a bunch and

46
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:01,000
you've heated it all up uh you really

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,320
want to cool the unit it down and he was

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,920
showing me by

49
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,959
just taking dry hits on it we'll put it

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,479
to use here I'll here with a glass glue

51
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,759
W just a couple of dry hits pulls the

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,520
the cooler air through the chamber and

53
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,919
it actually cools that little element

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
and most importantly it cools the oil

55
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,919
because those three little holes that

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,959
were sucking through if you heat that

57
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,439
oil up too much and you let it sit the

58
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,199
oil will actually drain down into those

59
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,280
holes and and kind of clog it up a

60
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,318
little bit so definitely an important

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,800
factor to pay attention to it's happened

62
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,639
at this one I'll have to unclog at a

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,120
moment um one of the nice things I like

64
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:37,439
about this pen and we spoke about it on

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,480
hash Church where Samurai came on and

66
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,199
discussed the different qualities of

67
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,759
components that are being used in these

68
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,119
different pens and pointing out how we

69
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,318
were all very obsessed about uh the

70
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,480
grade of titanium if it was an electric

71
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,238
nail uh some of us weren't even hitting

72
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,479
titanium we were preferring uh different

73
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:00,400
forms of ceramic Sil silicon carbide uh

74
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,799
quartz getting into Sapphire and he just

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,039
pointed out like you guys will hit all

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,360
these incredible different surfaces um

77
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,039
but what about all these pens you're

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,720
just hitting any Chinese rebranded pen

79
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,519
uh that's nothing against China when I

80
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,639
say a Chinese rebranded pen it just

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,480
happens to be where the pens are from I

82
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,399
can't talk smack about our people and to

83
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,959
be UPF front we have our most of our

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,080
devices are manufactured in China as

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,598
well they're manufactured in our faculty

86
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,120
using materials that we've carefully

87
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,199
selected and we want to make sure we're

88
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,640
putting only really safe materials

89
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,438
inside the heated air path of these

90
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,679
devices well when I had my I did it

91
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,919
wrong I put too much turp sauce in there

92
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,719
it all drained down it completely coated

93
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,359
the unit it wasn't giving me full rips

94
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,799
anymore Sam walked me through

95
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,640
troubleshooting when I pulled the

96
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,480
element out and I took it it actually

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,199
came apart because I had so much oil in

98
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,840
it and I the way I was twisting it I

99
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,158
twisted the piece out of it a little

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,319
overloading I was amazed at how it was

101
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,598
so simple it wasn't a bunch of like it

102
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,798
wasn't like a bunch of stuff that I

103
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,119
didn't know what it was it was just it

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
was super simple there was the ceramic

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
dish there were the two little wires and

106
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,878
there were the elements and that was it

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,479
we actually call this the kiss cartridge

108
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,438
for keep it simple stupid because

109
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,438
Simplicity leads to a beautiful design

110
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,719
that doesn't have extraneous materials a

111
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:16,238
lot of which are unsafe um your

112
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
cartridge came apart cuz we're not using

113
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,719
any glues or nickel mesh to attach any

114
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,959
of the stuff inside here it's just

115
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,000
titanium wire but it also went back

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,800
together just as easy exactly you know

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
and the only reason it came out don't

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,439
get me wrong it didn't fall out I was

119
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
pushing paper towel and wiping all the

120
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,478
oil that I had that I had done off of it

121
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,319
and I didn't realize some had pushed

122
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,439
onto the inside and was spinning the

123
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,839
inside compartment which finally

124
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,399
released and came out but uh otherwise

125
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,359
I've had an amazing time with this pan

126
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,478
I've taken it to Jamaica I've taken it

127
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,560
to Barcelona uh it's traveled well it

128
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:52,279
hasn't caused me any problems at

129
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,280
airports or at security uh so that's

130
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,879
been good and uh yeah it's it gives a

131
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,599
really tasty rip there's no doubt about

132
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,279
it so where are these available you were

133
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,240
going to mention there our website W9

134
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,519
tech.com you can buy them directly there

135
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
they're in smoke shops uh across the

136
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,120
country and at a bunch of different

137
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,720
online retailers too the Omron comes in

138
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,720
three different battery sizes this is

139
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,440
the smallest light duty 900 milliamp

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
model I think we're both rocking the HD

141
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,000
2100 milliamp right there and then you

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,160
have one in between the two and there is

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
a midsize which I didn't have out at

144
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,720
this moment but there's a 1400 and in

145
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
between medium duty size too so what

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
does that mean to the average person

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,120
what kind of timeline are they going to

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,720
get with this versus this on using

149
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,199
definitely it's kind of a hard question

150
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,000
to answer because it totally depends on

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,759
how much you vape so for somebody that's

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,079
only taken a couple hits a day this can

153
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,639
last a day or two between battery

154
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,318
charges if you're a heavy vapor and

155
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,879
you're using this thing 10 or 15

156
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,800
sessions a day you might want to step up

157
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,360
to the biggest battery size but maybe

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
just take this one to the concert that

159
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,720
night cuz it's small in the pocket abely

160
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,560
you know I'll be honest with you I I dab

161
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,360
a lot so I have an enail at home and I'm

162
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,918
not using this as my only device and

163
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,280
when I originally got my vape I thought

164
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:57,959
the biggest one's going to be the best

165
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,399
and after a week of not needing to

166
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,959
charge it I asked for the small one and

167
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,959
this is the one that I use the most now

168
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,318
cuz it's really pocketable yeah makes

169
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,439
sense well we should maybe load a couple

170
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,800
of these up for sure take take a few

171
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,000
tasty dabs we were making some rosin

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,840
earlier had a nice uh actually had a

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,360
really unique blowout I didn't have much

174
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,318
to press for rosin so I just used some

175
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,479
five and six star west coast concentrate

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,199
bubble hash and uh it it came out

177
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:27,800
beautiful the rosin actually this is

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,759
some of the rosin right here uh it just

179
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,960
happened to release bubble hash into the

180
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
rosin and I'll show you actually you can

181
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,079
see it dripping out of the thing right

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,759
there in the top left you can see how

183
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,519
the bubble hash is getting thicker and

184
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,439
darker however the rosin still separated

185
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,079
really nicely and we were able to get uh

186
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,439
a really nice pure product out of that

187
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,159
so why don't we uh load up a few why

188
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,038
don't we hit some of this pure yeah

189
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,439
absolutely I'm not sure if it's going to

190
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,038
shatter like it was when I was

191
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,160
collecting it or what's the deal but

192
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,038
that was really

193
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,360
pretty here we go

194
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:06,519
thank you sir put a little in mine as

195
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,879
well yeah I really love these little

196
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,399
units for you know obviously out and

197
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,800
about in the world you know where the

198
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,560
dab uh and and I do still carry with me

199
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,240
my Mothership and uh my Dil and

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,120
sometimes a battery and so I'm always

201
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,598
ready for a serious session if you've

202
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,399
got room for a pelican why not if you

203
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:25,759
only have a pocket this might fit your

204
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,799
needs well I'll tell you one thing for

205
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
traveling this is unparalleled when I'm

206
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,439
traveling it is so nice to be able to

207
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,000
have this unit especially across Canada

208
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,598
cuz I can actually leave it dirty and

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,120
have it filled um not a problem when I

210
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,598
can't you know it's nice to be able to

211
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,759
have different elements travel with

212
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,478
clean ones leave dirty ones behind and

213
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,720
just use them when you get back to that

214
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,839
country so yeah I've got my setting on

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,039
Blue I'm pretty serious blue is the

216
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,758
highest setting and uh giv some pretty

217
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,759
pretty damn nice

218
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,959
ribs The Taste on that's real nice so

219
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
when you you're using harder rips when

220
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,519
you're drawing harder the higher power

221
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,120
settings work better and if you're going

222
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,799
to use lower power settings you've got

223
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,478
to really milk it and breathe very

224
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,038
gently to get those T ribs which is

225
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,959
quite counterintuitive to a vaporizer or

226
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,598
a cannabis user who's used to smoking or

227
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,359
taking bong rips or dabs it's hard to

228
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,360
wrap your head around the fact that you

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,038
need to really pull gently and that's

230
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,000
much like the Jamaican steam pipe one of

231
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,800
the original the original um vaporizer

232
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,279
you know you don't want to pull too too

233
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,639
hard but uh definitely just hard enough

234
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,879
to to get that sweet

235
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,158
spot and when you get it right it's so

236
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,158
so

237
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,000
good

238
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,679
agreed very decent very decent so that

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,120
is the Omron pen the one that I've

240
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,199
definitely been using for the last few

241
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,039
months and getting used

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,200
to we're also going to cover the

243
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:59,000
Hercules oil cartridge today which is

244
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,680
you know from my perspective of just

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,639
learning about this it's seemingly like

246
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,159
the cartridge it is the bubble bags of

247
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:11,000
oil cartridges uh not needing to be

248
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:13,799
replaced warrantied uh even fixed if

249
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,799
need be definitely there's a a big

250
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,078
discrepancy between you know an easy to

251
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,199
ous vaporizer like this and a serious

252
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,759
tool and the Hercules is kind of a

253
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,680
special case product it's for somebody

254
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,480
that really consumes a lot of oil and

255
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,039
they want a a professional grade tool to

256
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,959
put it to use something that doesn't

257
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,278
break down and require Replacements so

258
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,919
while we think thon's a super high

259
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,200
quality device the coils inside will

260
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,958
burn out eventually and need to be

261
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,480
replaced and the Hercules was a groundup

262
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,119
approach to make a device that didn't

263
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,720
require replacement parts didn't have

264
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,959
pieces that burned out so which is

265
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,800
incredible I will show you guys what's

266
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,439
inside the herk yeah he's going to show

267
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,240
you and I'm also going to photograph

268
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,240
what's inside the herk and show you with

269
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,919
inlaid pictures as we always do here on

270
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,278
Bubble man's world to show you just how

271
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,479
you know it it's it's quite there's

272
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,958
quite a few pieces yet it's quite a

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,959
simple unit in the sense that uh each

274
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,399
one of them comes apart quite nicely and

275
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,119
you can get a nice overview of all the

276
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,799
pieces certainly it's a purpose built

277
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,560
machine it's kind of complex and we

278
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,759
don't intend this to be the uh we don't

279
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,199
intend it to be the device of an

280
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,120
everyday vaporist it's for that 10% of

281
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,160
people that really want a serious tool

282
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,919
that don't mind cleaning occasionally

283
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,480
and the trade-off there is that if you

284
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,278
you know maintain this device properly

285
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,560
it can last you for years you can put

286
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,720
hundreds of grams through it and not

287
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,919
need to buy replacement parts and uh get

288
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,120
really really really flavorful

289
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,599
performance out of it so yeah tell us a

290
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,639
little bit about the inside of the unit

291
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,839
here it's all stainless steel is it so

292
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,240
we have stainless steel housings and

293
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,440
these are called the heater core we have

294
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,159
the upper heater core and the lower

295
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,079
heater core and the upper heater core is

296
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,360
where you load your oil into there's

297
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,439
also a ceramic Rod placed inside the

298
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,560
center of it you can remove the ceramic

299
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,320
rod and this heating unit actually comes

300
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,599
with a warranty disassemble this all the

301
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,000
way so you can see inside mhm oh yeah a

302
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,480
couple extra pieces there it's quite

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,078
incredible when you see the whole thing

304
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,399
taken apart and you look at each

305
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,239
component what each thing does andone

306
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,600
there's little ceramic Rod exactly none

307
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,720
of these were off the shelf components

308
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,959
they're all designed for this purpose

309
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,480
chamber goes inside and then you place

310
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,518
this Wick inside which fits around the

311
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,320
rod and this almost looks identical to

312
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,799
the pad that volcano did years ago for

313
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,440
their um the Volcano Vaporizer now I

314
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,759
don't believe they did it out of

315
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,200
titanium didn't they right they were

316
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,278
doing stainless steel that's what I

317
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,560
thought that's what I thought as well so

318
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,439
this is V2 yeah and we did a St the

319
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,159
steel mesh a couple years ago and then

320
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,200
we made the grade 2 titanium mesh it's a

321
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,240
little bit better flavor with an interm

322
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,680
metal mhm very nice so the rest of the

323
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,440
Hercules is there to uh basically Supply

324
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:46,958
power to the bottom of the ceramic Rod

325
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,079
so that it can heat up and uh trans it's

326
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,319
really nicely well made though you know

327
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,559
definitely thank you yeah what uh do we

328
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,839
have one loaded up that we can uh rip we

329
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,638
can put this one to use um our newest

330
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,240
version of the Hercules comes in a 510

331
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,039
threading so it's compatible with a lot

332
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,639
lot of different box mods out there and

333
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,439
it can run 20 to 35 watts is our

334
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,600
suggested operating range and I'm going

335
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,279
to pop an optional accessory on this is

336
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,079
a bubbler that we have called the

337
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:16,360
Nibbler XL the Nibbler XL check this out

338
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,278
so that we can see the vapor production

339
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,039
get a little moisture conditioning very

340
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,639
cool this has been my uh GL that thing

341
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,159
tastes like

342
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,759
turps oh it's still there oh yeah oh

343
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,078
this will be fun it's tury so this is a

344
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,600
product that I've been using for a

345
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,239
number of years before became an

346
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,120
employee I put a couple hundred grams

347
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,600
through my her and became an evangelist

348
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,560
and then decided to uh spread the word

349
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,079
hell yeah so the Nibbler XL put this guy

350
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,638
to work as I mentioned a lot of our

351
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:42,359
products are made in China this is one

352
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,000
of the things we make in America by

353
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,600
American scientific glass

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,399
blowers uh take some rips on it

355
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,920
sweet so Sam was telling me while we had

356
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,720
the camera off briefly that he has put

357
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:00,759
over 250 g of oil through this

358
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,560
particular cartridge right here which is

359
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,919
his Hercules this is the one that we

360
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,239
have all apart and the one that we're

361
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,039
going to be photographing uh so when I

362
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,440
photograph it and you look at it and you

363
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,838
think that it's a brand new thing you

364
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,040
can understand that this is just a

365
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,560
cleaned product that Sam has used

366
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,838
hundreds if not t over a thousand tons

367
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,719
definitely for a couple years I've been

368
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,519
using the same one and I think the only

369
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
pieces I've replaced in this unit are

370
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,879
the little PTFE insulators here these

371
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,599
are used to to keep positive and

372
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,679
negative separate and we sell rebuild

373
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,399
packs for 10 10 piece pieces for 10

374
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,559
bucks something like that don't quote me

375
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
on that it's close but there's not too

376
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,000
many parts that need to be replaced

377
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,759
these bottom insulators are a semic

378
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,559
consumable item especially if you are

379
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,919
using the Nibbler you can wear those out

380
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,399
and need a replacement they're $10 so

381
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,919
the majority of the components in here

382
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,000
are really made to last and we even put

383
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,919
a one-year warranty on the heating Rod

384
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,839
inside wow those are tasty tasty

385
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,799
delicious rips you can definitely tell

386
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,320
this is a serious unit this is not a

387
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,078
unit that you're going to buy and not

388
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,680
take seriously you have to clean the

389
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,359
unit you have to maintain the unit and

390
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,239
you have to cool the unit down unless

391
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,159
you want your oils to be dripping down

392
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,560
into that lower compartment it's a good

393
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:12,399
point you've got to learn how to use it

394
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,439
properly this is not as easy to operate

395
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,519
as the Omron it has a specific usage

396
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,399
technique you need to do draws to

397
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,240
preserve the flavor and keep air flowing

398
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,198
through it so that oils don't cook up

399
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,799
top and lose potency and lose their T

400
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,479
right so you'll take right now he's

401
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,000
drawing on it without pushing the button

402
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,199
and what he's doing is he's cooling the

403
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,360
oil inside the chamber so it doesn't

404
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,879
degrade to the point of all full tarine

405
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,159
loss and so you're hitting this really

406
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,519
generic sort of reclaim ta tasting uh

407
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,278
rips exactly we have air flow engineered

408
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,879
through the Hercules to cool down the

409
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,240
rod cool down the metal coils and

410
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,120
resolidify your oil so that you can load

411
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,120
a half gram at a time inside a coil and

412
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,399
it tastes good in the first hit and the

413
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,720
10th hit and the 20th hit and as long as

414
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,839
you maintain that buffer load inside the

415
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,720
coil and keep it saturated the flavor

416
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,720
stays good it doesn't degrade like after

417
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,920
three and four hits on a coil VAP we put

418
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,680
t drops of turps in there

419
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,679
too so we uh we're going strong here for

420
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,839
certain really nice unit that's a

421
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,399
serious unit that is not like I'm ex

422
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,279
toay with my wife and I just want to

423
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,320
take a little dab that is might not want

424
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,838
to go for this one yeah that's like a

425
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,639
whole different level that's a that's a

426
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,480
medical unit really I mean people that

427
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,560
are in chronic pain that require dabbing

428
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,600
to reduce their pain they could

429
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,159
definitely get their pain reduced i'

430
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,879
I've definitely talked to our customers

431
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,360
some of whom have have been in hospital

432
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,519
and they've brought Hercules inside to

433
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,318
medicate when you know they're basically

434
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,759
not able to eat they need the device for

435
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:42,278
pain management yeah we're definitely

436
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,440
trying to make really top quality

437
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:47,439
components not beating around the bush

438
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,839
with uh anything that could be unhealthy

439
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,319
or deliver a less than flavorful result

440
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,160
wow it's quite an incredible unit and I

441
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:57,919
guess it can fit on a variety of bases

442
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,919
sure any 510 threaded mod so standard

443
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,559
issue box mods these these days and it's

444
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,479
got fairly low power requirements so 20

445
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,198
to 35 Watts nothing fancy needed mhm we

446
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,480
are working on our own vaporizer that

447
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,000
will have a few fancier functions than

448
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,639
the EEG boxes that are out there or to

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,799
come on that down the road walk us

450
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,560
through the components one by one and

451
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,198
what I'll do is I'll show the closeups

452
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,039
of them as you're talking about it so

453
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,879
just talk about each one of these little

454
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:25,399
kind ofs that you've got going on here

455
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,838
maybe the best thing to do would be to

456
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,039
start with the instruction manual make

457
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,199
sure I don't miss any beats there you go

458
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,919
so the her does have a lot of components

459
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,519
and it also comes with instructions that

460
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,198
show how all these things are put

461
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,480
together great instructions thank

462
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:43,879
you and uh so we start at the bottom

463
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,360
this is uh in the inter computer cord

464
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:50,399
this allows power to transmit to the

465
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,680
ceramic Rod the ceramic Rod is going to

466
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,879
sit inside the upper chamber which is

467
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,399
where the oil coil is installed into and

468
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,919
this is what Wicks and feeds oil into

469
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,720
that ceramic

470
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:07,318
Rod so this slides

471
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,400
inside there's an adjustable airflow

472
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,879
washer that will go on the bottom so

473
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,679
that you can control the Restriction it

474
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,120
kind of acts like a carb

475
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
cap then you've got to set that manually

476
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,279
once it gets a little sticky with the

477
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,078
oil you were mentioning it's an optional

478
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,519
piece exactly and you would basically

479
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:24,240
wait for a little bit of oil to get

480
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,558
through and you can stick it to uncover

481
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,279
or cover the holes if you choose I like

482
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,879
to use my Hercules without it it's my

483
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,079
personal choice

484
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,480
lots of options there I think with the

485
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,678
bubbler it's nice without it maybe

486
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,160
without the bubbler you might want to

487
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,320
have it have it turned on a little more

488
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
who knows possibly there's a million

489
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,399
different preferences out there and so

490
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,960
we want to make sure the Hercules is a

491
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,640
flexible device so that different people

492
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,120
with different preferences can do

493
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,799
whatever they want to with it just like

494
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:49,000
the Omron has four power settings so it

495
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:50,720
works for people that want to take a

496
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,359
really light rip or a thicker one

497
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,960
Hercules has a lot of flexibility too

498
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,759
this is the bottom insulator so you

499
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,759
thread the assembled heater core onto

500
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,558
this and then we have PTS Fe heat shield

501
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,640
that threads on the outside of

502
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:07,879
it there's a top cap that goes inside

503
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,720
and this seals the top is that screw on

504
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,480
or just pop on it's just a press fit and

505
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,640
it does get sticky with oil so it won't

506
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,839
fall out of there once you've used it

507
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,280
and then the mouth piece threads on top

508
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,519
or optional bubbler attachment exactly

509
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,839
or the Nibbler XL mouthpiece replacement

510
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,440
piece excellent really cool the way you

511
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,000
can take that whole unit apart 100% see

512
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,159
every component of it it's uh I'm just

513
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
really stoked on because these fate pens

514
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,080
to me were always just like a mystery I

515
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,480
always wanted to be like but what's what

516
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,038
what is it what is it hopefully we can

517
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,120
do some work to demystify all that yeah

518
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,679
well I think the way you guys have

519
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:44,879
shared and uh are showing uh your

520
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,840
product is definitely a good way of

521
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,760
leading yourselves down that road of of

522
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,918
demystification and it's wonderful we've

523
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,480
managed to I've personally hit full melt

524
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,400
dry full melt bubble and rosin in these

525
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,919
units uh the Hercules is a serious unit

526
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,200
in this sense that it will rage through

527
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,159
F melts definitely it's the one device

528
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,880
we make that's intended for contaminant

529
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,280
Laden hashes so Omicron works great with

530
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,520
oils and with rosins uh but anything

531
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,879
with contaminant will build up on the

532
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,038
wire and you have to clean it off yeah

533
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
you get a crust over the wire and

534
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,679
obviously you don't want to be you know

535
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,759
brushing it too too difficult right you

536
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,480
could damage the coil by trying to flake

537
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,240
that crud off you can damage the coil at

538
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,919
the same time from my perspective at the

539
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,759
price that you guys sell these coils at

540
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,759
which is is it $12.95 they $12.99 for

541
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,798
one right we you know you have discounts

542
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,640
20% off for two or more to me that's

543
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:38,079
ridiculous to me those are borderline

544
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,280
replaceable in the sense that you just

545
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,599
I'm very happy that I have a few extras

546
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,678
I don't replace them all the time I

547
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,279
clean mine as I can but when one goes

548
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,720
it's so nice to just roll in a nice and

549
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,158
they're totally cleanable so if you have

550
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,240
a couple of them you can soak some of

551
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,440
them in isopropyl alcohol use your one

552
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,359
and then when the other ones get clean

553
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,120
cycle them out yeah no totally very cool

554
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,079
but the Hercules is awesome because uh

555
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,239
of its design you can soak all the parts

556
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,119
in isopropyl alcohol you can boil them

557
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,480
and the grade 2 titanium coil will get a

558
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,678
little buildup from contaminant

559
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,919
especially if you're putting Bubble or

560
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
dry sift in there uh however you just

561
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
hang that off the end of a grade 2

562
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,439
titanium Dabber hit it with some heat

563
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,159
you're going to take all the carbon off

564
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,360
and then the rod can be selfclean you

565
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,000
just apply power when you've uh rebuilt

566
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,359
your her so the whole thing is

567
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,679
completely user serviceable and it

568
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,199
shouldn't require any replacement even

569
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,880
if you're putting really dirty material

570
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,720
inside that's pretty [ __ ] awesome

571
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,159
dude very cool very cool I've put

572
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,558
straight um unscreened or sorry I should

573
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,840
say unsifted ke just out of the bottom

574
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,440
of a grinder with tons of contamin in it

575
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,199
so like 1% melt yeah and just cleaned it

576
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,240
up afterwards it still works great still

577
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,159
give you a tasty rip as tasty as ke can

578
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,759
be not as tasty as those not as tasty as

579
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:51,280
the dryft d42 uh TP dipped dry sift that

580
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,158
we that we hit down not at all well

581
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,119
that's great man I'm really stoked on uh

582
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,919
seeing how this moves forward in the

583
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,759
future I love the idea of these pens

584
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,759
just getting more and more conscious and

585
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,200
and more user friendly and at the same

586
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:06,119
time sustainable you know not tossed and

587
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,080
thrown away little components it's one

588
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,759
thing but the entire pen like people are

589
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,519
just like people buy too many pens and

590
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,240
they break and they throw them away and

591
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,679
we just we can't stand yeah that's it's

592
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,798
terrible all those batteries end up in

593
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,320
landfills if your Omron ever has a

594
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,720
problem you call us up or get in touch

595
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,200
there's limited lifetime warranties in

596
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,480
all our gear so we're here to take care

597
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,120
of you not make something that you have

598
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,079
to throw out works well that's one of

599
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,000
the things we offer at fresh headies as

600
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,879
well on the bubble bags and it's why I

601
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,640
use the analogy you know the lifetime

602
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,480
warranty that it's it's important to

603
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,440
stand behind your product you guys are

604
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,919
selling it at a great price too like I'm

605
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
surprised some of the pens that were on

606
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,600
the market in the beginning were more

607
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,720
expensive than what you guys are selling

608
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,558
like your full-size battery kit for so

609
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,519
that's that's pretty

610
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,359
mind-blowing definitely stoked want to

611
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,599
give a shout out to uh Gary the uh the

612
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,879
creator of these products and uh the

613
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,719
owner of the company he's uh really

614
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,840
