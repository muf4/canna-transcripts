Bubble man's world I am back in my

00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,879
office in beautiful British Columbia uh

5
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:32,320
freshly back from the Cannabis Cup in

6
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,799
Amsterdam the 6 annual had an amazing

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,480
time this year I got to say I you hear a

8
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,919
lot of people say bad things about the

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,398
Cup every year and I have to say I just

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,079

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,039
have to say I met some great people I

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,640

in the industry that I meet and this

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040

I just wanted to share some of my

38
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,798
positive outcomes from it a few stories

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,640
with you guys um I I really should start

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,360
right off the bat with before I went to

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,000
The Cup this year I ended up hooking up

42
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,959
with um Brian and Stevie from denail and

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,879
these guys are great guys they've got a

44
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,959
really great product um I know they're

45
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,000
not the originator but what they have

46
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,239
done is they've taken a product they've

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,439
maken it that much better um they're

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
extremely knowledgeable when it comes to

49
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,039
the engineering of their product and

50
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,759
even the thermodynamics of titanium

51
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,199
versus uh quartz uh and of course what

52
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,959
I'm talking about is the

53
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:24,399
denail I've got one right here uh on my

54
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,959
desk beautiful uh zebra wood model uh

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,519
it's plugged into a titanium nail right

56
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,719
now uh in the mothership and it's up to

57
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,000
about 800 810 de and I've got a

58
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,239
beautiful variety of hashes out here

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,120
thanks to the guys at oil slick uh

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,120
thanks to Lars who really kicked me down

61
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,319
these products via the guys from oil

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,200
slicks and you know it might be funny to

63
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,839
think that a bubble guy might be using a

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,839
product like this but I got to say for

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,000
for my for my full melt bubble shatter

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
uh stuff like this that is absolutely

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,479
just you can't touch it you can't deal

68
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,360
with it this stuff is a real solution I

69
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,158
have to say um I'll be taking a couple

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,680
of dabs of this on the denail while we

71
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:08,840
talk and whatnot as well as some of the

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,080
other varieties um this is um I guess

73
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,840
it's about 5 years old right now this is

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,840
Master Kush I've had it for at least 5

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,640
years it's it's like a red oil it's it's

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,920
shatter um at the warmest touch though

77
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,518
it it's hard and then the minute you

78
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,399
touch it warm it does that you see what

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,438
I'm saying the warmth of your fingers is

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,480
enough to get this stuff to make a real

81
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:34,959
mess so what I'll do is I'll use the

82
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,598
skillet tool to get it off and then

83
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,840
we'll just leave that like that for when

84
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,919
we take it down that's how sticky that

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,438
stuff is right there I'll be able to use

86
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,518
a a lighter to get the skillet tool off

87
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:48,239
later but with a finger it just becomes

88
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,759
a real mess but I can smell that

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,480
wonderful Mash cush smell coming through

90
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,759
loud and clear so we've got these on the

91
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,479
oil pads uh we want to thank the people

92
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,000
at Skillet tool for hooking us up with

93
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,438
the tools to to get our hash off our oil

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,079
slicks and then of course I also want to

95
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,878
help thank those guys for these little

96
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,840
cool balls and the little containers

97
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,280
that they kicked me down uh the oil

98
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,280
slick guys kicked me down at the

99
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,000
Cannabis Cup um right now I've got some

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,639
OG bubble cush full melt in this one

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,918
here and I've been cruising around town

102
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,240
with it it's been quite convenient more

103
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,599
so than I thought and then the little

104
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,439
guy here I've got some full melt dry

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,280
sift that I just made from some of John

106
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,759
B's medic cush a bag of shm that he left

107
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,198
here a while ago I ran it through my

108
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,919
tumble now and I cleaned it up on a

109
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,038
secondary screen with my carding

110
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:43,038
technique and I made some real nice full

111
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,319
melt dry sift so I think I've mentioned

112
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:45,918
most of the companies I wanted to

113
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,319
mention I guess I'll give a little shout

114
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,560
out to uh K9 tubes with their little

115
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,680
mini uh rig uh pendant rigs not really a

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
pendant but it's definitely like a

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
necklace rig it's got the little hole

118
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
for wearing around your neck and it's

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,960
got the little educated nail in there

120
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
with the uh yeah nice little Dome that's

121
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,359
a cool little product right there but

122
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,239
when you want to get a nice little rip

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,319
and you don't have uh uh room for a big

124
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,240
rig also want to give a shout out to

125
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,918
Trippy sticks amelo you're a pleasure to

126
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,199
hang out with at the Cannabis cupo

127
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:20,000
always a pleasure loving the glass Vapor

128
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,360
Chambers uh the titanium element with

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,038
the Deep ceramic dish a little bit more

130
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,639
battery power than the rest of the units

131
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,639
it's why I stand behind trippy sticks

132
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,680
it's why I sell these things because

133
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,600
they work for me on the regular basis

134
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,038
um couple of piles of hash out here we

135
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,600
got Bubba and OG um one's 120 one's 90

136
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:41,199
Micron we've got about a quar pound of

137
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,360
beautiful John B nuggets here can't

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,960
remember the strain might be medy Kush

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,479
I'll open that up a little later but why

140
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,719
don't we start with hitting the denail

141
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:54,839
through the mother ship using the

142
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,880
skillet tool so let's see if I can just

143
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:01,239
oh yeah oh yeah so we'll just take a

144
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,079
little dab off off that it's transparent

145
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,000
I can see the gold coloring in it um I

146
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,918
do have a quartz bowl with this as well

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,478
um however I ended up leaving my 14 mm

148
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,879
quartz Bowl in Europe cuz I couldn't get

149
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:17,719
it clean more on that

150
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,719
later um but I have an 18 quartz Bowl

151
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,080
here but only a sheld in black and right

152
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,560
now I want to hit out of the Mother Ship

153
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,560
so let's dab the master Cush

154
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:46,879
probably could have used a carb cap

155
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:49,839
there I do find that when I use the

156
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,399
skillet tool and I cover the little hole

157
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,318
I can do a little carbing that way but

158
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,478
it's really mostly carbing the amount of

159
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,240
air that I suck in and not really

160
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:59,800
keeping the uh smoke from Raising off

161
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,400
the dish

162
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,038
really nice flavor on that you probably

163
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,519
noticed I didn't even cough it's h and I

164
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:07,478
have a sore throat and a little bit of

165
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,159
the Cannabis Cup

166
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:12,839
cough the 5-year cure there's something

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,199
to be said for it um it did stay out of

168
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,519
the fridge for about 3 years in a wood

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,038
box in a cold dark place and now I have

170
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,719
it in the fridge not the freezer and I

171
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,639
allow it to breathe about once every

172
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,960
month but this stuff's going on 6 years

173
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,639
old it's five plus years old

174
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,758
and just an

175
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,560
absolute I can't even describe the

176
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,160
subtleties of the flavor that just came

177
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,120
into my throat just

178
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,160
now um yeah just really nice it's

179
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,840
satiating my whole throat it's up on my

180
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,759
lips it's in my

181
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,758
throat and it's it's why you sometimes

182
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,240
want to cure your hash I don't have you

183
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,560
don't have to become religious and cure

184
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,199
all your hash all the time but it's sure

185
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,439
nice to take half the hash that you make

186
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,079
and you know use it the way you love it

187
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,038
and then try a little of experimenting

188
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,719
so many people are experimenting with

189
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,318
changing the texture with leaving

190
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
moisture behind with all these other

191
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,400
things try curing your hash for 6 months

192
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,680
to a year to 2 years to 5 years I'm

193
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,079
telling you there's something to be said

194
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,959
for it particularly water hash it

195
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,240
removes this scratchy harsh feeling um

196
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,478
we were talking to a diti today uh from

197

these valleys um Parvati Valley and

205
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,440

206
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,959
produced in India in these in these

207
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,279
areas and they have been for 800 plus

208

years and he was just giving some great

209
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,600
Knowledge from a from a first person

210

lives in the culture knows the people

212
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,319
talking about the differences between I

213
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,959
mean smoking out on the street to get

214
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,440
high as opposed to the

215
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:09,159
spiritual uh prayer of a Chillum with

216
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,240
the sadu sh you know praying to Shiva

217
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,799

information so if you get a chance come

219

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,320

221
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,600
turns here but uh I'm just excited to

222
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,200
talk to you guys from my office and of

223
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,839
course that Master Kush didn't hurt

224
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,000
things uh either so why don't we get

225
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:31,000
back to hitting some full melt dry sift

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,519
just made this today been curing in the

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,600
uh in the bag for some time left it open

228
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,120
for o probably almost a full month got

229
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,079
it really dry you just you want dry

230
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
material when you're doing dry sifting

231
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:44,639
especially if you're not using this dry

232
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
ice method but you're using old archaic

233
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,559
screening methods it's great to have dry

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,360
material so we'll scoop out a nice

235
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,599
little rip of the full Mel dry sip the

236
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,399
Holy Grail of hash right here as you can

237
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,159
see I have piles of full melt bubble

238
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,240
piles of even the shatter bubble here

239
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,278
that I have out on the oil slicks but

240
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,560
you'll never really see huge piles of

241
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:12,278
this hopefully in the future right now

242
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,278
not so here we

243
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,168
[Music]

244
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,519
go I'll do a macro video of you guys so

245
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,838
you can see this particular dry sift

246
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,480
melting I'd say it's a good 90 to 95%

247
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,079
pure heads it melts fairly nicely but

248
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,720
the quality of the resin wasn't the

249
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,559
highest that it could be so it's got a

250
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,680
little bit of a slower volcanic eruption

251
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,000
to its melt and I'll also show The

252
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,359
Master Kush 5year cured shatter

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,839
bubble as well as a bowl of the OG and

254
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,240
the Bubba because it's just so enjoyable

255
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,000
to

256
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,440
smoke ah so let's tell a funny story

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,559
from from the Cannabis Cup this

258
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,279
year trying to come up with one I guess

259
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,879
I was the first Booth searched uh by the

260
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,278
police this year at the Canvas Cup they

261
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,759
came right to my booth they told me

262
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,639
there were rumors that we had more than

263
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,879
we were

264
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,959
allowed which I think is laughable

265
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,559
because we definitely didn't we were

266
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,359
comfortable in talking with the Dutch

267
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,638
police they were polite they weren't

268
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,560
rude uh they just wanted us to follow

269
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,799
the simple rules as the police often do

270
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,759
I saw a lot of people bashing on it and

271
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,679
and it isn't something really you want

272
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,360
at the C cup but at the same time when

273
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,679
the Vibes aren't completely terrible

274
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,639
it's a bit of a unique position for us

275
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,559
maybe an American who's you know never

276
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,079
been harassed by the police in a way

277
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,599
that you're not really

278
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,120
harassed you they're just literally do

279
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,560
you have five grams or more no just have

280
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,919
five Gams okay have a nice day I know

281
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,479
some people are complaining about it and

282
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,399
it's a bummer for seed companies that

283
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,320
want to display their cannabis's but you

284
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,000
know I think over the years many many

285
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,278
people sold a lot of cannabis at the

286
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,639
Cannabis Cup and that in part was

287
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:05,159
probably why now there's stricter rules

288
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,959
and they're watching things like that it

289
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,240
does ruin it for the seed companies that

290
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,278
just wanted to show strains of what they

291
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,120
have in a nice big Cola bud but it is

292
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,879
what it is and as things are opening up

293
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,360
in some places they may close up in

294
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,320
others we still have Amsterdam we still

295
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,278
have this ability to go there and it's

296
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,560
it's pretty unique I know that it's not

297
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,480
comparable to what's happening in

298
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,559
Washington and Colorado and California

299
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,600
right now but it's still a good time and

300
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,759
I hope that can preserve it and allow it

301
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,639
to continue to happen I've been to the

302
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,360
Cannabis Cup since 1995 that was my

303
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,198
first cup at the P's party house and I

304
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,480
just feel that it's a unique event it's

305
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:45,039
a 5-day event not a two-day event it's

306
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,278
something that uh many people want to

307
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,159
complain about but yet if you make the

308
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,399
best time about it there's you can

309
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:53,439
really go hit an incredible group of

310
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,440
people and talk to them and ask them

311
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,519
questions in regards to you know things

312
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,160
that they may not have the time to

313
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,759
answer you on social media sites they do

314
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,958
have the time to answer you in person at

315
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,159
the Cannabis

316
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,838
Cup so let's see um I was honored to

317
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:12,639
speak at a panel this year at the

318
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:15,360
Cannabis Cup with um Mike Carrol uh from

319
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
California um Scott from rare dankness

320
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,919
from

321
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,320
Colorado and uh the DNA boys from

322
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:26,360
california- Amsterdam uh Danny Dano

323
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,360
hosted us and that was a really nice uh

324
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,519
time I've usually only spoke by myself

325
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,039
on a few occasions I'm not sure how many

326
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,360
panels I've ever spoken on but it was

327
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,159
nice to speak with those guys it was

328
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,440
nice to hear what they had to say all

329
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,958
knowledgeable in their fields and uh it

330
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,440
was nice to be able to fit in with a

331
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,599
group of of Growers and breeders as as

332
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,680
whatever my part was talking about the

333
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,360
resin and talking about I guess the end

334
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,758
result of which um we would be seeking

335
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,399
the desired traits for breeding in the

336
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,560
first place the resin production

337
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,879
cannaboid profile and that sort of

338
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:02,958
thing so that was really nice and then I

339
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,958
also got to speak uh on my own for just

340
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,719
about an hour I did my own talk on water

341
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:12,479
extraction and dry sifting and uh the

342
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,440
endoc canabo system and the best way on

343
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,360
feeding the endoc canabo system and

344
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,480
little bits of quotes from Dr William

345
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,680
Courtney and Dr David Allen to the

346
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,039
doctors that have turned me on to a lot

347
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,679
of the information that I know about

348
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:28,078
those such things so that was really

349
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:31,039
nice as well um I didn't have any drama

350
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:34,198
like Ben drunker was able to create uh

351
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:37,120
Power to Ben he spoke uh I guess on the

352
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:40,159
last day at the Cannabis Cup and he had

353
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,120
his sensey seed girls uh three or four

354
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,559
girls go throughout the audience and

355
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,240
give away free cannabis and so I'm I

356
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,239
guess there was an undercover police uh

357
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,360
in the audience and so he tried to stop

358
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,120
it from happening and I believe if I'm

359
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,759
not correct me if I'm wrong Ben removed

360
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,919
him by the collar of his jacket from the

361
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,199
room in which case a lot of police tried

362
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,799
to to get in and some people in the room

363
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,439
sort of kept that from happening for a

364
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,639
while but uh a little bit of drama when

365
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
you're trying to give away good cannabis

366
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,839
uh it was always something you were able

367
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,958
to do with the Cannabis Cup so that's

368
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,440
that's a little bit disappointing

369
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,559
but what can you say you know it's still

370
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,519
a good event you know you get to see

371
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,518
this unique group of people there's

372
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,759

373
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,959

00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,839
it was nice to meet bezel from beesel

375

really cool to meet those guys I maybe

381
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,719
repeating myself I'm not sure the last

382
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,799
dab of dry sift was very wonderful

383
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,600

415
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,558
to see some really exceptionally

416
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,078
well-made dry sift we love to see some

417
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,480
exceptionally well-made water hash we're

418
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:19,318
looking for water hash that hasn't

419
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,640
buttered out you need to dry that [ __ ]

420
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,159
proper and if you think you can do it on

421
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,919
parchment paper great if not I urge you

422
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,919
to use a food grade cardboard or even

423
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,600
the other day I was talking to Matt rise

424
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,960
I know a lot of you guys bash on Matt

425
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,918
and I know he said some things in the

426
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,000
community that he shouldn't have uh he

427
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,919
does definitely ow owe out some

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,839
apologies but I like to keep everyone

429
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,440
together rather than separate and I I

430
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:44,599
you know he I was asking him the other

431
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,160
day what he uses as opposed to cardboard

432
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:48,240
and he for the first time said something

433
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
that to me not he for the first time but

434
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,599
someone for the first time replied with

435
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,798
something that made us equal of a sense

436
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,918
which was uh thick paper towel I believe

437
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,400
under screen that he's drawing U the

438
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,120
bubble out on St stretched a big nice

439
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,600
stretched screen so if he's doing that

440
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,558
that's great that's still a desicant

441
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,759
that will still Wick the moisture out of

442
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:09,480
the hash so of course if you're doing

443
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,640
something like that to me that's the

444
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,919
equivalent of cardboard it's the

445
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,159
equivalent of getting something done

446
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,799
which parchment paper absolutely does

447
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:21,640
not maybe in a low humidity area but for

448
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,960
sure not anywhere else so I wanted to

449
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,159
say that and uh yeah I guess I'll have

450
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,880
another dab I've rolled myself some of

451
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,200
this uh oh [ __ ] was that the Bubba

452
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,360
thought it was the OG but I guess we're

453
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,360
going Bubba here we

454
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,440
go really great taste on the denail

455
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,480
bringing me back full circle to the

456
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,200
dmail cuz I brought them up earlier

457
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,558
wanting to shout them out Stevie and

458
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,640
Brian you've done an exceptional job on

459
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,359
this product um I really messed up I

460
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,799
took the first one to Amsterdam I

461
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,759
plugged it in with a converter not an

462
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,720
inverter and we cranked it up all hot

463
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,319
and we put it in front of a window with

464
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,839
cold air rushing in so

465
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,158
we we really put that unit to the test

466
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,439
and of course we pooched it I'm going to

467
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,280
be sending it back to him and he's going

468
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,798
to open open it up and check out you

469
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,119
know what was done but you have to

470
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:37,679
understand like no product could expect

471
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,439
to survive that so when we got the

472
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,000
second one from them this one with the

473
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,798
zebra wood I was a little worried I

474
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,599
wasn't sure how it was going to stand up

475
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,359
being set up to a step down converter

476
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,639
and running for 10 plus hours a day at

477
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,359
the Cannabis Cup in a room that's not

478
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,280
heated the room was cold well I'm happy

479
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,879
to

480
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,960
say this is the unit I brought to the

481
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,000
Cannabis Cup both whips from the other

482
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,600
unit the one that was plugged in and the

483
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,558
one that wasn't plugged in the one that

484
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:08,158
I pooched both work so that was really

485
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:10,599
cool and this unit worked flawlessly for

486
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,559
10 hours plus a day at the Cannabis Cup

487
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:17,199
for 5 days straight um that's pretty

488
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:20,279
incredible okay to keep a consistent

489
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,558
temperature for from within uh you know

490
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,000
the one degree or the two to 3° it would

491
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:28,480
move I always knew when they had the

492
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,519
door open cuz it would move almost 3°

493
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,038
which which was a vast you know it was

494
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,960
vast compared to what we were used to

495
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:38,038
inside at our hotel room which was

496
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,919
1° so I can't say enough about the unit

497
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,400
um I love the lightweight cable cord

498
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,679
that they use um it's it doesn't

499
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,200
constantly knock over my bubble uh you

500
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,280
know pull things off the table uh not

501
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,919
pull over the bong cuz it's so heavy so

502
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,519
that's a a real topnotch product I love

503
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,960
the quartz Bowl The Taste was really

504
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,798
nice for me but I also like the titanium

505
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,600
Bowl we were hitting around 750 to 810

506
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,918
you know I don't have enough uh

507
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,399
experience with it to say I know which

508
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,240
one I like the best I do like that Smoky

509
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,080
Rip but I do like that tasty rip and I

510
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,278
like to meet somewhere in the middle and

511
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:19,240
I it seems to be around 800° 780° for me

512
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:20,558
uh for the bubble in the water uh water

513
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,679
hash that I'm

514
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,558
smoking so I guess I won't keep you guys

515
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,320
any longer I've talked a little bit

516
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:28,599
about the Cannabis Cup I've talked about

517
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,639
some of the products that I was having

518
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,879
happy to receive and happy to use happy

519
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,880
to put through the

520
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,760
test um took a couple of dabs with you

521
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,320
guys maybe I'll finish it off with a

522
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,359
nice full melt dry sift rip out of the D

523
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,158
nail can't say enough about these

524
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,278
Mothership pipes either I know a lot of

525
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,080
people are can't wrap their heads around

526
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,720
how expensive they are and it seems

527
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,720
absurd for a clear glass pipe to pay

528
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,319
,000 or

529
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,000
$2,000 but we had the Fab egg there and

530
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,960
we had the straight Fab there and they

531
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,359
were pretty much two of the most unique

532
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,319
pipes in Amsterdam the way they hit the

533
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,558
consistent uh saving of flavor through

534
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,000
the filtration I'm not sure I understand

535
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:12,440
it but I really got to give Mothership

536
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,200
uh two thumbs up and so yeah if you're

537

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,960
believe it's high priority or high

539
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,960
integrity high integrity they're both

540
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,720
