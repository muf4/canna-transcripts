go these little stickers oh look at that

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,478
just like just like the OG I've always

44
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,118
kind of thought this was a very unique

45
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:52,879
and original case I've never seen any

46
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,718
other case anything like this uh very

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,000
easy for sort of throwing it into a

48
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:58,399
backpack and it's just durable and

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,438
strong you don't have to worry about the

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,640
pipe itself on the inside having any

51
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,559
problems well that is pretty slick I'm

52
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,639
not going to lie and it looks like they

53
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,598
put in that looks like a an a 3D XL Bowl

54
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,719
to me I could be wrong um but it really

55
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,199
looks like it no I would say that is the

56
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,560
3D XL Bowl it must just be the standard

57
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,919
that comes with the pipe now nice little

58
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,719
handheld unit nice color um I got to

59
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,280
give it up to puffco

60
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:31,680
for normalizing hashish use and live

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,560
hash rosin nor normalizing it for the

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
masses because let's be honest the

63
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,598
majority of people don't have access to

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,800
dab rigs they don't have the ability to

65
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:44,000
just like you know torch up a a quartz

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,040
Banger um so they've been doing an

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
incredible job with bringing access to

68
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,120
sort of regular people that want to get

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,360
into dabbing or want to try it as an

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,039
experience so beautiful beautiful little

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,760
piece right there nice little glass on

72
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:04,079
the inside there 3dxl b feels great in

73
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,840
the hand I'm super stoked about this I'm

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,519
definitely going to have a mad puffco

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,400
session at one point in time that may be

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,879
a part of this video it may not be a

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,080
part of this video I might just get the

78
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:19,598
unboxing part one done uh and then we'll

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,200
do some other videos uh in regards to um

80
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:25,318
you know showing it being used so comes

81
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,878
with the charger cord right here and

82
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,679
then they also give you uh a few little

83
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,719
Q-tips little four four pack of Q-tips

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,200
and that's just uh for those of you that

85
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,239
have never had a puffco before uh

86
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,798
they've got a cool little

87
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,719
um a cool little insert that fits right

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,599
into the bottom right here so this

89
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,639
little piece pops open they used to have

90
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,878
a Dabber in there as well oh there's one

91
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,598
on the other side and there's the Dabber

92
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,639
so I've never seen that I've always only

93
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,598
seen one of those little inserts uh get

94
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,318
the most out of your Peak Pro download

95
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,078
puffco connect and unlock deep

96
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,958
customization like VAP control Precision

97
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:08,120
temp settings mood lights Etc so when we

98
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,360
have the session um we will get into

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,719
that we will download the app and make

100
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,359
sure that we uh that we get into uh a

101
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:19,079
showing that so there we go for that and

102
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,839
put that right back in there actually

103
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,280
that went the wrong way it's very

104
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,918
specific way fits much better like that

105
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,679
then right over there all right let's

106
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,240
see what else we got

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,639
here puffco

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,600
actually this is not oh I see it's got

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,120
to go in there exactly as well I'll tell

110
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,000
you if there's a wrong way to do it I'll

111
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,399
do it before I do the right way I'll

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,079
almost always do the wrong way comment

113
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,000
if you're like me and you always do it

114
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,439
the wrong way before you do it the right

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,680
way uh trying to get this moved over a

116
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,160
bit so it's not blocking and then I'm

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,199
going to pull some of the other things

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,320
out here that were gifted so let's not

119
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,199
delay

120
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,879
you get out what you put in so this is

121
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,000
the new puffco pivot and I'm not going

122
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:09,918
to lie I've been very very very excited

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,959
to try this one it looks like it really

124
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,240
produces some interesting Vapor it's got

125
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,439
a really nice size um atomizer on on the

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,600
inside and

127
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:23,360
apparently it is small it is not a big

128
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,840
unit at all so see if I can uh use my

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,759
nails to get into this little

130
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,959
guy you think I would have uh

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
well you think I would have maybe

132
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,478
brought some scissors or something but

133
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,079
sticker comes off pretty easy so there's

134
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,038
that didn't rip the package I don't know

135
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,198
why but the OCD part of me is always

136
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:45,038
bothered when I take these little Moon

137
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,199
stickers off uh and they sh and they you

138
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,719
know take off the label or they take off

139
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,800
uh part of the package so that is not

140
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,199
the case here except it did a little bit

141
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,879
on the bottom there so this is uh the

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,439
pivot let's see what we got here oh

143
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,439
there's another one on the top

144
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,360
interesting all right well we'll get

145
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,959
that off as well a true unboxing video

146
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,280
to show you exactly what you're going to

147
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,439
be dealing with when you get yours I

148
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,079
believe they sold my goodness I believe

149
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,439
they sold out in a big way when they

150
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,560
released this product so I'm just going

151
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,800
to kind of put it back together I opened

152
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,680
it a little greasily so when you open it

153
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
up on the front you probably want to

154
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,038
hold it like this so you can pull that

155
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,199
off the instructions are right on the

156
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:33,120
top they've got their QR bar code as

157
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,840
well so once again enter here in about

158
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,918
four different languages and then boom

159
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:43,079
would you look at that that is a nice

160
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:47,279
little unit little bit of plastic on top

161
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,279
that we'll pull off

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,360
here W that is tight on there too very

163
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,598
nice feels amazing in the hand I'm not

164
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,680
going to lie it feels really amazing

165
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,918
there's the battery aspect to it it just

166
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,519
connects really quick to the battery the

167
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,758
battery is ultra light it almost feels

168
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:13,079
like nothing it's uh it almost feels the

169
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,038
same weight as the atomizer so we got

170
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,878
that and then you just pop that open

171
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:20,598
it's a nice little silicone piece that

172
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,479
stops over the top and you can see

173
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,199
there's your big atomizer right there

174
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,918
not quite big enough to fit my pinky in

175
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,199
but certainly a bigger atomizer than

176
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:33,560
I've ever seen on any um you know type

177
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,120
of handheld small device such as this so

178
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,319
that is incredible I guess inside the

179
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,240
box they've got more Q-tips and another

180
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,000
um USBC for charging little bit of

181
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,038
desicant there as well I'll get rid of

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
so that's nice just fits in the box

183
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:51,598
right in the

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,800
bottom that is really really nice

185
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:57,959
looking I can't wait to get these pivots

186
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,720
going you know I was watching all of the

187
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,959
the advertisements that they had for it

188
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,879
was kind of saying look we know you

189
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,519
hardcores are out there I mean they they

190
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,919
puffco understands that their products

191
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,158
aren't going to be an exact replication

192
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,478
of a dab out of a quarts Banger what

193
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,038
they're trying to do is that's the bar

194
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:16,800
and they're getting up to that bar and I

195
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,439
remember the first puffco pen I tried it

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,560
was a solid pen the battery lasted for

197
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,478
damn near forever but it certainly

198
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,199
didn't um deliver the hit that say the

199
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,158
puffco delivered when that came out you

200
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,158
know a couple years later

201
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,918
uh and then even more so when the puffco

202
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:38,479
pro came out the peak Pro uh and then

203
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,799
even more so when they released the 3dxl

204
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,639
bowl uh I remember the first time I hit

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,639
the proxy I I heard Roger say uh or it

206
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,278
might have even been Chelsea uh say it's

207
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,639
a it's a sipper not a ripper and I saw a

208
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:53,480
lot of people using these tools like

209
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,080
they were that very thing I saw people

210
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,600
loading up enormous dabs hitting it you

211
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,399
know leaning back so that the the the

212
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,399
the atomizer wasn't straight anymore it

213
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,919
was at an angle so now you've got rosin

214
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,159
that's being pulled in through this

215
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,879
suction going into the atomizer holes at

216
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,278
the top that's supposed to be for airf

217
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,399
flow and I saw a lot of people ruin

218
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,200
their units and then complain that they

219
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,078
weren't working and I've been guilty

220
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,600
myself of ruining electronics and

221
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:23,719
complaining that they didn't work I've

222
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,519
also become aware that that my using of

223
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,759
the piece of electronics

224
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,120
incorrectly is what's responsible for

225
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,679
breaking it more often than not my last

226
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,278
puffco with the p with the XL 3D XL Bowl

227
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,799
lasted for my God it must have been a

228
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,559
year and a half and I probably put a

229
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,439
thousand plus dabs through that thing

230
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,719
I'd have to go online and check exactly

231
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
what the number was but I put a lot of

232
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
rips through that thing before I finally

233
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,240
had problems with the atomizer now I'm

234
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,000
cleaning the atomizer right now I'm

235
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,720
finally cleaning it the proper way not

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,759
just cleaning the outside I'm soaking it

237
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,720
in alcohol I'm going to dry it properly

238
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,039
uh and then I'm going to see uh you know

239
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,839
what uh if I can get it back and working

240
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,799
this one's really nice I believe this

241
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,399
one is slate so there's the color

242
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,120
difference right there they did send me

243
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,679
two of these so I'll show you the

244
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,360
other unit right next to it the black

245
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,000
unit you can see there's a very very

246
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,639
substantial difference in those two

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,759
units right there so I can't tell you

248
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,799
how excited I am to start hauling on

249
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,879
these especially for snowboard season I

250
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,759
used to carry my puffco with me I've

251
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,360
even carried carried the proxy with me

252
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,480
I've carried other units with me that

253
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,560
have glass on them and one of the things

254
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm looking most forward to uh this

255
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,399
snowboard season in particular is to not

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,360
have to carry glass on the mountain but

257
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,679
still be able to get a rip uh as James

258
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
from puffco said the other day where I

259
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,000
can get my head straight where I get my

260
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,360
head the way I want to get it so really

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,360
excited about the two PE uh pivots

262
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,360
obviously excited about the puffco peak

263
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,159
Pro uh and then they also sent me this

264
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,079
little go little little dude the glass

265
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,838
adapter uh 3D chamber included so this

266
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,638
is a little adapter that allows you to

267
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,279
hook up to one of the pivots through the

268
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:15,879
top uh and put it into a a pipe through

269
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,838
a a I believe it's a glass uh grommet

270
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:20,439
we'll see here in a second because

271
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,600
obviously everyone has differ size glass

272
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,800
grommets there's 188 there's 144 most of

273
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,159
us nowadays are using like tens and

274
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,599
eights and even fives I think I saw in

275
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:34,319
bestest tedes pop out a Fiverr the other

276
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,720
day which was incredibly small we put

277
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
those over there so we can kind of get a

278
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
little bit more actually I think this

279
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,120
one will go real nice there these ones

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,039
will go real nice there there we go so

281
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,480
let's see what we've got

282
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,240
here I think it's just

283
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,240
a yeah one of these kind of releases

284
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,159
we'll just have to it's very nice tight

285
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:02,799
fit it doesn't just fall out uh By Any

286
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:05,039
Means you can see how tight that is and

287
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,199
once again on the top are your

288
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,319
instructions as well as your QR code and

289
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,399
here we

290
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:18,000
go this is nice so this is almost like a

291
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:20,919
a composite it's got the battery

292
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,639
connector which is

293
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,240
interesting I'm interested to see how

294
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,399
that's going to work and then uh it's

295
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,240
got the 14 it looks like that might even

296
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,000
be a 10 and this might be a 14 so I

297
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,919
guess what you can do is you can pull

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,799
these out right I'll show you that real

299
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,000
quick so you can pull that that right

300
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:45,240
out it goes in very easily and it pulls

301
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,440
out very nicely it's like a silicone

302
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,959
mold and then you can put in your your

303
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,279
10 so that's more than likely the one

304
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,319
that's going to fit my pipe right

305
00:12:53,278 --> 00:13:00,159
there and then let's just see what it

306
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:04,040
looks like with one of these cuz I'm

307
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:07,559
mildly confused I

308
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,919
guess okay so how do you do that you

309
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:13,039
just go like

310
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,039
that so now that's the

311
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,399
battery I'm

312
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,000
interesting just did to figure this out

313
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,360
I don't know why I can't figure it out

314
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,159
it can't be through just the battery

315
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,560
because you got to be able to take a rip

316
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:30,159
unless

317
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:32,119
ah mind blown so I'm sitting here going

318
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,000
well okay like I get when you take this

319
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,039
off you have the battery but this this

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,399
is the coil this is your atomizer this

321
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,719
is this is where you get your hit so I

322
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,440
was super confused when I just saw that

323
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,160
and I thought okay so you add your

324
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,160
battery to it what what's that going to

325
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,159
do where's the actual

326
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,000
rep right there there's your actual

327
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,839
secondary Bowl inside the little L with

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,679
the glass piece so you just put your dab

329
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,040
right in there you close it up you set

330
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:06,399
it all your settings are with one single

331
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:08,559
button um which is really nice because

332
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,078
it's got this bar of color that I saw on

333
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,000
their ads that it looks just so slick I

334
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,679
got to give them a shout out for how

335
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,759
slick of a product they have released

336
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:23,958
here so love the ability to Interchange

337
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:26,600
the different sizes of um mail um pieces

338
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,278
mail glass pieces and that's just so

339
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,680
cool I can drop that right into my pipe

340
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,159
and at the Times where say my denail

341
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,638
Universal heater is not heating up or my

342
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,600
I don't have it turned on and maybe I

343
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,360
have no gas in my torch I'm not I'm

344
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,399
moving away from the torch and I think

345
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,919
one of the things that puffco has done

346
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,879
incredibly is creating an atmosphere

347
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,278
where one can can can dab live hash

348
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,000
rosin or full melt bubble without the

349
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,559
use of a torch and you got to admit for

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,440
a lot of people that torch freaks people

351
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,439
out so I am really really

352
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,600
loving uh this particular particular

353
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,079
piece right here I'm just going to take

354
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,360
it all apart and put it back together

355
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,559
the way it was so it fits in the

356
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,800
packaging nice and

357
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,679
easily and we'll put this back to that

358
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,000
you could they just fit together so

359
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,838
nicely everything closes so nicely that

360
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,639
is extremely small I mean that is I can

361
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,120
almost hide that in my hand completely

362
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,240
if I take the bowl off I can hide the

363
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,480
battery pretty much perfectly in my hand

364
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,639
that's a nice little Ripper that beats

365
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,159
any pen I've ever felt in my my hand

366
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,198
right there so I'm really looking

367
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,399
forward to uh hitting some of that

368
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,758
concentrated X full melt bubble out of

369
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,559
that I'll definitely be playing around

370
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,839
with the puffco pivot glass adapter big

371
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,119
shout out to Chelsea for having all of

372
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,480
this stuff sent out to me you've always

373
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,318
been so kind and so generous and uh

374
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,639
taken such great care of me so uh it's

375
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:56,278
my honor to use the products that you

376
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,120
guys send me and turn people on to them

377
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,000
uh my daughter works at a dispensary

378
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,278
just down the street in Horseshoe Bay at

379
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,600
happy Isle and they actually sell the

380
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:07,120
puff Co product so that's pretty cool um

381
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,040
let's open the final thing which is the

382
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,720
travel case we'll open the travel case

383
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,078
and we'll see what's going on here it's

384
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,399
good that I have this

385
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,039
one somewhat of I wouldn't call it a

386
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,240
nail but I have a little bit of a nail

387
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,240
right on my middle finger that's the one

388
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
that's allowing me to open all of this

389
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,159
stuff so just make sure I've got all the

390
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,079
Plastics put away all right we've got a

391
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,759
nice little sleeve here that the p the

392
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,559
case just slides out I love the Retro

393
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,159
look of the case this reminds me of some

394
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,479
old school like pencil case that I had

395
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:40,958
in like

396
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,959
1979 uh pops open real nice and easy and

397
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,159
as you can

398
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:48,799
see just has a spot I'm guessing for

399
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:54,399
everything so I guess we're going to

400
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:58,000
have to see I guess the main part is um

401
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,679
for jars and then I guess right here

402
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,720
yeah that looks like that so you kind of

403
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,720
got your spot right across the top that

404
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,679
you can put your uh your unit I'm

405
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:12,880
guessing that this might even fit

406
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,280
um it's hard to say I know if that fits

407
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,160
that like that or no getting to know all

408
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,160
this stuff I guess it probably fits the

409
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,120
adapter I could check be nice to have

410
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,319
the adapter in there as well not that I

411
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,678
I would need it but uh I mean honestly I

412
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,359
can tell for

413
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,640
myself um for the mountain especially I

414
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,918
mean for you know for cruising around on

415
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,038
uh that's pretty cool that damn near

416
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,000
fits so without the glass piece it

417
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,679
absolutely fits in here a little bit

418
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,359
kind of sort of sort of I guess you've

419
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,400
got that little piece right there so you

420
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:52,319
can kind of go like

421
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:56,400
that okay so there's that still more

422
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:58,839
room very cool very cool little case uh

423
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,400
fits probably like three or four jars

424
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,279
bars of your um of your hash which is

425
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,360
always

426
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,158
convenient and uh I got to say man good

427
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,319
job that you guys have done on this it's

428
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,919
really really nice equipment um I'm

429
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:17,759
hoping on getting a puffco code for you

430
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,120
guys but in the future uh in the future

431
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,519
where you can get maybe a little tiny

432
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,119
bit of a discount but in the meantime

433
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,400
just go head on over to puffco.com uh

434
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,359
and you can get any of these products

435
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,559
off of their website and uh I know some

436
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,079
people have been like oh I got a bad one

437
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,639
a long time ago and I didn't listen

438
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,678
they're an exceptional team they're

439
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,000
going to get back to you in regards to

440
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,840
their customer service uh if you have a

441
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,919
unit that's not working or something

442
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,639
went wrong with it definitely do

443
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,240
something about that get in touch with

444
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,919
them make sure that uh you let them know

445
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,000
because a company can't fix uh what you

446
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,600
don't let them know they need to they

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,679
need to be told they need to be you know

448
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,439
l in on the fact that something's not

449
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,480
working I know selling Bubble Bags over

450
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,120
the years

451
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,640
uh we've had some warranty issues and

452
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,759
the people who need to get those

453
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,440
warranty issues that reach out to us are

454
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,119
very happy the people who do not reach

455
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,480
out to us end up being pretty pissed and

456
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,759
sometimes I'll see them like five or 10

457
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,319
years down the road and they'll say yeah

458
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,919
I bought your bags and they one came

459
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,599
ripped or something or something

460
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,840
happened you know really we haven't had

461
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,678
many warranty issues since probably 15

462
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,199
years ago when there was this rubber

463
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,798
coating that the manufacture just

464
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,400
started putting onto the inside of the

465
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,679
nylon without telling us and eventually

466
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,400
over time that nylon that material would

467
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,400
chip off and come out and so we

468
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,159
warrantied all those bags over the years

469
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,840
so make sure if you do purchase a puffco

470
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,559
uh product that you give their customer

471
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,439
service a chance if something goes wrong

472
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,918
with it and if nothing goes wrong with

473
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,720
it well then just enjoy that piece of

474
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,840

475
