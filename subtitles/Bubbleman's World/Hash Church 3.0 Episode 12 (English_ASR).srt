lovely melty bubble blonde tasty

96
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,359
flavorful bubble reminds me of some old

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,719
school Dutch Treat that used to grow

98
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,159

99
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,519
coded in resin so we're we've invited

100
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,359
Mark in we're going to end up talking

101
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,959
about that this hash Church cultivar uh

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,840
throughout the day here and uh I wanted

103
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,639
to make him a part of the show um just

104
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,280
sort of kind of you know share my thanks

105
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,439
with him and also kind of apologize

106
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,799
because I've been so busy and here we

107
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,800
are during a global pandemic you know

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
things are going rough with for Mark and

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
his family like it's not just smooth

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,800
sailing they're they're really trying to

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,519
hold it together and rock and roll and

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,560
make things work out and now they're

113
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,439
sitting on this cultivar and the minute

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
I posted it I'm certain the guy could

115
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,719
have probably sold 50,000 seeds people

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,879
just hitting him up left right and

117
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,520
center and he's like look I'm not going

118
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,319
to sell any of this I just want to make

119
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,560
sure you're good with it that it's the

120
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,360
hash church cultivar that it's real I'm

121
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,879
not trying to build fake hype and all

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,680
this sort of stuff so that's kind of the

123
00:04:52,879 --> 00:05:00,319
story behind Mark just seemed uh like a

124
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,519
good dude with a nice cultivar and uh I

125
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,680
thought yeah it's a beautiful cultivar I

126
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,478
you know me allowing him to name it hash

127
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,038
church is nothing more than me saying

128
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,359
sure you can name it hash Church we're

129
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:11,879
not partnering up I'm not going into the

130
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,520
seed business to make money off

131
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,279
cultivars that's none of what I'm

132
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,639
interested in but I love the idea of

133
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,719
helping good folks and the bubble did

134
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,400
come out very very nicely I also pressed

135
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,440
a little bit of Ros and it had a really

136
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,959
nice kind of unique almost an old school

137
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,879
high if that makes any sense and uh

138

that

168
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:44,719

169
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,479
2020 one w n but we won't have that

170

00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,839
that what you're

177
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,400

178
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,959

Times well we shout shout out to uh

187
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,759
Chimera he just sent me an email saying

188
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,199
he's not going to be able to make it

189
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,840
today as he has no heat and he's trying

190
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,919
to sort that out so welcome to Canada

191
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,158
welcome to uh I'm not even sure where

192
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:49,478
Chimera is these days to be honest but

193
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:51,598
he's usually kind of in a wooded area so

194
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,758
it makes sense yesterday was wicked

195
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,240
wicked windy and uh I'm surprised I have

196
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,479
power right now actually it's kind of a

197
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
blessing that we're able to do this

198
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,639
first of the hash Church we're going to

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,079
talk about that Mr Bingle Lombardi we're

200
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,360
going to get into it in a little bit

201
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,800
don't worry about that I'm just going to

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,199

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,360

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,120
in a long time that we haven't been able

206
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,520
to kind of connect some of you I connect

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,560
with the odd time on Zoom chats like Mr

208
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,680
Colin Palmer welcome Colin I see him

209

210
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,400
see all of you and I will apologize to

211
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,439
the entire hash Church community because

212
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,399
I do feel like I've dropped the ball a

213
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,278
little bit I guess we got to the point

214
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,278
where hash Church felt secure enough of

215
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,360
a show that even if I didn't do it for

216
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,320
months and months all I had to do is

217
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,839
text you guys we get back together and

218
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,919

219
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,360
how it started to play out but I have a

220
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:47,000
lot of people we have to understand that

221
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200

Amber triones all milky no clear at all

327
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,879

328
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,720
that it's going to get washed probably

329

335
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:43,000
have metamorphis from doing the Edibles

336
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,319
to actually accepting my doctorate um I

337
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,240
actually had a doctorate the whole time

338
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,600
I was in cannabis and I just never used

339
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,519
it and um Dr seil Agarwal um approached

340
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,240
me um when there was a when there was a

341
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,600
flux a change between medical and

342
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,440
recreational and um he started a

343
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,720
cannabis and psychedelic uh Integrative

344
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,240
Medicine practice up here in Seattle so

345
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,160
now that's what I'm doing I'm practicing

346
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,759
Psychotherapy with cannabis and

347
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:16,480
psychedelics and it's um really amazing

348
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,639
it's uh probably some of the best work

349
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,879
I've ever done well that's what's up and

350
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,120
it doesn't even surprise me in the least

351
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,000
because the mushroom has been boring its

352
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,919
little way back into my life like so

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,039
crazy I can't even like tell you all how

354
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,519
hardcore the mushroom and now just to

355
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,639
give everyone a little idea you know

356
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,839
I've had a relationship with the

357
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,079
mushroom for a very long time since the

358
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,600
late 80s early 90s when my roommate

359
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,958
Jason ordered spores from siy company

360
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,199
that was owned by cat and Terrence

361
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:49,000
McKenna we ordered the SZ siy strain

362
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,719
which is the parental stock of the penis

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,399
envy mushroom nowadays siy is of course

364
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,920
the mushroom that Dennis McKenna and

365
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,958
Terrence McKenna collected in the Amazon

366
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,120
during the 70s prior to writing their

367
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,599
book uh the mushroom Growers guide which

368
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,320
was one of the first times uh people

369
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,440
were able to gather information on

370
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,278
cultivating mushrooms indoors they took

371
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
it a step further I guess there was a

372
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,879
priest down in the Amazon who had

373
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,839
cleared some trees to raise some cattle

374
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,039
the cattle started [ __ ] the [ __ ]

375
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,519
started spawning the mushrooms started

376
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,319
speaking and the McKenna started

377
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,919
listening and that sort of brought the

378
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,879
mushroom to Hawaii which we shipped it

379
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,278
in a Spore print over to Winnipeg

380
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,078
Manitoba an absolute incubator of

381
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:31,360
alcoholism where we thought let's see if

382
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:32,719
we can get less people to drink alcohol

383
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,839
and trip out on these wonderful

384
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,360
mushrooms that were growing in my closet

385
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,360
at the time in Grain prior to the PF

386
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,399
Tech so we didn't have the old distilled

387
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,240
spores in water that we could just

388
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,879
inject we actually were forced to use

389
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,680
transfer Chambers where you had to you

390
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,439
know take the old gloves and build them

391
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,719
into a box and do everything inside that

392
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,199
which was a little bit you know A Step

393
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,680
Above uh growing cannabis which we

394
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,240
thought was pretty amazing at the time

395
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,838
but all of a sudden and ulating mycelium

396
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,879
into agar transferring agar into grain

397
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,680
casing grain and growing and fruiting

398
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,799
mushrooms this was a whole other

399
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,078
incredible experience and I cannot tell

400
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,000
you how blessed I am to have had that

401
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,838
experience to have had the mushroom in

402
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,278
my life I'll never forget stumping Paul

403
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,199
stamitz at the Psychedelic gathering in

404
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,919
Whistler one year where I got to meet

405
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:28,078
the entire psychedelic family from Ralph

406
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:30,078
mner to Jonathan a to Paul stamitz to

407
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,919
Finn McKenna was there at the time his

408
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,599
father uh Terren had just passed away um

409
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:36,958
but it was really quite an incredible

410
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,440
time and Paul stamus walked by my my

411
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,159
booth that I had and I was selling

412
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,519
bubble bags and I had a macro photograph

413
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,759
from yuk Dumas in Amsterdam and I said

414
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,399
to Paul I said can you identify this

415
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,278
mushroom and he stood there for three or

416
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,240
four minutes with this totally stumped

417
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,480
look on his face and uh I finally said

418
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,879
you know listen it's actually a

419
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,920
glandular Tricom just busting your balls

420
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,639
and uh it was pretty funny I do look

421
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,399
forward to seeing him again one day and

422
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,078
bringing that up because I guarantee you

423
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,439
he won't forget being stumped on a

424
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,240
mushroom identification photo that

425
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,679
indeed was not a mushroom so awesome to

426
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,480
hear that you're doing all of that Dr

427
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,439
Allison Dron I love it we're actually uh

428
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,000
Dennis McKenna and Paul stamitz are

429
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,279
currently um working with our Clinic

430
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
because uh we've had a hard time with d

431
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:29,440
Crim in Washington state of psychedelics

432
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,160
we're not as um fantastic as Oregon and

433
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
so we're trying to come at it from

434
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,000
another perspective with the right to

435
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,160
try

436
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,919
psilocybin and so we're

437
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,038
currently um we have submitted

438
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,240
documentation to the DEA to do

439
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,240
psilocybin for end of life um and so a

440
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,919
couple of my patients are part of the

441
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,640
study to be able to use it uh terminal

442
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,520
cancer patients so we are we work with

443
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,759
McKenna and stamas as well because

444
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,440
stamus is helping us procure the

445
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:01,960
psilocybin for our project well I'm

446
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,440
going to put up a cyanin mushroom cap

447
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,640
that I photographed with my macro camera

448
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,919
I've never photographed psilocybin

449
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,679
mushrooms with my macro photograph but

450
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,600
as we're talking about the mushroom I

451
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,159
should I feel and this is another sort

452
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,359
of trippy thing that the mushroom pulled

453
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,600
me forward I I discovered cyan Essence

454
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,918
mushrooms growing on a grow that I had

455
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,719
back 20 plus years ago we seen some

456
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,400
dreadlocked kid picking mushrooms like

457
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,038
it was going out of style in our front

458
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
yard and we're just trying to you know

459
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:32,640
grow cannabis illegally at the time not

460
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,679
not let anyone know and we see this kid

461
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,320
and I buy Paul's book and I start to

462
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,240
discover that this is one of the single

463
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,879
largest patches of sin Essence that I

464
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,200
have ever seen in my life this kid must

465
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,640
have gotten 8 to 10 pounds before we

466
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,440
finally caught him and said please stop

467
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,240
picking the mushrooms on our property

468
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,400
and heating us out we have an illegal

469
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,679
grow over there we didn't say that but

470
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,000
we were definitely feeling it and uh so

471
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,519
recently 20 plus years later 22 years

472
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
later I was uh pulled in by the mushroom

473
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,639
again this year I don't know if any of

474
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,599
you saw some of the mushroom photos I've

475
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,600
been posting but we found some massive

476
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,399
sciessent flushes here in Vancouver

477
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,558
really like I'm talking me and my friend

478
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,720
were rolling around on the ground uh

479
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:18,279
giggling like school girls we were so

480
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,159
giddy uh it was just the most exciting

481
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,759
amazing thing to see the mushroom come

482
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,720
back full circle into my life I've been

483
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,960
uh doing macro do uh micro doses uh to

484
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,319
the macro does I did for so many years

485
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,240
when we first started growing terrance's

486
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,119
mushrooms we were pretty much of the

487
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,400
belief system that if we didn't eat five

488
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:38,319
grams in a dark room that there was no

489
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,960
purpose or point in in eating these

490
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,240
mushrooms so we're I see Wade tilting

491
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,279
his head back and laughing like oh young

492
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,159
people like my God because we were like

493
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,678
teenagers in in our just young 20s and I

494
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:55,360
really laughing at having done that

495
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,960
myself absolutely and it was the most

496
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,319
amazing thing and I you know so many

497
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,919
people that have asked me over the years

498
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,798
have you go to university like where did

499
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,000
you go to university and I I really take

500
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,319
a quote once again out of Paul stam's

501
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,960
book when I saw him speak in Vancouver

502
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,918
and I believe it was

503
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:14,519
1995 the first year that I actually met

504
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,320
do uh uh Dave uh skunkman Sam he was at

505
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,038
this event as well it was kind of like a

506
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,519
hemp and psychedelic event and Jonathan

507
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,119
art was thanking the people at Harvard

508
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,960
and you know everyone was H thanking

509
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,798
Yale University and all of these like

510
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,480
you know super brilliant men that went

511
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,359
to these incredible institutions and

512
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,480
then and then Paul stamitz gets up and

513
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,918
he's kind of got a disheveled shirt on

514
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,919
he says oh wow you know I I learned

515
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,080
everything I learned from the mushroom

516
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,960
and standing ovation like right away

517
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,759
already's like just Tak all the

518
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,000
universities and push them off to the

519
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,798
side and he's like I just want to give

520
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,599
props where props are due not that

521
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:51,839
Harvard and Yale and all those amazing

522
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,879
people aren't great but the mushroom

523
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,839
taught me everything and I would uh I

524
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,000
would really say the same thing so it's

525
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,879
really wonderful to see of course

526
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,359
cannabis is an accelerator of course

527
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,640
cannabis once it breaks through and gets

528
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,599
to you know breaks through uh into

529
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,000
legalization into breaking out of

530
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,918
prohibition can uh psychedelic uh plants

531
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
are going to be a close followup it

532
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,038
makes sense as you open your mind to

533
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,440
stopping believing in the propaganda

534
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:22,599
that has been so strong over the last

535
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,000
several you know hundred plus years and

536
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,359
I if for people that want to get into

537
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,960
this there's an incredible book out

538
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,479
there called The Immortal key and it

539
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,640
really shows the history of when

540
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,759
psychedelics took a left turn and

541
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,960
Christianity took a right turn and you

542
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,278
ended up with this really divisive split

543
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,798
between the Greek way of thinking that

544
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:43,798
scientific sort of proof versus the

545
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:46,679
paleo-christian way of thinking which is

546
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:49,158
really that faithful way they took the

547
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,880
the Rapture out of the experience they

548
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,240
removed all of the Psychedelic

549
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
sacraments they replaced it with the

550
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,278
blood of Christ of course which we all

551
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,360
know how well that did for indigenous

552
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,079
people around the world and uh here we

553
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,278

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,759
really just the tip of the iceberg

599
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,199
because with what you know Paul's got

600
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,879

community right now that have going on

602
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
dragonfly Earth medicine who I hope to

603
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,879
see here later on I've been taking their

604
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,278
capsules I take Paul's capsules Lion's M

605
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,960
but I also take the chaga and the turkey

606
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,679
tail and uh all Corps and a whole

607
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,480
variety of other mushrooms that

608
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,840
dragonfly Earth medicine put into their

609
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,079
capsules so I'm I'm always enjoying both

610
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,119
of those capsules and uh I just can't

611
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,278
say enough about all of these medicinal

612
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,278
mushrooms and the the new tropics and

613
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,440
how they offer you know this

614
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,159
regeneration to your brain and this

615
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,278
elasticity you grow older for memory and

616
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,278
it's just I can't say enough about it I

617
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,720
don't know the most about it so I won't

618
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:37,919
say too too much but there's some very

619
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,600
interesting

620
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,200
conversations uh to be had uh around

621
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,398
this fungus for sure and I thought you

622
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,480
know what getting the macro camera out

623
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:49,639
and starting to shoot it and see it in a

624
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,519
way that I've never seen it before also

625
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,960
just like cannabis really opened my mind

626
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:58,000
to learning more about the mushroom um

627
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,759
and yeah I just uh I can't say enough

628
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,919
about uh about the mushrooms I'm really

629
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,599
excited about the I'm I'm really excited

630
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,720
about the future of mushrooms um we we

631
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,240
don't know anything about it it just

632
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,720
we're kind of going into to mushrooms

633
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,679
like we did cannabis you know

634
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,558
completely just like new and fresh and

635
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,559
it's a mushroom that's all we know um we

636
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,480
know that people call it psilocybin and

637
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,278
now we know that there's a little

638
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,240
nickname called silly and and that's all

639
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:32,038
we know about it but the the some of the

640
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,759
things that I've seen and heard is is

641
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,879
it's our it's the same path that we were

642
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,798
taking with cannabis so when they say

643
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,880
that cannabis is a gateway drug it

644
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:43,319
really is because it's opened our mind

645
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,760
and opened our opportunities to so many

646
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,000
different things and and mushrooms

647
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,359
hopefully can be one of these uh we're

648
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,519
hoping to be able to give them to Colton

649
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,319
because he has migraine headaches and

650
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,558
we've heard so many good stories about

651
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:01,278
it um our friend Dr Sue sisily is doing

652
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:04,158
a lot of research on on a psilocybon and

653
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:07,640
she really believes that if Colton could

654
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,240
access that then then he she thinks that

655
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,600
it would really break through his

656
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,759
migraine headaches and he wouldn't have

657
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:16,879
to take you know Summa triptan and nor

658
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,879
trolene and Gaba Penton and things like

659
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,919
that that they're wanting to prescribe

660
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,399
him for for migraine headaches um so you

661
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,200
know we're really excited for for that

662
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:29,558
legislation to come through and we're

663
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,640
hoping that eventually we'll be able to

664
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:34,398
get involved in that and and understand

665
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,399
a little bit more about psilocybin and

666
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:38,439
mushrooms and stuff like that so well I

667
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:41,439
can tell you that the mushroom the

668
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,080
mushroom is actually excited about the

669
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,159
Turners becoming proponents of the

670
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,720
mushroom because the mushroom has seen

671
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,120
what you've done for the cannabis plants

672
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,440
and I guarantee you it won't be too

673
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,199
different for the mushroom when you say

674
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,038
you jumped in like newbies I was going

675
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,840
to say you did like a triple backflip

676
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,640
off the high high diving board isn't

677
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,439
that usually how the Turners enter a

678
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,480
community we we physically can do that I

679
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,120
mean we are gymnasts so I do

680
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,759
own right that's awesome well I look

681
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,798
forward to sharing the journey with you

682
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,398
guys I love this whole psychedelic

683
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,879
Renaissance that we're in the middle of

684
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:19,278
that I can't help but think that

685
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,360
cannabis had an incredible you know

686
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:24,919
impact on the cracking of the core of

687
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,759
the social fabric that allowed this to

688
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:31,200
start taking place and to start rooting

689
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,879
and it's been a long long long journey

690
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,000
when you think of so many years back our

691
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,159
Gordon wson stepping into Maria samina's

730
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,119
while he he might be the last I heard

731
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,159
from folks in my office was that he was

732
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,239
down in Oregon and it could just be he

733
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,519
was working with the Oregan Sil Theon

734

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,079
pretty heavy trips as an older gentleman

738
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,919
and to me my hats off and I gave him

739
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,798
respect for jumping in and doing it the

740
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,278
right way and of course he's an

741
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:44,558
absolutely impeccable writer that's what

742
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:48,398
he specializes in writing and if you

743
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:50,599
haven't read the omnivores dilemma or um

744
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,719
the the botony of Desire these are all

745
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,240
spectacular books that uh that he has

746
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,038
written R Gordon Watson's article was

747
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,640
called seeking the magic mushroom it was

748
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,759
published in May of 1957 in Life

749
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,759
magazine and you guys can check that out

750
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,960
as well and she's right that is

751
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,919
absolutely the place to start is how to

752
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,200
change your mind I listened to it a

753
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,360
couple months back on Audible it was

754
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,278
awesome I mean I mean getting through

755
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,038
this whole pandemic craziness um almost

756
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:20,880
every one of my clients is currently

757
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:23,000
micro doing in some fashion um with a

758
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,519
macro do thrown in there for good

759
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,159
measure um because it's um it's we have

760
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:32,240
no control over craziness that's going

761
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,120
on in our world so it's um it's a

762
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,079
perfect time to really in investigate

763
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,239
your psyche and uh come to some form of

764
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,918
Happiness from within well you you just

765
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,798
called it because listen life isn't

766
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,519
about figuring out how to stop suffering

767
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:50,000
life is suffering you're going to suffer

768
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,679
throughout the whole thing it's how you

769
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,798
react to your suffering this is the

770
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,559
great trick this is what thick nanot

771
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,440
says in his wonderful book The Art of

772
00:30:57,558 --> 00:30:59,918
Living

773
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,798
if you haven't listened to that book or

774
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,240
read that book this is another amazing

775
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,558
book that will bring you solace in

776
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,839
Western Society we tend to have

777
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:11,798
foundational belief systems that set us

778
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:13,720
up for anguish and pain okay this we

779
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,240
become attached we become attached to

780
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,558
our little dog when our little dog dies

781
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,240
we're shattered we we become attached to

782
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,038
our parents when our parents die we're

783
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,638
shattered well these are there's

784
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,398
different ways of having your belief

785
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:28,759
systems switch so that you once you

786
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,839
don't believe that death is final that

787
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,480
belief system well it opens up a whole

788
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,558
other you know opportunity to to to

789
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,399
remove some of that suffering that or at

790
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:39,839
least some of that reactionary suffering

791
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,319
that you know how we react to our

792
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,879
suffering so that's the big trick in

793
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,240
life and I think I said it recently when

794
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,600
someone asked me what do you think about

795
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,200
this mushroom thing is it just going to

796
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,558
be a big corporate takeover and blah

797
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,159
blah blah blah blah and I said you know

798
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,359
yes and no I mean what I really think

799
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,278
about it is is that it's probably the

800
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:59,519
most important thing in regards to

801
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:01,519
psychology and Psych Psy Psychiatry

802
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,240
being able to remove ourselves from the

803
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,278
pharmaceutical drugs that people are

804
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,000
currently taking messing with brain

805
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,599
chemistries when you have access to

806
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,720
fungi and plants that do it but on a

807
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,839
very different level in a very more

808
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,558
personal sort of Soul seeking level um

809
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,638
you know already with people who are

810
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,519
terminally ill they're finding a single

811
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:23,599
dose of psilocybin uh done and taken the

812
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,038
right way with the right person can give

813
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,319
them instantaneous relief of death

814
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:29,240
because here's the thing when you

815
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,319
realize that death is actually just a

816
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,000
transition just like you're

817
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,759
transitioning your suffering into

818
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,880
happiness just like you transitioned

819
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,359
your fetus into birth uh there's no

820
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,440
death and once you have that revelation

821
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,479
of course you're going to be less

822
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,200
stressed out about death when you have a

823
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,720
complete and total understanding that

824
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,639
death is a complete and total illusion

825
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,159
and it's not really real it's just

826
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:53,638
another transformation so these are

827
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,120
things I think the world desperately

828
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,439
needs right now maybe a little bit more

829
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:02,479
than another four hours of CNN um

830
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,679
but we are but Michael's book also spoke

831
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,278
to the reconnecting that psychedelic

832
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,159
mushrooms do and especially in older

833
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,519
patients and people who are suffering

834
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:14,240
trauma it

835
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:17,558
reconnects nerves and Pathways neural

836
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,440
Pathways in the brain that I think is

837
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:23,519
exponential to human healing especially

838
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,000
during this most trouble time of covid

839
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,798
but especially is going to be needed for

840
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,919
these uh Healthcare work ERS Who as a

841
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,879
combat V I can see the thousand yard

842
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,799
stare in these poor workers my sister's

843
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,440
a nurse and others that are just dealing

844
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:40,918
with death day in and day out uh they're

845
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,480
going to need this therapy as well and

846
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,799
the older patients and those that

847
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,679
survive the damage that's done they're

848
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,599
going to need it for healing especially

849
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,798
mentally yeah it's good that you're

850
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,359
bringing that up Aon it's it's that's

851
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,158
something I was gonna going to chime in

852
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:56,519
on is you know they to me it's like

853
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,440
being in the pocket when you're playing

854
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,000
music with other other instrumentation

855
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,360
you know happening around you you're

856
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,798
you're in the pocket and that opens up

857
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,358
doorways and Pathways to go anywhere you

858
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:10,000
want and do things musically that you

859
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:11,398
could otherwise wouldn't be doing

860
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,358
because you're getting yourself and your

861
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:15,358
mind out of the way and you're allowing

862
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,960
yourself to exist and get in touch with

863
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,279
yourself and the pathways that allow you

864
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,760
to to be so in tune with the things that

865
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,960
you're doing and and things Colin you

866
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,879
you just described a part of this new

867
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,398
movie from Pixar called soul and I don't

868
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,799
know if any of you guys have seen this

869
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:35,000
movie but it's heavy really heavy

870
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,960
there's the guy he's a piano jazz player

871
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and when he goes into the pocket in his

872
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,480
improvisation he disappears and he goes

873
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,398
to a place where the new souls are born

874
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,398
and they call it the pocket he's like

875
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,799
floating in a purple energy just like

876
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:54,358
improvising yeah in in musical terms

877
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,399
like tragus said me playing Black to my

878
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:00,039
face I'm constantly trying to get out of

879
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:02,440
my own way I it's just I'm I'm that's

880
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:04,599
that's what that's my dream is to just

881
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,679
just get myself out of my way so I'm

882
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,880
just channeling these this energy and

883
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,319
these things and it's all about

884
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,000
dexterity and just being in touch with

885
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,519
your your body and that's that's music

886
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,920
in in a sense it's it's it's and it's

887
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,358
also canabo and it's also psilocybin

888
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,519
it's it's it's all these things and and

889
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,480
how that all works um you know is g to

890
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:29,800
be individual for everyone you know but

891
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,760
it but the general ideology of a pocket

892
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,880
um we as musicians speaking in musical

893
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,880
terms we we always talk about this and

894
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,720
it's really really we all talking about

895
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,358
this with with these you know chemicals

896
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:45,439
because it's true it's so true you you

897
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:47,960
really can't get past yourself if you're

898
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,880
thinking about it you're you're never

899
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,159
gonna get it if that's H we using it as

900
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,079
the analogy well when you say I need to

901
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,719
get out of my own way what you're really

902
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,839
saying is I really need to get my ego

903
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,439
off the couch out of the steering wheel

904
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:06,960
out of the driver's seat and that ego

905
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,760
disillusion people enforce this that

906
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,760
they are their egos and that's where

907
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,520
you're also setting yourself up for some

908
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,000
massive massive pain and anguish because

909
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,599
you aren't it's just a it's just a

910
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,039
mental construct that you created

911
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,079
throughout your life based on your

912
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,239
experiences I I wouldn't say that it's

913
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:28,119
nothing because I truly believe the ego

914
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,358
is sort of

915
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,880
the controller it's the value of this

916
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,358
experience if we come from the

917
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,440
everything we come here we're split

918
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,920
we're divided we're we're we're we're

919
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,240
we're fractured we be get to become this

920
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:44,240
single eye and then we go back to the

921
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:45,919
source so this this experience really

922
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,279
probably some of the most valuable

923
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,599
experiences that we have on Earth is

924
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,280
that relationship with building our ego

925
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:56,039
and designing our ego and using our ego

926
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,240
to navigate this three-dimensional

927
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,279
reality that we're currently in

928
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,199
because souls or whatever you want to

929
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,079
call that life energy they don't have

930
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,358
that ability like this is the valuable

931
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,280
Universal all the souls are lining up

932
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:13,598
with their quarters to get a turn at

933
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,200
Earth this is the game that's got the

934
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,800
lineup in the arcade and here we all are

935
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,679
and uh what a joy that we found things

936
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,440
like cannabis we found things like the

937
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,960
psychedelic mushroom thank God for the

938
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,559
people and the proponents who now are

939
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,400
the people here here on this very panel

940
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,920
but when we were growing up we all had

941
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,880
different shoulders of giants while I

942
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,039
mean you know weight and and and Sam

943
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,000
were still there back when we were all

944
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,480
barely a blink in our Daddy's eye but

945
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,280
you know it's a neat thing to have been

946
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,079
able to stand on the shoulders of giants

947
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,040
and to pass on this information and as

948
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,599
fast as information is passing it's

949
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:55,599
still very very very slow and uh

950
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:57,519
nothing's quicker than in my opinion

951
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,960
eating the Flesh of that mushroom

952
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,559
smoking the resin of that cannabis plant

953
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,480
and that is where I really start to

954
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:08,159
gather information and learn and put

955
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,880
things together so thank thank you each

956
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,679
and every one of you for taking this

957
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,318
journey and sharing it with everyone

958
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,358
because uh we're all learning from it

959
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:19,480
there's no doubt just think you know

960
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:21,159
Colton was what Colton was 13 when we

961
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,358
started our cannabis

962
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:26,960
journey and now he's going to be 21 this

963
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:30,759
year we're looking at seven years of

964
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,679
just cannabis reform and it's still not

965
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,200
even there you know we still have in in

966
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,039
in the United States we still have like

967
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,598
19 states that haven't legalized

968
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,440
anything and so now we're starting a

969
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,880
whole new Journey with with psilocybin

970
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,200
trying to get it legalized and I'm like

971
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,318
why is it taking so long when we can get

972
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:53,039
a vaccine for covid within eight months

973
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:56,639
you know it just doesn't make any sense

974
00:38:53,039 --> 00:39:00,920
to me and I don't understand why we have

975
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:04,838
these beautiful plant um

976

977
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,639
ourselves and we are making it illegal

978
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,440
and people are keeping it illegal for

979
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:16,920
what reason I just I can't wrap my my

980
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,838
head around to to let us know just how

981
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,039

that's the reason we do what we do yeah

983
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:25,000

984
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,160
could they're literally shining a

985

992
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,199

993
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,880
thank goodness we have people in the

994
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,399

996
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,000
you know what I've got there's bigger

997
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,119
things for me than to swallow a bunch of

998
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,159
[ __ ] that's being fed to me by a a

999
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:02,000
news person or a news anchor I've got

1000
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,000
this real thing here my 13-year-old son

1001
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,639
who basically just about died in a lake

1002
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,239
and almost drowned and now something

1003
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,879
else isn't right so I don't really have

1004
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,838
time for all this [ __ ] over here and

1005
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,720
that's how you tear through all of that

1006
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:19,799
crap in a very quick uh manner now to me

1007
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,519
I was just as blown away when you know

1008
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,440
people I think it was Chris Christie

1009
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:26,039
that like the dad like approached Chris

1010
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,039
Christie and was like my kid will die

1011
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,920
without this medicine my kid has

1012
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,838
epilepsy and will die without this

1013
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,200
medicine and he was just like yeah no

1014
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:37,159
sorry you can't we can't like right to

1015
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,358
the guy's face even I was just like wow

1016
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:43,078
like it was almost like when Donald

1017
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:46,199
Trump made fun of the guy with the arm

1018
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:48,119
the reporter that was also like a sign

1019
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,118
like oh of course this is going to take

1020
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,838
forever because if he could maintain a

1021
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:55,079
presidency after doing that well then

1022
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:56,920
anything's game it's like of course like

1023
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,440
oh what children in America are dying

1024
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,079
because don't have access to cannabis

1025
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,800
we'll get some synthetic stuff your way

1026
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,400
as soon as we can we just got to wrap up

1027
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,280
these patents make sure that the profit

1028
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,519
margins are approved got to be FDA

1029
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,119
approved you know it's going to take

1030
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,480
seven years unless it's a vaccine for

1031
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,079
covid we'll Hammer that out in nine

1032
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,838
months the same thing let's send

1033
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,079
millions of dollars to other countries

1034
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:21,920
but each American can only get

1035
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:25,800
$600 we but we did the same thing when

1036
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,920
um we we were lobbying in DC one year

1037
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,280
and we went to our representative in

1038
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,800
Colorado Springs and his name is Doug

1039
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,960
Lamborn And that son of a [ __ ] I'm

1040
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,160
telling you he looked straight at at my

1041
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,039
face and said if it's not FDA approved

1042
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:43,000
then there's nothing I can do about it

1043
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,719
and I said can we FastTrack it and he

1044
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,318
said well yeah of course we'll we'll

1045
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,439
sign a bill to FastTrack it and I said

1046
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,159
we will be the face of that bill I said

1047
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,400
we will do anything that it takes to get

1048
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,358
that bill FastTrack and FDA approved and

1049
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,079
I said but what are we supposed to do in

1050
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,358
the

1051
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,318
meantime and and he said there's nothing

1052
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:05,078
I can do about it and I said well my kid

1053
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:08,000
will die without this medicine you know

1054
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:10,720
he he can't take the regular westernized

1055
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,239
medications he's G he's not going to

1056
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:18,039
survive that and he looked at me and he

1057
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:21,759
said that's not my problem oo oh my God

1058
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:24,000
and I went off I was so freaking mad and

1059
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,359
I'm like yes it is your problem it

1060
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,880
absolutely is your problem and I'm like

1061
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:29,519
so you're going to tell me that it's

1062
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,358
okay for me that I'm just supposed to

1063
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,759
let Colton die because this is not an

1064
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,880
FDA approved

1065
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,000
medicine God and I was just I was

1066
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,440
appalled I could not believe it and then

1067
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,800
to to see the the same things happening

1068
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,760
all over the United States you know and

1069
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,559
even in other countries I just I just

1070
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:55,040
don't understand how people can't be

1071
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,680
more compassion compassionate about the

1072
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,480
life of a of an individual know even

1073
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,879
with this Co stuff you know there was so

1074
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,079
many people that said it well if you

1075
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,318
can't survive it then you're not

1076
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,440
supposed to survive it I'm like but you

1077
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,599
know it just stay in your house and I'm

1078
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,159
like but you know Colton makes a

1079
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,880
difference in the world you know he

1080
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:18,799
tries to make a difference in the world

1081
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,480
it's it's what we do and you're telling

1082
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,920
me that his difference that he's made in

1083
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,559
the world isn't worth it anymore that he

1084
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,680
needs to just stay home and not so you

1085
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,960
can't wear mask so Colton can actually

1086
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,358
go out and do the things that he does to

1087
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,720
make your life better but it's the

1088
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:42,119
compassion and the and and just the the

1089
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:45,078
Simplicity of of all of this that just

1090
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:48,960
boggles my mind and I'm just I'm so glad

1091
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:52,000
to be able to move into a a journey in

1092
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,960
my life where I'm more more woke I wish

1093
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,800
that I was even more woke but I used to

1094
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,400
be that D mom and

1095
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,280
now I you know since cannabis saved

1096
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,519
Colton's life I'm looking at other

1097
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,119
things thinking oh my gosh what more is

1098

1106
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,679
quite a story and same thing Colton he

1107
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:36,119
grabbed bball he started using cannabis

1108
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:38,159
I mean um just quite an amazing story

1109
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,480
both of you guys it's it's great he just

1110
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,239
walked in Mike's coming in and work in

1111
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,838
the garden but uh I thought you know

1112
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,118
what jump in here and say hi Mike

1113
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:46,880
because uh yeah happy New Year Mike it's

1114
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,240
good to see you and it's really nice to

1115
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,880
see that you have absolutely kicked

1116
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:55,239
Cancer's ass because I know it had a

1117
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,280
deep grasp on you you were you weren't

1118
00:44:55,239 --> 00:45:00,598
the stage one guy you were deep in

1119
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,000
it well I don't know what stage it would

1120
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:04,480
call it was it was a crucial tumor that

1121
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
needed to be removed and it was

1122
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,480
tenacious because it kept coming back

1123
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,199
and due to its Rarity it's well that's

1124
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,480
why we were tackling it with Canabis

1125
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:13,679
because uh they couldn't figure it out

1126
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,318
they thought cutting it out would be

1127
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,879
good enough but no it's just not they

1128
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,558
removed a rib they removed tumors you've

1129
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,318
had over 26 surgeries M's got quite an

1130
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,000
amazing story and cannabis has since

1131
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:30,719
changed his life completely and uh

1132
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,480
you're on uh RSO daily he makes his own

1133
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,838
uh he gets he went and got his own

1134
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,599
what's the machine he has the extract um

1135
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:40,960
mind blank now mind blank which is

1136
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,359
awesome but um I mean all these little

1137
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,838
things exact extract and and and I've

1138
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,000
even talking with Mike about mushrooms

1139
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:48,599
and stuff and I was going to mention

1140
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,480
that Turner I mean for me um I was

1141
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,640
having bad migrain and cluster headaches

1142
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,599
from my 28t fall and in 2007 I took a

1143
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:58,639
micro dose of mushrooms at

1144
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,280
420 and my headaches never came back I

1145
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,639
used to I couldn't handle my tension

1146
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,920
headaches and stuff like that I mean

1147
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,759
I've been previously using mushrooms in

1148
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,920
the past but I really became medicinal

1149
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,200
when I was going through that time with

1150
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,440
my injuries and mushrooms was that that

1151
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,799
that next step of me being able to move

1152
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,079
forward with what had happened to me so

1153
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,920
definitely go down that pathway micro

1154
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,480
doing is huge when it comes to dealing

1155
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,880
with headaches and migraines for me

1156
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,079
myself and I know lots of testimonials

1157
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,760
that people do the same thing and it's a

1158
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:31,200
great reward so um enjoy your journey

1159
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,880
just a little bit of the time that's it

1160
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,759
that's it guys that's it you know right

1161
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,200
before you uh he came in and introduced

1162
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,079
Mike I was kind of thinking as Wendy was

1163
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,199
talking and a few people in the in the

1164
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:42,760
room were talking about what what it is

1165
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:44,358
this is you know you just can't imagine

1166
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,720
you're like this is my child like what

1167
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:48,480
are you evil and you start thinking and

1168
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,159
I'm sure they're just probably the wrong

1169
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,039
terms to think of it as they're just

1170
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,598
these opposing forces whether it's

1171
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:56,400
Darkness and Light or good and evil try

1172
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,079
to get out of that mentality cuz they're

1173
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,599
really both Wings on the same bird but

1174
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,880
it really is this like opposing energy

1175
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,720
that's built into all of life you know

1176
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,519
all of life entropies all of life dies

1177
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,399
and so you got to just think that

1178
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,920
without that opposing energy there

1179
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,559
couldn't be the other side to the

1180
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,880
opposing energy and it's this sort of

1181
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,359
Journey that we take and you just want

1182
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,720
to you know you want everyone to just

1183
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:24,078
come on all let's get everyone on side

1184
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,919
and it seems to be an impossible factor

1185
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,240
it's it's that there always has to be

1186
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,280
both sides to the coin or the coin

1187
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,719
itself can't exist it seems to be a very

1188
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,880
important part of the illusion that

1189
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,639
certainly on four or five grams of dried

1190
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,000
psilocybin mushrooms you can break

1191
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:41,480
through and experience something far far

1192
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,318
beyond that uh or maybe some LSD I

1193
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,039
remember Sam telling us one time he took

1194
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:48,079
I don't know if it was a 100 or 200 or

1195
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:50,039
however many hits he took back in the

1196
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,800
60s and blacked out there's there are

1197
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:55,440
ways to experience to remove your

1198
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,440
Consciousness from this 5ense prison

1199
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,119
that it's currently locked into to you

1200
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,920
know if you think of psychedelics as a

1201
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,880
pro a prosthetic that can take that

1202
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,960
Consciousness out of this five sense

1203
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:11,160
prison and move it beyond that into this

1204
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,920
you know more wider I I would say view

1205
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:15,159
but really the language isn't there

1206
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,599
because it's beyond our senses but

1207
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:19,358
anyone that's experienced these

1208
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:21,480
substances in Fairly large doses uh will

1209
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:23,239
be up and Downing their head right now

1210
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,039
with a somewhat pale look on their face

1211
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:29,199
and a bit of fright uh in their soul

1212
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:32,079
because uh yeah the ego uh my favorite

1213
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:34,879
teren McKenna quote these compounds do

1214
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,800
not bathe the ego in a cloud of

1215
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,119
certitude that's one of my favorites

1216
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,720
right there from psilocybin in the sands

1217
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,358

to see you and um I just I think it's a

1237
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,199
beautiful representation of the fact

1238
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,200
that you know we can't necessarily

1239
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,719
always uh rely on our government or

1240
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:38,318
medical industry for things and I'm

1241
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:40,480
really thankful that at least we do have

1242
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:43,838
an alternative community of people that

1243
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,920
are turned on and that will go the extra

1244
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:47,519
mile no matter what because karmically

1245
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,960
and their hearts they're right and I'm

1246
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,798
thankful to this community of people on

1247
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,280
and people that are listening because

1248
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:55,280
obviously there's amazing amounts of

1249
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,240
people listening too that are equally as

1250
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,119
powerful so big love and respect to that

1251
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,318
community that keeps this world a better

1252
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,119
place and keeps it taken and I just

1253
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:07,119
think that you know as the Cannabis

1254
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:10,000
culture and having been a part of it for

1255
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,920
um the past 30 years pretty much was

1256
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,679
sounds incredible wow time is totally

1257
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,680
rolling that you know being a part of

1258
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:19,879
the traditional Market made us not look

1259
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,719
towards you know the government made us

1260
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:25,880
not look

1261
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:28,199
towards whatever uh politics lobbying

1262
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,920
anything because just wasn't allowing us

1263
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:31,519
to be able to get the job done and it

1264
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,960
seems like more and more people are

1265
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,639
coming on board and places and things

1266
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,119
are becoming legalized you know and and

1267
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,798
and decriminalized and it's all because

1268
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,000
the medicine is really doing the work

1269
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:45,759
sure there's people behind it there's us

1270
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
cultivating it there's people getting it

1271
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,920
out there totally illegally Against All

1272
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,798
Odds but it's the medicine that that

1273
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,599
changes the people when people people

1274
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:59,759
ingest it that that they feel those

1275
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,119
transitional changes even even

1276
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,440
politicians now so we're becoming more

1277
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,440
intelligent because the food and the

1278
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,798
medicine that we're taking is of higher

1279
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,838
intelligence so it brings our

1280
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:15,039
possibilities up and that's what they

1281
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:18,078
don't want they the them they don't want

1282
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:21,000
that intelligence to thrive and places

1283
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,160
like ases is like a you know Ames

1284
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,480
Institute I don't know if you've talked

1285
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:27,199
about it yet but I mean it's it's like a

1286
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,480
a ground zero spot for

1287
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:32,118
you know normalization and and and maybe

1288
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,559
you could tell us more about and the

1289
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:36,519
bridge The Bridge from from the work

1290
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,200
that we've been doing in the in the in

1291
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:40,920
the black market and the traditional

1292
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:42,598
market and now Ames is really taking it

1293
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,400
Forward Alison I'd love to hear about

1294
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,760
what what you've been up to and what

1295
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,599
what you've been doing lately um I

1296
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,240
mentioned earlier that we're currently

1297
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,599
um well we do all kinds of psychedelics

1298
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:58,639
right now um Dr sis is working on um

1299
00:51:54,599 --> 00:52:01,079
using iasa uh for cancer patients um she

1300
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:03,318
has also put forth um her first

1301
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:07,000
documentation to get approval from the

1302
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:09,079
DEA to utilize iasa she is also working

1303
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,239
with the mckenas um there she's a

1304
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:17,240
steward to their property in Hawaii and

1305
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:20,118
so we will be using iasa from that um

1306
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:22,118
that that community and um as I

1307
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:25,000
mentioned earlier we are currently

1308
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:28,798
working on a study for psilocybin end of

1309
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,798
life um we are trying to bypass a DCM

1310
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:35,599
and and using the right to try rule um

1311
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:38,000
and uh getting uh attorneys involved to

1312
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:41,039
basically Sue on behalf of several of

1313
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,838
our clients to be able to use psilocybin

1314
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:47,440
for end of life um we currently do in

1315
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:49,880
office ketamine assisted Psychotherapy

1316
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:55,000
sessions we do cannabis assisted

1317
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:57,920
Psychotherapy sessions um it's uh I I

1318
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,119
can't I can't tell you guys enough the

1319
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,119
power of the work it's like cannabis was

1320
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:08,358
amazing or is amazing but when you take

1321
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:11,640
these people who are hurt and just have

1322
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:14,039
tried every medication and then you give

1323
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:16,598
them some psychedelics and you see the

1324
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:19,119
change and it's like Marcus is saying

1325
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:22,880
that ego dissolution your ego gets in

1326
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:25,640
the way of whether you know it's um

1327
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:31,480
seeing love or whether it's letting go

1328
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:35,039
of hurt or loss and um with the ego gone

1329
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:38,920
it really allows someone to um see

1330
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:41,519
another side of life and uh and and I'm

1331
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,838
really lucky and so honored every time I

1332
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:46,838
sit with someone on a psychedelic

1333
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:49,558
session or I support someone and either

1334
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:52,920
teaching them how to micro dose um or to

1335
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:56,280
do macro doing um it's it's an honor and

1336
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,798
a privilege to me um it just just it's

1337
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,200
it's kind of like helping like you were

1338
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:05,079
saying Marcus take their soul to a to

1339
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:08,000
like a cleaner lighter um space where

1340
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:10,079
that um the constructs of everyday life

1341
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,798
don't have to

1342
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,640
apply and that's that's that's kind of

1343
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:18,039
what we're doing at as I mean every day

1344
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:20,039
is is different um you know we deal with

1345
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:22,759
with with all different kinds of clients

1346
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:24,719
that are looking for support um I like I

1347
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,520
said I do ketamine in the office and

1348
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,519
then I support micro and macro dosing of

1349
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:32,679
other psychedelics that are not yet

1350
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:36,400
legal and um our goal is to be able to

1351
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:38,358
do psilocybin we are um we have we have

1352
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,318
gone through the MDMA training through

1353
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:44,078
maps and now we're awaiting the DEA to

1354
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:46,039
approve um our site we've gotten all the

1355
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,760
requirements of the refrigerators and

1356
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:50,400
everything that MDMA is supposed to be

1357
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,960
kept in but unfortunately under Trump's

1358
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:57,160
presidency um a lot of those DEA

1359
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:59,039
approvals have um kind of stalled

1360
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:01,558
so we are hoping that with the new

1361
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:03,400
presidential Administration that we will

1362
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:05,880
have more our site will be approved for

1363
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,920

1364
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,960

right this second just to say it but

1383
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:58,318
yeah it was an incredible panel with

1384
00:55:54,679 --> 00:56:00,719
maps just on uh Canabis and cancer and

1385
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:03,279
other plant medicine and and cancer and

1386
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:05,480
just it was just blew my mind to to sit

1387
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,599
with those folks and and just have a

1388
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:14,400
discussion so I feel like wow you know

1389
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:17,160
as much as 2020 has been just so

1390
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,920
incredibly you know whatever it is it's

1391
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:21,279
all of the words I don't even want to

1392
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,358
say one word because it's all of the

1393
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,280
words still the mushrooms are getting

1394
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:29,838
through the melium is grow gr you know

1395
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,319
the seeds are sprouting the plant

1396
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:35,000
medicine is making its way into almost

1397
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:37,798
regular conversation regular dinner

1398
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,480
tables and regular Suburbia like all

1399
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:43,599
over the world and I just think that

1400
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:47,119
this incredible you know time for plant

1401
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,760
medicine and totally we're we're getting

1402
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,680
such empowering messages and and it's

1403
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,599
really giving us a lot of the answers

1404
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:58,078
that we've been searching for that you

1405
00:56:54,599 --> 00:57:02,200
know maybe science and this idealization

1406
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:04,920
of a continually isolating things to

1407
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:07,598
give us the answers of the great magic

1408
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,838
of the unknown of why we're here and why

1409
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,200
we exist and where we're going to and

1410
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,000
where we came from and it just seems

1411
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:17,519
like the plant medicine is doing much

1412
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,960
better than um you know past science

1413
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:21,838
it's definitely reaching the masses I'm

1414
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,318
always surprised when I get like an

1415
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,480
80-year-old Grandma come in with like a

1416

Michael pollen book all Doge eared and

1417
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,440
she's like help me do this take you know

1418
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,400
these little old ladies more so than I

1419
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,720
ever saw in cannabis because these are

1420
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,318
these are old ladies that are not

1421
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,439
necessarily sick but they just want to

1422
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:41,920
know like they want to find peace in

1423
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,798
death they want to find peace with with

1424
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,559
their past um and it's um and they're

1425
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,000
willing they've never some of them have

1426
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,440
never done psychedelics before and they

1427
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,920
just want to like find out what is this

1428
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,000
magic that goes on with looking inside

1429
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,559
the mind and it's really cool it's

1430
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,239
really really cool and and I definitely

1431
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,798
see psychedelics touching the masses a

1432
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:08,358
lot more um since since the acceptance

1433
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,960
of

1434
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:14,119
cannabis yeah that's that's for sure go

1435
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,639
ahead an it's a great healing too uh one

1436
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:20,720
that a lot of our veterans are finding

1437
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:23,639
exponentially uh I've started uh kind of

1438
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:26,199
a a group with loose affiliation with

1439
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,000
various uh veterans from all over the

1440
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:31,000
United States and now we have ones from

1441
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,880
Canada who are joining us uh because

1442
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,079
we're finding not just cannabis is

1443
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,119
helpful but especially working through

1444
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:39,318
our post-traumatic stress to arrive at

1445
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,119
our post-traumatic growth one of the

1446
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:44,318
things we find is definitely

1447
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:49,160
psychedelics of various ones help kill

1448
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:51,199
that ego so that they can get past uh uh

1449
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:53,838
their trauma so that they can finally

1450
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:57,239
arrive at their healing um it it

1451
00:58:53,838 --> 00:59:00,318
definitely is a clear of the pathways

1452
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:03,239
and the blockages for many people I

1453
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:05,719
can't say for all but at the same time

1454
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:10,038
uh these are things that we realize that

1455
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:12,919
cannabis has its place but so does Iain

1456
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:15,480
so does iasa so do all the other

1457
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,760
naturopathic plant medicinein so uh I

1458
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,480
want to give a shout out to my veterans

1459
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,880
Action Council brothers and sisters

1460
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,240
there uh for our continued work because

1461
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,838
that's one of the things we're working

1462
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:29,279
towards in the new year is continuing uh

1463
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:31,000
opening up access especially for

1464
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,960
veterans because we're just a small

1465
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,079
encapsulation of society but such a

1466
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:40,199
concentration of society it's reflection

1467
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:42,079
reflects back so uh we just want to uh

1468
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:44,558
lend our hands and our ears and our

1469
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,960
minds as well I think one of the

1470
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,599
important things we're going to find in

1471
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,039
the next 10 years as well as we do with

1472
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:52,798
everything we we scrub all the culture

1473
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,720
out of it right we do everything in a

1474
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:58,559
very sort of clean style room and I

1475
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:00,480
think that the set and setting and the

1476
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,079
importance of learning that and everyone

1477
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,119
learns that when they have their first

1478
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,880
maybe took too much whatever at the

1479
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:07,760
wrong spot it was kind of like wow that

1480
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,920
was that was certainly not the same as

1481
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,200
it usually is and that was kind of a bad

1482
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,920
experience like I guess taking acid and

1483
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:16,358
going to the bar and playing pool wasn't

1484
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,480
as good of an idea as we thought it was

1485
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:20,078
and so you can see how the set and

1486
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,559
setting and I wonder where that will

1487
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:26,160
take us this set and setting because

1488
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:28,319
will it be in a room with walls and and

1489
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:30,078
ceilings and or will it be outside will

1490
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:32,119
it be more like you know because we have

1491
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,079
these two things we have these aashka

1492
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:36,039
ceremonies that are happening in in

1493
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,839
South America and in Central America and

1494
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,200
they definitely happen in different

1495
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,838
types of Huts they have these

1496
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,960
traditional settings that have been in

1497
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:45,599
place for many many many decades and

1498
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,400
then you have sort of the western

1499
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,079
society's version which we do with

1500
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,440
everything even the way we grow cannabis

1501
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,240
we've scrubbed the entire Terre right

1502
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,000
out of the entire cannabis Growing

1503
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:57,479
Experience which could you imagine ever

1504
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
suggesting that to the wine folk like

1505
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,679
hey we should scrub the terroir out of

1506
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,280
grapes and grow them indoors with like

1507
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:04,759
lights and white poly walls and like

1508
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:09,160
what do you think of that idea you know

1509
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:12,160
like so I hope we don't scrub out that

1510
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:15,038
terar culture from the Psychedelic

1511
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:17,558
experience if that makes sense one of

1512
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:20,119
the things we are working towards right

1513
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:23,039
now in the veterans Action Council is

1514
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:25,400
Sops we started reaching out to Shaman

1515
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,200
and others and realizing that there's a

1516
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:31,880
lot of unfortunate sexual abuse that can

1517
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:34,038
happen in uh these situations Maps has

1518
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,480
put out a situation so we're actually

1519
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:39,039
working on a white paper and Dr Dron I

1520
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,358
would love to have your input and look

1521
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:44,079
over because we're reaching out to the

1522
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:46,838
Native American Shaman Community the the

1523
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:49,480
traditional uh Shaman Community as well

1524
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:51,880
as reaching out to Ms because we realize

1525
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,000
that a lot of people want to IDE and

1526
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,559
want to go there but at the same time

1527
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,519
they don't know how to prep themselves

1528
01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:00,519
where need to be who needs to be there

1529
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:02,719
um you know because people think that a

1530
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:04,920
couple is there but we got wi that a

1531
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,439
particular couple will abuse people

1532
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:11,159
while they're under these psychedelics

1533
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,440
so um we want to work on educating

1534
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:15,679
people so that they can have the

1535
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,119
experience that they desire and not the

1536
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:21,358
one that they get you know tan I I

1537
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,760
usually recommend people so for what I

1538
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:25,880
do like you know there's some um you

1539
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,079
might hear some clinics that do just in

1540
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:33,599
fusions like whe whether it be ketamine

1541
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:37,079
um um or or underground therapists that

1542
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:39,359
do their individual work um but for what

1543
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,318
we do at our Clinic it's absolutely

1544
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,119
imperative to develop a

1545
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:46,719
relationship um over a period of time

1546
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:50,400
with the person that you're going to be

1547
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:53,558
going on this journey with um I work

1548
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,639
with um highly traumatized individuals

1549
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:59,160
who've had years firefighter police

1550
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:02,639
officers people who've been uh raped

1551
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:06,399
multiple times um and those type of

1552
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:10,118
individuals really require uh trust and

1553
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,519
I know Maps um does the two people um in

1554
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,358
our office it's just one therapist but

1555
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:16,358
what we do is that we develop a

1556
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:19,838
therapeutic relationship over a period

1557
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:22,719
of time prior to giving that person

1558
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,278
psychedelics um and sitting with them um

1559
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:28,639
and that

1560
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:31,239
seems that seems for me to help a client

1561
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:34,759
develop that trust but I'm absolutely

1562
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:36,759
open to to reading your paper and um

1563
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:40,160
giving some feedback because I think

1564
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:43,839
that this is in order for anyone to let

1565
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:47,318
go of their ego in an environment they

1566
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:50,558
really need to trust the people that are

1567
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:53,639
going to be the holder of their

1568
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,319
bodies agreed I put my email in the chat

1569
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,719
there so uh if you could reach out I to

1570
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:01,798
uh make contact for that because we just

1571
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,399
want to create a safety document so that

1572
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:07,239
when people have or want to experience

1573
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,480
this this just becomes sort of a go-to

1574
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:11,000
document so they can understand that

1575
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,760
this is the way that it should be done

1576
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,519
so appreciate your input and thoughts

1577
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,640
and there's an energy behind the

1578
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,079
medicine that's being taken to and the

1579
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:21,679
way that it's cultivated and we've

1580
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:24,519
learned through cannabis about conscious

1581
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:26,759
cannabis cultivation and how its effects

1582
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:29,719
from regenerative cannabis into the body

1583
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,480
is more it's easier to assimilate and

1584
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:33,278
when with psychedelic mushrooms I mean

1585
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,679
they could be grown in a super

1586
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:38,880
chemically Laden situation and really

1587
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:41,118
that's not positive for our body nor is

1588
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,760
it positive for the people growing it or

1589
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:46,760
the trip that we're GNA have you the use

1590
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:49,200
of isopropyl in the production of of of

1591
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,960
psychedelic mushrooms is extremely

1592
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,879
harmful to our microbiome and and you

1593
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:56,559
wouldn't want the cultivators to get

1594
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,599
sick in the in in

1595
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:02,880
in the uh you know process of creating a

1596
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:05,960
cure so there's conscious ways of

1597
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,880
creating psychedelics you can do it like

1598
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:10,159
Marcus has been showing wavy caps and

1599
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,000
cyan Essence in the background those are

1600
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,798
uh Woody mushrooms people can create

1601
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,920
Woody patches on their land and create a

1602
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,960
lot of medicine in those areas and I you

1603
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:22,680
know we talk about the the epigenetics

1604
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,519
of the trip it's it's so important where

1605
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:27,519
are

1606
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,519

01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:01,159
but yeah we were you were chipping out

1614
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:02,639
there and I really wanted to hear that I

1615
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:06,318
was going to add to what you were saying

1616
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,960
is is that I am I have I've never in my

1617
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,000
life heard of so many people growing

1618
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,880
mushrooms these little little ladies

1619
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,400
coming in to visit me at the office

1620
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,559
they're growing mushrooms uh every Tom

1621
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,039
Dick and Harry is growing mushrooms at

1622
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,839
this point I live in the Pacific

1623
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:23,119
Northwest so it's very easy or creating

1624
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:24,639
new strains this was what I was gonna

1625
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,160
dragonfly I was going to touch on is

1626
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,480
that what's seeming to happen now is

1627
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:32,000
that people are putting two different

1628
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,679
types of mushrooms in a tub and then how

1629
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,599
would you describe it is that then they

1630
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:38,719
just choose the spores of the big fatty

1631
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:40,920
ones and then they continue to propagate

1632
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:43,278
the big fatty ones but that doesn't

1633
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,680
necessarily mean that the traits of that

1634
01:06:43,278 --> 01:06:50,159
particular mushroom are the best just

1635
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:53,278
because it looks big it's it's okay I

1636
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:55,798
know it's this constant need for bigger

1637
01:06:53,278 --> 01:06:59,440
better quads you're going to look for

1638
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:59,440
quads in in

1639
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:06,199
mushrooms

1640
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:09,079
quads guys doesn't matter it doesn't

1641
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:11,239
matter but star mushrooms listen I

1642
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:12,640
listen I will even add it's it's more

1643
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:14,318
important than that because anyone

1644
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:16,440
that's ever grown mushrooms knows that

1645
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,679
when you take a trip of the little

1646
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,880
aborts the little mushrooms that don't

1647
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:22,679
make it the Caps that don't open up

1648
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,079
they're tiny little babies well listen

1649
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,639
primordial heads listen those things I

1650
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:28,359
swear to God I don't know if this is a

1651
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:30,400
fact but this is what it seems like when

1652
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:32,838
you eat them it seems as though they've

1653
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,559
produced all of their psilocybin and

1654
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:37,278
psilocin when they're this big and then

1655
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:39,519
you eat a gram of those and it's

1656
01:07:37,278 --> 01:07:41,599
literally like eating five grams of like

1657
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,719
big huge giant you know three foot

1658
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,720
mushrooms or whatever because especially

1659
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:47,759
if they're fresh the stem but is the

1660
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:50,318
most my partner is agreeing with what

1661
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,079
you're saying yeah me too my psychedelic

1662
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:55,719
Journeys have agreed with what I'm

1663
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:57,920
saying in the Pacific Northwest there's

1664
01:07:55,719 --> 01:08:00,278
a lot of foraging that goes on here you

1665
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,240
know in addition to the Sans we also

1666
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:05,880
have spring and fall ovoids um which is

1667
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:07,639
another type of psychedelic mushroom and

1668
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,798
then of course on the coast we have the

1669
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:13,239
azer resence um so we're in like the

1670
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:16,079
mecca here in the Pacific Northwest for

1671
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:17,719
mushrooms and so Seattle has gone on the

1672
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,119
attack to kill the mushrooms because

1673
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:21,039
they used to have wood chips all over

1674
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:23,838
the city and psychedelic mushrooms grew

1675
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,039
all over the city that's West

1676
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:28,158
Vancouver over

1677
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:29,960
they still all of West Vancouver certain

1678
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,960
cities are adding fungicides to their

1679
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:36,000
wood chips so that they do not grow the

1680
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,798
mushroom but that's most that's mostly

1681
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,399
up in Bellingham we're hearing

1682
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:43,158
Bellingham fungicide in the mushro in

1683
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:45,399
the in the chips but but here in Seattle

1684
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:47,318
it hasn't really the fungicide hasn't

1685
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:51,278
really taken over it's still really good

1686
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:54,520
my partner is a master forager um and so

1687
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:57,359
he spends his fall and spring um out in

1688
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:59,679
the wood chips well he's invited up to

1689
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,560
Vancouver to come spend it with us this

1690
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,640
next fall because we're doing the very

1691
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,400
same thing we're we're pulling morals

1692
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,400
we're pulling yellow foots which you see

1693
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:11,759
behind me all varieties of gold

1694
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:15,119
shantells Lobster mushrooms cauliflower

1695
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:17,520
mushrooms uh bow lights um a whole

1696
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:21,079
variety of wonderful edible mushrooms I

1697
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:23,920
ate my fair share of edible mushrooms

1698
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:26,119
this fall it was insane we would just go

1699
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,440
every single weekend Shout to Shawn

1700
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:30,079
Michaels uh the very same Shawn Michaels

1701
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:32,519
that did the pointilism work on my

1702
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:35,198
bubble man uh guy that sits on the

1703
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:38,159
tricomes he's uh been forging also for

1704
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:40,798
the last 20 years here uh fungi and

1705
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,278
plant medicine so it's uh it's a huge

1706
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:44,039
bonus but you guys should come up and we

1707
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:46,120
should uh we should share some pick and

1708
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:48,238
stories and some experiences someone

1709
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:51,519
someone needs to come to Illinois and

1710
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:53,879
help us we have tons of mushrooms here I

1711
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,880
mean Illinois has medicinal polypores on

1712
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,119
your trees in Illinois

1713
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,719
oh my gosh and we have no I mean we have

1714
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:03,800
70 Acres of just Woods um that my family

1715
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:06,920
owns and you know we we're looking we're

1716
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:10,560
doing we mushroom hunt um but mushroom

1717
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:12,800
hunting morels which go for like $500 a

1718
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:16,159
pound around here because everyone loves

1719
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,480
them so much but there's we we look at

1720
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,279
all these other little mushrooms that

1721
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:22,639
are around and we're like which ones can

1722
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:25,158
we eat which ones can we not um it's

1723
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:28,159
just it's incredible there's and we live

1724
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:31,238
um the area that we live in is the where

1725
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:33,000
the Three Rivers come together so it's

1726
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:35,759
really moist here and there's a lot of

1727
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,560
humidity um so someone needs to come and

1728
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:42,760
show this area get yourself some spores

1729
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:46,159
and uh Spore some of your hardwood bark

1730
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:48,520
what about a special show on mushrooms

1731
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:51,119
both edible and psychedelic Where We

1732
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:54,199
Gather some of the great minds and we

1733
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:55,880
educate ourselves like that yeah and

1734
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:57,879
that would be awesome I mean I don't

1735
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,960
know how many times that I've gotten on

1736
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,400
to to Hash church and I've been like I

1737
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,679
don't know enough about cannabis and you

1738
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:06,719
guys all blow my mind um simplify it for

1739
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:08,920
us you know we're just now getting into

1740
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,679
this we need to know which mushrooms are

1741
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:13,800
good which mushrooms are bad where to

1742
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:16,560
find them you know and and just just

1743
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:19,480
simplify it just for the the the Layman

1744
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:23,679
so we can get more good good if you're a

1745
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:26,000
human bad if you're a bug anyone okay

1746
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:28,359
and not found in Illinois either

1747
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,679
and I was wanting to say that you know

1748
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:33,719
the

1749
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:36,359
incredible um uh positive reactions that

1750
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:38,960
we've gotten from compounding cannabis

1751
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:41,639
with medicinal mushrooms so adding that

1752
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,679
in there the incredible importance of

1753
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:46,800
these adaptogens going together and and

1754
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,679
creating medicine together yet there's

1755
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,360
some Moc canic caps that was really fun

1756
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,319
you

1757
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:55,599
knowy turkey tail Lion's man all of

1758
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:57,799
those U my partner just said it's

1759
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,600
actually illegal to possess legal it's

1760
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:04,440
legal it is legal to possess spores in

1761
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:07,199
Illinois oh so you canful than the

1762
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:10,799
fruiting body so that's a good thing to

1763
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:13,678
know very powerful is it is it true that

1764
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:16,679
scores are are legal in all 50 states to

1765
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:19,319
hold no they're illegal in California

1766
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:22,199
they're illegal in California is it true

1767
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:24,559
that spores are the only other living

1768
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:27,238
creature to leave Earth aside from

1769
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,320
humans and float in space trapped in

1770
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:32,919
Cosmic radiation pressure just putting

1771
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:34,519
it out there uh water bears as well oh

1772
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,158
water oh right what do they called it

1773
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,480

1774
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:41,158
just took those things to the Moon

1775

1776
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:45,719
living organism those weird little

1777
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:48,399
creatures that have the snout mouths

1778
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:50,920

1779
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:53,519
traga no

1780
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:55,679
nobody when we which

1781
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,760
one yes

1782
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,239
exactly

1783
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:02,199
at [ __ ] so it's a small group it's a

1784
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,479
small group six-legged creatures that

1785
01:13:02,198 --> 01:13:06,678
can survive in space but yeah it' be

1786
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,959
great to know about uh if if actually

1787
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:11,359
scores do actually travel through space

1788
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,158
because you know how long have they been

1789
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:16,519
traveling yeah and where did they come

1790
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:20,439
from we need all these questions

1791
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:22,960
answered and also can you imagine space

1792
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:24,399
nice I I want some space mushrooms as

1793
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,000
well for all we know we have them

1794
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:28,839
already we are space mushrooms let's be

1795
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,119
real like we're pretending right now

1796
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:35,159
that we're not ATN have you ever tried

1797
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:37,119
this the the uh cyano

1798
01:13:35,158 --> 01:13:39,238
franciscans the the Psychedelic

1799
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:41,039
mushrooms that are found in Oakland I'm

1800
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:43,039
pretty sure it's like in a Jack In The

1801
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:46,000
Box parking lot or something like that

1802
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:48,679
like there a newer variety of of

1803
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,439
psychedelics that's been discovered in

1804
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:54,199
the last maybe 10 years now and I'm sure

1805
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:56,879
and there wasn't a clinical name for

1806
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:59,960
them because they were new but we've you

1807
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,719
know taken them and and had some uh

1808
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,239
chance to try and grow them but it

1809
01:14:01,719 --> 01:14:04,198
wasn't Su have you heard do you know

1810
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:06,638
about the

1811
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:08,799
Oakland I have heard of it I have not

1812
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:11,279
tried it and if anybody who sees me who

1813
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,159
knows me and wants to and has access to

1814
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:15,920
I would love to try them and I'm pretty

1815
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,238
sure if someone's watching the chat from

1816
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,239
what I I've been told on the on the

1817
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:22,039
street you know it's called the cyano

1818
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:24,439
franciscans but it probably should be

1819
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:28,359
called the cyano they're mushrooms that

1820
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:30,559
you don't they actually try they try you

1821
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:32,198
that's the way it usually goes for sure

1822
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:36,960
I mean and with psychedelics there's

1823
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:38,759
there's there's manure loving uh cubus

1824
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,960
and a lot of them are manure loving and

1825
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,760
those are a lot of the ones that are

1826
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:49,119
grown indoors or you can cultivate them

1827
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:51,639
in greenh houses yeah the the produc how

1828
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:54,399
would you uh rate the the high of that

1829
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:55,760
mushroom was it a solid ego kill which

1830
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:59,519
mushroom

1831
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:03,560
the Oakland Francis Francis uh it was

1832
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:08,560
very uh visually pleasing very visually

1833
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:11,520
pleasing and uh had a you know super

1834
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,480
silly note to it it was kind of like a

1835
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:17,040
little bit reminiscent to the to the

1836
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:19,759
cyan Essence to the very very sparkly

1837
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:23,399
more sparkly than I'd had mushrooms in a

1838
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,920
long time lots of like really activated

1839

Bist those are blue bells and grow also

1843

in and around like Maple Ridge and stuff

1844
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:41,279
in British

1845
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:43,480
Columbia yeah I've tried those before

1846
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:45,439

1847
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:46,479
ones we had recently was the albino

just eat on them like you

1854
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:07,039
know I feel like I should be welcoming

1855
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,639
both skunkman Sam and best friend Farms

1856
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,639
into the room I feel like I kind of [ __ ]

1857
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:12,719
the bed on welcoming those two guys to

1858
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:16,400
the room and I apologize I got sucked

1859
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:18,800
into the mushroom talk can you hear me I

1860
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:20,439
can hear you you you're like the guy on

1861
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,320
the cell phone commercial can you hear

1862
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:23,919
me

1863
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:27,000
now he patented all the mushrooms wanted

1864
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:30,039
to say one thing and that is we've been

1865
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,800
through a lot of this before the psychic

1866
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:37,920
psychedelic revolution in the 60s and I

1867
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:40,719
think our big mistake then was okay we

1868
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,719
took psych does we did kill our ego that

1869
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:47,719
served a purpose to let us understand

1870
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:51,239
ourselves better but uh the trouble was

1871
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:55,158
uh back then lar used to preach turn on

1872
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:59,000
tune in and drop out we don't want to

1873
01:16:55,158 --> 01:17:01,879
drop out we want to turn in turn on

1874
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,920
excuse me tune in and take

1875
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:09,079
over really that's the goal is to take

1876
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:13,520
over because if we don't we have the

1877
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:15,679
morons in [ __ ] power and uh we we're

1878
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,639
stupid enough we don't need even

1879
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:22,520
stupider people telling us what to

1880
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:26,039
do ain't that so I just want to tell you

1881
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,320
go ahead kill your ego turn on t in but

1882
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:30,760
take

1883
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:31,599
over and overgrow don't forget to spread

1884
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:34,360
the

1885
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,440
overgrow my ciate the

1886
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:39,519
system yeah let let let the mushrooms

1887
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,279
and the plant medicine take over and we

1888
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:46,920
just stewarded it into the melium we

1889
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:49,279
like to spread melium everywhere well

1890
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,000
said hey I want to throw in a thought

1891
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:55,840
here I I love the conversation about

1892
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,920
killing the ego um and yes that was my

1893
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,520
experience with psychedelics uh earlier

1894
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:03,399
in my life but I came to realize that

1895
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,840
actually it's not so much about killing

1896
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:08,638
the ego it's about coming to understand

1897
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:12,360
that the ego doesn't have to be in

1898
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:15,679
charge uh ego does serve a function in

1899
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:19,719
certain ways it's but to me psychedelics

1900
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:22,359
took the illusion away that all of this

1901
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:26,000
physical plain reality is what's really

1902
01:18:22,359 --> 01:18:29,920
important um and I it's been years since

1903
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,520
I've used any psychedelics um I I get

1904
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:37,639
really high on love these days uh love

1905
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:40,159
of my life love of nature I I'm

1906
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:42,719
fortunate enough to shelter in place on

1907
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:45,158
a farm where I can walk the land and

1908
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,319
really drink deeply of how beautiful it

1909
01:18:45,158 --> 01:18:51,359
is when it rains finally in

1910
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:53,960
California um and I get really high that

1911
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:57,639
way because psychedelics early in my

1912
01:18:53,960 --> 01:19:00,880
life helped me recognized that all of

1913
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:03,639
the stress and the fear and the anger

1914
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:06,400
that I could find in my life was an

1915
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:09,679
illusion and it was based on attachment

1916
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:11,759
as as Marcus alluded to earlier so I I

1917
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:14,399
really want to encourage people to yes

1918
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:17,360
use use psychedelics to help you see the

1919
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:20,559
illusion that that seems so real that we

1920
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:24,359
call life because yes life is suffering

1921
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:27,639
and uh but what's true is within each of

1922
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:31,039
us there's this place that psychedelics

1923
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:33,840
helps you experience where you can carry

1924
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:37,479
it forward in your life dayt day moment

1925
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:41,560
to moment without the need to constantly

1926
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:43,879
micro do or to macro do and I highly

1927
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,000
encourage anyone that hasn't tried the

1928
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:50,119
Psychedelic experience to do so but also

1929
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:55,039
to recognize that it's helping you see

1930
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:57,359
truth as versus is truth itself

1931
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:59,600

another here that was a big part of of

2017

2018
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,760
inspiration we all gave one another and

2028
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,600
yeah so thanks I just wanted to just to

2029
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,559
bring him up a little because you know

2030
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:05,440
he is was a special part of hash

2031
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,360
Church oh yeah he was definitely a fan

2032
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:11,279
favorite lots of people always loved uh

2033
01:24:08,359 --> 01:24:13,799
listening to what uh hereso had to share

2034
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:15,439
and a thinker innovator you know

2035
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,679
definitely was playing around where you

2036
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:20,678
know we got people going off about tech

2037
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:22,199
in the in the chat right now upset that

2038
01:24:20,679 --> 01:24:24,480
certain texts haven't been shared but

2039
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:26,839
Horatio's texts you know were unable to

2040
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,919
shared because of the danger they they

2041
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,600
posed to to people playing around with

2042
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,119
them and he didn't want to be giving

2043
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,560
Tech to people and then having them hurt

2044
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:38,319
themselves and so you know you can see

2045
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:40,600
that it's not just black and white you

2046
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:42,198
know people want Tech and so they feel

2047
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:45,280
that complaining about it is how they

2048
01:24:42,198 --> 01:24:46,919
can get it but it's not it's not always

2049
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:48,599
it doesn't always work out that way so

2050
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:51,079
you know I I remember talking to him

2051
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,079
about you know when I went and filmed

2052
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:55,399
Horatio's inner sanctum and how

2053
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:56,880
controlling he was in that aspect and he

2054
01:24:55,399 --> 01:25:00,559
really wanted to make sure that I didn't

2055
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:03,239
share anything um that you know maybe

2056
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,600
people would get a hold of and and and

2057
01:25:03,238 --> 01:25:07,079
hurt themselves doing so you know that

2058
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,639
that that was some chemistry that he was

2059
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:12,439
playing around with there and uh I kind

2060
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:14,159
of respected it that he that he wanted

2061
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:16,599
to do it that way you know I personally

2062
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:18,799
was very honored to be able to go into

2063
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,520

that they make um I um I I purchased

2097
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:02,359
some jewelry as a way of supporting the

2098
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:04,520
family um and so she still she still has

2099
01:27:02,359 --> 01:27:08,519
those pieces not all of them went for

2100
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:10,159
auction um but uh and story behind that

2101
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,600
and the jewelry that was made was

2102
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,319
actually was pretty cool because it was

2103
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:19,239
a new form of attack that he had

2104
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:21,439
actually came up with by fusing two

2105
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:24,198
compounds together to make the jewelry

2106
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:26,839
that no one had done before so it's a

2107
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:29,158
completely new as you know how ratio was

2108
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:31,960
he came up with something so amazingly

2109
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:34,000
and Innovative he was able to fume these

2110
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,679
together I saw the material I saw what

2111
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,158
was going on with it I seen the molds

2112
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,760
and everything um this Julie is

2113
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:41,759
something special and it's be great for

2114
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,520
the family to move on because she'll be

2115
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,199
something that Mar will be working on

2116
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,119
and his daughter maybe in the future but

2117
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:49,719

2148
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:12,560
shank some mushroom going hard been

2149
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,800
going hard on the uh the mushrooms

2150
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:19,239
lately probably taking up to three

2151
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:22,880
heaping tablespoons of lion M Lion's man

2152
01:29:19,238 --> 01:29:27,319
three heaping tablespoons of uh turkey

2153
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:30,079
tail and and um just started a a 12-day

2154
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:33,198
water cleanse and I'm just going to go

2155
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:36,238
hard with the mushrooms and the Miso and

2156
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:40,079
just do water mushrooms and miso for 12

2157
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:42,559
days and try to get reset I feel like

2158
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:46,198
coming into my 50th year I felt like it

2159
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:49,119
was really important to well having

2160
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:52,319
passed my 50th year felt like it was

2161
01:29:49,118 --> 01:29:54,559
probably a good thing to uh do some

2162
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:56,840
cleansing and and and some sometimes

2163
01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:00,760
when it's quiet it's it's a good time to

2164
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:03,719
go within and realize that food and

2165
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:05,400
drinking and and external and all these

2166
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:08,158
things that we take into our lives

2167
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:10,238
really take up a lot of time and energy

2168
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:13,079
and when we sort of pull back from that

2169
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:15,599
and and do things that you know are good

2170
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:17,359
for our body I think that we learn more

2171
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,400
about ourselves and we learn more about

2172
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:24,279
what's going on um you know in the world

2173
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:25,920
today so coming into 2021 I feel like um

2174
01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:28,319
you know and probably end it with a

2175
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,719
really beautiful intentional Journey

2176
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:34,279
some type of plant medicine

2177
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:36,960
Journey so loving those mushrooms also

2178
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:40,439
thanks uh Marcus I've been taking so

2179
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,800
much oil it's been awesome it's it's

2180
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:46,238
it's just so healing on so many levels

2181
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:48,360
to mix the medicinal mushrooms with the

2182
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:51,678
Cannabis I feel like they were made for

2183
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:53,519
each other and and a lot of those

2184
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,039
mushrooms in there are foraged from our

2185
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,639
for

2186
01:30:55,039 --> 01:31:01,479
and we live on the edge of a Wilderness

2187
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:05,319
so it's like eating longevity

2188
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:05,319
enzymes you know with

2189
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:15,480
longevity longevity enzymes you know the

2190
01:31:09,238 --> 01:31:19,039
poly like who gets artist con and amadu

2191
01:31:15,479 --> 01:31:21,319
and fobes and the red belted conch and

2192
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:23,560
and slices we slice them up and make

2193
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:27,000
make oil out of them I mean the oil of

2194
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:29,639
the mushrooms itself is

2195
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,719
just yeah just that there it is red

2196
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:35,960
belted polypore slice it up and just

2197
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:39,480
stuff the pots and I'll P I'll pull a

2198
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:41,359
polypore off like that slice it with a a

2199
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:43,759
knife to a little thing and chew on it

2200
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:47,118
while I'm and then if you put the slices

2201
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:49,800
together overnight in a basket they will

2202
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:53,118
melate on top of each other they just

2203
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:55,400
continue to grow it's insane so if you

2204
01:31:53,118 --> 01:31:57,759
took that and you sliced it it's like

2205
01:31:55,399 --> 01:32:00,559
you could make a thousand of them from

2206
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,520
that they just want to continue to grow

2207
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,960
and they seem to be everywhere and it's

2208
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:07,199
good to have some of the bark still on

2209
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:10,399
the mushroom because the bark is healing

2210
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:14,359
as well and the cambium layer I mean the

2211
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:16,920
mushroom is is a fruit of the cambium

2212
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:19,158
layer of the tree yeah that mycelium is

2213
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:21,600
where it's attached to the lifeblood of

2214
01:32:19,158 --> 01:32:24,079
the tree so all the intelligence of the

2215
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:26,360
tree and all of the history of the tree

2216
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:30,079
and all the everything that the tree is

2217
01:32:26,359 --> 01:32:30,079
uptaken is in

2218
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:36,920
that that Marcus is holding that then we

2219
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:39,479
can absorb because we can't absorb the

2220
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:43,039
tree but we can absorb the mushroom so

2221
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:47,238
it's a brid and uh that dried mushroom

2222
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:50,479
that Marcus had is uh still has a a lot

2223
01:32:47,238 --> 01:32:53,359
of the medicine in it so it does store

2224
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:55,238
in they're dry but it's really hard it's

2225
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,000
nearly impossible possible to cut you

2226
01:32:55,238 --> 01:32:58,759
could probably burn that

2227
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,439
Marcus I mean I don't know whether you

2228
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:05,159
want to burn that one or not but those

2229
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:08,359
uh those mushrooms when uh when dried

2230
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:11,118
also burn so like this is and also the

2231
01:33:08,359 --> 01:33:14,559
the smelling the smoke from a polypore

2232
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:16,639
like chaga and amadu the Tinder conch

2233
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:19,600
smelling the smoke is healing to the

2234
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:22,639
body and a lot of native peoples used

2235
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:26,280
that as an incense in their uh in their

2236
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:28,199
smoke and so you can smoke this polypore

2237
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:32,599
if you take a little slice of it and put

2238
01:33:28,198 --> 01:33:35,319
it in a vitam mix and kind of uh make it

2239
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:37,400
it goes furry when you try and blend it

2240
01:33:35,319 --> 01:33:39,840
it doesn't like chip up you can mix it

2241
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:42,879
with cannabis and smoke it in a

2242
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:46,199
doobie and it's really really good for

2243
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:49,118
you it's a fantastic you know fungicide

2244
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:51,960
it's really helpful for damp lung issues

2245
01:33:49,118 --> 01:33:54,000
people with consumption and and a lot of

2246
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:56,319
the native people had it you know like

2247
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,279
Josh was saying in their medicine bag

2248
01:33:56,319 --> 01:34:02,279
because it helps rid pathogenic fungi so

2249
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:05,679
we always burn it through our green

2250
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:07,679
houses we burn them in our basements we

2251
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,719
really you know take advantage of of

2252
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,639
this cleansing uh here's another really

2253
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:14,840
awesome example same thing that Marcus

2254
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:18,159
was showing and this is off of birch and

2255
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,199
it I mean uh the the red belted conch is

2256
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:22,679
the phomopsis pinac cola which is

2257
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:24,599
generally off a pine tree but this is

2258
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:26,399
from a birch tree

2259
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,360
so this would have different compounds

2260
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:31,439
because the Birch has betulinic acid in

2261
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:34,158
it so we we really are stoked when we

2262
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:37,158
find mushrooms off a birch tree it's our

2263
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:40,359
goal to we eat the Birch we eat the the

2264
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:42,799
bark of the Birch we drink the birch

2265
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:46,639
bark because you can't eat

2266
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:50,800
it I mean you can do a lot of things but

2267
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,800
this is on Birch this chagga

2268
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,399
beautiful today really became a mushroom

2269
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,840
church I'm going to have to do like a

2270
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:03,158
I'm going to have to start a mushroom

2271
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:05,719
show where we share mushroom information

2272
01:35:03,158 --> 01:35:09,079
and do maybe not every week by any means

2273
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:11,118
but be good to do a mushroom maybe I

2274
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:13,559
could ask all of you to help collect

2275
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:15,118
some names and contact information for

2276
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:19,560
the people that would want would should

2277
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:21,238
be in you know invited such a discussion

2278
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:22,800
yeah I think that between the people

2279
01:35:21,238 --> 01:35:24,959
just on the panel here right now we

2280
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,239
could probably put together another 50

2281
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,880
to 100 names pretty easily and we could

2282
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:33,279
encourage the growing of mushrooms

2283
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,239
together with cannabis especially for

2284
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:39,198
the backyard and homeg grower because a

2285
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,519
lot of medicinal mushrooms like myi

2286
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:44,638
lions

2287
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:45,920
M uh what's Rishi those three are just

2288
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:48,159
ones that come off the head that they

2289
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,239
can grow they grow off wood so you can

2290
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:53,399
if if people are clearing their Forest

2291
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:56,238
blah blah their fire you know whatever

2292
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:59,399
you can plug trees and put them in the

2293
01:35:56,238 --> 01:36:01,959
dirt underneath your cannabis so the

2294
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:04,238
trees will fruit these medicinal

2295
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:06,439
mushrooms underneath your cannabis and

2296
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:08,959
they'll breathe together right because

2297
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:12,359
the mushrooms are breathing in oxygen

2298
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,960
and exhaling carbon dioxide with the

2299
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:17,599
plant which is taking it in it's a

2300
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:20,480
beautiful C cyclical and then if you

2301
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,920
plant your mushrooms with uh micro isal

2302
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:25,638
fungi then you just have this completely

2303
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:28,079
living unbelievable medicine that will

2304
01:36:25,639 --> 01:36:30,520
it'll transform your life that this is

2305
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:32,840
what we should do is try and challenge

2306
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:35,040
each other to and it wouldn't fruit

2307
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:37,039
maybe this year so that's a real thing

2308
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,560
you know when you when you plug a tree

2309
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:41,198
may or may not fruit but it might fruit

2310
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:43,600
in the fall if we do it proper in the

2311
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:46,359
spring you know and we've done that

2312
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:48,960
before and why not take on a a higher

2313
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:52,679
intelligence like I think that what we

2314
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:55,198
continue to do is this circle game

2315
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:57,158
almost like a durable inside of a cage

2316
01:36:55,198 --> 01:37:00,158
that we continue to look towards

2317
01:36:57,158 --> 01:37:02,839
government and individuals and humans

2318
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:06,359
for better information like humans

2319
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:09,000
evolve together we are all on this

2320
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:11,839
incredible Collective Consciousness we

2321
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,238
need to look towards other beings such

2322
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:17,279
as plant medicines for us to evolve to

2323
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:20,678
that next level we can't be looking

2324
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:21,639
towards other humans we need to be you

2325
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:24,359
know

2326
01:37:21,639 --> 01:37:27,359
evolving with the medicine that that are

2327
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:29,799
here for us and I just love it that uh

2328
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:32,238
you know the mycelium continues to pop

2329
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:36,679
up in all little cities all over the

2330
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:38,959
place and become decriminalized and and

2331
01:37:36,679 --> 01:37:42,199
and she's making her way you know the

2332
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:44,599
Cannabis sort of opened the door uh for

2333
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:46,519
all the rest of the plant medicines to

2334
01:37:44,599 --> 01:37:48,199
to walk through it and some cannabis

2335
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:50,840
Farms are transforming just to

2336
01:37:48,198 --> 01:37:52,960
psilocybin production true in Oregon I

2337
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,960
know this and also you can grow

2338
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,198
mushrooms

2339
01:37:54,960 --> 01:38:00,719
do in a greenhouse right next to a

2340
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:03,879
cannabis greenhouse and you can exchange

2341
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:06,359
the air between the two greenh houses

2342
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:08,960
you know and then you would have you

2343
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:10,679
know and and science May someone's gonna

2344
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:14,000
try and tell you it's bad but it's good

2345
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:16,319
because SP go onto the tricomes someone

2346
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,719
will prove that this is good and those

2347
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:21,840
spores be on the tricomes as we consume

2348
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:24,439
them and so it'll be more it'll be third

2349
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:27,599
instead of secondary metabolize it'll be

2350
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:28,839
like what's the third tertiary yeah that

2351
01:38:27,599 --> 01:38:30,719
tertiary

2352
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,760
metabolites just and then it will go

2353
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,198
into quads which goes back to what we

2354
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:38,199
were originally talking about which is

2355
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:38,198
really the go you know which which

2356
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:49,039
is well the conversation take one

2357
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:50,840
there's uh there's also the aspect I

2358
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:52,679
have actually people send me stuff all

2359
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,880
the time like samples and stuff of

2360
01:38:52,679 --> 01:38:56,359
things that they do and some of the most

2361
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,679
interesting samples I have are people

2362
01:38:56,359 --> 01:39:01,598
who are micro doing decarbox cannabis

2363
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:04,840
and mushrooms and

2364
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:08,159
caps for for like a daily you know

2365
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:10,800
booster um and uh yeah that's that's

2366
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:14,039
that's what we do Allison so we've been

2367
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,440
compounding mushrooms and cannabis oils

2368
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:19,439
both THC CBD

2369
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:22,198
CBG you know doing isolates full

2370
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:24,879
spectrum all of it and you know for a

2371
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:27,000
very long time you know realized that

2372
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:29,760
you know the isolates were not helping

2373
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,359
we already knew that as far as the the

2374
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:37,920
the studies go but you you put it onto

2375
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:42,158
patients no full spectrum full full soak

2376
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:44,840
oil uh we do a a coconut olive oil and

2377
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:47,799
like 17 different mushrooms and it seems

2378
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:49,840
to just help people with everything why

2379
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:52,679
not throw it out there we always give

2380
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,840
people the recipes we tell people do it

2381
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:56,319
yourself

2382
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,520
here's these amazing plants that that

2383
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:01,198
are showing themselves and and we're

2384
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,320
becoming more educated from them so

2385
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:06,279
let's let's make them in our own

2386
01:40:03,319 --> 01:40:09,158
kitchens let's let's heal each other so

2387
01:40:06,279 --> 01:40:11,359
possible yeah yeah I love it that you've

2388
01:40:09,158 --> 01:40:13,359
got somebody who's doing that as well

2389
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:16,639
the more people who are compounding

2390
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:19,079
these incredible intelligent uh plants

2391
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:21,639
together and mushrooms are just going to

2392
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:24,000
be helping us all out it just it just

2393
01:40:21,639 --> 01:40:25,039
helps raise us all up

2394
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,599
it's pretty

2395
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:28,599
cool pretty pretty

2396
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:35,079
cool yeah I think a lot of people are

2397
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:37,399
starting to take you know into account

2398
01:40:35,079 --> 01:40:41,399
the the power of what you know specific

2399
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:46,279
tpin can do um in specific uh varietal

2400
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:49,839
tpine um you know uh that you you know

2401
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:54,238
you can really blend two different types

2402
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:56,639
of experiences that um are quite

2403
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:58,559
complimentary to one another and quite

2404
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:02,000
really really beneficial to your every

2405
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,400
day you know and it's really it's it's

2406
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,679
interesting because we really are

2407
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:08,598
starting to touch on a very large pallet

2408
01:41:06,679 --> 01:41:10,599
and it starts to get into this idea of

2409
01:41:08,599 --> 01:41:13,440
of biohacking and and better

2410
01:41:10,599 --> 01:41:15,960
understanding what you can do um for

2411
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:18,399
yourself and being more self-sufficient

2412
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,960
and better understanding your own body

2413
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:22,920
um and then the energy that you can

2414
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:25,158
connect to um by understanding these

2415
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:27,679
compound BS together and that's

2416
01:41:25,158 --> 01:41:30,158
something that um it's really beautiful

2417
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:33,719
to see you know everyone around us kind

2418
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:35,799
of learning and wanting to learn um and

2419
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:36,840
as you kind of Illustrated before Kelly

2420
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:39,800
it's

2421
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:43,639
it's it's so it's you know we have

2422
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:46,840
abundance around us fine yeah they small

2423
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:49,599
right it's really important that um you

2424
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:52,319
know we we connect with these medicines

2425
01:41:49,599 --> 01:41:54,000
in a really responsible and really um

2426
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:56,599
you know

2427
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:00,118
a really a way that allows us to really

2428
01:41:56,599 --> 01:42:00,119
get in touch with with what's around

2429
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:11,960
us come on your researchers on these CHP

2430
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:13,760
Frontiers we need you yeah I mean I

2431
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:16,399
think in terms of tpin there's a lot of

2432
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,320
work that's being done I know you know

2433
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:20,118
there's there's there's quite a few

2434
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:21,639
people that are that are on the verge of

2435
01:42:20,118 --> 01:42:23,719
releasing a lot of different products

2436
01:42:21,639 --> 01:42:25,520
that incorporate I know teren mckennon's

2437
01:42:23,719 --> 01:42:28,560
been working on some stuff that that

2438
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:30,679
incorporates terpenes um I think a lot

2439
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,239
of people are really working on this you

2440
01:42:30,679 --> 01:42:34,719
know it's just a matter of time right

2441
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:37,000
now and better understanding how we can

2442
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:40,118
scale a lot of this stuff so it's it

2443
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,719
it's available for everyone um cultivar

2444
01:42:40,118 --> 01:42:45,559
specific tpin are very hard to scale um

2445
01:42:43,719 --> 01:42:47,359
it's a it's you know the process in

2446
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,800
which you need to go through to isolate

2447
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:52,759
them you know your returns are just not

2448
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:54,800
there yet um however you know there

2449
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,639
there are the ways we can achieve what

2450
01:42:54,800 --> 01:43:00,480
we're trying to do and and the turpins

2451
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:04,000
that are involved in in mushrooms you

2452
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:08,118
know the the the TR Turpin and the tpin

2453
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,079
S and the sesa tpin I always love to say

2454
01:43:08,118 --> 01:43:12,880
just just for fun because I came to this

2455
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:14,439
on on a journey is that is you know when

2456
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,880
if you take all the crayons and you melt

2457
01:43:14,439 --> 01:43:20,519
them all together they're always Brown I

2458
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,520
always feel like

2459
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:34,400
oh no broke up mushrooms breaking

2460
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:36,560
up really think about that oh

2461
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:40,839
no we're

2462
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:43,159
uh sorry it's okay just said all the

2463
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:46,560
Crayons yes all the Crayons Together

2464
01:43:43,158 --> 01:43:48,039
made Brown and yeah so when you and then

2465
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,760
you you take all the Crayons you melt

2466
01:43:48,039 --> 01:43:51,639
them they make brown and then if you

2467
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,840
take all the Tarpin in the world and you

2468
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:57,079
melt them all together smells like

2469
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:59,560
mushrooms so I feel like there's really

2470
01:43:57,079 --> 01:44:06,359
some awesome

2471
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:09,080
um uh Horizons to expand on in tpine h

2472
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:15,000
production uh in mushrooms I just sent

2473
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:19,079
Marcus a h um article called TR uh

2474
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:23,238
traversing the fungal

2475
01:44:19,079 --> 01:44:24,158
Tome I got it the tome

2476
01:44:23,238 --> 01:44:27,598
the

2477
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:30,238
terpenome one of them their government

2478
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:33,679
SS the fungal terpenome I want to

2479
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:36,959
Traverse the fungal tome in fact that is

2480
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:39,480
100% the name of the show by the way

2481
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:42,279
traversing the fungal terpenome you just

2482
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:44,718
named the show okay so that's the name

2483
01:44:42,279 --> 01:44:46,960
of it that's not even a joke that's

2484
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:50,359
happening for

2485
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:53,689
sure wow I just can't believe how great

2486
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:57,359
that is it rolls off the tongue so

2487
01:44:53,689 --> 01:45:01,039
[Laughter]

2488
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:02,759
eloquently [ __ ] I love you guys great we

2489
01:45:01,039 --> 01:45:04,560
got a lot of people in the chat room

2490
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,360
listening and chatting away I don't know

2491
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:10,560
how many of you guys are visiting the

2492
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:12,679
chat room but uh there's a solid 400

2493
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,440
plus people in there chatting away got a

2494
01:45:12,679 --> 01:45:17,520
couple of good conversations going on

2495
01:45:14,439 --> 01:45:17,519
it's a lot of the old

2496
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:23,719
hardcores OG's go ahead when we Ally

2497
01:45:22,118 --> 01:45:28,759
with with

2498
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:35,359
Fi we're we're creating a bridge we're

2499
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:37,920
helping our own fungi and bacterial

2500
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:42,238
microbiome have

2501
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:44,920
communication uh back to our very DNA

2502
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:48,919
how we are able to uptake these things

2503
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:53,639
like I love the quote that we're

2504
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:57,399
99.9% identical as far as our DNA and 99

2505
01:45:53,639 --> 01:46:00,279
.9% different as far as our

2506
01:45:57,399 --> 01:46:02,198
microbiome and I was reading last night

2507
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:07,639
that we have

2508
01:46:02,198 --> 01:46:10,079
380 trillion viruses or pathogens living

2509
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:13,599
in our body at all times it's called The

2510
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:17,519
Vi the the vome just look up

2511
01:46:13,599 --> 01:46:19,520
vome online on the W on you know on then

2512
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:23,880
you'll find

2513
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:27,480
out yeah so so the the more that we can

2514
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:29,520
Ally with these incredibly intelligent

2515
01:46:27,479 --> 01:46:33,479
beneficial

2516
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:37,280
microbiology spores fungi it's going to

2517
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:39,479
help us rise up and help create a higher

2518
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:41,679
Consciousness like I was saying before

2519
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:44,118
because because they're so easily

2520
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:47,520
available for us to uptake they're just

2521
01:46:44,118 --> 01:46:50,880
right there and and and they communicate

2522
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:53,599
with our interior microbiome so so

2523
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,800
easily and our brain you know they say

2524
01:46:53,599 --> 01:46:58,039
you know trust your gut because your gut

2525
01:46:55,800 --> 01:47:01,039
maybe is more like your brain than your

2526
01:46:58,039 --> 01:47:03,599
brain because there's so many more

2527
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:06,158
organisms and microorganisms and

2528
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:08,520
thinking you know thinking and with your

2529
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:11,000
receptors and your neurology so your

2530
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:13,440
microbiome is and your nutrition and

2531
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:17,679
your connection to soil is equally as

2532
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:19,638
important as micro doing and as taking

2533
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:23,359
cannabis to treat your ailment so

2534
01:47:19,639 --> 01:47:25,480
without the full picture of of nutrition

2535
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:27,519
and Earth connection and schans

2536
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:29,959
resonance and without these things that

2537
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:32,599
connect us to the longevity of the earth

2538
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:36,039
the earth is always going to be here we

2539
01:47:32,599 --> 01:47:38,079
in our smartness you know we may go away

2540
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:40,880
very easy we always say we're trying to

2541
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:42,679
save the Earth it's so funny like we're

2542
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,800
trying to save ourselves people the

2543
01:47:42,679 --> 01:47:47,639
Earth is trying to save us and we really

2544
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:50,119
need to listen because the Earth has the

2545
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:53,599
answers the only

2546
01:47:50,118 --> 01:47:56,198
on and Detour really quickly that we're

2547
01:47:53,599 --> 01:47:58,000
talking about our own microbiome we also

2548
01:47:56,198 --> 01:48:00,678
need to talk about these cultivated

2549
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:03,000
plant medicines microbiome the

2550
01:48:00,679 --> 01:48:05,079
endophytic system within the Cannabis

2551
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,439
also the endophytic system within the

2552
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:10,479
mushrooms the endic system within all of

2553
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:12,919
the vines that we're taking and making

2554
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:15,479
medicine out of we need these medicines

2555
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:17,960
to be incredibly intelligent so we can

2556
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:20,399
gather that information you know people

2557
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:23,158
have bad trips on mushrooms not just

2558
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:25,960
because they are um thought it a good

2559
01:48:23,158 --> 01:48:29,158
idea to go to the movies or you know had

2560
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:32,239
a bad epigenetic situation but also they

2561
01:48:29,158 --> 01:48:34,000
took bad mushrooms the same as cannabis

2562
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:37,079
we all know what it's like to take a

2563
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:40,319
really big hit of some chemi weed it

2564
01:48:37,079 --> 01:48:44,599
just spins you it's horrible so it's not

2565
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:48,519
just any mushroom is good for you or

2566
01:48:44,599 --> 01:48:51,880
any is good for you we need to really

2567
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:55,480
your source and know your farmer ask

2568
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:59,599
your farmer to rise above and create

2569
01:48:55,479 --> 01:49:02,000
intelligent medicine rise above yeah

2570
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:04,679
rise up

2571
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:08,118
Hi Rise

2572
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:08,118
Up ca why

2573
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:17,560
not yeah actually so go ahead into my

2574
01:49:15,238 --> 01:49:19,839
regimen actually it's it makes perfect

2575
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:20,800
sense the conversation for even into the

2576
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,560
organic

2577
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:27,079
indoor uh I was taught how to make

2578
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,480
melium Flats out west from soilscape

2579
01:49:27,079 --> 01:49:31,198
Solutions

2580
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:33,238
friends and I've been using that for

2581
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:36,118
yeah Sam and Natalie and I've been using

2582
01:49:33,238 --> 01:49:39,359
that method for probably seven plus

2583
01:49:36,118 --> 01:49:41,719
years in a row and I get great fungal

2584
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:44,598
flat results on a pretty good Rhythm and

2585
01:49:41,719 --> 01:49:47,560
it really without being scientific about

2586
01:49:44,599 --> 01:49:49,679
it it opens up my tpin and my oils I get

2587
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:52,199
great fraction on the test back we've

2588
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:54,118
done and it seems like even back from

2589
01:49:52,198 --> 01:49:56,279
the extra actor friends like ancient

2590
01:49:54,118 --> 01:49:58,479
green for instance those friends that

2591
01:49:56,279 --> 01:50:02,599
were seeing better high quality results

2592
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:04,759
out of it and full tarping profile and

2593
01:50:02,599 --> 01:50:08,719
just amazing results from the mushrooms

2594
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:12,119
into the soil life for regenerative so

2595
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:15,639
on r on repeat for

2596
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:15,639
us that's what's

2597
01:50:16,039 --> 01:50:21,439
up that is what's up got to shout out my

2598
01:50:19,719 --> 01:50:25,039
six-year-old who I'm taking care of

2599
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:27,359
today as my wife is off having a little

2600
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:29,679
rest and relaxation he's been incredible

2601
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:33,158
and has not bothered me a single time

2602
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:36,158
just taking taking care of himself shut

2603
01:50:33,158 --> 01:50:38,519
I have the new Co Mouse for 2021 for all

2604
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:40,759
you smokers so you got you got a hole

2605
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:44,079
here so you can smoke your joint and

2606
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:47,079
when you're finished I had these custom

2607
01:50:44,078 --> 01:50:50,759
made and uh there you

2608
01:50:47,078 --> 01:50:53,519
go this is the co M for

2609
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:55,400
2021 was actually um

2610
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:59,239
girlfriend's mother who came up with the

2611
01:50:55,399 --> 01:51:01,559
idea and um got to be safe out there for

2612
01:50:59,238 --> 01:51:02,479
2021 right you got still be able to puff

2613
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,800
so this way you don't have to take off

2614
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:08,839
your mask your

2615
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:10,199
fatty or just go to a restaurant just go

2616
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:11,360
to a restaurant because it doesn't

2617
01:51:10,198 --> 01:51:12,799
matter how many people are in the

2618
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:15,078
restaurant you're just allowed to take

2619
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,920
your mask off when you go in there there

2620
01:51:15,078 --> 01:51:20,759
you go but it was it was just the I had

2621
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,279
42 delivered to the door so some people

2622
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,639
are getting these in the mail as be your

2623
01:51:22,279 --> 01:51:30,039
20 21 present

2624
01:51:25,639 --> 01:51:31,719
nice yes that is hilarious DK trades

2625
01:51:30,039 --> 01:51:34,760
says that's hilarious John you make them

2626
01:51:31,719 --> 01:51:36,599
in big mouths for people like me well

2627
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:38,039
actually the prototypes we can only put

2628
01:51:36,599 --> 01:51:40,119
pinners in there I'm like I need to be

2629
01:51:38,039 --> 01:51:42,078
able to put a joint in there so I should

2630
01:51:40,118 --> 01:51:43,759
what I said a big pen just give me a

2631
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:45,479
like enough so I could put like a big

2632
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,800
big pen in there and she laughed but

2633
01:51:45,479 --> 01:51:48,839
that's the size that you need take a

2634
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,920
smokey fatty right oh my God that looks

2635
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:53,199
like a sharpie yeah that's what that's

2636
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:55,639
what worked

2637
01:51:53,198 --> 01:51:56,839
so because my first ones I had had

2638
01:51:55,639 --> 01:51:59,118
stains in the front because I was

2639
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:01,319
smoking with it so she was laughing so

2640
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:02,960
she came up with the idea of making us

2641
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:05,960
yeah and there's different prototypes

2642
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:07,560
but uh you know be inventive for 2021

2643
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,279
whatever you're going to do and and

2644
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:11,920
spread the word about cannabis and this

2645
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:14,439
is I have a full bandana that I can go

2646
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:18,599
into the bank with that has the whole

2647
01:52:14,439 --> 01:52:23,399
thing all right I have to ask Sam why is

2648
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:26,039
your guy backwards is he okay is is Cat

2649
01:52:23,399 --> 01:52:26,039
in the Hat

2650
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:35,560
okay now he's gone oh [ __ ] now I've done

2651
01:52:32,439 --> 01:52:35,559
it now you've done it

2652
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:43,078
at no more oh oh he's got his mask on

2653
01:52:39,078 --> 01:52:46,039
he's got his mask on Oh my he he doesn't

2654
01:52:43,078 --> 01:52:49,359
want to get a computer

2655
01:52:46,039 --> 01:52:53,399
virus oh remember boys and girls it's

2656
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:55,639
not a dad joke until it's full grown

2657
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:58,559
so what's uh going on in Amsterdam there

2658
01:52:55,639 --> 01:53:00,840
Sam is the uh is covid ripping through

2659
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:02,840
your friends and family or is it really

2660
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:09,159
not that you don't see it too

2661
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:11,760
much uh I I I saw it around and uh uh

2662
01:53:09,158 --> 01:53:13,799
but I think Amsterdam itself must be

2663
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,719
getting worse because all the

2664
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:19,840
restaurants are closed all the schools

2665
01:53:15,719 --> 01:53:23,920
are closed so yeah it's not doing so

2666
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:27,520
right I I have a question about Spectrum

2667
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:33,239
it it's always like the holy gray full

2668
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:36,560
spectrum but uh I mean I always thought

2669
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:39,559
that for smoking anyway what you want is

2670
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:42,800
THC you don't really want the other

2671
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:46,639
conoids you may want particular Turpin

2672
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:52,199
that you enjoy whether it's a mirene for

2673
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:54,760
Punch or loline for up but uh I I I

2674
01:53:52,198 --> 01:53:59,439
always always hear about full spectrum

2675
01:53:54,760 --> 01:54:02,639
like it's the Holy Grail but it's I I

2676
01:53:59,439 --> 01:54:05,359
just don't see it for for recreational

2677
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:07,159
use I really don't see it well because

2678
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:10,279
your Holy Grail is

2679
01:54:07,158 --> 01:54:12,439
THC with lots of turps so the thing

2680
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:15,158
about cannabis is that everyone has a

2681
01:54:12,439 --> 01:54:17,799
different Holy Grail and I also will say

2682
01:54:15,158 --> 01:54:19,719
that when I heard that I also thought I

2683
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:21,840
always think this when I hear people say

2684
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:24,639
oh you know iets are no good I think

2685
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:27,078
okay just a second time out um what

2686
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:29,520
about uh you know someone like Haley

2687
01:54:27,078 --> 01:54:32,238
Rose who has this you know neurological

2688
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:34,679
disorder super sensitive they created

2689
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:36,479
the Haley's Comet for high CBD had

2690
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:37,719
certain ratios I'm sure John could go on

2691
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:39,919
for hours about it because he has a

2692
01:54:37,719 --> 01:54:42,239
close relationship with them but what

2693
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,319
happened was it worked it worked it

2694
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:46,439
worked it didn't work it didn't work

2695
01:54:44,319 --> 01:54:48,118
anymore like whatever happened something

2696
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:49,719
happened in the terar something happened

2697
01:54:48,118 --> 01:54:51,920
in the grow something happened in the

2698
01:54:49,719 --> 01:54:53,000
genetics where things just changed a

2699
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:55,319
little bit

2700
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,279
produced different things and now all of

2701
01:54:55,319 --> 01:54:59,118
a sudden it wasn't working anymore so I

2702
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:00,759
always thought that a value would be

2703
01:54:59,118 --> 01:55:03,359
like listen obviously want we want to

2704
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,920
take the whole plant apart so we we can

2705
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:07,279
actually decipher through our own

2706
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:09,679
bioassays what it is that's happening is

2707
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:12,319
this you know this full spectrum versus

2708
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:14,359
microns of hash versus certain ones put

2709
01:55:12,319 --> 01:55:16,599
together with other tpin from different

2710
01:55:14,359 --> 01:55:18,839
just let's do it all let's dive into

2711
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:21,520
this as deep as we possibly can and

2712
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:24,360
uncover all these complexities so that

2713
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:26,639
we can a which we always all at least

2714
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:28,679
claim that the patients are the most

2715
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:30,279
important we can send that data over to

2716
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:32,560
patients and be like look if you're

2717
01:55:30,279 --> 01:55:34,880
someone like Haley and you require a

2718
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:37,280
company to monomolecular eyesee and

2719
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:39,159
isolate every compound so they can build

2720
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:42,519
it back to something that they' are

2721
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:45,000
copying from a full spectrum state of

2722
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:46,800
perspective like a of a of a plant

2723
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,238
they've done the full lab test now

2724
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,960
they're going to take all their monom

2725
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:51,839
moleculars and tpine fractions and

2726
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:53,560
they're going to put that back together

2727
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:55,719
the best that they can to the point

2728
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:57,679
where it never changes so that someone

2729
01:55:55,719 --> 01:55:59,840
with a neurological disorder or maybe

2730
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:02,239
even someone like Colton who has super

2731
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:04,880
sensitivities in in the intestinal

2732
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:07,559
region any little amount of anything

2733
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:11,400
that's off he's going to feel that like

2734
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:13,199
strong so there value of monomolecular

2735
01:56:11,399 --> 01:56:15,759
there's the and there's also the value

2736
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:18,359
that we can take it all apart do I mean

2737
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:20,079
the first time Sam put a bowl of pure

2738
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:22,519
THC in my bullshire I thought it was

2739
01:56:20,078 --> 01:56:24,519
neat I smoked it but then you know was

2740
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:25,960
all ready to be excited about it and he

2741
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:27,480
was like well how was it how was it how

2742
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:30,560
was it right just right in your face

2743
01:56:27,479 --> 01:56:32,198
super excited like well I guess in a

2744
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:34,039
sense it was a little one-dimensional

2745
01:56:32,198 --> 01:56:36,719
and then hitting it with that one single

2746
01:56:34,039 --> 01:56:39,800
tpine that wasn't even cannabis derived

2747
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:42,480
just to experience that sort of whoa

2748
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:44,159
this is different to me it's all

2749
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:45,919
valuable we should never get caught up

2750
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:48,719
in our divisions of course the Holy

2751
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,319
Grail is everything it's all whatever

2752
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,920
perspective you're going down that can

2753
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:55,118
be your Holy Grail and all facilitate

2754
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:57,679
you getting as far down that road as

2755
01:56:55,118 --> 01:56:59,279
possible but let's not [ __ ] on all the

2756
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:01,920
other roads because there's so many of

2757
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:04,078
them so Sam we know what your road is we

2758
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,679
appreciate your road many of us have

2759
01:57:04,078 --> 01:57:07,960
traveled your road thanks to you

2760
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:10,840
pioneering and breaking ground and

2761
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:14,078
putting that road in for many of us so

2762
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:16,840
huge thanks for that but also thanks to

2763
01:57:14,078 --> 01:57:19,960
people like Colton who are discovering

2764
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:21,480
New Roads for for for different people

2765
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:24,960
uh in different times in different

2766
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:27,439
experiences so that's how we have we

2767
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,719
have discovered that roads is definitely

2768
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:31,839
the best uh analogy to go there because

2769
01:57:29,719 --> 01:57:34,198
we always say that you know a person's

2770
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:37,199
canab endocannabinoid system is like a

2771
01:57:34,198 --> 01:57:38,960
road and every road has potholes in it

2772
01:57:37,198 --> 01:57:41,158
so you have to figure out you know what

2773
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,639
you need to fill those potholes make

2774
01:57:41,158 --> 01:57:45,000
sure that you don't you know if you add

2775
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:46,319
too much then it gets the row gets bumpy

2776
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,880
you don't get enough you don't fill

2777
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:51,359
those potholes uh but we discovered that

2778
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:54,359
you know there are you know can there

2779
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:56,759
are canabo that I can't have so there's

2780
01:57:54,359 --> 01:57:59,519
this cannabinoid called

2781
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:01,360
thcv uh which is an appetite suppressant

2782
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,679
so first off Whoever thought of weed

2783
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:05,880
that didn't give you the munchies uh

2784
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:08,239
that that you know when we first figured

2785
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:10,560
that out that blew my mind uh but it's

2786
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:12,718
an appetite suppressant so for people

2787
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:14,880
with diabetes who just want to lose

2788
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:17,078
weight and I also hear that it's working

2789
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:19,078
really well for people with uh

2790
01:58:17,078 --> 01:58:21,519
post-traumatic stress disorder uh

2791
01:58:19,078 --> 01:58:23,759
they're using it with great success but

2792
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:26,840
it's an heti suppressant so someone like

2793
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:29,719
me who has a wasting syndrome uh I can't

2794
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:32,520
have thcb so there are you know

2795
01:58:29,719 --> 01:58:34,679
cannabinoids that people you know should

2796
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:38,440
be looking at and analyzing and deciding

2797
01:58:34,679 --> 01:58:40,199
you know is this what's best for me uh

2798
01:58:38,439 --> 01:58:42,839
because there are you know some canapino

2799
01:58:40,198 --> 01:58:44,559
that people either can't handle or can't

2800
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:46,360
have and we need to know that

2801
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:48,560
information as patients because if we're

2802
01:58:46,359 --> 01:58:50,759
taking this as a medicine we need to

2803
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:54,480
know what everything that we're putting

2804
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:56,199
into our bodies is doing to our bodies

2805
01:58:54,479 --> 01:59:00,799
we need that information we need to know

2806
01:58:56,198 --> 01:59:04,759
that I absolutely agree with you and uh

2807
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:08,360
I I it would I want to empower you to

2808
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:12,760
the most degree to get the combination

2809
01:59:08,359 --> 01:59:15,598
or turpine or or cannaboid that benefits

2810
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:18,920
you and none of the ones that

2811
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:20,599
don't exactly right and I and I think

2812
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:21,800
that that that's what our trial and

2813
01:59:20,599 --> 01:59:24,520
error has been through this whole

2814
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:27,279
journey is that you know we we were the

2815
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:28,960
full spectrum family we we got into

2816
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:30,880
cannabis and everybody was say full

2817
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:34,239
spectrum full spectrum full spectrum and

2818
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:36,560
we love that um you know CBG has done a

2819
01:59:34,238 --> 01:59:39,319
lot of good for a lot of people in CBN

2820
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:42,520
and we we understand that situation but

2821
01:59:39,319 --> 01:59:45,238
we also understand it as a medicine too

2822
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:49,119
and that specific combinations or

2823
01:59:45,238 --> 01:59:53,399
specific turpins or specific canabo um

2824
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:56,759
do have do set harm to other people um

2825
01:59:53,399 --> 02:00:00,679
and we we discovered that on accident um

2826
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:04,199
by colson's um medicine and you know

2827
02:00:00,679 --> 02:00:07,840
getting a strain to to for for him that

2828
02:00:04,198 --> 02:00:09,799
had a lot of thcv in it which cannabis

2829
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:12,719
doesn't have a lot of thtv in it but

2830
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:16,599
this is this this was one strain and I

2831
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:19,158
and I can't remember what it was um

2832
02:00:16,599 --> 02:00:22,480
African it might have been I have no

2833
02:00:19,158 --> 02:00:25,799
idea I mean we what happened

2834
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:28,678
it may have been it we we just know that

2835
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:31,360
whatever what the difference in the

2836
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:35,078
medicine that he was taking was

2837
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:36,639
thcv and that was it and we we noticed

2838
02:00:35,078 --> 02:00:39,039
that when we gave him Vapes that had

2839
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:42,440
thcv in it that he would start losing

2840
02:00:39,039 --> 02:00:44,359
weight and he lost it rapidly um and

2841
02:00:42,439 --> 02:00:46,638
that was one of the scariest things for

2842
02:00:44,359 --> 02:00:49,639
me is because trying to get him to 100

2843
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:52,359
pounds is difficult uh trying to

2844
02:00:49,639 --> 02:00:56,279
maintain that is even worse well it was

2845
02:00:52,359 --> 02:00:58,799
difficult now I'm 115 yeah um because we

2846
02:00:56,279 --> 02:01:02,198
figured that kind of stuff out um and we

2847
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:04,599
we've tried to avoid thcv at all costs

2848
02:01:02,198 --> 02:01:06,598
um because for like for him it doesn't

2849
02:01:04,599 --> 02:01:09,679
work now like he said for people with

2850
02:01:06,599 --> 02:01:11,960
diabetes it's excellent um I would love

2851
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:15,399
for somebody to just make a pill that

2852
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:17,039
was thcv for weight loss I mean that

2853
02:01:15,399 --> 02:01:20,879
whoever does that is going to be a

2854
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:24,238
billionaire um they're working on it

2855
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:26,199
good good good send me some send me

2856
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:28,919
some but you

2857
02:01:26,198 --> 02:01:31,960
know I think the Frankenstein I think

2858
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:35,679
frankensteining it sometimes we we have

2859
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:38,078
to understand that um it's okay to do

2860
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:40,319
because we do have to we have certain

2861
02:01:38,078 --> 02:01:44,880
patients that need certain things and

2862
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:47,880
then we also want to have other canono

2863
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:51,239
involved in and tping involved um and

2864
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:53,960
flavonoids we we want everything but we

2865
02:01:51,238 --> 02:01:57,078
want specific too um so I think that

2866
02:01:53,960 --> 02:02:02,000
there is a a place for

2867
02:01:57,078 --> 02:02:04,679
everyone and if you're taking the I if

2868
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:08,800
you're taking the

2869
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:11,800
FL you'll get if if you're smoking the

2870
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:15,320
flavonoids you're de you're deactivating

2871
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:18,800
them a short note that's all excuse

2872
02:02:15,319 --> 02:02:21,359
me I just wanted to say that I think all

2873
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,199
of these points are really important and

2874
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:24,719
what's happen happening is we're missing

2875
02:02:23,198 --> 02:02:28,559
an incredible

2876
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:31,039
bridge and that's allowing the plant and

2877
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:34,800
the cultivator to have those

2878
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:38,800
conversations for the greater people we

2879
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:41,199
we I I feel like when science continues

2880
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:42,880
to and this is just like a side of it

2881
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:44,559
you know we we we have all different

2882
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:47,078
things and I respect everybody in the

2883
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:50,960
conversation for sure but I got to stick

2884
02:02:47,078 --> 02:02:53,279
up for the plant here in that she has

2885
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:55,439
these capabili when we talk about full

2886
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:59,078
spectrum we're talking about that full

2887
02:02:55,439 --> 02:03:00,719
plant what that full plant has to offer

2888
02:02:59,078 --> 02:03:03,238
and we've learned and you all have

2889
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:05,319
learned that thcv is not good for Colton

2890
02:03:03,238 --> 02:03:08,759
well that's really easy to get a

2891
02:03:05,319 --> 02:03:10,519
varietal that doesn't have thcv it's

2892
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:13,159
really easy to get a varietal that

2893
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:16,320
doesn't have the CBG it's easy to get a

2894
02:03:13,158 --> 02:03:19,319
varietal that does that has exactly the

2895
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:22,439
tpine ratios everything that you're

2896
02:03:19,319 --> 02:03:25,920
looking for and and and then we have the

2897
02:03:22,439 --> 02:03:28,479
plant grow it and by saying that we

2898
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:31,199
synthesize it and take this tpine and

2899
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:34,158
that tpine and we mix it together and

2900
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:35,598
we're humans and we're scientists and

2901
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:38,519
we're going to do it better than the

2902
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:42,039
plant can I just really feel like we're

2903
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:44,520
missing something very important here

2904
02:03:42,039 --> 02:03:47,599
that of course we need science to say

2905
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:50,159
yeah this chirine is good this canaban

2906
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:52,279
oid was helpful this wasn't but let's

2907
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:54,879
allow the plant to create create the

2908
02:03:52,279 --> 02:03:58,000
medicine for the people rather than

2909
02:03:54,880 --> 02:04:00,279
science Laboratories creating it let's

2910
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,840
get that beautiful connection to the

2911
02:04:00,279 --> 02:04:05,759
Growers and to the the strains that you

2912
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:08,639
need colon that can be grown

2913
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:10,400
regeneratively that can be done well

2914
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:13,199
it's the problem is is that you're in

2915
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:16,920
Illinois and there's still all this sort

2916
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:19,759
of you know heavy duty oppression on the

2917
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:22,719
plant that needs to be lifted we need to

2918
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:25,800
allow the plant to do what she does and

2919
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:27,520
stop outsmarting her and ourselves and

2920
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:29,679
thinking that we're going to do a better

2921
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:31,880
job that's all I'm saying and I'm

2922
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:34,078
sticking up for the plant in in in that

2923
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:36,319
way so when we talk about full spectrum

2924
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:38,319
we're talking about the fullness of that

2925
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:40,599
particular plant we're using that whole

2926
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:44,519
plant that whole

2927
02:04:40,599 --> 02:04:47,199
varietal and we agree with that uh and

2928
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:50,000
we we think that a whole plant a whole

2929
02:04:47,198 --> 02:04:53,078
spectrum is is very beneficial for so

2930
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:55,198
many people um but we also see the other

2931
02:04:53,078 --> 02:04:59,359
side of it you know we if we could find

2932
02:04:55,198 --> 02:05:02,039
a plant that would be great for Colton

2933
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:03,920
um and we we wouldn't have to take it

2934
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:07,439
apart and we wouldn't have to figure out

2935
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:10,359
what chirpin or what uh Cano work and

2936
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:13,279
what they what don't in his body um and

2937
02:05:10,359 --> 02:05:16,039
that's the only thing that that we grew

2938
02:05:13,279 --> 02:05:18,559
for his medicine uh for people with

2939
02:05:16,039 --> 02:05:20,880
crohn's disease then that would be so

2940
02:05:18,559 --> 02:05:23,960
amazing but there but like you said

2941
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:26,760
everybody's different everybody is

2942
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:29,158
different um and they have their own

2943
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:33,280
potholes and you know we have to learn

2944
02:05:29,158 --> 02:05:36,078
how to film uh cannabis I I I I've taken

2945
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:40,039
cannabis a million times and I don't see

2946
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:42,198
the benefits in me that I see in him

2947
02:05:40,039 --> 02:05:44,920
because it just doesn't work as well for

2948
02:05:42,198 --> 02:05:46,879
me for whatever I mean I'm I'm a pretty

2949
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:50,719
healthy person so I don't really have a

2950
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:53,840
whole lot going on um but you know we

2951
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:55,760
everybody is so different and I wish

2952
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:59,319
that we could just figure

2953
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:01,480
out like you know like Tylenol I mean

2954
02:05:59,319 --> 02:06:05,000
and I and I know that this is like

2955
02:06:01,479 --> 02:06:08,000
insane but you take 500 milligrams of

2956
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:10,880
Tylenol and your headache goes away um

2957
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,679
for most people but with this plant it's

2958
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:15,480
just not that way and it there's just so

2959
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:19,039
many varieties and so many things that

2960
02:06:15,479 --> 02:06:21,598
you can do with it and it's just there's

2961
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:23,118
we're we're just at the cusp of of

2962
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:26,039
learning everything that this plant can

2963
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:28,558
do and and what is in it you know we

2964
02:06:26,039 --> 02:06:31,238
still probably have not discovered

2965
02:06:28,559 --> 02:06:34,119
cannaboids that that is in this plant

2966
02:06:31,238 --> 02:06:36,479
and what they what their powers are well

2967
02:06:34,118 --> 02:06:38,839
you just you're you're mentioning how

2968
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:40,359
important the human element is in all of

2969
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:43,039
this that the plant's not going to do

2970
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:45,558
everything for us that we are a major

2971
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:47,599
factor even in growing it because if

2972
02:06:45,559 --> 02:06:49,520
we're growing it with salts and we're

2973
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:52,119
not putting in that energy yeah there's

2974
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:55,719
there's a way to think that as a human

2975
02:06:52,118 --> 02:06:57,679
you can do better and you start growing

2976
02:06:55,719 --> 02:06:59,559
organically and regeneratively and

2977
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:02,039
that's actually better and that was the

2978
02:06:59,559 --> 02:07:03,360
human factor So when you say oh humans

2979
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:05,960
think they're going to take this plant

2980
02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:08,198
and do better well that's actually what

2981
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:11,118
we're all kind of doing with it at all

2982
02:07:08,198 --> 02:07:13,598
times so who's to draw the line where

2983
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:15,319
that should stop you know all I know is

2984
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:16,880
the plants aren't all available at this

2985
02:07:15,319 --> 02:07:18,399
point in time and I hate when I see

2986
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:20,840
small children with neurological

2987
02:07:18,399 --> 02:07:22,598
disorders where cannabis help them one

2988
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:24,279
grow and then then two grows down the

2989
02:07:22,599 --> 02:07:26,279
line it's not helping them the same

2990
02:07:24,279 --> 02:07:29,078
cultivar anymore because something

2991
02:07:26,279 --> 02:07:32,039
changed something the room got too hot

2992
02:07:29,078 --> 02:07:34,519
something happen so you know I do see a

2993
02:07:32,039 --> 02:07:36,880
value in all of it I certainly wouldn't

2994
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:39,679
pick one over the other I just think

2995
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:41,359
that we're so divided by as humans we

2996
02:07:39,679 --> 02:07:44,239
constantly have to put up a fence and

2997
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:45,799
say no the grass is greener over here or

2998
02:07:44,238 --> 02:07:47,799
you know no it's actually Greener Over

2999
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:49,360
Here I just rip that fence down stand on

3000
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:50,880
the edge and just say look let's be

3001
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:51,960
accepting of all of these different

3002
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:55,359
potential

3003
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:58,760
as long as they're based in love and

3004
02:07:55,359 --> 02:08:01,880
based in trying to help and based in

3005
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:03,760
positivity and great you know a greater

3006
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:05,639
you know outcome for the human race

3007
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,719
where I'm not talking about becoming

3008
02:08:05,639 --> 02:08:10,679
some evil corporate entity that uh holds

3009
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,439
these Powers over the rest of the world

3010
02:08:10,679 --> 02:08:15,158
gets rid of all plant medicines grow you

3011
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:17,319
know and I wasn't also even talking

3012
02:08:15,158 --> 02:08:19,158
about you know synthesizing as much as

3013
02:08:17,319 --> 02:08:21,078
isolating and then re and then

3014
02:08:19,158 --> 02:08:21,960
restructuring that's really kind of what

3015
02:08:21,078 --> 02:08:24,238
I was

3016
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:26,719
mentioning but I do appreciate your

3017
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:29,078
passion and uh did very much hear what

3018
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:31,359
you had to say one thing I thought what

3019
02:08:29,078 --> 02:08:35,000
was interesting is is uh Kelly brought

3020
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:37,598
up the idea of of a term we use you like

3021
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,880
like we use broadspectrum and tfree and

3022
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:43,039
and these terms that are so um full

3023
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:45,199
spectrum what what does full spectrum

3024
02:08:43,039 --> 02:08:47,760
mean what types of tpes what types of

3025
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:49,558
cannabinoids are there you know I do

3026
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:52,920
think that it needs to be further

3027
02:08:49,559 --> 02:08:55,440
divided defined and further explored and

3028
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:58,359
we need to better understand uh our

3029
02:08:55,439 --> 02:09:01,678
varietals and and how they're grown and

3030
02:08:58,359 --> 02:09:03,319
what regions they're grown in um it it's

3031
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:05,279
going to really help us better

3032
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:08,558
understand what the chemicals that the

3033
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:11,118
plant's producing are um you know what

3034
02:09:08,559 --> 02:09:14,159
it consistently can produce and what

3035
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:16,598
those anomalies are um you know I've

3036
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:20,118
seen in different conditions spikes in

3037
02:09:16,599 --> 02:09:23,000
thca that in Delta 9 that that are

3038
02:09:20,118 --> 02:09:24,639
abnormal um you know and it when it gets

3039
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,039
to cooler temperatures and different

3040
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:29,920
feeding schedules you see lower overall

3041
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:33,359
Tack and all this stuff really

3042
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:35,599
attributes to not only the environmental

3043
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:38,000
factors but also the feeding what you're

3044
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:40,360
giving the RIS of spere what type of

3045
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,118
inoculant are available what type of

3046
02:09:40,359 --> 02:09:43,359
cover crop is even there to even

3047
02:09:42,118 --> 02:09:45,078
sequester what you're trying to

3048
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:47,039
sequester and then providing the

3049
02:09:45,078 --> 02:09:48,639
environment for it to actually sequester

3050
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:51,399
because that's a whole other topic in

3051
02:09:48,639 --> 02:09:52,719
itself and you know it really is

3052
02:09:51,399 --> 02:09:54,558
important for us to have this this

3053
02:09:52,719 --> 02:09:57,559
dialogue and I do appreciate that point

3054
02:09:54,559 --> 02:09:59,800
of view and it's it's uh it's something

3055
02:09:57,559 --> 02:10:03,039
we need to talk more about because full

3056
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:05,000
spectrum is varietal specific it's why

3057
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:08,198
we name these things we humanize it we

3058
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:10,359
get closer to trying to grab onto it

3059
02:10:08,198 --> 02:10:12,238
with our human hands and and better

3060
02:10:10,359 --> 02:10:14,158
understand it by naming them and using

3061
02:10:12,238 --> 02:10:17,759
naming notes and glimmers and things

3062
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:19,719
like that but yeah it's it's it's super

3063
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:21,679
important because the dialogue is all we

3064
02:10:19,719 --> 02:10:23,319
have um and it allows us to kind of

3065
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:26,559
expand upon one another's thought

3066
02:10:23,319 --> 02:10:29,519
processes and and processes as well um

3067
02:10:26,559 --> 02:10:34,920
how you do everything I

3068
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:34,920
agree there is no ra rather than

3069
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:42,679
seeing sorry go ahead Sam oh I was just

3070
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:46,198
going to say there is no true full

3071
02:10:42,679 --> 02:10:50,920
spectrum in the sense that there is no

3072
02:10:46,198 --> 02:10:55,598
one variety of cannabis that has all 150

3073
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:58,279
of the tpin and all uh 120 or whatever

3074
02:10:55,599 --> 02:11:01,239
it is of the cannaboids it just doesn't

3075
02:10:58,279 --> 02:11:03,078
get in the way words just get in the way

3076
02:11:01,238 --> 02:11:05,558
because as soon as you start as soon as

3077
02:11:03,078 --> 02:11:07,599
you start using the word you start going

3078
02:11:05,559 --> 02:11:09,719
all over the place with with with the

3079
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:11,679
word I think it should be full spectrum

3080
02:11:09,719 --> 02:11:14,158
like the whole plant you're using that

3081
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:17,399
whole plant most of the leading

3082
02:11:14,158 --> 02:11:20,000
herbalists that use herbs and things

3083
02:11:17,399 --> 02:11:22,238
with patients on The Daily for

3084
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,880
Generations both believe that not

3085
02:11:22,238 --> 02:11:29,439
cannabis is not the only answer towards

3086
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:32,279
full health and transformation cannabis

3087
02:11:29,439 --> 02:11:35,078
is one thing that a person would use to

3088
02:11:32,279 --> 02:11:38,359
transform their health and often

3089
02:11:35,078 --> 02:11:41,238
compounding cannabis with other herbs is

3090
02:11:38,359 --> 02:11:43,000
the actual you know healing that's

3091
02:11:41,238 --> 02:11:45,799
needed so then you're just now your full

3092
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:48,599
spectrum is including other plants so I

3093
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:51,360
think the idea is that diversity is is

3094
02:11:48,599 --> 02:11:53,279
what we're missing and and if you look

3095
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:55,158
at a person who's really sick a lot of

3096
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:58,599
times if you dissect their microbiome

3097
02:11:55,158 --> 02:12:01,158
they have less living organisms in their

3098
02:11:58,599 --> 02:12:03,679
gut enabling them to transform their

3099
02:12:01,158 --> 02:12:07,319
nutrients and Medicine sure it's pretty

3100
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:11,078
easy so you just got to say oh I need to

3101
02:12:07,319 --> 02:12:13,039
up my diversity how do I do that any

3102
02:12:11,078 --> 02:12:14,840
person has their own reality and their

3103
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:17,719
own world and their own things that are

3104
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:19,639
available to them it's just a goal when

3105
02:12:17,719 --> 02:12:21,920
you learn things and that's what science

3106
02:12:19,639 --> 02:12:23,599
is good for they teach us some things

3107
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:27,118
and then you just learn through

3108
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:30,119
intuition to go further so diversity is

3109
02:12:27,118 --> 02:12:32,679
the key to our survival and Longevity

3110
02:12:30,118 --> 02:12:35,078
and also oh you go ahead go ahead go

3111
02:12:32,679 --> 02:12:37,000
ahead well and you were saying that you

3112
02:12:35,078 --> 02:12:38,319
know we have different sides of things I

3113
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,039
don't know if it's really different

3114
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:43,359
sides as much as it is it's holistic

3115
02:12:41,039 --> 02:12:46,198
what we need is we need more

3116
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:48,679
conversations more of holistic views

3117
02:12:46,198 --> 02:12:50,839
we're always taught that there's this

3118
02:12:48,679 --> 02:12:52,880
side or there's that side or that this

3119
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:55,800
thing needs to be an opposition with

3120
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:58,920
this thing I think that now that we've

3121
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:01,320
noticed so much diversity and

3122
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:04,118
divisiveness not diversity as far as

3123
02:13:01,319 --> 02:13:07,238
like diverse but you know being diverse

3124
02:13:04,118 --> 02:13:09,880
and divisive and being separated I think

3125
02:13:07,238 --> 02:13:12,439
that we need to realize that there's all

3126
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:16,319
these beautiful conversations that bring

3127
02:13:12,439 --> 02:13:19,118
in a wholeistic value it's good this is

3128
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:21,599
just good conversation and to accept all

3129
02:13:19,118 --> 02:13:23,158
all the different values and realize

3130
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:25,279
that they're all there because we're all

3131
02:13:23,158 --> 02:13:27,198
invited this is our table we're bringing

3132
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:29,759
everything and putting it to the table

3133
02:13:27,198 --> 02:13:31,839
hi perspectives perspectives would be

3134
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:34,639
the term more than size they're all

3135
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:36,840
perspect perspectives this convers learn

3136
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:40,480

you yeah and I love I love everyone's uh

3139
02:13:43,559 --> 02:13:48,800
dialogue that they bring to it it's so

3140
02:13:46,118 --> 02:13:51,639
um expansive in everyone's front

3141
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:53,400
everyone has a very unique understanding

3142
02:13:51,639 --> 02:13:55,960
of their disciplines that they've been

3143
02:13:53,399 --> 02:13:58,359
studying respectively and that's that's

3144
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:59,800
um that's the beauty in of of it all

3145
02:13:58,359 --> 02:14:04,359
it's just

3146
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:04,360
it's it's just soaking in you

3147
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:10,800
know y straight up cannabis Community

3148
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:13,159
that's why we love it so much

3149
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:15,480
right it's a growing Community now it's

3150
02:14:13,158 --> 02:14:17,879
a changing Community for a long time we

3151
02:14:15,479 --> 02:14:19,919
sort of you know almost held the keys to

3152
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:22,359
the gate and that those Gates have been

3153
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:24,000
blown off and the Community has expanded

3154
02:14:22,359 --> 02:14:25,759
and it's over here and over there and

3155
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,078
it's it's you know it's been some years

3156
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:31,599
of the Cannabis core Community getting

3157
02:14:29,078 --> 02:14:33,078
used to you know okay well look we want

3158
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:34,719
it to be included we want it to be

3159
02:14:33,078 --> 02:14:36,238
included we want it to be included then

3160
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:38,880
all of a sudden they included us and

3161
02:14:36,238 --> 02:14:41,198
everyone started criticizing everything

3162
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,760
about how it you know which is natural

3163
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:44,399
you know you're kind of trying to steer

3164
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:47,599
this thing or feel that you're steering

3165
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:51,359
a thing but I really do welcome the rest

3166
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:54,400
of the world I welcome so many people to

3167
02:14:51,359 --> 02:14:56,078
cannabis and how how they are all

3168
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:57,479
finding like we mentioned with Colton

3169
02:14:56,078 --> 02:14:58,799
earlier like different Pathways

3170
02:14:57,479 --> 02:15:01,000
different roadways and more importantly

3171
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:03,880
sharing those ways with us so that we

3172
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:06,800
can see all the incredible uh beneficial

3173
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:09,639
ways that um that you can use this plant

3174
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:11,760
and there's 50,000 commercial purposes

3175
02:15:09,639 --> 02:15:14,279
this plant can be used for there's you

3176
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:17,320
know plexiglass and metals there's you

3177
02:15:14,279 --> 02:15:19,519
know essential amino acid Rich seed oils

3178
02:15:17,319 --> 02:15:21,039
and it's really quite something when you

3179
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,119
when you start to break it down I'm

3180
02:15:21,039 --> 02:15:24,639
certain if it was discovered tomorrow

3181
02:15:23,118 --> 02:15:27,198
for the first time in the history of

3182
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:28,639
mankind it would be one of the greatest

3183
02:15:27,198 --> 02:15:31,238
discoveries ever

3184
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:34,078

02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:53,280
everywhere so watch out there's a lot of

3193
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:55,599
sharks [ __ ] teeth and they bite and

3194
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:58,158
they take a lot of Flesh so uh be

3195
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:58,159
careful out

3196
02:16:04,238 --> 02:16:08,359
there yes a lot of people are in the

3197
02:16:06,439 --> 02:16:09,879
industry for all the wrong reasons but a

3198
02:16:08,359 --> 02:16:12,039
lot of the people that most people I

3199
02:16:09,880 --> 02:16:13,719
know are in it for all the right reasons

3200
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:15,479
and those are the people that people are

3201
02:16:13,719 --> 02:16:18,279
listening to and paying attention to so

3202
02:16:15,479 --> 02:16:20,078
you don't see um the [ __ ] with all

3203
02:16:18,279 --> 02:16:22,599
the followers or all the people getting

3204
02:16:20,078 --> 02:16:24,279
involved we have we have a job in a

3205
02:16:22,599 --> 02:16:26,039
sense and we have a journey and I think

3206
02:16:24,279 --> 02:16:27,639
it's a journey we all follow which is

3207
02:16:26,039 --> 02:16:29,118
just spreading the knowledge and

3208
02:16:27,639 --> 02:16:32,679
education on how

3209
02:16:29,118 --> 02:16:34,718
cannabis it's it's it's saved my life

3210
02:16:32,679 --> 02:16:37,200
it's it's I love preaching about it and

3211
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:38,959
talking about it every day wherever I go

3212
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:41,880
it's kind of like have you done a bong

3213
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:43,358
rip what's wrong like it's important to

3214
02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:46,879
just keep sharing that knowledge and how

3215
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:46,880
it helps you my battery is

3216
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:54,879
low yeah and it's really

3217
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:57,200
my bad uh it's it's really important to

3218
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:59,679
make sure that patients are protected

3219
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:02,359
and that you know uh because this whole

3220
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:03,799
industry is centered around the patient

3221
02:17:02,359 --> 02:17:06,719
the patients are really the ones that

3222
02:17:03,799 --> 02:17:09,799
need to be taken care of the most almost

3223
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:12,759
you know as much if not more than the

3224
02:17:09,799 --> 02:17:15,000
plant itself uh you know there are

3225
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:17,880
plenty of patients out there who I'm

3226
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,558
sure are getting taking taken advantage

3227
02:17:17,879 --> 02:17:21,879
because the people that they're getting

3228
02:17:19,558 --> 02:17:24,638
their medicine from basically have a

3229
02:17:21,879 --> 02:17:27,079
monopoly on their life because you know

3230
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:29,799
say you go to one grower and it's the

3231
02:17:27,079 --> 02:17:32,239
only for one reason or the other it's

3232
02:17:29,799 --> 02:17:34,840
the only cannabis that works for you

3233
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:38,039
then you're stuck going to that one one

3234
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:40,799
grower or that one company or wherever

3235
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:42,960
it is you're going to and they can

3236
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:46,079
basically dictate however it is they

3237
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:47,638
want to give you your medicine or

3238
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:52,840
whatever they want to do with their

3239
02:17:47,638 --> 02:17:52,839
medicine they will so a lot of patients

3240
02:17:53,159 --> 02:17:58,318
right so you know a lot of patients need

3241
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:00,200
to have protections like that you know

3242
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:02,599
to make sure that their medicine isn't

3243
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:05,639
going to be you know tampered with that

3244
02:18:02,599 --> 02:18:08,799
it's going to be coming in consistently

3245
02:18:05,638 --> 02:18:10,638
effectively and safely that we know

3246
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:13,000
everything that's going into this

3247
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,920
medicine because and that's the Gap

3248
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:17,318
medicine's a human right that's the Gap

3249
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:19,799
that we're having we're having even you

3250
02:18:17,318 --> 02:18:23,000
as a patient having direct contact with

3251
02:18:19,799 --> 02:18:26,079
the plant you know you being able to

3252
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:29,000
have this this incredible relationship

3253
02:18:26,079 --> 02:18:32,120
with the plant because nobody can make

3254
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:35,239
medicine for you better than you I think

3255
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:38,120
anyone who's a cultivator anyone who

3256
02:18:35,239 --> 02:18:40,119
understands this plant understands that

3257
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:43,319
anyone you know and and that's the

3258
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:45,160
problem it's all this politics and all

3259
02:18:43,318 --> 02:18:47,519
this this oppression on this plant

3260
02:18:45,159 --> 02:18:49,638
that's getting in the way from us to be

3261
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:52,398
able to have this direct good connection

3262
02:18:49,638 --> 02:18:53,759
with the plant and I I love it that you

3263
02:18:52,398 --> 02:18:57,239
said that Colton because you're

3264
02:18:53,760 --> 02:19:00,000
absolutely right the plant is here for

3265
02:18:57,239 --> 02:19:04,398
the patient number one the plant's

3266
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:06,558
number one goal is to heal humanity and

3267
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:09,478
so that's what that's what she wants to

3268
02:19:06,558 --> 02:19:11,718
do is is to have that direct connection

3269
02:19:09,478 --> 02:19:13,478
with patients and and it continues to

3270
02:19:11,718 --> 02:19:15,678
get in the way and these conversations

3271
02:19:13,478 --> 02:19:18,920
that we're having that are very holistic

3272
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:21,879
in nature allows that energy to go out

3273
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:25,000
so that the plant can can make its way

3274
02:19:21,879 --> 02:19:27,239
into regular Society so that everybody

3275
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:29,239
can have that direct relationship and it

3276
02:19:27,239 --> 02:19:31,478
is why we created the pure certification

3277
02:19:29,239 --> 02:19:33,679
to Ally and bring Farms together for the

3278
02:19:31,478 --> 02:19:35,879
betterment of humanity to create safe

3279
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:37,879
medicine that's alive and living along

3280
02:19:35,879 --> 02:19:40,799
with our own bodies and biomes and

3281
02:19:37,879 --> 02:19:43,799
patients can have direct contact with

3282
02:19:40,799 --> 02:19:46,759
with uh cultivators and these medicine

3283
02:19:43,799 --> 02:19:48,358
makers have been like having to survive

3284
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:51,639
so they're creating medicine that

3285
02:19:48,359 --> 02:19:53,559
survives too so now we're all adapting

3286
02:19:51,639 --> 02:19:55,358
and adapted genic medicine you know for

3287
02:19:53,559 --> 02:19:57,318
the masses we hope that you can get what

3288
02:19:55,359 --> 02:19:59,640
you need and there's so many cultivators

3289
02:19:57,318 --> 02:20:01,879
that want nothing more than to be

3290
02:19:59,639 --> 02:20:04,119
cultivating medicine directly for

3291
02:20:01,879 --> 02:20:06,279
patients that's their number one goal in

3292
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:09,120
focus and they feel incredibly

3293
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:12,040
frustrated just like you that they can't

3294
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:14,280
get it to you that's their number one

3295
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:17,120
the biggest problem that's me over here

3296
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:18,280
access ATN number one he's been he's

3297
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:21,240
been you

3298
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:23,920
know walking his talk for forever is

3299
02:20:21,239 --> 02:20:26,199
whole adult life of patient access how

3300
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:28,760
do we get the plant to the people and

3301
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:30,359
the people to the plant and this is this

3302
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:32,680
is what we're all trying to break down

3303
02:20:30,359 --> 02:20:34,920
those barriers go and that all that red

3304
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:37,960
tape is just it it's just strangling us

3305
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:40,840
as patients and and we we don't want

3306
02:20:37,959 --> 02:20:43,000
that we would love to be able to grow um

3307
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:45,318
but one of the things one of the reasons

3308
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:47,719
why we don't grow and somebody on this

3309
02:20:45,318 --> 02:20:49,840
panel needs to get this done is that we

3310
02:20:47,719 --> 02:20:53,318
we do want testing we want to make sure

3311
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:57,639
that what what we're growing isn't full

3312
02:20:53,318 --> 02:21:01,359
of of Miracle Grow here in Illinois I

3313
02:20:57,639 --> 02:21:05,039
mean we're monsan Haven um but we we

3314
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:07,680
need that so we we always depend on a

3315
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:09,399
cultivator and a grower of of with a

3316
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:12,318
company because at least we're getting

3317
02:21:09,398 --> 02:21:15,599
tested medicine um home testing is is

3318
02:21:12,318 --> 02:21:18,318
very very difficult um and but but we

3319
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:21,000
need to know how many canono Colton is

3320
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:24,199
getting in his body how many flavonoids

3321
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:27,600
are not not really flavenoids but tpin

3322
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:30,040
and and if there's any microbials and is

3323
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,960
there mold in it because you you trust

3324
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:36,319
me to grow his medicine and it's gonna

3325
02:21:31,959 --> 02:21:39,639
get [ __ ] I mean it he it's it's bad um

3326
02:21:36,318 --> 02:21:42,959
but I I think that we need to have those

3327
02:21:39,639 --> 02:21:47,398
types of small little entities that that

3328
02:21:42,959 --> 02:21:50,000
help the the novice grower Empower

3329
02:21:47,398 --> 02:21:52,760
themselves to grow their own medicine um

3330
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:54,959
and with without that without those

3331
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:57,639
little home testing kits that we can

3332
02:21:54,959 --> 02:22:00,318
test you know we we get afraid that

3333
02:21:57,639 --> 02:22:04,039
we're not getting the right canabo in

3334
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:06,760
his into his system um so there's just

3335
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:10,600
there's just so many aspects of of Home

3336
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:12,478
grow and and Commercial grow and and

3337
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:15,318
everything and all the red tape that

3338
02:22:12,478 --> 02:22:19,239
just strangles us as patients and it's

3339
02:22:15,318 --> 02:22:21,159
just it's disheartening it's so sad

3340
02:22:19,239 --> 02:22:23,760
we're we're all I think it's the the

3341
02:22:21,159 --> 02:22:25,879
term is we're all

3342
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:27,960
learning we're all learning every

3343
02:22:25,879 --> 02:22:30,000
State's learning every state is learning

3344
02:22:27,959 --> 02:22:32,919
from each other every bill is different

3345
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,959
and they're all reminiscent of some Bill

3346
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:37,879
that they heard about once and you know

3347
02:22:35,959 --> 02:22:39,919
that's that's that becomes the problem

3348
02:22:37,879 --> 02:22:43,318
but it also becomes the path forward and

3349
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:46,359
how we shape that and and it's you know

3350
02:22:43,318 --> 02:22:48,398
it's something that is important to to

3351
02:22:46,359 --> 02:22:50,840
know is that someone like myself that's

3352
02:22:48,398 --> 02:22:53,159
in a regulated State I work really hard

3353
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:55,840
to make sure that I have induction seals

3354
02:22:53,159 --> 02:22:57,920
and things that keep this stuff fresh

3355
02:22:55,840 --> 02:23:00,359
because I know how long it takes to even

3356
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:02,120
get to a patient and it just Bo that

3357
02:23:00,359 --> 02:23:03,920
alone boggles my mind because coming

3358
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:06,160
from the traditional sense it was

3359
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:08,879
immediate it just you didn't have these

3360
02:23:06,159 --> 02:23:11,359
you never had these hurdles before so

3361
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:13,000
it's you know the responsibility is is

3362
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:15,600
massive and then the

3363
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:17,559
testing you know that that's super

3364
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:19,359
important like you said you can't you

3365
02:23:17,559 --> 02:23:20,879
can't be ingesting mold you're create

3366
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:23,318
you're you're trying to solve from one

3367
02:23:20,879 --> 02:23:24,799
problem and creating a new one and

3368
02:23:23,318 --> 02:23:27,959
that's just you know it's important to

3369
02:23:24,799 --> 02:23:30,398
have access to Labs even for yourself

3370
02:23:27,959 --> 02:23:33,959
and I think yeah hom grower should have

3371
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:36,119
access to all this stuff I you know it

3372
02:23:33,959 --> 02:23:39,358
just gives us better insight as to what

3373
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:41,720
we're doing and how we can do it um you

3374
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:43,120
know and it's it would you know it just

3375
02:23:41,719 --> 02:23:44,599
helps us further along what we're

3376
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:45,640
actually after which is better

3377
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:48,720
understanding the things that we just

3378
02:23:45,639 --> 02:23:51,039
don't understand and I'm going to chime

3379
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:54,478
in here it requires due diligence

3380
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:57,600
right now in Utah they're trying to pull

3381
02:23:54,478 --> 02:24:01,679
PTSD off of a conditions for medical

3382
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:04,000
marijuana so uh as forward as we are

3383
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:06,720
moving there are still people trying to

3384
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,639
pull things back so remember interal

3385
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:10,920
vigilance is the price of Liberty ladies

3386
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:13,599
and gentlemen and your brothers and

3387
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:15,920
sisters in Utah need your help so you

3388
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:18,880
know find a local organizations National

3389
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:20,680
organizations chime in but you know it's

3390
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:23,358
a new year but the struggle it's the

3391
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:26,520
same unfortunately for some people and

3392
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:29,640
um what you were also talking about uh

3393
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:31,439
Wendy is you know growing cannabis can

3394
02:24:29,639 --> 02:24:33,439
be easy but growing medical grade

3395
02:24:31,439 --> 02:24:36,159
cannabis consistently is an art and

3396
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:38,000
that's a challenge and that's a thing

3397
02:24:36,159 --> 02:24:40,920
that uh one of the things when I was a

3398
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,840
buyer that I used to do is you know a

3399
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:44,920
plant can tell you exactly if you've

3400
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:47,680
grown it enough times you can look at a

3401
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:49,279
plant and tell exactly what's gone on

3402
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:51,720
and really freak out the grower it's

3403
02:24:49,279 --> 02:24:52,800
really kind of fun um because they're

3404
02:24:51,719 --> 02:24:55,358
like how the hell did you get in my

3405
02:24:52,799 --> 02:24:59,639
growroom but the plant tells you

3406
02:24:55,359 --> 02:25:02,200
everything so uh having educated people

3407
02:24:59,639 --> 02:25:04,318
who can give you good information around

3408
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:07,439
cannabis is always challenging because

3409
02:25:04,318 --> 02:25:09,959
every grower I know grows

3410
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:11,720
different everyone I know you know

3411
02:25:09,959 --> 02:25:13,278
everybody here is nodding because you

3412
02:25:11,719 --> 02:25:16,840
know everybody thinks they know how to

3413
02:25:13,279 --> 02:25:18,760
grow it or this way etc etc so it's also

3414
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:21,200
challenging to educate people how to

3415
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:23,120
grow properly when every everybody grows

3416
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,960
in different ways and paths and

3417
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:27,000
pathologies so depending if it's

3418
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:29,199
Hydroponics if it's inso if it's indoor

3419
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:31,719
if it's outdoors you've got different

3420
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:34,840
functions and different religions to

3421
02:25:31,719 --> 02:25:37,119
each specific ones depending on what you

3422
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:39,680
have and have access to so it's also

3423
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:42,359
what you can afford what you have access

3424
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:46,040
to and yes there needs to be Regional

3425
02:25:42,359 --> 02:25:47,920
players who could come in and educate or

3426
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:50,319
there be Regional places where people

3427
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:53,000
could go and learn how to grow and

3428
02:25:50,318 --> 02:25:55,239
educate themselves like what positronics

3429
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,239
used to do you know they would propagate

3430
02:25:55,239 --> 02:25:59,920
clones that'd be mothers there so you

3431
02:25:57,239 --> 02:26:02,159
could come in and then grow your plant

3432
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:04,359
if you need to in a communal environment

3433
02:26:02,159 --> 02:26:06,680
so you could learn and teach at the same

3434
02:26:04,359 --> 02:26:09,120
time but of course that was decades ago

3435
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:11,760
and Amsterdam and a galaxy far far away

3436
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:14,760
but it's still applicable today is

3437
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:17,079
community growing so that you can learn

3438
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:19,398
proper techniques so you can arrive at

3439
02:26:17,079 --> 02:26:20,959
the techniques that will most benefit

3440
02:26:19,398 --> 02:26:22,719
you so that

3441
02:26:20,959 --> 02:26:24,959
Colton can get a better quality of

3442
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:27,239
cannabis from you than you had

3443
02:26:24,959 --> 02:26:29,639
previously green thumbs aren't natural

3444
02:26:27,239 --> 02:26:31,760
they're learned oh yeah I do not have a

3445
02:26:29,639 --> 02:26:34,000
green thumb and one of the things that

3446
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:37,239
we are learning is that you know we we

3447
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:39,799
moved from Illinois to Colorado um for

3448
02:26:37,239 --> 02:26:41,840
access to cannabis and the legislative

3449
02:26:39,799 --> 02:26:44,159
system there was you know they they

3450
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:47,239
tried and tried and tried to to to pull

3451
02:26:44,159 --> 02:26:50,799
it back but then we moved back from from

3452
02:26:47,239 --> 02:26:51,920
Colorado to Illinois and

3453
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:55,438
the

3454
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:58,318
ecosystem here is different uh so when

3455
02:26:55,439 --> 02:27:00,920
you have blue dream in Colorado it's

3456
02:26:58,318 --> 02:27:02,879
it's a different it's a different style

3457
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:05,600
than it is here in Illinois because

3458
02:27:02,879 --> 02:27:09,039
there's different growing techniques and

3459
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:11,720
and situations it's very it's very humid

3460
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:14,359
here it's very dry in Colorado so when

3461
02:27:11,719 --> 02:27:16,719
you have a Colorado grower to come in

3462
02:27:14,359 --> 02:27:18,520
and grow your medicine in Illinois

3463
02:27:16,719 --> 02:27:20,519
they're they're running into a lot of

3464
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:22,200
situations that that they don't

3465
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:25,319
understand because they've never grown

3466
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:27,840
in Illinois we have rich soil here here

3467
02:27:25,318 --> 02:27:31,398
um we have a lot of moisture in our air

3468
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:34,200
um so the it it's just it's been so

3469
02:27:31,398 --> 02:27:36,439
every region is so different um so

3470
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:39,439
making sure that we have medicine across

3471
02:27:36,439 --> 02:27:41,559
the the United States uh anywhere Colton

3472
02:27:39,439 --> 02:27:43,680
decides to go that is consistent has

3473
02:27:41,559 --> 02:27:46,559
been very very difficult to

3474
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:49,520
find yes no one has pulled the ray Croc

3475
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:51,119
model where you get your same big Big

3476
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:53,000
Mac here

3477
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:55,800
as you get in St Louis that's still

3478
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,639
always been a frustration and our 21

3479
02:27:55,799 --> 02:28:00,478
years of providing genetics is you know

3480
02:27:58,639 --> 02:28:02,760
people want what we had last year or the

3481
02:28:00,478 --> 02:28:06,039
year before they didn't keep or

3482
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:08,318
maintain um and that's also challenging

3483
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:10,760
because you know people grow differently

3484
02:28:08,318 --> 02:28:13,318
and you know you can get a different uh

3485
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:15,359
yield in the lower areas of the Bay Area

3486
02:28:13,318 --> 02:28:17,680
than you can in certain other bay areas

3487
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:19,200
of the Bay Area because there's so many

3488
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:21,159
microclimates there's literally more

3489
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:23,840
microclimates here in the Bay Area than

3490
02:28:21,159 --> 02:28:27,639
some places in the world so it becomes

3491
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:30,359
challenging just here in an area in a

3492
02:28:27,639 --> 02:28:33,559
region as well it becomes challenging

3493
02:28:30,359 --> 02:28:35,640
for consistency and maintaining or

3494
02:28:33,559 --> 02:28:38,719
getting consistent access from my

3495
02:28:35,639 --> 02:28:42,559
patients perspective is a frustration

3496
02:28:38,719 --> 02:28:44,398
because also having stability of access

3497
02:28:42,559 --> 02:28:46,719
to the genetics so that when somebody

3498
02:28:44,398 --> 02:28:48,959
says this is a blue dream it is actually

3499
02:28:46,719 --> 02:28:51,278
a blue dream but not something else

3500
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:53,278
masquerading as a Blue Dream which is I

3501
02:28:51,279 --> 02:28:55,880
think one of the bigger frustration a

3502
02:28:53,279 --> 02:28:58,880
lot of us have found especially having

3503
02:28:55,879 --> 02:29:01,079
to forge in the traditional Market much

3504
02:28:58,879 --> 02:29:04,079
less even in the legal Market because

3505
02:29:01,079 --> 02:29:06,840
consistency of genetics to have the same

3506
02:29:04,079 --> 02:29:09,879
Big Mac every single day I still can't

3507
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:13,120
do after 21 years right and I think that

3508
02:29:09,879 --> 02:29:15,879
the only way that we can actually help

3509
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:18,600
that progression along is interstate

3510
02:29:15,879 --> 02:29:21,959
commerce you know if we can have you

3511
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:24,318
grow the same exact medicine for Colton

3512
02:29:21,959 --> 02:29:26,839
and be able to send it across the state

3513
02:29:24,318 --> 02:29:29,398
lines then then we wouldn't have this

3514
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:31,960
issue um so that's one of the big things

3515
02:29:29,398 --> 02:29:35,478
that we will be pushing this year um is

3516
02:29:31,959 --> 02:29:38,639
interstate commerce um because like you

3517
02:29:35,478 --> 02:29:41,639
said there's so many different regions

3518
02:29:38,639 --> 02:29:43,879
and you know the way you grow may be

3519
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:45,879
completely different the the way you

3520
02:29:43,879 --> 02:29:47,599
grow grow blue dream may be completely

3521
02:29:45,879 --> 02:29:50,398
different than what's being the way you

3522
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:52,880
grow blue dream in Illinois um but yet

3523
02:29:50,398 --> 02:29:56,840
the blue dream that you grow in in your

3524
02:29:52,879 --> 02:29:59,559
area is what we like the best um so we

3525
02:29:56,840 --> 02:30:03,200
should definitely be pushing interstate

3526
02:29:59,559 --> 02:30:05,278
commerce um and reciprocity and you know

3527
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:07,600
just making sure that it's it it's

3528
02:30:05,279 --> 02:30:10,000
available and accessible across state

3529
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:12,040
lines and and across country lines I

3530
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,439
mean we have a ton of people you know

3531
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:17,880
here in Canada

3532
02:30:14,439 --> 02:30:20,760
and we we want to be able to access

3533
02:30:17,879 --> 02:30:23,159
Canadian medicines you know because

3534
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:26,680
we're the United States and our our

3535
02:30:23,159 --> 02:30:28,600
infrastructure kind of sucks um but you

3536
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:31,720
know if you grow the best I want the

3537
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:33,318
best for my kid and I want to be able to

3538
02:30:31,719 --> 02:30:36,358
access it without having to move where

3539
02:30:33,318 --> 02:30:38,478
you are right and I love the idea of

3540
02:30:36,359 --> 02:30:42,239
expanding that even greater bring it to

3541
02:30:38,478 --> 02:30:45,119
you across the world the globe you know

3542
02:30:42,239 --> 02:30:48,359
imagine crying sorry

3543
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:50,600
sorry sorry sorry go Marcus go Marcus

3544
02:30:48,359 --> 02:30:52,159
please um I was just saying that it

3545
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:54,359
would be neat to do that on a world

3546
02:30:52,159 --> 02:30:56,439
scale like have international Commerce

3547
02:30:54,359 --> 02:30:58,600
where you know people who grow cannabis

3548
02:30:56,439 --> 02:31:01,279
and extracts in different parts of the

3549
02:30:58,600 --> 02:31:03,279
world all over every country being able

3550
02:31:01,279 --> 02:31:05,439
to move those to different countries and

3551
02:31:03,279 --> 02:31:08,159
to find certain things and have

3552
02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:10,279
discoveries as to you know we speak

3553
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:12,600
about the importance of Terr well if

3554
02:31:10,279 --> 02:31:15,120
Terr is important then it's likely with

3555
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:17,439
cannabis that certain things will

3556
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:19,520
Express themselves you know more

3557
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:21,520
uniquely or whatever terminology you

3558
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:23,600
want to use you you'll see some unique

3559
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:25,359
expressions from Cannabis depending on

3560
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:28,000
where you grow it and at what time of

3561
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:30,800
year that you grow it and I love the

3562
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,920
idea of Interstate travel with for

3563
02:31:30,799 --> 02:31:34,719
cannabis and being able to do Commerce

3564
02:31:32,920 --> 02:31:38,600
but I really love the idea of being able

3565
02:31:34,719 --> 02:31:40,719
to send stuff from like Colombia to you

3566
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:43,000
know Illinois or to be for you guys to

3567
02:31:40,719 --> 02:31:45,920
be able to access stuff from everywhere

3568
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:50,359
in the world and we would love to have

3569
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:52,760
things from Colombia or or Venezuela or

3570
02:31:50,359 --> 02:31:57,000
wherever I mean just think of the

3571
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:59,880
ability to try different areas and

3572
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:02,680
different regions of the world um that's

3573
02:31:59,879 --> 02:32:04,199
more realistic now more than ever great

3574
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:06,398
to be able to give you this nearly clear

3575
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:09,120
rosin it's ridiculous the Reas i' love

3576
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:11,719
to have your nearly clear rosin uh

3577
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:13,560
Michael krowitz and the group uh down at

3578
02:32:11,719 --> 02:32:16,719
the un

3579
02:32:13,559 --> 02:32:20,000
unfortunately changed international law

3580
02:32:16,719 --> 02:32:22,000
over the holidays they actually got uh

3581
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,600
cannabis pulled out of schedule four so

3582
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:26,680
actually medical marijuana now exists in

3583
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:28,880
the [ __ ] world for the first time the

3584
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:32,439
DEA is still not responded to it in

3585
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:35,879
December but this now opens up Things N

3586
02:32:32,439 --> 02:32:37,680
uh uh internationally on top of that hey

3587
02:32:35,879 --> 02:32:39,839
Georgia we're looking at you if the

3588
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:42,159
state of Georgia passes and gets both

3589
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:44,478
these Democrats elected then you're

3590
02:32:42,159 --> 02:32:47,799
going to see a more act and you will see

3591
02:32:44,478 --> 02:32:49,959
interstate commerce open up within uh

3592
02:32:47,799 --> 02:32:51,358
the year here in the United States but

3593
02:32:49,959 --> 02:32:53,559
if it doesn't then it's going to be

3594
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:56,439
fought all the way through but a lot of

3595
02:32:53,559 --> 02:32:59,039
changes a lot of places you can plug in

3596
02:32:56,439 --> 02:33:01,239
to make a lot of change happening not

3597
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:04,479
only internationally because of medical

3598
02:33:01,239 --> 02:33:06,879
marijuana now being internationally

3599
02:33:04,478 --> 02:33:07,879
recognized by the UN and the World

3600
02:33:06,879 --> 02:33:10,478
Health

3601
02:33:07,879 --> 02:33:13,119
Organization I want to be able to import

3602
02:33:10,478 --> 02:33:16,119
Canadian cannabis and we want to be able

3603
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:18,200
to export our California Cannabis as

3604
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:20,720
well uh so we could have genetics

3605
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:23,439
exchange all that fun stuff so I think

3606
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:24,679
2021 and in the future it's a lot of

3607
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:27,000
stuff's opening up but definitely

3608
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:29,840
interstate commerce domestically could

3609
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:31,959
potentially happen soon awesome and

3610
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:33,760
hopefully we'll continue to push that

3611
02:33:31,959 --> 02:33:36,199
that education forward and that

3612
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:38,680
conversation forward because just like

3613
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:42,000
you all are looking for for the right

3614
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:45,520
medicine we as cultivators want nothing

3615
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:48,359
more than to find the right patients so

3616
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:50,439
when CBD is opened up and we we are

3617
02:33:48,359 --> 02:33:53,200
doing our m canic

3618
02:33:50,439 --> 02:33:55,800
I have direct contact with all of my

3619
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:58,200
patients you know or you know I'm able

3620
02:33:55,799 --> 02:34:01,000
to talk to them on a human level what's

3621
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:04,680
going on what's happening it's all freed

3622
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:07,478
up it's direct it's from the grower the

3623
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:09,398
manufacturer the maker directly to the

3624
02:34:07,478 --> 02:34:12,278
patients so we can have these

3625
02:34:09,398 --> 02:34:15,639
conversations so in my garden I could

3626
02:34:12,279 --> 02:34:18,920
have okay these three plants I'm growing

3627
02:34:15,639 --> 02:34:21,959
for Colton not only am I growing them

3628
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:25,040
for the the varietal that he wants but

3629
02:34:21,959 --> 02:34:28,278
I'm thinking about him as I'm growing

3630
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:31,080
them and I'm growing enough for him to

3631
02:34:28,279 --> 02:34:32,920
have for an entire year that he's not

3632
02:34:31,079 --> 02:34:35,520
going to run out that he's not

3633
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:37,200
continually looking for something so I

3634
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:39,200
want to continue pushing that

3635
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:41,800
conversation forward too that the

3636
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:43,520
cultivators are having direct com

3637
02:34:41,799 --> 02:34:46,719
conversation and communication and

3638
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:48,960
education with the patients worldwide I

3639
02:34:46,719 --> 02:34:51,199
I would just like to also say like often

3640
02:34:48,959 --> 02:34:54,000
cannabis is fumigated when you bring it

3641
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:56,720
from another country which

3642
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,398
completely is goes counterintuitive to

3643
02:34:56,719 --> 02:35:01,079
everything that you've done to put into

3644
02:34:58,398 --> 02:35:02,199
the medicine so let's keep cannabis from

3645
02:35:01,079 --> 02:35:05,239
being

3646
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:07,880
fumigated and keep it medicine let's

3647
02:35:05,239 --> 02:35:10,199
keep cannabis sacred and keep cannabis

3648
02:35:07,879 --> 02:35:11,000
as medicine so as we're fighting for

3649
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:13,880
this

3650
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:16,000
International you know Marketplace let's

3651
02:35:13,879 --> 02:35:18,639
like be aware that a lot of herbs and

3652
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:21,120
Foods get fumigated with chemicals when

3653
02:35:18,639 --> 02:35:22,760
they enter the

3654
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:24,200
of a new country and Alice probably has

3655
02:35:22,760 --> 02:35:26,079
something to say about International and

3656
02:35:24,200 --> 02:35:29,040
Alice it's nice to see you what's going

3657
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:31,000
on girlfriend nice to see you all too I

3658
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:33,279
said to Marcus sorry I came in late but

3659
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,040
my cat dropped all my transplant so I

3660
02:35:33,279 --> 02:35:38,279
had to fix

3661
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:40,319
it and um I was actually wanting to

3662
02:35:38,279 --> 02:35:41,960
bring up something too because um every

3663
02:35:40,318 --> 02:35:44,478
time I come here most of the people that

3664
02:35:41,959 --> 02:35:46,239
are here are either North Americans

3665
02:35:44,478 --> 02:35:48,318
right are either from United States or

3666
02:35:46,239 --> 02:35:50,318
from Canada and I love to come here and

3667
02:35:48,318 --> 02:35:53,199
listen to all the conversation

3668
02:35:50,318 --> 02:35:55,239
and but I feel that you are all so many

3669
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:57,079
steps ahead than we are in Brazil even

3670
02:35:55,239 --> 02:35:59,719
though I live in California now that I

3671
02:35:57,079 --> 02:36:01,879
just love to come here learn everything

3672
02:35:59,719 --> 02:36:03,920
sometimes I even take notes so I can

3673
02:36:01,879 --> 02:36:06,920
just like rethink on how this could be

3674
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:08,439
applied South American perspective and a

3675
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:10,799
few things that you brought up today

3676
02:36:08,439 --> 02:36:12,800
that I really loved is this that you

3677
02:36:10,799 --> 02:36:14,879
were talking about the education and the

3678
02:36:12,799 --> 02:36:16,639
fact that the person that grows can also

3679
02:36:14,879 --> 02:36:18,839
have a connection with the with the

3680
02:36:16,639 --> 02:36:21,478
patient and now in Brazil they're trying

3681
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:24,120
to pass a b that only the government and

3682
02:36:21,478 --> 02:36:27,039
importations would be ready to would be

3683
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:29,160
um possible to produce cannabis somehow

3684
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:32,080
or like deliver cannabis to patients and

3685
02:36:29,159 --> 02:36:33,920
no hom growing at all so no one can have

3686
02:36:32,079 --> 02:36:36,200
the connection with the medicine itself

3687
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:38,680
or grow from their for for themselves

3688
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:41,279
and I see how this is how this just

3689
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:44,239
takes the full on power autonomy of the

3690
02:36:41,279 --> 02:36:46,800
patient I I talk like I mean I'm a

3691
02:36:44,239 --> 02:36:48,680
cannabis patient too but I I balance in

3692
02:36:46,799 --> 02:36:51,278
between being a patient because of my

3693
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:54,359
chronic pain and also being someone that

3694
02:36:51,279 --> 02:36:56,600
uses like that likes dab that likes high

3695
02:36:54,359 --> 02:36:58,318
THC content things different tping

3696
02:36:56,600 --> 02:37:00,279
profiles and trying to balance that

3697
02:36:58,318 --> 02:37:01,840
thing and it's just so hard when we

3698
02:37:00,279 --> 02:37:05,560
think of it for someone from South

3699
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:08,040
America in a reality like this and uh I

3700
02:37:05,559 --> 02:37:11,799
just love to come here and just learn

3701
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:13,920
everything and uh try to try to engage

3702
02:37:11,799 --> 02:37:15,719
and uh translate this knowledge for the

3703
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:18,000
people down there with the possibilities

3704
02:37:15,719 --> 02:37:20,639
there are you know the possibilities

3705
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,120
that I offer down there so thank you so

3706
02:37:20,639 --> 02:37:25,719
much for all the for for all the I'm

3707
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:27,600
just listening today I'm just like

3708
02:37:25,719 --> 02:37:30,199
almost taking notes

3709
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:31,960
Here well we're happy to have you Alice

3710
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:34,600
I was kind of sad when I didn't see a

3711
02:37:31,959 --> 02:37:36,639
few key folks Dr Mark never made it

3712
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:38,318
today we hope and wish him a happy New

3713
02:37:36,639 --> 02:37:39,959
Year and that everything's okay with him

3714
02:37:38,318 --> 02:37:43,239
because I know he had planned on making

3715
02:37:39,959 --> 02:37:44,959
it but uh he had a birthday too is that

3716
02:37:43,239 --> 02:37:48,600
what yeah he did didn't he he just had a

3717
02:37:44,959 --> 02:37:51,079
birthday an earth strong for Dr Mark yes

3718
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:53,000
hashy believe Mark also lives in an area

3719
02:37:51,079 --> 02:37:55,520
that used to be the mushroom capital of

3720
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:57,959
the of the world and I want I was hoping

3721
02:37:55,520 --> 02:38:00,159
he would be in today so we could talk a

3722
02:37:57,959 --> 02:38:02,159
little bit about Kenneth Square and see

3723
02:38:00,159 --> 02:38:06,959
if that has any

3724
02:38:02,159 --> 02:38:09,239
Roots uh in the world uh at large uh you

3725
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:11,519
know what's happening it'll have to wait

3726
02:38:09,239 --> 02:38:14,199
till next week I

3727
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:16,200
suppose can I bring up one subject since

3728
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:18,439
I I arrived here late and I said like

3729
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:21,960
last but it's just that now I'm stoned

3730
02:38:18,439 --> 02:38:24,760
and tripping and uh I just uh something

3731
02:38:21,959 --> 02:38:26,959
crossed my mind which is H uh we were

3732
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:30,040
talking about education and cannabis

3733
02:38:26,959 --> 02:38:32,318
right and we recognize cannabis as this

3734
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:34,800
moderate plant and this very medical

3735
02:38:32,318 --> 02:38:37,000
plan too but a lot of people and I think

3736
02:38:34,799 --> 02:38:39,959
that all of us are aware of that do not

3737
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:42,120
use the plant medically they create

3738
02:38:39,959 --> 02:38:44,119
different patterns they create uh

3739
02:38:42,120 --> 02:38:46,880
different relationships with the plant

3740
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:49,120
that sometimes their be their actions

3741
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:50,879
their uh their daily tests their

3742
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:52,880
behavior Behavior towards the plant does

3743
02:38:50,879 --> 02:38:55,879
not create a healthy setting or a

3744
02:38:52,879 --> 02:38:58,199
healthy environment for the people and

3745
02:38:55,879 --> 02:39:00,599
uh that's something that I almost don't

3746
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:02,600
hear about here in United States I feel

3747
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:04,399
like in Brazil when we're engaging

3748
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:06,479
content about cannabis and things like

3749
02:39:04,398 --> 02:39:08,119
this we always try to bring up this

3750
02:39:06,478 --> 02:39:09,599
perspective to which is almost harm

3751
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:11,040
reduction right coming with the good

3752
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:13,640
things and the bad things and how to

3753
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:15,760
balance them and I would like to hear

3754
02:39:13,639 --> 02:39:18,039
all from all of you something that it's

3755
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:19,680
hard for us to hear I would like for you

3756
02:39:18,040 --> 02:39:21,840
all to tell me something negative ative

3757
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:23,439
about cannabis and because I think that

3758
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:25,920
that's a thing that engages in the

3759
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:27,800
education you know in balancing harms

3760
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:30,520
and risks and I wanted to talk about

3761
02:39:27,799 --> 02:39:32,599
this with you all because uh two months

3762
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:34,920
ago we made a post on girls in green and

3763
02:39:32,600 --> 02:39:36,399
a Content based on the that we have to

3764
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:38,439
talk about the negative effects of

3765
02:39:36,398 --> 02:39:40,760
cannabis and it was the thing that most

3766
02:39:38,439 --> 02:39:43,639
engaged lately because that's something

3767
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:45,520
that few people were talking about and I

3768
02:39:43,639 --> 02:39:48,680
just wanted to bring it up here for a

3769
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:49,920
discussion too if it possible I have a

3770
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:54,840
great idea

3771
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:58,079
go ahead Wendy um so I I was the DAR mom

3772
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:59,200
you know we we established that earlier

3773
02:39:58,079 --> 02:40:04,359
um

3774
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:08,279
but there when it came to Colton being

3775
02:40:04,359 --> 02:40:12,239
um being a patient of Crohn's and on

3776
02:40:08,279 --> 02:40:14,560
pharmaceutical medicines I saw more harm

3777
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:16,840
on Pharmaceuticals than I have on

3778
02:40:14,559 --> 02:40:20,719
cannabis H not to say that there isn't

3779
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:24,040
any type of harm but I haven't found any

3780
02:40:20,719 --> 02:40:28,318
and I I

3781
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:30,200
just I think it's a mindset I think that

3782
02:40:28,318 --> 02:40:34,959
because we

3783
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:39,479
have villainized this plant for so long

3784
02:40:34,959 --> 02:40:42,919
that people push off a lot of negativity

3785
02:40:39,478 --> 02:40:46,159
towards a person that does use cannabis

3786
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:49,879
um there's there's a Facebook group it's

3787
02:40:46,159 --> 02:40:54,200
called parents opposed to pot and they

3788
02:40:49,879 --> 02:40:58,398
are just they just push the negativity

3789
02:40:54,200 --> 02:41:01,520
so bad when as a parent with a kid that

3790
02:40:58,398 --> 02:41:03,559
was 13 when he started using cannabis

3791
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:07,600
which I never thought in a million years

3792
02:41:03,559 --> 02:41:10,600
that I would do um I just don't see a

3793
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:14,318
whole lot of negative other

3794
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:17,880
than the mentality of other people that

3795
02:41:14,318 --> 02:41:20,959
are against it still so if we can if we

3796
02:41:17,879 --> 02:41:23,438
can educate every one about the benefits

3797
02:41:20,959 --> 02:41:26,000
of it I think that you would see less

3798
02:41:23,439 --> 02:41:29,639
harm um

3799
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:31,639
than than using the plant um I think

3800
02:41:29,639 --> 02:41:34,478
that that's I think the negative you

3801
02:41:31,639 --> 02:41:37,358
know stigma of it is is really what

3802
02:41:34,478 --> 02:41:39,398
makes it worse and I think that you know

3803
02:41:37,359 --> 02:41:40,600
with everybody who has tried cannabis

3804
02:41:39,398 --> 02:41:44,478
you know there hasn't really been

3805
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:46,640
anybody that had a you know a bad effect

3806
02:41:44,478 --> 02:41:49,879
from it as far as you know somebody you

3807
02:41:46,639 --> 02:41:51,318
know getting sick from it as in you know

3808
02:41:49,879 --> 02:41:53,398
not gonna get cancer you're not gonna

3809
02:41:51,318 --> 02:41:55,318
get cancer or anything from it obviously

3810
02:41:53,398 --> 02:41:58,159
there are some canabo that have some

3811
02:41:55,318 --> 02:42:00,359
effects that you don't want to have like

3812
02:41:58,159 --> 02:42:02,239
I can't have thcv it's an appetite

3813
02:42:00,359 --> 02:42:04,159
suppressant you know I would lose a lot

3814
02:42:02,239 --> 02:42:06,359
of weight that you know not good for

3815
02:42:04,159 --> 02:42:09,840
someone with a wasting syndrome but it's

3816
02:42:06,359 --> 02:42:11,720
not to say that thcv is bad it's not bad

3817
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:14,840
it's doing exactly what it's designed to

3818
02:42:11,719 --> 02:42:16,519
do which is to suppress your appetite

3819
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:18,559
but there are obviously you know some

3820
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:20,960
people that should back off from that

3821
02:42:18,559 --> 02:42:22,719
conoid go to other cannaboids instead

3822
02:42:20,959 --> 02:42:25,159
and I think everybody can have a bad

3823
02:42:22,719 --> 02:42:27,879
trip and and like like dragonfly was

3824
02:42:25,159 --> 02:42:30,079
saying earlier they they you you have to

3825
02:42:27,879 --> 02:42:32,318
have good medicine you can't have all of

3826
02:42:30,079 --> 02:42:34,478
these chemicals you can't have all of

3827
02:42:32,318 --> 02:42:38,398
these things and I think that with

3828
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:40,398
education and good growing habits and

3829
02:42:38,398 --> 02:42:42,318
less Monopoly when it comes to these

3830
02:42:40,398 --> 02:42:44,000
huge companies that want to just take

3831
02:42:42,318 --> 02:42:46,478
over and make billions and billions of

3832
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,639
dollars I think that that's where we

3833
02:42:46,478 --> 02:42:52,239
need to start is making sure that people

3834
02:42:48,639 --> 02:42:53,680
are Ed at understand that yeah you know

3835
02:42:52,239 --> 02:42:55,959
if you have a bad trip it could have

3836
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:59,279
been because they're using monsano

3837
02:42:55,959 --> 02:43:03,039
pesticides and in your in your medicine

3838
02:42:59,279 --> 02:43:05,319
um and that it wasn't just a it could

3839
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:07,640
have just been a fluke that we have an

3840
02:43:05,318 --> 02:43:09,519
endoc canab cannabinoid system and that

3841
02:43:07,639 --> 02:43:12,318
we need to nourish it and we need to

3842
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:16,040
keep it saturated um but I think that it

3843
02:43:12,318 --> 02:43:17,760
is it is all encompassing of Education I

3844
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:19,160
think so too and I just wanted to bring

3845
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:21,000
up one thing that it's a different

3846
02:43:19,159 --> 02:43:23,318
perspective to you coling to like when

3847
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:25,120
you're in South America or in Brazil no

3848
02:43:23,318 --> 02:43:28,039
one knows which cannaboid they're

3849
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:29,479
consuming they're buying bre and that's

3850
02:43:28,040 --> 02:43:30,560
something that I like to bring up here

3851
02:43:29,478 --> 02:43:32,719
because it's such a different

3852
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:34,478
perspective when I when I asked about

3853
02:43:32,719 --> 02:43:35,840
the negative effects of cannabis is the

3854
02:43:34,478 --> 02:43:38,438
negative effects of cannabis and

3855
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:41,318
prohibitionist itself too that in a non-

3856
02:43:38,439 --> 02:43:44,120
legalized uh setting we have all these

3857
02:43:41,318 --> 02:43:45,920
other layers that doesn't have a market

3858
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:47,600
there no no testings at all you brought

3859
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:49,840
the testing so much today how this is

3860
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:52,559
important for a medical patient and over

3861
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:54,359
there people medicate themselves with

3862
02:43:52,559 --> 02:43:57,079
whatever weed they can find because they

3863
02:43:54,359 --> 02:43:59,439
recognize weed as something medical so

3864
02:43:57,079 --> 02:44:02,799
they are doing uh can of butter out of

3865
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:04,920
brick weed with a lot of like chemicals

3866
02:44:02,799 --> 02:44:06,318
on it and they're giving the cookies to

3867
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:08,318
their trying to give the cookies to

3868
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:10,600
their grandma and sometimes it's not

3869
02:44:08,318 --> 02:44:12,719
exactly positive for them so I believe

3870
02:44:10,600 --> 02:44:15,040
in you with the education right it's

3871
02:44:12,719 --> 02:44:18,239
that it's the tool for so people can

3872
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:21,399
balance if it's good or bad for them uh

3873
02:44:18,239 --> 02:44:23,799
I I I would add that and I wouldn't say

3874
02:44:21,398 --> 02:44:25,599
it's necessarily bad but I would say

3875
02:44:23,799 --> 02:44:27,879
that for certain mental health

3876
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:32,279
afflictions here in North America at

3877
02:44:27,879 --> 02:44:34,478
least I've seen cannabis not be helpful

3878
02:44:32,279 --> 02:44:37,000
and what I mean with by that is like how

3879
02:44:34,478 --> 02:44:39,799
we even deal with mental health in the

3880
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:41,799
first place and how it's so just swept

3881
02:44:39,799 --> 02:44:43,559
under the rug and no one it's fine if

3882
02:44:41,799 --> 02:44:45,199
you have a big tumor growing on your

3883
02:44:43,559 --> 02:44:46,719
neck people will feel bad for you and

3884
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:49,520
they'll care for you but if you have

3885
02:44:46,719 --> 02:44:51,559
something twisting in your mind that

3886
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,520
you're having difficulties with people

3887
02:44:51,559 --> 02:44:55,920
don't really have as much patience for

3888
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:58,279
that stuff they get scared for their own

3889
02:44:55,920 --> 02:45:01,398
well-being with certain mental health

3890
02:44:58,279 --> 02:45:03,279
afflictions and it's really you know

3891
02:45:01,398 --> 02:45:04,920
it's that is the major problem that

3892
02:45:03,279 --> 02:45:07,239
we're not you know this missing

3893
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:09,279
psychedelic component for taking care of

3894
02:45:07,239 --> 02:45:10,680
people and and care you know like I

3895
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:13,359
think it was

3896
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:16,159
um you know it was one of the guys that

3897
02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:17,359
dragonfly Earth medicine had on who I

3898
02:45:16,159 --> 02:45:20,478
guess he takes people through

3899
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:22,279
psychedelic Journeys and he was really

3900
02:45:20,478 --> 02:45:25,358
interesting he was talking about the

3901
02:45:22,279 --> 02:45:28,439
importance of bringing people back to

3902
02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:31,760
their moments of trauma holding them you

3903
02:45:28,439 --> 02:45:34,479
know in in your arms while they're in

3904
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:35,800
that moment of whatever their trauma is

3905
02:45:34,478 --> 02:45:37,599
you could be a little baby that was

3906
02:45:35,799 --> 02:45:39,358
getting left in the room because some

3907
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:41,479
book said it was a good idea to make

3908
02:45:39,359 --> 02:45:44,760
your baby sleep away from you for the

3909
02:45:41,478 --> 02:45:46,719
first like f the first night of its life

3910
02:45:44,760 --> 02:45:48,639
it's like what a crazy crazy thing to

3911
02:45:46,719 --> 02:45:50,920
convince mothers of but it it happens

3912
02:45:48,639 --> 02:45:52,478
and so you know there's all of these

3913
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:54,000
different things with mental health that

3914
02:45:52,478 --> 02:45:55,478
we've got these major problems and I

3915
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,639
think if we can take care of that with

3916
02:45:55,478 --> 02:45:59,358
the missing component that is

3917
02:45:56,639 --> 02:46:01,039
psychedelic plant medicines and fungi

3918
02:45:59,359 --> 02:46:03,640
that we'll see maybe less of it but I

3919
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:06,080
have seen some people who have used

3920
02:46:03,639 --> 02:46:08,920
cannabis almost in an addictive way

3921
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:11,279
smoking it like crazy amounts throughout

3922
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:13,359
the day and just and and you can see

3923
02:46:11,279 --> 02:46:15,680
that it it it wasn't being helpful I had

3924
02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:17,920
a roommate who actually had to stop

3925
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:20,520
eventually because it was it was really

3926
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:23,040
just it was too much for him especially

3927
02:46:20,520 --> 02:46:25,079
the way he was uh using it and I felt

3928
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:28,160
that from that relationship I've learned

3929
02:46:25,079 --> 02:46:30,000
that because I use it in such I am an

3930
02:46:28,159 --> 02:46:31,959
anomaly to a lot of people that in the

3931
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,200
amounts that I use it maybe not to you

3932
02:46:31,959 --> 02:46:35,879
people here on this particular panel but

3933
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:37,600
to a lot of people they'll get together

3934
02:46:35,879 --> 02:46:40,398
with me and I'll always say listen like

3935
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:42,279
you don't have to keep up this isn't a

3936
02:46:40,398 --> 02:46:45,439
keeping up thing like I don't want you

3937
02:46:42,279 --> 02:46:47,399
to uh you know to feel that every time I

3938
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:50,040
have a little dab that you also should

3939
02:46:47,398 --> 02:46:51,799
have a little dab and uh you know that

3940
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:54,240
relationship with my old roommate really

3941
02:46:51,799 --> 02:46:55,759
taught me that that you know be aware

3942
02:46:54,239 --> 02:46:58,199
that everyone's going through different

3943
02:46:55,760 --> 02:47:00,920
things and that uh you know everyone has

3944
02:46:58,200 --> 02:47:02,279
different capabilities so that's what I

3945
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:05,359
would say about that

3946
02:47:02,279 --> 02:47:06,920
Alice uh I I will speak on two one I

3947
02:47:05,359 --> 02:47:09,200
will speak directly to what you spoke

3948
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:11,200
toward Marcus because there studies that

3949
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:13,399
have shown that people who do have

3950
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:16,319
multiple personality disorders or

3951
02:47:13,398 --> 02:47:18,119
schizophrenia it does allow using of

3952
02:47:16,318 --> 02:47:20,478
cannabis allows them to slip more

3953
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:22,600
lucidly in between uh their

3954
02:47:20,478 --> 02:47:23,879
personalities I've seen VA studies

3955
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:26,680
regarding this

3956
02:47:23,879 --> 02:47:29,000
specific and a newer more interesting

3957
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:30,960
one that is somewhat controversial which

3958
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:33,920
is cannaboid

3959
02:47:30,959 --> 02:47:37,719
hyperemesis syndrome which causes

3960
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:40,799
chronic nausea uh I had a friend of mine

3961
02:47:37,719 --> 02:47:43,719
uh daughter uh she was 16 and using

3962
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:46,119
cannabis she got there on the islands in

3963
02:47:43,719 --> 02:47:49,398
Hawaii and just

3964
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:51,479
became chronically nauseous

3965
02:47:49,398 --> 02:47:53,278
every time she became she smoked

3966
02:47:51,478 --> 02:47:57,438
cannabis to the point where she had to

3967
02:47:53,279 --> 02:48:00,840
go to the uh hospital um so uh people

3968
02:47:57,439 --> 02:48:02,520
are finding that um and a small

3969
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:04,520
percentage of the community are finding

3970
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:06,439
that you know cannabis does not work for

3971
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:10,040
them some people are allergic and this

3972
02:48:06,439 --> 02:48:12,639
most recent one um I would ask Dr Dron

3973
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:16,319
are you familiar with the uh canono

3974
02:48:12,639 --> 02:48:18,840
hyperemisis syndrome yeah I am it's

3975
02:48:16,318 --> 02:48:20,079
interesting though it seems at least at

3976
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:22,760
least in some of the patients that I

3977
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:26,559
work with it seems to be

3978
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:28,800
THC that causes it more so than CBD and

3979
02:48:26,559 --> 02:48:31,519
so some of our oncology patients will

3980
02:48:28,799 --> 02:48:34,239
switch them when they have these re the

3981
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:36,560
kind of uh type of reactions to

3982
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:39,000
cannabis we will switch them to like a

3983
02:48:36,559 --> 02:48:42,398
CBD and they don't seem to have the same

3984
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,680
kind of like nausea uh physical pain

3985
02:48:42,398 --> 02:48:45,599
that the hyper mesis um seems to bring

3986
02:48:44,680 --> 02:48:49,279
with high

3987
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:52,239
THC I've also read a a study that it had

3988
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:55,000
a lot some of it could have had to do

3989
02:48:52,239 --> 02:48:58,159
with neem oil and I don't I don't know

3990
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:00,959
about that um but there I've heard I've

3991
02:48:58,159 --> 02:49:03,559
heard that theory come up I've heard

3992
02:49:00,959 --> 02:49:05,919
that theory too but no confirmation just

3993
02:49:03,559 --> 02:49:08,278
to science to back that up it's all hear

3994
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:10,120
saiying conjecture at this time if

3995
02:49:08,279 --> 02:49:13,640
there's a study that backs it up I'll be

3996
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:15,640
happy to cite it Alice you have well

3997
02:49:13,639 --> 02:49:17,478
I've been doing a a bunch of study you

3998
02:49:15,639 --> 02:49:20,799
know research and and looking up on

3999
02:49:17,478 --> 02:49:23,238
hyper mesis syndrome and and what we're

4000
02:49:20,799 --> 02:49:27,318
also finding is that it's sort of

4001
02:49:23,238 --> 02:49:29,439
becoming um an overlay maybe like a a

4002
02:49:27,318 --> 02:49:32,439
whitewash if you will sort of like

4003
02:49:29,439 --> 02:49:35,398
fibromyalgia you know you come in with

4004
02:49:32,439 --> 02:49:37,639
with pain and and doctors are really

4005
02:49:35,398 --> 02:49:40,920
they need to have a diagnosis it's part

4006
02:49:37,639 --> 02:49:42,799
of the medical industry to give you a

4007
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:45,359
diagnosis so they have to give you

4008
02:49:42,799 --> 02:49:47,519
something so hyper Mesi Syndrome has

4009
02:49:45,359 --> 02:49:50,079
been coming up a lot they'll ask people

4010
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:53,040
do you smoke they're having a lot of of

4011
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:55,520
of puking we're also finding that within

4012
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:59,760
those people if we ask further questions

4013
02:49:55,520 --> 02:50:02,120
can you please test the enzy the enzymes

4014
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:04,238
um of the stool and of the blood for

4015
02:50:02,120 --> 02:50:06,680
gallbladder a lot of these people are

4016
02:50:04,238 --> 02:50:09,359
having gallbladder issues

4017
02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:12,398
simultaneously and is the endoc canabo

4018
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:15,479
system sparking something also

4019
02:50:12,398 --> 02:50:17,639
thca isn't seemingly reacting in the

4020
02:50:15,478 --> 02:50:20,840
same way so you know I just wanted to

4021
02:50:17,639 --> 02:50:24,039
further what you're saying Allison thcs

4022
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:27,600
has been very active with whatever this

4023
02:50:24,040 --> 02:50:31,880
syndrome or reaction is thca has not

4024
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:34,238
been so much like CBD also so there's a

4025
02:50:31,879 --> 02:50:37,159
lot of um information out there that we

4026
02:50:34,238 --> 02:50:39,279
just don't know enough about as well as

4027
02:50:37,159 --> 02:50:41,279
chirpings you know I know Colin you

4028
02:50:39,279 --> 02:50:43,520
would probably have a lot to say about

4029
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:47,159
this there's people who are reacting

4030
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:50,120
directly to tpine consumption and when

4031
02:50:47,159 --> 02:50:53,520
we re uh you know h uh grow plants that

4032
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:56,040
are very very low in tpin those people

4033
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:59,840
who have these symptoms and symptomatic

4034
02:50:56,040 --> 02:51:03,000
effects from certain high aromatics of

4035
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:05,359
of of of cultivars when we reduce those

4036
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:06,559
aromatics they do much better so there's

4037
02:51:05,359 --> 02:51:09,279
a lot of

4038
02:51:06,559 --> 02:51:12,439
unknowns this anecdotal evidence that

4039
02:51:09,279 --> 02:51:15,920
we've seen in family that have H have

4040
02:51:12,439 --> 02:51:18,120
had hyper mesis really bad will smoke it

4041
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:19,238
come back from a weekend of of smoking

4042
02:51:18,120 --> 02:51:21,760
other

4043
02:51:19,238 --> 02:51:24,520
herb that's wherever at an event and

4044
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:27,520
then have some of our herb that we grew

4045
02:51:24,520 --> 02:51:32,279
and not have any effects of it at all so

4046
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:35,319
it's definitely common to find Cannabis

4047
02:51:32,279 --> 02:51:38,200
with chemicals so one of the harms with

4048
02:51:35,318 --> 02:51:40,959
cannabis might be that it's a dynamic

4049
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:45,319
accumulator and one of the harms is it

4050
02:51:40,959 --> 02:51:47,599
uptakes bad attitudes right and int and

4051
02:51:45,318 --> 02:51:49,079
chemicals and those bad attitudes and

4052
02:51:47,600 --> 02:51:51,880
chemicals re

4053
02:51:49,079 --> 02:51:53,478
act in our body it's also wisdom weed so

4054
02:51:51,879 --> 02:51:55,199
sometimes it brings out the ailments

4055
02:51:53,478 --> 02:51:56,438
that we need to pay attention to so

4056
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:59,760
sometimes if you smoke weed and you get

4057
02:51:56,439 --> 02:52:01,960
an adverse ailment it might be a window

4058
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:05,079
towards something else that might be

4059
02:52:01,959 --> 02:52:07,159
happening and so also one other thing is

4060
02:52:05,079 --> 02:52:09,760
another harm to cannabis would be maybe

4061
02:52:07,159 --> 02:52:12,680
to say that it's the one thing that can

4062
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:14,960
heal you so one thing that's harmful is

4063
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:18,840
it's not the only thing that can heal

4064
02:52:14,959 --> 02:52:22,639
you it's one of the things that you use

4065
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:26,920
along with health well-being exercise

4066
02:52:22,639 --> 02:52:30,358
Community connectivity diversity and

4067
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:33,359
love and food

4068
02:52:30,359 --> 02:52:35,559
juicing those things definitely I mean

4069
02:52:33,359 --> 02:52:37,720
and music your life those things are

4070
02:52:35,559 --> 02:52:40,439
definitely yes um those things are

4071
02:52:37,719 --> 02:52:42,478
definitely um something that we learned

4072
02:52:40,439 --> 02:52:44,398
coming into you know we're newbies at

4073
02:52:42,478 --> 02:52:46,478
cannabis still I mean we've been in in

4074
02:52:44,398 --> 02:52:50,000
involved in this situation for seven

4075
02:52:46,478 --> 02:52:52,238
years Colton decided now to not just

4076
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:54,879
have Crohn's disease but have massive

4077
02:52:52,238 --> 02:52:58,799
migraine headaches and cannabis isn't

4078
02:52:54,879 --> 02:53:01,238
touching them so it is the

4079
02:52:58,799 --> 02:53:04,478
all-encompassing it's your whole

4080
02:53:01,238 --> 02:53:07,639
wellbeing it it is music it is love it

4081
02:53:04,478 --> 02:53:10,679
is psychedelics it is conventional

4082
02:53:07,639 --> 02:53:13,358
medicines it is cannabis it's everything

4083
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:17,079
and you just have to find what that is

4084
02:53:13,359 --> 02:53:18,720
um and and and enjoy it and and be in

4085
02:53:17,079 --> 02:53:21,000
the in the moment with it it's it's not

4086
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:22,840
an all for All or Nothing system you

4087
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:25,760
know there are people that use you know

4088
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:27,439
cannabis alongside their pharmaceutical

4089
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:30,439
uh regimens and they're having great

4090
02:53:27,439 --> 02:53:33,840
success with it uh so it's really it's

4091
02:53:30,439 --> 02:53:36,559
always about what you as an individual

4092
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:38,840
need for your body it's never about you

4093
02:53:36,559 --> 02:53:41,600
know oh well everybody is doing this so

4094
02:53:38,840 --> 02:53:43,760
I'll do it that way too uh even though

4095
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:45,399
you know a lot of people may be taking

4096
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:46,600
the same medicine that you are it

4097
02:53:45,398 --> 02:53:48,079
doesn't mean that you have to be taking

4098
02:53:46,600 --> 02:53:50,279
it the same way or you have to be taking

4099
02:53:48,079 --> 02:53:52,600
the same amount you know your body

4100
02:53:50,279 --> 02:53:55,040
requires different things so don't be

4101
02:53:52,600 --> 02:53:57,439
afraid of only using one thing to meet

4102
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:59,600
those qualifications or using multiple

4103
02:53:57,439 --> 02:54:01,079
things to meet those qualifications

4104
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:03,079
because that's the journey that we're

4105
02:54:01,079 --> 02:54:06,200
going to be heading on you know with his

4106
02:54:03,079 --> 02:54:08,680
migraines is is trying to find to to see

4107
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:11,800
if psilocybon would be beneficial for

4108
02:54:08,680 --> 02:54:16,559
Colton's migraines um cannabis doesn't

4109
02:54:11,799 --> 02:54:18,959
so it's obviously not the the perfect

4110
02:54:16,559 --> 02:54:22,238
solution for for his body

4111
02:54:18,959 --> 02:54:23,959
when it comes to his me his migraines

4112
02:54:22,238 --> 02:54:26,559
but it is a great solution for his

4113
02:54:23,959 --> 02:54:29,559
Crohn's disease um so I think using

4114
02:54:26,559 --> 02:54:31,119
everything in Your Arsenal and your in

4115
02:54:29,559 --> 02:54:33,719
in in the world that you can get your

4116
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:36,520
hands on is is definitely

4117
02:54:33,719 --> 02:54:39,559
beneficial and with no Stigma right

4118
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:42,359
that's the thing no stigmas no stigmas I

4119
02:54:39,559 --> 02:54:44,680
think that's a really big thing um

4120
02:54:42,359 --> 02:54:45,920
changes thei that the person's GNA have

4121
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:47,800
like if you're in a prohibitionist

4122
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:48,920
setting there's a way more of a

4123
02:54:47,799 --> 02:54:50,358
possibility

4124
02:54:48,920 --> 02:54:52,680
that if you take a psychedelic you're

4125
02:54:50,359 --> 02:54:54,120
going to go into a difficult trip

4126
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:56,318
doesn't have to be a bad trip right but

4127
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:58,040
a difficult time because you're going to

4128
02:54:56,318 --> 02:54:59,920
uh you're going to go through that it's

4129
02:54:58,040 --> 02:55:01,960
prohibited okay my mom doesn't know I'm

4130
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:03,760
here I'm taking something that no one

4131
02:55:01,959 --> 02:55:05,079
knows I don't know what the [ __ ] this is

4132
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:06,760
because I don't know what's in there and

4133
02:55:05,079 --> 02:55:09,120
I mean if you know so there's a lot of

4134
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:10,920
things that uh connect to that and

4135
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:13,000
there's it's definitely your mental ill

4136
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:15,639
you know that's that's your mental

4137
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,719
capacity and your mental state is

4138
02:55:15,639 --> 02:55:18,840
definitely something that that would

4139
02:55:17,719 --> 02:55:22,959
react

4140
02:55:18,840 --> 02:55:25,000
to negatively towards your your trip if

4141
02:55:22,959 --> 02:55:27,079
if you were in like oh my gosh you know

4142
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:28,920
am I going to get caught you know that's

4143
02:55:27,079 --> 02:55:31,639
one of the reasons why we thought okay

4144
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:33,920
moving to Colorado where we're safe

4145
02:55:31,639 --> 02:55:35,680
where we have access where mentally

4146
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:39,238
we're

4147
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:42,559
relaxed that it's going to make his his

4148
02:55:39,238 --> 02:55:45,559
opportunity to for health better I think

4149
02:55:42,559 --> 02:55:46,799
mental stigma is a huge thing most

4150
02:55:45,559 --> 02:55:48,799
dangerous thing about cannabis is

4151
02:55:46,799 --> 02:55:50,438
getting caught with it yeah

4152
02:55:48,799 --> 02:55:53,000
it's true and there's one thing that

4153
02:55:50,439 --> 02:55:55,000
Marcus shared about like mental health

4154
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:57,079
that uh well I graduated in Psychology

4155
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:58,680
before I changed my life for the to grow

4156
02:55:57,079 --> 02:56:02,478
weed

4157
02:55:58,680 --> 02:56:05,120
but I some some two subjects that I I

4158
02:56:02,478 --> 02:56:07,639
see cannabis as as a tool to help out

4159
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:10,120
but also if it's used improperly as a

4160
02:56:07,639 --> 02:56:13,159
tool to make you go deeper even deeper

4161
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:17,120
in the hole is anxiety and depression

4162
02:56:13,159 --> 02:56:19,520
too and it all depends on what uh what

4163
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:21,520
you were all saying especially damn pure

4164
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:23,319
that brings this holistic experience

4165
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:24,760
that it's not only the Cannabis itself

4166
02:56:23,318 --> 02:56:26,478
right it's everything that comes with it

4167
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:29,398
all your daily habits and things like

4168
02:56:26,478 --> 02:56:32,318
this but with people that have like a

4169
02:56:29,398 --> 02:56:35,439
severe anxiety consuming high THC higher

4170
02:56:32,318 --> 02:56:37,639
THC profiles can help them can even be a

4171
02:56:35,439 --> 02:56:39,920
factor that help them like have one more

4172
02:56:37,639 --> 02:56:41,920
of an anxiety crisis but different

4173
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:44,120
cannabinoids with different ways of

4174
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:47,680
consuming it can help out settle down

4175
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:49,160
and to calm down too so it's very crazy

4176
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:51,200
that just the knowledge and the

4177
02:56:49,159 --> 02:56:53,639
education towards the plant can change

4178
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:55,439
the whole experience you can get with it

4179
02:56:53,639 --> 02:56:59,039
and I just wanted to shine a light on

4180
02:56:55,439 --> 02:57:02,600
this too because mental illness and uh

4181
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:03,800
and every every every medicine it

4182
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:05,640
doesn't it doesn't matter if it's

4183
02:57:03,799 --> 02:57:08,318
cannabis or if it's an anti-depressive

4184
02:57:05,639 --> 02:57:10,799
medicine it's uh like a tra from the

4185
02:57:08,318 --> 02:57:12,478
traditional you know like uh sorry my

4186
02:57:10,799 --> 02:57:14,559
English is kind of is kind of kind of

4187
02:57:12,478 --> 02:57:17,199
sucks sometimes but from from like this

4188
02:57:14,559 --> 02:57:19,719
medical traditional medical environment

4189
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:21,040
uh every person it's subjective and

4190
02:57:19,719 --> 02:57:24,318
every person is going to create an

4191
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:26,279
experience towards that so uh with

4192
02:57:24,318 --> 02:57:29,238
cannabis it's the same thing and he has

4193
02:57:26,279 --> 02:57:31,680
to be taken care of and seen and taken

4194
02:57:29,238 --> 02:57:33,719
care of by a community not only by a

4195
02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:36,639
psychiatrist not only by a doctor that

4196
02:57:33,719 --> 02:57:38,559
only sees the symptom and I think that

4197
02:57:36,639 --> 02:57:40,159
cannabis at this point I wanted to bring

4198
02:57:38,559 --> 02:57:42,000
up the subject about the good and the

4199
02:57:40,159 --> 02:57:43,920
bad parts of cannabis because I think

4200
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:46,238
that that creates a setting while

4201
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:47,879
someone has the autonomy to balance

4202
02:57:46,238 --> 02:57:49,600
everything and make a choice like oh

4203
02:57:47,879 --> 02:57:51,679
okay in Colorado so I can make these

4204
02:57:49,600 --> 02:57:53,079
choices or I'm in Brazil so I can make

4205
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:55,398
exactly the choices I wanted but I have

4206
02:57:53,079 --> 02:57:57,478
to go with the flow of what I have here

4207
02:57:55,398 --> 02:58:00,680
and I just wanted to bring this up and

4208
02:57:57,478 --> 02:58:03,519
uh bring this bring the subject

4209
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:07,000
up I'd like to I appreciate it go ahead

4210
02:58:03,520 --> 02:58:09,159
Wade yeah uh I love the question great

4211
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:13,000
one Alice

4212
02:58:09,159 --> 02:58:15,639
um I've seen two potential problems if

4213
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:19,000
you will with using cannabis uh one of

4214
02:58:15,639 --> 02:58:21,199
them uh is overdose cannabis has a

4215
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:23,159
really strong biphasic effect where you

4216
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:26,159
get certain effects and experience at

4217
02:58:23,159 --> 02:58:28,200
low doses but when you increase the dose

4218
02:58:26,159 --> 02:58:30,478
particularly if you and you use the

4219
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:32,479
example of somebody who takes brick weed

4220
02:58:30,478 --> 02:58:35,438
and makes cookies and gives it to their

4221
02:58:32,478 --> 02:58:39,398
grandmother and grandmother gets like

4222
02:58:35,439 --> 02:58:42,238
150 milligrams of THC and she never

4223
02:58:39,398 --> 02:58:44,519
wants to talk about cannabis again and

4224
02:58:42,238 --> 02:58:46,760
she's lost the opportunity to experience

4225
02:58:44,520 --> 02:58:48,680
some of the healing effects that

4226
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:50,478
cannabis can offer

4227
02:58:48,680 --> 02:58:52,359
and I think that's a problem and that's

4228
02:58:50,478 --> 02:58:54,879
about education which has come up a

4229
02:58:52,359 --> 02:58:55,960
number of times today the other place

4230
02:58:54,879 --> 02:58:59,519
that I've seen

4231
02:58:55,959 --> 02:59:01,959
cannabis potentially be a problem is at

4232
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:03,640
the right dose and the right chemistry

4233
02:59:01,959 --> 02:59:05,839
cannabis has really remarkable

4234
02:59:03,639 --> 02:59:08,478
properties to relieve

4235
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:10,680
pain and pain is actually a message from

4236
02:59:08,478 --> 02:59:13,478
your body to stop doing what's causing

4237
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:16,120
the pain and I know from personal

4238
02:59:13,478 --> 02:59:18,840
experience that you can use cannabis to

4239
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:20,920
the point where you can hurt yourself

4240
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:23,000
and that's a problem and again that's an

4241
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:25,398
education thing it's helping people

4242
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:30,040
understand how cannabis interacts with

4243
02:59:25,398 --> 02:59:32,278
our uh OC canono system and how it can

4244
02:59:30,040 --> 02:59:35,760
help our bodies not just heal Trauma

4245
02:59:32,279 --> 02:59:37,960
from injury or overuse but really help

4246
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:39,159
our bodies find the condition we call

4247
02:59:37,959 --> 02:59:43,799
Wellness or

4248
02:59:39,159 --> 02:59:45,439
health and and I'm really excited about

4249
02:59:43,799 --> 02:59:47,398
something I've been doing a lot and I

4250
02:59:45,439 --> 02:59:49,639
want to throw this in here I've created

4251
02:59:47,398 --> 02:59:52,760
an education program for a local

4252
02:59:49,639 --> 02:59:56,119
dispensary here and uh part of that

4253
02:59:52,760 --> 02:59:57,800
program is to help the consumer who

4254
02:59:56,120 --> 02:59:59,520
doesn't know much at all about cannabis

4255
02:59:57,799 --> 03:00:03,039
other than well if you smoke a joint you

4256
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:05,120
get high help a consumer to understand

4257
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:08,200
how cannabis Wellness might work in

4258
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:09,680
their life and also a pro part of the

4259
03:00:08,200 --> 03:00:11,560
other part of the program is for the

4260
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:14,720
wellness Associates the people who are

4261
03:00:11,559 --> 03:00:17,159
doing the transactions in the dispensary

4262
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:19,840
helping them to understand what does

4263
03:00:17,159 --> 03:00:21,879
cannabis as a wellness product not just

4264
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:25,960
as a medicine but as a wellness product

4265
03:00:21,879 --> 03:00:29,119
is helping people find this

4266
03:00:25,959 --> 03:00:31,238
wholeness uh that we call Health and it

4267
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:33,279
is possible to have that and mental

4268
03:00:31,238 --> 03:00:35,079
health particularly with the covid and

4269
03:00:33,279 --> 03:00:37,159
so many people being forced into

4270
03:00:35,079 --> 03:00:38,879
isolation mental health I think is a

4271
03:00:37,159 --> 03:00:41,318
huge issue and I think the conversation

4272
03:00:38,879 --> 03:00:45,519
today has been really fruitful in this

4273
03:00:41,318 --> 03:00:48,000
way um I'm looking forward to uh more

4274
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:49,399
people having access to the uh

4275
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:51,120
educational thing that I've been putting

4276
03:00:49,398 --> 03:00:53,159
together because I'm really excited

4277
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:56,040
about it I've realized I'm trying to

4278
03:00:53,159 --> 03:00:57,920
address a perceived need where people

4279
03:00:56,040 --> 03:01:00,520
don't really understand what we talk

4280
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:03,760
about when we speak of cannabis as

4281
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:05,880
medicine and uh I wanted to touch on one

4282
03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:08,880
other thing that was said earlier in the

4283
03:01:05,879 --> 03:01:12,879
conversation about isolates and

4284
03:01:08,879 --> 03:01:15,599
concentrates and I'm a big fan of the

4285
03:01:12,879 --> 03:01:17,278
canono but really when because we're

4286
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:18,520
talking about patients and patient

4287
03:01:17,279 --> 03:01:20,720
well-being

4288
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:22,520
every person's ECS is different and

4289
03:01:20,719 --> 03:01:25,079
every person responds differently to

4290
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:28,159
cannabis preparations so it's really

4291
03:01:25,079 --> 03:01:31,000
important for opportunity to be

4292
03:01:28,159 --> 03:01:33,719
available to people for seeds to get out

4293
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:35,478
to as many people as possible and let

4294
03:01:33,719 --> 03:01:37,278
them start trying to find the plant

4295
03:01:35,478 --> 03:01:41,679
that's going to work for them because

4296
03:01:37,279 --> 03:01:43,880
this plant will uh assert itself herself

4297
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:48,238
in knowing you and providing the

4298
03:01:43,879 --> 03:01:50,599
medicine the chemistry that is uh again

4299
03:01:48,238 --> 03:01:53,279
this the genetics of this plant like you

4300
03:01:50,600 --> 03:01:54,640
mentioned Blue Dream part pardon my rant

4301
03:01:53,279 --> 03:01:57,279
I know I'm taking up a lot of time right

4302
03:01:54,639 --> 03:02:01,000
at the end of the show but uh I'm really

4303
03:01:57,279 --> 03:02:03,359
excited about it uh Blue Dream you

4304
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:05,840
know does really well in certain parts

4305
03:02:03,359 --> 03:02:07,640
of California I can imagine in Illinois

4306
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:09,639
where the environmental conditions are

4307
03:02:07,639 --> 03:02:11,358
very different the genetics of that

4308
03:02:09,639 --> 03:02:13,920
plant would give you a completely

4309
03:02:11,359 --> 03:02:16,840
different result and yeah analytical

4310
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:20,680
testing is really an essential thing so

4311
03:02:16,840 --> 03:02:22,719
on that note happy New Year everyone and

4312
03:02:20,680 --> 03:02:26,000
much love and much respect to each of

4313
03:02:22,719 --> 03:02:27,559
you and I'll stop renting now thank you

4314
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:29,398
thank you Wade I didn't think of that as

4315
03:02:27,559 --> 03:02:31,680
a rant at all but it was a great way to

4316
03:02:29,398 --> 03:02:34,439
kind of end out the show sort of Polish

4317
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:36,600
it off my little son is anxious for me

4318
03:02:34,439 --> 03:02:38,639
to go spend the afternoon with him and

4319
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:41,079
I'm actually very anxious to go spend

4320
03:02:38,639 --> 03:02:44,879
the afternoon with him so I want to

4321
03:02:41,079 --> 03:02:47,159
thank everyone if you are into it uh we

4322
03:02:44,879 --> 03:02:49,039
can continue this next Sunday and have

4323
03:02:47,159 --> 03:02:50,600
more discussion about everything that we

4324
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:54,319
just talked about I am going to figure

4325
03:02:50,600 --> 03:02:57,520
out a kind of behind the scenes separate

4326
03:02:54,318 --> 03:03:00,719
show for the mushroom um the uh

4327
03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:02,840
traversing the fungal terpenome as uh

4328
03:03:00,719 --> 03:03:04,879
Josh hooked us up with earlier that'll

4329
03:03:02,840 --> 03:03:07,200
be the new mushroom show the first of
