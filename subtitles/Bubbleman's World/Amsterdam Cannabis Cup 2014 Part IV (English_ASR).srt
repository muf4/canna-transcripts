and what we're doing with our water ash

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,939
techniques same trace was actually

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,159
floured outside full Sun Colorado its

21
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,019
weight and then the growth was growing

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,719
inside so there's a really nice rounded

23
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,250
profile there fuckin'-a man we're gonna

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,650
have to get you guys on hash Church one

the room or somewhere else but we'll get

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,530
a good venue we'll have maybe two or

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,769
three computers open simultaneously with

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,159
to two to three people on each computer

45
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:14,519

48
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,869
cure and just sound like an individual

49
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:38,189
graham jar might eventually end up

50
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,890
lighting out those are the things that

51
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,719
really make sure your hash stays

52
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,619
perfectly granular when you're working

53
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,620
with fresh frozen material

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,120
there are chunks that might not end up

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,300
perfectly drugged but it's your job as a

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,129
hash maker to make sure you can identify

57
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,410
those chunks that are not properly

58
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,659
drying so you don't say promis-- the

59
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:04,699
quality of the rest of your hash there

60
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,259
are will always be the one little piece

61
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,699
that does not fit perfectly through the

62
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:10,699
sieve or perfectly through the micro

63
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:13,209
planer that you need to remove from the

64
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:13,209
rest of the hash

65
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,620
have interesting

66
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,620

00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,798
[Music]

146
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:10,059

148
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:15,039
waiting for for those guys up

149
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:22,289
that's not about the Windham it's a big

150
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:29,079
one there you go

151
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:31,149
we do that every time - let's hope that

152
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,410
one doesn't let it be one of the biggest

153
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:49,019
one that's for sure we have it on camera

154
00:09:35,409 --> 00:10:03,309
that's when paper shot you so much yeah

155
00:09:49,019 --> 00:10:03,789
yeah we use for watches it's actually

156
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:10,000
pretty good

157
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:11,250
I mean be the amount of what would be

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,960
about two ounces

159
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,960
you guys gotta open it before you like

160
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,830
trimmed at all but the value on it I

161
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,750
mean the cost on that's a lot less -

162
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,210
because not near as many people have had

163
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,570
a handle it it hasn't had a occupy any

164
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,460
space getting hung dry so they're

165
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,620
sitting pretty a pretty good return as

166
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,780
far as just a few turkeys oh that's nice

167
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,610
it's been the fact that little that

like the resin is visible from a great

202
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:50,299
distance with the naked eye dry suit

203
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,980

sentries have a sniff of it is s called

207
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:11,209
I couldn't

208
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:16,318
oh yeah beautiful ute OCD representing

209
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:17,958
with cannabis not riddlin oh my god

210
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:20,578
which ones that

211
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,859
that's enough of granddaddy terms but a

212
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:24,088
different long fantastic a couple

213
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,188
different plants which basically it

214
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,529
works out Frieda plants we've had to

215
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:31,349
divide up for out in four four grams

216
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:34,139
because it's the strain not cut in or

217
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,389
right Rome once I checked and they said

218
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,419
yep that's cool to do that as long as

219
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:41,009
it's the same strain cool that's how

220
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,870
we're doing it I figured that's the true

221
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:45,499
representation of what seed companies

222
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:49,709
capable so the interesting way to end up

223
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:51,269
almost upon us but snow that right which

224
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:54,268

225
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:58,230

229
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:11,269
sfv can melt geez but let's head Jim

230
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:11,269
small that one the name got me excited

231
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:18,359
it's very yeah it's very reminiscent of

232
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,120
liked Angie's and marmalade Jilly bean

233
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,740
but it's it's different there's like a

234
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,078
creamy orange sherbert behind like the

235
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,629
orange zest like rotting orange like any

236
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,198
kind of associate Angie would it's

237
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:33,199
pretty sweet

238
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:42,189
big shopping bag full of dank weed

239
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:47,500

240
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:54,730

little bit better with the light huh

247
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:23,279

296
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,380
like can you even try to name off

297
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,170
someone like all the flavors we've been

298
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:53,620
hitting everything from yogurt custard

299
00:18:50,170 --> 00:19:03,300
sour fruit purplish heat

300
00:18:53,619 --> 00:19:07,599
sweet buttery haze hazy skunky just

301
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:09,460
citrus lemons yeah let's see over there

302
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,429
we got the glue we got the gorilla glue

303
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,829
yeah we got the fabuloso blue suede

304
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,190
shoes we got the blue suede shoes over

305
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:18,460
there

306
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,860
and then there was another one that he

307
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,319
put in there was the baby Ross Betty

308
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:25,569
Ross Betty Ross do a little googling on

309
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,669
Betty Ross you guys and you'll find out

310
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:30,429
who she is she may or may not be related

311
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:35,220
to in some form another to a Bruce

312
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,220
Banner beer no water

313
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,700
just get that last little bit of heat

314
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:42,490
when you're pressing resin you require

315
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,880
two things you require heat and/or

316
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:48,849
pressure the more pressure the more heat

317
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,640
is created the more heat you use the

318
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:53,949
less pressure is required those are the

319
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,080
two things you require to press hash so

320
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,720
I've shown quite a few methods over the

321
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,879
years from the old wine bottle technique

322
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,910
and the steaming of the hash on the on

323
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,090
the stove on low to heat up the resin

324
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:10,360
indirectly it's never a bad idea so this

325
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:13,209
is another great way with the oil slick

326
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,769
product there I can't believe you can

327
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,230
heat that up to 500 degrees

328
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:19,629
doesn't yeah we're way below the of

329
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:25,410
course yeah I would suspect or the 100

330
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:27,670
Rangers that's yeah thanks a lot
