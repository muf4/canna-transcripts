an Alex as well I had sent it to them as

60
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,450
well but I think the way it happened

61
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,680
this morning that things did not get

62
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:45,818
sent the way they should have gotten

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,290
sent so it should be conversation today

64
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,669
they're gonna come on we're gonna talk

65
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,370
about the way they're doing their new

66
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:53,048
test for the the country fair that's

67
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,670
happening in Layton bill in July they've

68
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,849
broken the categories into five

69
00:02:54,669 --> 00:03:00,488
different categories based on terpene

70
00:02:57,848 --> 00:03:03,119
expressions oh yeah you said that that

71
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,709
looks really cool

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,789
yeah well this is a that would be a

73
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,140
first of its kind yes leave that up to

74
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:15,519
the people at the end woke up of course

75
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:16,839
I think it we have to push you know it's

76
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,909
good to see things pushing in a

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,019
different direction at least challenging

78
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:25,150
the status quo yeah they're defining

79
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,150
cannabis culture in a lot of ways they

80
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,010
are not waiting for permission they are

81
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,659
actually coming out and doing it really

82
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,348
well this new event that they're doing

83
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:36,879
is based solely on organic horticulture

84
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:38,469
which i think is really great it's like

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,060
the old-timers stepping up and saying

86
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,500
hey we have to be stewards of the

87
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,000
environment we have to pay attention to

88
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,979
what we're doing and I think that's

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,620
fantastic

90
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:49,000
personally well it's nice to see them

91
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,709
changing it up and doing something a

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,598
little bit different and you know the

93
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,979
importance of terpenes that we have

94
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:56,229
learned in the last 20 years

95
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:57,909
hey welcome Sam hey we have to be

96
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:01,030
stewards of the farm you have to pay

97
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:04,449
attention and what we're doing and it's

98
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,689
like deja vu that was such a weird deja

99
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:09,429
vu I was like I've heard this before the

100
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:13,659
importance of terpenes that you've

101
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,870
learned hey he stays on I keep repeating

102
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:20,699
the same [ __ ] I apologize I'm you them

103
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,699
I'll just mute I'm he'll figure it out

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,859
the terpenes are where the Terps are

105
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:28,478
where it's act well they're definitely a

106
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,919
part of it for sure a very important

107
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,228
part that maybe for a long time we

108
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,728
weren't quite as aware of seems like the

109
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:38,788
community is becoming more and more

110
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:42,120
aware Tim's here welcome to mr. Salinger

could you please tell us a little bit

117
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:59,168
about what you're doing up in

118
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,818
Laytonsville and the new country fair

119
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:03,038
and then we wanted to ask you about the

120
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,229
new competition and how you are breaking

121
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,589
it into terpenes and that you've changed

122
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:13,360
the categories well can you guys hear me

123
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:16,269
good very well okay so what's going on

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,949
is that I've been calling the Emerald

125
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,750
cup of canvass country fair for 14 years

126
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:23,110
and of course we do it in the wintertime

127
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:26,709
where it's not the best weather for a

128
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,120
fair type environment so I've talked

129
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:31,060
with Jonathan's involvement a few years

130
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,978
back and he held the domain name for me

131
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,389
and a friend of mine wanted to come

132
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:36,728
along and try to do that last year at

133
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,528
black oak branch and failed kind of

134
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:40,149
miserably with it and I went back and

135
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:42,158
said you know what that was my name that

136
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:43,658
was my that was my show I'd like to do

137
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:45,550
that and make something good for the

138
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:46,930
Emerald triangle people in the community

139
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,490
of Mendocino because they're all kind of

140
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,468
disappointed we took the Emerald cup out

141
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,418
of the triangle and down to Santa Rosa

142
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:54,759
so we thought we'd bring something back

143
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,500
home for everybody up here and do a

144
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,150
weekend event where you can camp out and

145
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,019
actually hang with people you know the

146
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,299
Emerald cup and a lot of these

147
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,068
competitions or shows they're so hectic

148
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,419
you're running your booth you barely

149
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,479
have a chance to even spend five minutes

150
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:08,889
with anybody I hardly even see anyone

151
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:10,538
I've got to go back to see you showed up

152
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,829
through all the videos and so I was like

153
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:14,620
okay let's do a weekend event where

154
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:16,359
people stay for the weekend we'll make

155
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,800
it a really community-based thing we'll

156
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,229
bring the best of the Emerald triangle

157
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,509
vendors in and we'll do a new type of

158
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:24,728
competition that we will want to do alex

159
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,800
has been bugging me forever so we

160
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:28,508
thought we'd do all that and put a great

161
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,538
show together now I'm working with some

162
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,460
new partners they're very quiet and they

163
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:35,810
they never use their name so

164
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,849
not even supposed to really honor him in

165
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,439
fact if you look at the introduction for

166
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,789
the cannabis Country Fair we really

167
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,500
didn't even introduce them and except

168
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:45,379
we're very vague it's because they're

169
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,720
quiet they're not ego based I'm working

170
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:50,000
with a new group of people out of red

171
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,979
light management the guys that

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,589
discovered Dave Matthews they have fish

173
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:56,990
it's the most respected talent agency in

174
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:59,598
the world for music they also our

175
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,848
partners and many festivals but they

176
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,038
don't put their name on anything they're

177
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:06,409
not ego based the gentleman who owns the

178
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,659
thing privately never puts his name into

179
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,130
anything so I'm probably gonna get a

180
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,620
little flak for even going into this

181
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,659
much because like I said they're they're

182
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,120
just a very quiet reserved company but

183
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,590
they're very powerful stuart ross who

184
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,209
produced the first 360 Lollapalooza is

185
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:25,908
helping manage the show and the idea

186
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:29,209
turn it into like a Lollapalooza and

187
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:31,668
take it around the country and integrate

188
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:33,680
alternative lifestyles and the

189
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:35,629
agricultural techniques and the medicine

190
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,939
and everything that we do and take it

191
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,990
around and you know show it off to

192
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:41,120
Michigan in the East Coast and down

193
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,189
south in Texas and stuff because that's

194
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,348
what they do we've got Charlie Hernandez

195
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,879
who's out with you two right now usually

196
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:49,370
produced and production managed I'm

197
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,189
sorry all the Farm Aid shows he's on the

198
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,750
board of directors he was out Neil he's

199
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,180
pretty he's the production manager for

200
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,819
us so we had some issues last year with

201
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,769
the Emerald cup as we all know it got

202
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,560
out of control with so many people

203
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:06,168
coming in and we extended the contest

204
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,089
accidentally which may gave us a train

205
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:10,879
wreck with 850 entries the last three

206
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,319
days I was out of control so we really

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,658
looked at it and even though we had a

208
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,968
good experience with our partners last

209
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:18,769
year we had the opportunity to work with

210
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:20,870
red light and come in and bring them in

211
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:22,459
and we decided that we wanted to move up

212
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,408
to the next level so that we could be

213
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:26,060
you know the hold up to that standard is

214
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:28,550
the best show in the world so we've got

215
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,168
Charlie and Stewart with us for the

216
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,879
cannabis Country Fair and the Emerald

217
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:34,309
cup we have another partner red light

218
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,620
gym Lully who's helping produce the show

219
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,598
he created a festival back in 80s called

220
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,788
the horn festival he worked with

221
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,709
earthing aids off for ten years he's an

222
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:45,110
amazing I mean everybody there is

223
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:47,599
amazing he's an incredible individual

224
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,339
happy Father's Day to all of them

225
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,480
and that's this new team that we're

226
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,130
coming together with the cannabis

227
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,379
country fair so that we can take it on

228
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:56,509
the road and work with people like you

229
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:58,600
and everybody else to help showcase who

230
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:05,600
we are you know ten there's a long

231
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,829
there's not it's a great entry than what

232
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,110
you've done with the country with the

233
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:10,939
Emerald cup and I'm sure what will

234
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,870
happen with the Country Fair I mean even

235
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,029
though you say it's gotten out of

236
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,970
control it is the most community-based

237
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:19,068
event in my opinion that you can attend

238
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,778
anywhere in the world mean you go to

239
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,309
places like in Europe everybody comes

240
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:25,458
from everywhere else but there's just

241
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:26,508
such a core group community with what

242
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:30,049
you're doing that I just think is

243
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,339
fantastic yeah well I've got word out of

244
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,620
control maybe that's a little

245
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,870
heavy-handed it was just the elements

246
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,720
when you get that many people we've

247
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,039
learned things and like we had 300 extra

248
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,259
people that tried to get it a Damian

249
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,049
Marley now we've never had a problem in

250
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,399
the past because by the end of the night

251
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:47,629
there's so many people that are so high

252
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,328
they don't even want to go to the show

253
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:52,549
so we left the first 3500 in it's never

254
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:55,099
been a problem because it's just worked

255
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:57,318
this year about 400 people wanted to see

256
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,629
Damian and they could just see Damian

257
00:09:57,318 --> 00:10:01,370
and it was sad because they couldn't get

258
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:02,778
in there and the fairgrounds wouldn't

259
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,179
open up and let those extra few hundred

260
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:06,379
people in and then the contest was kind

261
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,088
of a challenge because so many late

262
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,860
entries you get 850 entries the last

263
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,779
three days I mean how can people judge

264
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,310
that so we've changed the rules for the

265
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,019
Emerald cup we're gonna shorten the

266
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,789
timing we're gonna give the testing a

267
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,438
lot more space we're gonna give the

268
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:22,068
judges clean medicine and we're going to

269
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:23,659
rectify everything that wasn't perfect

270
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:25,250
because you know what it's amazing you

271
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:26,899
can be an 8-cylinder card if you're

272
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,339
running on seven cylinders it still

273
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,568
won't be a perfect right even though

274
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,370
it's running almost perfect so the

275
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:33,559
Emerald cup from what everybody saw

276
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,730
really went well but we see the few

277
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,989
things we're going to correct and we're

278
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,610
starting with the cannabis country fair

279
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,310
to get them all in it sounds like you

280
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,610
got the right people on board Tim I mean

281
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:48,679
wow that's great to see

282
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,730
really no 140 cannabis companies and

283
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,549
they decided they want to work with us

284
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,250
and I'm very proud and honored to have

285
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:56,389
them with us there it's really still the

286
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,799
Emerald cup presenting a cannabis

287
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,149
country fair but to know that they're

288
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,068
the ones helping with the show the

289
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,500
organisation and whatnot gives me a lot

290
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:04,139
of cup

291
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,120
we can deal with the other aspects now

292
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:07,590
that's that's a key aspect that's needed

293
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,399
I actually did the Horde tour myself

294
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,769
many moons ago in a galaxy far far so

295
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,840
yeah I know the professionalism that

296
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,720
goes into it and what's needed and that

297
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,690
was a very well-run gig altogether so

298
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,639
just from the listing of the cadre you

299
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,860
have there it's quite impressive and

300
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,159
it's great because it shows that you're

301
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,050
taking it serious and vendors want to

302
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,459
know that the people that attend don't

303
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:34,319
really understand what happens around

304
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,810
the you know in the backwoods of what

305
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
actually takes Jen transpires I have an

306
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:42,839
idea of thrown events not of course of

307
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,549
this caliber but it's great Tim thank

308
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,200
you very much for one coming on and then

309
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:48,089
making us well aware of what's

310
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,060
transpiring and thank you for stepping

311
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:55,860
up your own game I do have a question

312
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:57,929
for you Tim this is Nessa Sam here what

313
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,870
I'm interested in is your saying that

314
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:05,879
there will be five dominant dominant

315
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:08,610
terpene varieties yes contest me between

316
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,830
picking out the best of these five

317
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:15,210
different terpene dominant varieties

318
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:18,240
correct yes and are those going to be

319
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:24,570
type 1 type 2 or type 3 plants in other

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:26,700
words THC CBD and THC or CBD well we're

321
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,150
not going to do CBD for this this

322
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,720
contest we decided to tighten up and

323
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:37,289
just go with concentrates and light depo

324
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,190
and do a small contest it was the last

325
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,740
night of show that we put together

326
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,050
there's a lot of other events you got

327
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,250
Dougie chalice down there and so we

328
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:47,250
thought we'd just start with a small

329
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,379
contest you know stay out of people's

330
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,879
way and and just keep going with it

331
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,509
there's so many different ways you can

332
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:58,740
throw in the contest dominant variety

333
00:12:54,509 --> 00:13:04,139
you mean also a THC dominant variety

334
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,120
with well that sounds really good

335
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,389
because I was worried that you were

336
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,549
gonna mix up the three type one type two

337
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,259
and type three plants and that would

338
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,419
have been crazy because how can you

339
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,389
compare a CBD variety

340
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,479
see varieties side-by-side just by

341
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,769
terpene content it wouldn't work

342
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,149
you know what I mixed up enough and I

343
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,710
think everybody else is so we don't need

344
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,179
to do any more than we already got if

345
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,580
there's so much for us to learn and be

346
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:36,259
educated on but that is the future for

347
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,450
sure so the five term is the future

348
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:41,720
really quickly - Kevin Jodrey and the

349
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,670
golden tarp who basically started this

350
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,740
this direction of course with dominant

351
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:49,620
core view with the trooper festival and

352
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,360
then you've got Jeremy plume Jesse Dodd

353
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,370
up there with the cultivation classic so

354
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,840
these three groups really spearheaded

355
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,310
the direction of that even though Alec

356
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,500
Dixon has been bugging me for years to

357
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:00,389
go in this direction they jumped in and

358
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,519
did it and it's really a big shout out

359
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,929
to Kevin Jodrey and the folks at

360
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,419
Wonderland the golden tarp that really

361
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:09,199
spearheaded that up in Garberville

362
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:12,089
does that have to be a natural

363
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:16,520
extraction from plant material or can it

364
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:20,340
be fabricated with natural terpenes and

365
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,860
THC distillate well we're doing a

366
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,200
separate distillate contest and so you

367
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,210
can do that we'll have a co2 contest and

368
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,370
the and the concentrate contest will all

369
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,440
be natural extraction the distillate

370
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,259
contest we're opening that up we're

371
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,910
recognizing that I mean I tried Toni

372
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,860
Mendocino who's the creator of the

373
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:41,129
skittles and whatnot and fields they

374
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,779
have an ethanol cartridge that boy I

375
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:44,879
finally found a cartridge I mean we have

376
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,559
co2 cartridges they're nice but this

377
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,939
ethanol distillate cart was just

378
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,649
stunning I mean it was the first thing

379
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,450
I'd ever tasted which had expansion

380
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:53,309
actually almost tasted like you were

381
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,920
smoking a joint except with a clean

382
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,689
taste and and it hit well all the way

383
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,370
down so that the futures obviously going

384
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,870
to be ethanol distillates for the

385
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,929
cartridges and so we're bringing that

386
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,310
distillate contest in to recognize that

387
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:07,409
even though ethanol is still considered

388
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:09,299
a violent solvent we got to get

389
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:11,399
realistic here I mean it's not it's it's

390
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,809
an even xane of propane and butane are

391
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,279
gonna be allowed in there bringing them

392
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:16,889
in their states can allow them in so

393
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,240
under the right conditions these these

394
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:19,799
are gonna come in and we're going to let

395
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,200
them into the cup we're just waiting for

396
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:27,849
the legalization to come in well what is

397
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:29,709
the THC level of ethanol Carter

398
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,560
like this in other words if you looked

399
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:34,629
at it as THC as a percentage of the of

400
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,239
the weight of volume what is it do you

401
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:39,129
have any idea you know I don't know

402
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,169
those are the first real ethanol carts

403
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:42,519
that I've seen come in and there wasn't

404
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,809
any information with them I've been

405
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,060
hitting them for the last couple weeks

406
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,768
and trying them out with everybody that

407
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,719
I know all the hardcore people that

408
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:51,549
don't want cartridges in their lives and

409
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,589
they're all going you know what I

410
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,629
probably I probably hit this in fact I

411
00:15:53,589 --> 00:16:04,360
would I like this and so I'm like oh my

412
00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:07,809
gosh this is really a project yes okay

413
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,318
yeah because 20 years ago we tried an

414
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:16,268
ethanol extracted from resin material

415
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:18,039
and it worked pretty good but I myself

416
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:21,250
personally I couldn't handle it was

417
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:25,509
ethanol based but it was nebulized with

418
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,549
ultrasonics well you know leave it to

419
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:29,110
the brilliant people of this country in

420
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:31,568
this world to figure out new ways to do

421
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,100
things so you know we've gone from you

422
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:34,778
know where I come from just you know

423
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,069
puffing on joints to where you've got

424
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:38,289
the leading scientists in the world

425
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:40,299
figure out how to do all this it's so

426
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,948
far beyond me I just you know my hats

427
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,399
off to all of them and I just want to

428
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:46,870
enjoy it can I ask you Tim what was

429
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,179
these five terpenes that you're going

430
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,539
with Turpin allene pioneer limonene

431
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:54,429
careful Ian and mercy and are those the

432
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:57,669
five most prominent terpenes and

433
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:59,559
cannabis well according to Alec Dixon

434
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:01,629
and Essie labs and what they're doing

435
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,549
you know you've got so many others but I

436
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,929
think that you know talking to Alec he

437
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:08,230
thought that we could have them all fall

438
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:10,269
into those ranges and so of course I

439
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,279
defer to them they're going to be the

440
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:17,279
ones that separate the the entries into

441
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,808
into the categories for our judges and

442
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,609
you know looking at it you know like I

443
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:23,109
said there's so much to learn I'm old

444
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,000
school we were doing the cup you know

445
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,578
just everything against itself we used

446
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,839
to have a best morning bud contest so

447
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:31,329
that the blue dreams and stuff would

448
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,428
have a chance this is a very different

449
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:34,750
structure of how to do it I'm excited to

450
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,980
see how it works I'm hoping that it

451
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,900
works so well that we can bring it right

452
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,789
into the cup it gives a lot more room

453
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,269
for different strains to win I mean

454
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:42,799
how's the blue dream or a train

455
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,480
we've talked about that in the judging

456
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,950
forever oh this is a stunning blue dream

457
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,470
but I wasn't going to beat up fuel you

458
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,120
know so this gives all those different

459
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,100
strains a chance to compete to get

460
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,750
honored it brings back and you know what

461
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:55,549
the concentrates going in that direction

462
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,039
so much I mean who wants to just you

463
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:59,480
know hit a dab of OG you're looking for

464
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,879
cookies you looking for skittles you

465
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,470
look at urban children of ours and so in

466
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,960
the concentrates he's even more

467
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,308
pronounced it's time to really recognize

468
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,069
that what we're looking for are these

469
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:11,899
terpene profiles and so let's honor them

470
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:14,210
and give everybody a chance to to win

471
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,070
prizes off of those I would agree with

472
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,319
most of the terpenes you picked but

473
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:23,599
Carrie ethylene does not potentiate or

474
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,029
modulate THC as far as I know I know I

475
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:32,029
tried it I couldn't get it to modulate

476
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:34,279
it huh well that's interesting incorrect

477
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:37,099
him it's more about the the expressions

478
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:40,579
that are shown in the test that SC Labs

479
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:42,500
is doing I think they're seeing

480
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:45,079
carefully and things like gorilla glue

481
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,240
can Girl Scout cookie sherbert skittles

482
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,308
the stuff that there's the cannabis

483
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,650
Country Fair has a really good page on

484
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:54,349
this listed under contest and it talks

485
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,170
about the different categories for the

486
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:59,389
terpenes and Alex is supposed to be

487
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:02,630
joining us as well today so maybe we can

488
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,300
get more information on em too he's you

489
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,220
know what he is he's brilliant I'll tell

490
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,589
you what Alec and Josh and the guys at

491
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,569
SC it's just amazing what they're doing

492
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:13,519
and you know they have put it together

493
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:14,659
well there's a lot of different ways you

494
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,980
can go there's so many different

495
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,509
varieties I mean you could have expanded

496
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:22,549
this out but then how do you how do you

497
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:26,170
close down the contest only there's only

498
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:29,539
so many terpenes with modulation and put

499
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,850
potentiation a lot of the terpenes do

500
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:34,639
not modulate and do not put 10 she ate

501
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:38,119
THC for example so you might want to

502
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,940
start with those first oh boy we should

503
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:43,849
get you on a panel talking about this

504
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,519
it's a salad I I don't I I live in

505
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:49,939
Europe and I don't think I'll come to

506
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:52,369
California just to attend there

507
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,528
hopparoo everyone come over yeah because

508
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,628
I think this is how people are going to

509
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:59,929
be educated and there's a lot of

510
00:19:56,628 --> 00:20:02,000
Education that needs to take place and I

511
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:03,820
know a lot of people say that carry out

512
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,740
lean is important for medicinal use

513
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:11,898
because it's it's a cb2 binder but if

514
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,628
you want to get high you don't want to

515
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:22,489
see be due to binder you want to see b1

516
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:23,509
binder well that's true well it's like I

517
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,548
said we're all going to go through this

518
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:27,139
contest together and then go through the

519
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,548
Emerald cup and it's going to be

520
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:30,619
something that everybody's gonna really

521
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:31,759
learn a lot about because really as I go

522
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:33,199
out there and talk to people

523
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,179
there's so little information that

524
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,470
people the people really know and we're

525
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,298
sitting there talking about it but most

526
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,860
people are still in the dark are the

527
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:43,308
concentrates going to be in the same

528
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:45,439
categories yes concentrates can be

529
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:47,720
broken down into terpene profiles which

530
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,548
is they had to convince me to do that

531
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,379
I'm old school so I'm like oh my gosh

532
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,450
this is like you know it's nice we're

533
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:55,308
doing it the country fair but when you

534
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,778
look at the concentrates look at all the

535
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:58,940
flavors that are coming in and shooting

536
00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:00,528
profiles that are there so it really

537
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,139
naturally breaks down into those

538
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:04,819
categories too as far as winners and

539
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:07,398
what people are looking for I agree with

540
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:10,069
you Tim it is a natural way to do it

541
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:14,928
what would be kind of interesting is if

542
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:17,778
they would also besides a printout of

543
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:20,600
the terpenes and cannabinoids of the

544
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:24,079
extract also habit of the original herb

545
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:26,658
the extract was taken from so that you

546
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:30,378
could see what has altered in the

547
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:32,809
extract versus the original herb and I'm

548
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:36,319
talking about altering the cannabinoid

549
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:39,558
you're terpene profiles you're

550
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:42,230
interesting you know that's a very good

551
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:44,089
suggestion actually well I wish we had

552
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,538
more time before this contest to have

553
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:49,490
taken a lot of this in Tony's came on we

554
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:51,230
did this from a wrong start Tony did a

555
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,149
little bit through SC labs with Blue

556
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,009
River where they tested the bud and then

557
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:56,839
they tested the terpene profile of the

558
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:59,240
terpenes that were extracted and it was

559
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,980
there were little little minor changes

560
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,980
but fairly accurate it was pretty

561
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,308
interesting it definitely a good idea

562
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,009
depends how rough your extraction is the

563
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:12,319
sesquiterpene stick around much stronger

564
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:14,990
than the monoterpenes it'd be really

565
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,788
really gentle the monitor could be all

566
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,538
there and pretty close to the original

567
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:22,609
profile as in the earth right I think

568
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:24,919
the ones that I saw there was just a few

569
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:28,119
that it actually like like one had

570
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,740
disappeared and a new one had shown up

571
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,209
terpene which was kind of interesting

572
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,730
maybe Alec can talk about it when he

573
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,889
gets in from Messi you know the

574
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,429
cultivation classic guys they're Jeremy

575
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:42,199
and the Philo's people with what they're

576
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,750
doing is really interesting they put all

577
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,580
the cultivation classic and you can see

578
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,589
how it fits and what's where it's going

579
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:51,319
and how how the genetic you know

580
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:52,369
background goes and I think you're going

581
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,750
to see more that we're trying to bring

582
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:56,750
that into the cup this year as an

583
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,269
educational piece and it's exciting to

584
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:03,349
see this I mean it's so I'll be back in

585
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:07,808
the woods just will you have a category

586
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:10,788
for pure terpenes cannabis derived on

587
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:13,519
adulterant rate no cannabinoids no herb

588
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:15,079
just terpenes you know we're not doing

589
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,339
at the campus Country Fair what I

590
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,788
believe will do that if there will cup

591
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:23,240
nice that would that be variable you

592
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:24,980
know where do we stand that out because

593
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,929
we wanted to make sure we didn't make

594
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,808
one mistake with this contest and it was

595
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:31,759
a new set of you know parameters it was

596
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:33,980
like let's just keep it small let's keep

597
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,269
this together and do this because we

598
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,769
went back and forth on how many other

599
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:38,750
contests people wanted us to add a bunch

600
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:40,759
of the contests in it was like you know

601
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,259
what let's just work with this we'll

602
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,970
head pickup we'll get it down and we'll

603
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:45,379
just expand it but that's a really good

604
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,269
suggestion on that when we talked about

605
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,610
it I think it should be in yeah good

606
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:51,349
idea to build your foundation you know a

607
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:53,479
little simpler and not too overly

608
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:56,089
complex because as we know with cannabis

609
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,329
and getting into terpenes especially the

610
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:00,668
holy smokes you could go deep it can get

611
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:03,379
complicated

612
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:08,630
yeah I mean all of this is complicated

613
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:10,370
this contest is complicated where it's

614
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,080
like I can't keep track of all the

615
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:14,148
prizes and the contests and what's going

616
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,949
on that's why we're bringing these these

617
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:17,319
you know heavy weights in here just make

618
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,080
sure it all runs right

619
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,279
well I tip my hat to you sir it's you

620
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,189
know you've been doing a great job

621
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,809
obviously I hear great things about the

622
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,330
Emerald cup it's one of the events that

623
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:31,539
I cannot believe I haven't been to in

624
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:34,869
the cannabis community it's hopefully

625
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:37,059
one day one day Oh we'll get you out you

626
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:40,359
got an extended VIP tickets for yourself

627
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:42,220
- that's so cool Tim the Marc's been at

628
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,409
this a while so I can't visit mark

629
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,230
because of my cannabis convictions and

630
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:50,019
mark can't visit me because they're so

631
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,480
we've both been bumped on the Canadian

632
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:54,160
border so this is a lot of why I used to

633
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,630
do house Church because it gave me time

634
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,910
to just sit and smoke with mark I know

635
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,380
it sounds funny but it was I can't

636
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,390
other than meeting him in Europe at a

637
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:05,290
coffee shop I don't get to spend quality

638
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:07,090
time with my friend or Jamaica I'm in

639
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:07,779
Hollywood marking to make the yet but on

640
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,369
tennis

641
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,399
well we'll be doing that soon I'll tell

642
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:15,219
you go ahead Tim oh there's just so much

643
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,300
going on in Canada right now I wish I

644
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,950
could get up there - I've got

645
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,930
convictions and so I can't get I'm

646
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,200
hoping with the unfoldment legalization

647
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:26,440
they'll open that all up now

648
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:29,230
we will meet in Jamaica Tim tell

649
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,820

714
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:49,419
cannabis-based is a little competition

715
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,639
there's it's just such a better thing to

716
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,800
have these amazing bands play at these

717
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,540
events but make it still you know

718
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,180
focused on that plant that we all love

719
00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:00,579
and the County Fair I mean that's a

720
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,039
natural I used to always go to county

721
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:06,369
fairs it was very agriculturally

722
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,019
orientated both animals and plants what

723
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:09,909
can we talk about a little bit this is

724
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,769
an organic based fear I read on your

725
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:14,009
website you're not even you don't even

726
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:15,910
want to accept applications from

727
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:17,740
nutrient companies that don't have

728
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,590
organic lines could you talk a little

729
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,359
bit more about that Tim well we're

730
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:24,459
really stepping out with that we're not

731
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,259
calling anybody out but we're looking at

732
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,049
what the state's going to demand next

733
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:31,299
year in terms of testing and we're

734
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,190
looking at the environmental issues and

735
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,779
the patient's issues and we're just

736
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,309
drawing a line and saying that we need

737
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:38,920
to provide organic medicines for our

738
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:41,079
patients and for our farms and for our

739
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,550
communities and we just can't stand down

740
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:44,889
from that so we're

741
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:46,509
just now going to demand that everybody

742
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,250
coming into Canada's Country Fair and

743
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:50,170
the Emerald cup we already have all the

744
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,359
all the food organic we have all the

745
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,330
entries organic we've given some people

746
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,859
leeway as far as vendors but we're drawn

747
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:58,119
a line in the sand and saying look if

748
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,490
you want to be with us and you want us

749
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,659
to represent you then you're gonna have

750
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,549
to be organic because that's what we're

751
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,890
saying we are and then without all these

752
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:07,329
groups slip in that aren't people people

753
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,740
come to us and they say well we thought

754
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,960
they were organic cuz they were with you

755
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,470
and so we're bowing for these companies

756
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,720
in effect no yeah I think I think that's

757
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,420
fantastic I mean you represent to me the

758
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,160
old-school Mendocino when I first went

759
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,630
up there in 94 and I spent my first

760
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,720
summer up there growing with Richard

761
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,720
Davis you you remember Richard Davis he

762
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,490
had a museum yeah he was a hero it was

763
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,049
different I mean you guys had such a

764
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,970
different consideration for the

765
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,769
environment around you you were not

766
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,390
polluters you would not trash in the

767
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:39,879
place you were not clear-cutting to put

768
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,830
up greenhouses it was such a different

769
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,380
vibe I mean the guys growing at the

770
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:46,149
normal meetings and and the activism I

771
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,980
did were the same people I saw at the

772
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,500
earth first stuff that was standing up

773
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,240
and trying to stop the loggers and and

774
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,400
then a whole new generation of people

775
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,430
seem to come in after proposition 215

776
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,519
passed and it took a very different vibe

777
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,529
and it broke my heart and a lot off and

778
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,269
you know I'm not religious but going up

779
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:06,399
to those trees it's like a spiritual

780
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:09,460
experience you know Northern California

781
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,200
and I'm just really happy that you have

782
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,420
this voice of reason and that you're

783
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,850
bringing back this consciousness of hey

784
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,009
we have to be stewards of the land we've

785
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:20,289
got to take care of each other I love

786
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:22,660
the community element of this so much

787
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:24,609
Tim and I hope people really hear that

788
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,040
and get that and understand that that's

789
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:30,129
been a big part of the mo cup for a very

790
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:33,730
long time thank you very much time

791
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,200
that's a it's a it is true but you know

792
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,150
it's not just the cannabis people it's

793
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,180
across the country we we taken all the

794
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:42,580
topsoil off all the land we toxified it

795
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,840
so much that boys you know you go on a

796
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,609
San Joaquin Valley and they're growing

797
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,889
six legged frogs and all kinds of stuff

798
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:50,049
and it's like we need to be leaders and

799
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,759
I need to take that responsibility and

800
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,589
we'll raise that bar and show the rest

801
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,929
of this country how to do it because

802
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:56,218
they're not doing

803
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:57,479
in the vineyard industries and the

804
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:59,489
traditional agriculture industries

805
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:02,219
they're pretty much toxifying the land

806
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:05,009
and themselves and us and it's got to

807
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:07,019
stop and it's you know it's really a

808
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,429
great place for us to be to be able to

809
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,229
leave that way and show everybody how to

810
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:12,659
do that and that's what the state is

811
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:15,479
asking us to do and that's what we can

812
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:16,830
do and you know those people coming back

813
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:18,239
after all those years ago Todd they were

814
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:19,558
coming back up here not to make money

815
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:21,989
but to live a good life with their

816
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,308
families to live organic lives and it

817
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,629
was about growing some cannabis if they

818
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:26,158
could pay their bills cuz nobody was

819
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,928
getting rich I mean back then if he

820
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,210
could bring a hundred pounds out you

821
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:31,919
were a huge guy I mean anybody could

822
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,088
that was almost unfathomable because you

823
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,409
were growing out of the trees and let

824
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,878
the shade these little quarter rounds

825
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:38,159
four quarter pound plants a huge plant

826
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:39,538
now it's like people are like unless

827
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,309
you're a ten box guy and grown a

828
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,069
thousand pounds the guy showed up at my

829
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:46,138
house at area 101 he came in he said I

830
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:48,118
got four acres and humble I'm getting

831
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:50,548
four more do you think if I have eight

832
00:31:48,118 --> 00:31:54,749
acres I can compete and I said you know

833
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:56,519
what eight acres we're done we're doomed

834
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:58,469
I mean there's just no way to support

835
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,598
that there's no there's no way to get it

836
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:02,849
up people to smoke that and so we're

837
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:04,319
gonna all have to be reasonable going

838
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:05,878
into this it's gonna be a big thing

839
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,428
because one of the things I found the

840
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:10,678
last month we're finding up here is we

841
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:12,599
have a crisis going on and I want to

842
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,909
start a whole like almost a theater

843
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:18,178
piece on what happened how did this

844
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:19,200
happen because we're bringing prop 64 in

845
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,369
we're supposed to be reasonable

846
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,440
everybody's supposed to be down at an

847
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:22,978
acre or less we're gonna be all playing

848
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,989
fair

849
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:26,580
Mendocino is playing fair we've got

850
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:28,200
everybody at the top level doing a

851
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:30,148
quarter acre that's what we've got

852
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,288
10,000 square feet and I've got

853
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,238
neighborhoods complaining because we're

854
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:34,858
too big and yet you've got Steve

855
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:37,200
DeAngelo down there were 27 and half

856
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:39,418
acres they're predicting 25 million

857
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,950
pounds being grown from Santa Cruz to

858
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,269
San Luis Obispo this year

859
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,129
I mean it's eight times what the

860
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:45,538
triangle brought out you talked to Eddie

861
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,368
and the guys in Sacramento they're going

862
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:49,048
to come online with a hundred million

863
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:50,579
pounds they're building the greenhouses

864
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:53,128
as fast as they can right now won't

865
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:54,689
impact us this year but before prop 64

866
00:32:53,128 --> 00:32:56,428
came in you got people on Humboldt about

867
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,769
four to eight acres you got people

868
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:00,359
always safe to gone around it and how

869
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:03,298
did our senators our leaders and

870
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:05,848
everybody allow this nightmare that

871
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,160
happened before it even became legal but

872
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:09,500
looking

873
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,750
don't don't you think in all factuality

874
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,700
I mean there's been a surge of growers

875
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,769
surge of people buying land because it's

876
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,539
got huge profitability you take the

877
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:19,730
profitability out and you turn this into

878
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:22,220
tomato farming there's gonna be a whole

879
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:25,069
lot less enthusiasm around that tomato

880
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,890
farming because there's not the profits

881
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:30,379
there and if cannabis goes down to the

882
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,960
price of anywhere near organic Tomatoes

883
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,360
under ten bucks a pound all these guys

884
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,980
are walking out the door I mean you're

885
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,779
you're gonna see a nice quiet Northern

886
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,549
California again because you're gonna

887
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:42,259
lose a lot of the people that came up

888
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:45,109
there with the antenna can I could beat

889
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:46,549
ya and not to say that not to say that

890
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:49,159
people aren't going to get a decent

891
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:51,710
dollar for their cannabis in the future

892
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,570
a craft style like that'll always exist

893
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,850
but this three thousand dollar a pound

894
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:57,889
thing that's based in on people going to

895
00:33:55,849 --> 00:34:00,589
prison for years of their life is just

896
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:04,520
no longer the reality that we want to be

897
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:06,500
part of Todd I do disagree with $10 a

898
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,250
pound though and the reason is is

899
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:13,570
because the anibus is usually sold dry

900
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:16,460
by the pound and if you sold dried

901
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:18,980
organically grown tomatoes that were

902
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,168
dried it wouldn't be $10 a pound they'd

903
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,300
be more because who have to drive the

904
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,429
link go through the the hassle to do so

905
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,230
that makes sense

906
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:30,740
fantastic example so I'll show you look

907
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,179
up my dry organic tomato pound but you

908
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,918
know what I don't think it'll go down to

909
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,659
ten but you get that there's gonna be a

910
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,579
situation where your neighbors are

911
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,409
looking at the cost of production and

912
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:41,119
they're gonna be realistic about what it

913
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:42,980
costs to produce that pound of cannabis

914
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,989
they're gonna double their price because

915
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,789
they have investors that want to see a

916
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:49,779
return this is gonna turn into a regular

917
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:54,889
business and I think one not happen

918
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:57,019
everything's that's the trouble is it

919
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,940
already happened it's it's like with

920
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:01,699
what we found out and the research is

921
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,470
that that we I went to sleep I had some

922
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,329
serious illnesses over the winter and I

923
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,559
woke up doing this canvas Country Fair

924
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:09,199
thinking we were gonna have like the

925
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,269
total celebration and it's almost it's

926
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,919
not a wake but it's almost like a total

927
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:14,809
shock and awe thing that's gone on

928
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,240
because what we found is is that that

929
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:19,039
last year's outdoor right now because of

930
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,519
the millions of pounds of depo is coming

931
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,650
in

932
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,650
it's almost not saleable you're watching

933
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,570
people that have sour DS and and and

934
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,849
cookies and stuff that they begin 12 to

935
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,320
14 they're not getting a thousand now

936
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,730
they're looking at boxes and maybe they

937
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,890
gotta go I've been told seven or eight

938
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,900
and it's because there's so much demo

939
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:37,639
coming in that they don't even want last

940
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,380
year's anymore there's not even a market

941
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,389
or even back east people don't want it

942
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,190
and so you've got this whole thing where

943
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,779
now you're gonna have these millions and

944
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,450
millions of pounds of temples coming in

945
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,100
from all over the California farmland

946
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:50,239
and it's going to keep the prices down

947
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,980
and then you're gonna have the long

948
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,509
season come in and I've got people

949
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,480
predicting that you're gonna see long

950
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,760
season crops in Humboldt and Mendocino

951
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,400
going for six to seven hundred dollars

952
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:06,020
by Halloween and probably 500 on the

953
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:08,000
front by Thanksgiving I think being

954
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:09,949
generous to be honest with you Tim from

955
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,010
when I was really really the truth of it

956
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:15,559
is let's be frank here you can grow a

957
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,080
Christmas tree farm and you sell those

958
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,860
Christmas trees less for for less than a

959
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,489
hundred dollars

960
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,960
some of them take five years to grow you

961
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:26,239
what do you think you could do with the

962
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,510
crown of us which is an annual crop I

963
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,429
mean of course you could sell it for

964
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:33,440
$100 a plant each one when you drive

965
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:35,899
you'll get more than a kilo it's gonna

966
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,030
it's just simple economics of course you

967
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,860
can you know Tim in the 90s they were

968
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,050
growing so much and down in Switzerland

969
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,890
that the way they did harvests work

970
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,080
because they couldn't they couldn't

971
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:47,299
bring in the labor to harvest everything

972
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,739
in the field so they had picnic tables

973
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,050
set up and people could come to the

974
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,849
fields and literally buy a plant go cut

975
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,920
it down process what they wanted leave

976
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:57,469
the pile with take what they wanted and

977
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,539
split that's that's gonna be I believe

978
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:02,649
the future because when you get into the

979
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:05,659
labor of taking it down trimming it

980
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:09,590
sharing it and then packaging it you've

981
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:11,269
tacked on a whole lot of cost true yeah

982
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,910
you know what there's the jincan of

983
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:16,280
people that they developed Shaw's web

984
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:18,139
and then they just agreement with the

985
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,690
guys that pushed it out so they formed a

986
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:22,549
gen can and went to Kentucky and worked

987
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,920
with Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul to

988
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,510
legalize hemp to sell worldwide they

989
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,930
grew a million pounds last year at

990
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:31,020
twenty dollars a pound

991
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:32,699
with organic growing farming techniques

992
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,858
with the tobacco farmers and they're

993
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:36,298
doing crystal Seavey they'd like me to

994
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:37,858
bring it into my products out you're not

995
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:39,269
trying to figure out how I'll be viewed

996
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:41,159
by the people out here I start using

997
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:42,989
crystallized CBD from Kentucky even

998
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,940
though they're California humble

999
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:46,949
triangle people that grew it all so I'm

1000
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,900
like oh my what does this mean and now

1001
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:50,548
they're coming to California to do you

1002
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,980
know THC boost

1003
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:54,900
cannabis and they're talking you know 50

1004
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,400
bucks a pound well yeah you know you're

1005
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,548
right traditional agriculture when you

1006
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,079
get in there I'm looking at it like for

1007
00:37:59,548 --> 00:38:02,969
all the people that spent 40 years in

1008
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,818
the triangle developing this living this

1009
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:07,439
fighting it going to jail and trying to

1010
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:09,150
put it together I would have liked to

1011
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,909
have seen them get an extra year or two

1012
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,338
as the transition took place and what

1013
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:16,440
we're seeing is it came in so quick that

1014
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:17,909
it's already here and done and you're

1015
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,679
gonna like you said you're gonna see it

1016
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:21,690
it might even go below that this year

1017
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,308
and on the one side for the patients

1018
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,039
with the amount of products we're going

1019
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:27,480
to get and for the pricing it's going to

1020
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,890
be an incredible thing across this

1021
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,900
country California's going to become a

1022
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,578
forty five billion dollar industry so

1023
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,380
it's going to be remarkable that all the

1024
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,028
products and the stuff that's going to

1025
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,068
come in here but it's going to be a very

1026
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:39,719
difficult transition for the Emerald

1027
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:41,548
triangle folks and for the people up in

1028
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:43,439
the Sierras and stuff that didn't get

1029
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:44,940
their brands or old school didn't get

1030
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,858
their permits you didn't do it that way

1031
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,269
they thought they'd just stay with it

1032
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,219
for the next few years and they're gonna

1033
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:53,028
find that it's it's coming out of faster

1034
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:56,399
they're think about it what other

1035
00:38:53,028 --> 00:39:00,869
agricultural products are grown up in

1036
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:04,019
the Emerald triangle they're in little

1037
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:06,869
pairs were a big part you try it and you

1038
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:10,250
got business travelers wonder lumbered

1039
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm just trying to point out not a true

1040
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:16,170
agricultural center the way many places

1041
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,510
in California are no I think that I

1042
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,880
think that the price reduction is gonna

1043
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,789
weed out Northern California of all the

1044
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,980
wannabe cannabis entrepreneurs and leaf

1045
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:27,569
people like that we're there because

1046
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,068
they love the place because they cared

1047
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:30,869
about the place because it felt like

1048
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:33,179
home and they weren't there to make

1049
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:36,150
money and I mean and I feel Tim totally

1050
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:38,159
for a lot of the people there's a lot of

1051
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,559
20-somethings that were screaming at me

1052
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,208
because I was support in 64 and

1053
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,069
I don't really have a ton of pity for

1054
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:46,528
them they were eight nine ten years old

1055
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:48,150
when we passed to 15 20 years ago they

1056
00:39:46,528 --> 00:39:49,978
don't understand what it was like to get

1057
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,930
raided to get locked up to go through

1058
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:54,058
hell and they don't get the fight that

1059
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:56,038
we fought for so long and this hasn't

1060
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,439
been overnight this has been [ __ ]

1061
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,869
decades of us losing you getting our

1062
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:02,998
asses handed to us our assets taken our

1063
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:05,969
bills lined up our lawyers sucking us

1064
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:08,009
dry so if this hasn't been overnight and

1065
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:09,659
I do feel bad for the people that had

1066
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:12,269
Gardens in the last ten years and has

1067
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:14,670
just watched profits go down but this is

1068
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:16,018
great for the end-users because there's

1069
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,298
gonna get to a point I think where it

1070
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:20,488
goes direct to consumer where people

1071
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:22,978
like you can sell on your website like a

1072
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:25,619
winery does and say hey 3,000 cases of

1073
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:27,478
XYZ take it or leave it and and I

1074
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:29,608
believe that it's gonna change the face

1075
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:31,558
of this and if it means that the end

1076
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:33,478
user is going to end up seeing huge

1077
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:35,519
price reductions in the cannabis that

1078
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:37,078
they get I think it's great and I feel

1079
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:39,298
totally bad for people that have been

1080
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,619
living off it but I feel way better for

1081
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:42,809
the people that have been drinking wine

1082
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,640
or smoking cigarettes or sucking down

1083
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:46,589
pharmaceutical pills because they had no

1084
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,889
[ __ ] alternative and couldn't smoke

1085
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:51,420
the $400 an ounce [ __ ] that you and I

1086
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:54,028
burn like trees you know we burn it like

1087
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,849
it's nothing but a lot of people don't

1088
00:40:54,028 --> 00:40:57,900
get to live that experience and and now

1089
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:01,170
maybe they will

1090
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,630
and I think yay I really do think yay

1091
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:07,349
for them cuz it helped me I hope it

1092
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:10,019
helps everyone else you know I love you

1093
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:13,289
Todd I'd like to see the price for a

1094
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:15,838
large plant that can yield one kilo

1095
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:18,569
cleaned and dried but you perm a

1096
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:21,469
Christmas tree type set up a hundred

1097
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:24,719
dollars that way people could afford to

1098
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:31,259
smoke hashish you know and that's what I

1099
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:34,170
like dry snipped together with cannabis

1100
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:35,670
trees missing right [ __ ] Christmas trees

1101
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,068
they shouldn't be cutting down pine

1102
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:41,818
trees those should all be wheat you know

1103
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:43,920
it should all be cannabis just think of

1104
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:45,630
the beautiful smell on Christmas morning

1105
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,150
in your house if you came down and there

1106
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:50,610
was just this big huge beautiful

1107
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:55,730
cannabis plant in full bloom

1108
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:55,730
yeah the beautiful thing you know what

1109
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:01,019
go ahead get me to talk on that and I

1110
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:02,849
really do agree that I've been telling

1111
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:04,889
people for years that they had to wake

1112
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:06,630
up and so I've spent the last three

1113
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,789
years getting my manufacturing in place

1114
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,110
getting my branding getting it all and I

1115
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:11,880
told everybody it wasn't gonna go on

1116
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,490
we've all said one more year one more

1117
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,650
year and I I don't what I the only thing

1118
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:18,959
I am perplexed by was that we talked

1119
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:21,119
about was 64 and what I sold people Todd

1120
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,280
was that this was going to be an orderly

1121
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,159
rollout we were going to hold back

1122
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,750
large-scale farming to like one acre for

1123
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:31,079
just a few years and we were just gonna

1124
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:34,019
let this slowly you know roll down and

1125
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,610
it's happened so quick that it's just

1126
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:38,460
steamrolled it and it's basically over

1127
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,829
and so what you're seeing up here is

1128
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,940
going to be shock and awe and for me

1129
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:43,650
it's like we're coming to the cannabis

1130
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,059
country fair it's good for us to have

1131
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,250
bending so we can show people and we're

1132
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:48,659
gonna talk about all this at the end of

1133
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,400
the day though I fall on your side Todd

1134
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:51,989
and everybody else it's going to be an

1135
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,210
incredible boon for patients they're

1136
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:55,559
gonna see cost-effective medicine in the

1137
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,030
80s when they started bringing it so

1138
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:58,440
much time I wasn't sure what I do with

1139
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,120
all the time Mexicans I was getting

1140
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,860
thousands of pounds and it just got

1141
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,900
cheaper and cheaper well people just

1142
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,220
started smoking more and more it became

1143
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,389
like all of a sudden it just went

1144
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:07,919
everywhere well that's what's gonna at

1145
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:10,019
what this campus is going to go from

1146
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,460
seven percent to 22 percent to forty

1147
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:14,190
pretty soon half this country is going

1148
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,289
to be using cannabis in some form so and

1149
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:19,079
it's gonna be cheap wonderful I've

1150
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:20,940
listened I completely am with you I have

1151
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,130
believed everything that I've been

1152
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,929
saying with Jack Herer for 25 years I

1153
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,930
believe that society will be a better

1154
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:29,279
place if they have cannabis instead of

1155
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:30,929
pharmaceuticals booze tobacco and

1156
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,150
everything else I really believe in

1157
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:37,079
cannabis and it's just it I believe that

1158
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:39,329
the price is absolute huge hurdle for a

1159
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,519
lot of people to overcome and it's

1160
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:43,500
beautiful to hear that elope that in a

1161
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,119
sense low quality cannabis is not

1162
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,829
desirable because everybody's like oh

1163
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,279
it's a race to the bottom it's raised to

1164
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:49,230
mids

1165
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,510
well now mids won't be able to be sold

1166
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,769
because everybody wants good stuff so

1167
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,860
you're gonna have to learn how to grow

1168
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:57,719
quality at a competitive price and it's

1169
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,820
gonna have to be clean because now we

1170
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,299
have people like alex at SC that's gonna

1171
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,250
be able to see if it's not and

1172
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,640
disqualify the people that are

1173
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:10,360
hustle us cuz you know I was blown away

1174
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:13,670
that so many people brought tainted

1175
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:17,180
samples and entered him into the mo cop

1176
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:19,070
because I thought jeez who do that you

1177
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:21,019
know like what wants to get caught and

1178
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:23,420
there's so many people did that and I

1179
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:26,059
think that's this willful ignorance of

1180
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,950
what they're doing that leads them down

1181
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:30,940
this path or thinking they can compete

1182
00:44:27,949 --> 00:44:33,139
with stuff that you would never smoke

1183
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,369
yeah and I also think that they went to

1184
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:36,769
they went to a few other labs that

1185
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:38,839
weren't quite as tough as SC they might

1186
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:41,630
not have tested it they did make some

1187
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,160
mistakes but you know we had an

1188
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,660
educational process with the cup the

1189
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:46,039
last two years everybody realizing that

1190
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:47,629
because nothing was getting tested and

1191
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:49,489
let's face it the thing of it is is that

1192
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,200
most of the OG and these collectives is

1193
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:53,059
not tested it's all indoor and the

1194
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,259
dispensaries are turning their head the

1195
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:56,570
other way because they want to sell it

1196
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,460
and next year like alex says let the

1197
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,320
restrictive nature of the testing it's

1198
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,970
going to be nine times harder and most

1199
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,890
of the stuffs gonna fail so the one

1200
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:06,109
niche for the high-end cannabis farmers

1201
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:08,389
is going to be growing a really quality

1202
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:10,490
organic product and so if you're the

1203
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:12,679
best of the best you'll have a small

1204
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:14,569
niche the biggest thing Todd is that

1205
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:18,799
with all the Devils coming in so quick

1206
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:20,809
there's no time to store last year's

1207
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,250
crop anymore all these people that store

1208
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:23,750
it and think they're gonna keep it nice

1209
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,789
and tight and sell it I'm looking at

1210
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:28,369
this our D and this cookies and stuff it

1211
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:29,989
looks great but it's not fresh light

1212
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,609
demo and so people are looking at it

1213
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:33,379
like I can buy fresh light up or I can

1214
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,240
buy your backpack last years which is

1215
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,220
great but now they're B grain we don't

1216
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:39,139
want it and I'm like oh my god in one

1217
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:41,959
year you can hell no longer can sell

1218
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:43,759
last year's outdoor or if you do you're

1219
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,079
gonna sell it for seven it's interesting

1220
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,180
too though because people are now

1221
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,949
experiencing fresh cannabis in abundance

1222
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:50,869
and they get the terpene profiles and

1223
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:52,159
how bright they are and how they look at

1224
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:53,929
stuff that's been sitting around they go

1225
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,819
I'd still like it but there's just

1226
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:58,609
there's just not the shine there and

1227
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,680
it's it's people are getting wiser to

1228
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:01,970
this and and this is also why when I saw

1229
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:03,379
the ax breaking get down into the

1230
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:05,299
terpenes I thought this is really

1231
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:07,849
fantastic because it's really bringing

1232
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,100
more attention to the nuances that have

1233
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,929
been attracting us for so long and it's

1234
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:13,940
a great educational tool because you

1235
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:16,099
can't really understand the contest

1236
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,019
unless you start learning the names of

1237
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:20,329
terpenes and why they're the one

1238
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:22,579
in the heads of the contest so I thought

1239
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:24,500
it was a fantastic educational tool this

1240
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,909
is really why I've loved animal Cup for

1241
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,159
so long because I think that bringing

1242
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:29,809
everyone together you influence the

1243
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,670
community because everyone else sees

1244
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:33,889
what everyone's doing and there's an

1245
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,570
emulation that occurs you know everyone

1246
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:37,309
wants to step up their game and do

1247
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:39,289
better I don't think anyone wants to

1248
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:41,269
bring dirty medicine to the table so

1249
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:43,099
what you're doing is creating the

1250
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:46,639
element or the atmosphere where they can

1251
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:48,559
truly learn and grow and and communicate

1252
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:51,129
with one another and that's probably my

1253
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:55,670
favorite element of both of your events

1254
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:58,820
until doing this analysis of the herb

1255
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,159
and the extract made from it to show any

1256
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:05,000
differences in terpene or cannabinoid

1257
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:10,489
contents or ratios you could also do

1258
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,769
fresh herb and dried herb because drying

1259
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:20,750
gets rid of three-quarters of the

1260
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:22,250
terpenes already good good input I love

1261
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,170
the point where they make your salt

1262
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,210
it'll be interested to see what happens

1263
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,619
next year cuz on the website I like how

1264
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,880
you're talking about how you're doing

1265
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:30,710
things this year and then you're going

1266
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,300
to apply them what you learned to the

1267
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,070
next year's competition I mean this is

1268
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,960
also something that this has been such a

1269
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,910
growing experience for everybody that's

1270
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:42,050
watching you do this because it's an

1271
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:44,719
application of ideas and technology all

1272
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:46,000
coming together under one roof well what

1273
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,199
was the Emerald cup when I say

1274
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,780
technology be in the testing and then

1275
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:53,960
application of ideas being organic and

1276
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:55,880
sustainable farming I think it's I think

1277
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,309
it's the only way to go and if someone's

1278
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,320
not there to teach these new young bucks

1279
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:05,809
so to speak how to do it right where

1280
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:08,870
they're gonna learn it it's the only

1281
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:11,210
conscious way to go but people buy

1282
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:14,239
Budweiser beer too instead of a a

1283
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:17,210
handcrafted small beer so I mean it's

1284
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:20,750
not the only way to go but it's the

1285
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,519
intelligent you know conscious way but

1286
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,199
you know the fastest-growing market and

1287
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:26,239
the spirits and alcohol markets is the

1288
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:28,069
high end and it's gonna be the fastest

1289
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,539
in the cannabis industry because once

1290
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,798
people could go to a collective and get

1291
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,989
an OG and not have to be

1292
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:35,358
you dog they all wanted og well now that

1293
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:37,249
they can go get skittles or you know a

1294
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,259
six star full melt concentrate they can

1295
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:41,629
see the difference between fresh frozen

1296
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:42,978
bras and rather than low-grade and so

1297
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,449
you're going to see those prices come

1298
00:48:42,978 --> 00:48:45,948
way down people gonna be able to use

1299
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:47,929
much better medicine because it'll be

1300
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:50,358
much more cost effective and this

1301
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:51,650
contest I thought it I really am proud

1302
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:53,688
of the fact that was stuff that you say

1303
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,338
we can take this around the country open

1304
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:56,538
source and teach all these people so

1305
00:48:55,338 --> 00:48:58,728
they don't do what we did to the

1306
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:59,839
triangle environmentally they learn the

1307
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,308
right way they learn how they're gonna

1308
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,380
get a better profile with organic

1309
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:05,119
farming techniques and how they can get

1310
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,380
patients to the right medicine and so we

1311
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,028
can teach this whole country in this

1312
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,160
whole world and we need to do is just

1313
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,748
open it up to export all this so that we

1314
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,308
can keep growing enough to sell it all

1315
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,478
over the world which is what we do as we

1316
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,039
do with the rest of California

1317
00:49:14,478 --> 00:49:17,928
agriculture we sell it all over the

1318
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,880
world well that's gonna be our saving

1319
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:22,219
grace whether they would just get back

1320
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,749
and be on the interstate lettuce go

1321
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:25,789
nationwide like they're letting the Jan

1322
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:27,288
kin of folks do with the hemp they sold

1323
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:28,759
a million pounds nation or worldwide

1324
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:31,400
they're gonna do to liam pounds this

1325
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:33,469
year you know and so that's what we need

1326
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,358
to do and then we can basically hold our

1327
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:37,369
heritage you know in some ways i think

1328
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,498
the opportunities in front of you and

1329
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:41,778
you know with with no disrespect to high

1330
00:49:39,498 --> 00:49:43,188
times they brought many of us together i

1331
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:45,018
wouldn't know a lot of my friends if it

1332
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:47,509
wasn't for the events in amsterdam and

1333
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:49,968
but i think that it's a different vibe

1334
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:51,949
and the community really could use the

1335
00:49:49,969 --> 00:49:55,309
kind of vibe that you guys are putting

1336
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:57,438
out because i mean again no disrespect

1337
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:59,150
to high times but it's it's more of a

1338
00:49:57,438 --> 00:50:01,038
party vibe and not exactly an

1339
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,099
environmentally conscious let's you know

1340
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,839
save the world vibe and you and mo cop

1341
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:07,579
has definitely been from more of a

1342
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,798
coming from the earth perspective and

1343
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:12,048
hey let's be responsible and hey let's

1344
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,938
be good stewards and good neighbors and

1345
00:50:12,048 --> 00:50:15,288
and i think that's the message more and

1346
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:16,969
more people need to learn as they get

1347
00:50:15,289 --> 00:50:18,859
into this community because if they

1348
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:21,979
don't if that if the community doesn't

1349
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:23,989
take on these core values it's just

1350
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:26,178
gonna be a [ __ ] show and you know that's

1351
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:27,889
we don't we don't need to see more

1352
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:29,838
events you know holding their events and

1353
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:31,338
leaving piles of trash so the vote you

1354
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,469
know the photos go viral and everybody

1355
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:35,088
thinks you know oh look at those jerks

1356
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:37,369
you know we need people like you guys

1357
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:38,838
that stay until the place is perfectly

1358
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:41,209
clean and you know leave it better than

1359
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,248
you found it and i really would love to

1360
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,358
see you go national with this if not

1361
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,909
international

1362
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:48,588
this because you know from the rumors

1363
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:51,528
I've heard people smoke this stuff

1364
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:54,409
everywhere so the potential is pretty

1365
00:50:51,528 --> 00:50:56,358
huge well you know we want to do we want

1366
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:59,210
to take exactly we're doing here this

1367
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:00,980
conversations and take that across this

1368
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,318
country so that people can very quickly

1369
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,210
not have to take ten years to learn we

1370
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:06,858
can get them up to speed and that's just

1371
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,900
a critical important thing for us right

1372
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:10,998
now because you can see this country in

1373
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,130
this world it's not inclusive it's not

1374
00:51:10,998 --> 00:51:14,179
community it's not I mean it used to be

1375
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,099
you grew up in a neighborhood and

1376
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:17,298
everybody in that neighborhood was part

1377
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:20,749
of your hood it didn't matter you were

1378
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:21,259
all the hood and it was across the whole

1379
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:23,149
world

1380
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:25,519
and now look at what we become in the

1381
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,139
cannabis world now unfortunately a lot

1382
00:51:25,518 --> 00:51:28,159
of dog-eat-dog is starting to happen

1383
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:30,170
because people are starting to be

1384
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,759
worried about their their brands their

1385
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,440
livelihoods and instead of everybody

1386
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:33,949
being an outlaw where it's us against

1387
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,499
them

1388
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:37,608
now it's becoming it's all of us against

1389
00:51:36,498 --> 00:51:39,828
everybody because we're trying to fight

1390
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:41,838
for our lives and we got to really stop

1391
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:43,548
that and really hold together as a team

1392
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:45,108
that's why we're trying to teach people

1393
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:47,420
how to manufacture we teach people how

1394
00:51:45,108 --> 00:51:49,788
to make 6-4 6-2 are full amount we don't

1395
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,619
hold back on anything that we do because

1396
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:56,509
it's got to be open source and it's got

1397
00:51:51,619 --> 00:52:00,619
to be a community well one thing you can

1398
00:51:56,509 --> 00:52:03,679
see quite obviously from the analysis

1399
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:06,130
the last few years is that varieties

1400
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:11,498
that have high terpene levels are

1401
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:11,499
consistently and in the winning circle

1402
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:16,670
absolutely the theis THC is never won

1403
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:18,048
any of our contests people have come in

1404
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,608
several times and told me they got the

1405
00:52:18,048 --> 00:52:21,409
is THC and they're gonna win and I tell

1406
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:23,298
them all I'll bet you a hundred bucks

1407
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:25,608
you don't it's the balance of the

1408
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:28,278
cannabinoids and the terpenes in our

1409
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:29,598
case I thought that it'd only be OGS and

1410
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,789
fuels that would win and then all of a

1411
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,499
sudden you add the green queen a green

1412
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,880
crack you had the lemon skunk you had

1413
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:37,159
these different things come in last year

1414
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,900
skittles and so for us our judges have

1415
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:41,420
really moved towards those terpene

1416
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,130
profiles and that balance and it's been

1417
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,539
nice to see so this Merit receptor that

1418
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,460
you see that it really is the higher

1419
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:50,480
terpene profiles that a lot of our

1420
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,679
judges look for but the real truth the

1421
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,769
real truth is that

1422
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:57,129
terpenes on an average used to be one

1423
00:52:54,768 --> 00:53:00,639
and a half two percent of

1424
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:04,599
dry weight total now they're moving up

1425
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:08,618
towards 5% and a few individuals have

1426
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:10,809
been created which are 10% 10% terpenes

1427
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:12,068
that's amazing and what do you what do

1428
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:13,359
you think the concentrate on those

1429
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:17,619
terpenes would be if you did an

1430
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:21,578
extraction that's I don't know I haven't

1431
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:24,329
done it and I I did not do this chirping

1432
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:29,200
work but friends of mine did do it and

1433
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:32,829
5% several people I know have fibers but

1434
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:34,179
a few people even have tethers because

1435
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:35,890
it's just interesting it you get a lot

1436
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:37,659
of people talking about the addition of

1437
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:39,429
cannabis derived terpenes and maybe

1438
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:41,078
there's a going to be a number where

1439
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:44,259
it's too high terpenes being

1440
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,880
hydrocarbons but maybe we are already

1441
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:47,740
seeing for the lasts you know maybe

1442
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,990
decade to two decades that we've been

1443
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:52,508
smoking some fairly high percentages of

1444
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:55,239
terpenes in our extractions well the

1445
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:58,929
best way is when you have a contest like

1446
00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:01,179
Tim's at the Emerald cup and the winners

1447
00:53:58,929 --> 00:54:04,268
are consistently those that are also

1448
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:05,409
highest intervenes there's there it's

1449
00:54:04,268 --> 00:54:09,250
not a coincidence

1450
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:10,960
if that's for sure now I think we should

1451
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:13,719
go back and do some research because the

1452
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,849
testing all came in so late you know I

1453
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:17,618
got a midnight I haven't gone back and

1454
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:19,028
looked at that data and we have all the

1455
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:20,108
data from all those concentrates and

1456
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:21,460
we'll bring that into the cannabis

1457
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:24,969
Country Fair because I think that's

1458
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:26,289
really you know a great great suggestion

1459
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:28,298
to to really look at these two European

1460
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:31,240
profiles in the concert right now the

1461
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:34,150
cartridge is pushing 15 bands got stuff

1462
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:36,038
came in over 14 you got really credible

1463
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:38,740
13 levels I don't know how high they go

1464
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:41,829
of where the balance would be let's just

1465
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:43,899
omit that so much research that we have

1466
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:45,460
so much data we almost have to hire

1467
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,670
somebody just to start mining all the

1468
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:51,480
data and giving us information and I was

1469
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:55,450
talking about herbal terpene levels of

1470
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:58,028
one or two percent now up to five and a

1471
00:54:55,449 --> 00:55:02,139
few individuals have been created which

1472
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:04,900
are 10 the extracts I I don't even know

1473
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:07,618
how how high those numbers would go yeah

1474
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,269
I think they'd be pretty high

1475
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:11,838
I'll have that information by the canvas

1476
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:15,889
country fair we're gonna put that up I

1477
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:18,210

1478
00:55:15,889 --> 00:55:19,588

amazing events that I can't come to

1487
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:41,368

we'll get over there Todd and I'll make

1492
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:51,538
it you guys are like I said all invited

1493

1495
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:57,118
Todd you've been a great support a great

1496
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,278
voice of reason I got you down in LA I'm

1497
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,960
up here in the the Triangle and it's

1498
00:55:59,278 --> 00:56:03,690
like we're both representing the same

1499
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,028
things we want the same things and we're

1500
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,588
seeing the same things happen so I can't

1501
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:09,150
imagine what we'll be in five years how

1502
00:56:07,588 --> 00:56:11,058
many products how many new industries

1503
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:13,139
how many things we'll have to talk about

1504
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:15,298
it'll be tough for the farmers in the

1505
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:16,949
transition but overall like you said for

1506
00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:19,978
the world and for all of us it's just

1507
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:23,998
going to be an amazing new dawn we're

1508
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:26,159
coming into a new world okay I said you

1509
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:28,348
know my upside of this Tim is I've been

1510
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:30,719
growing my own stuff since I was 13 and

1511
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:32,640
if a 13 year old kid can grow it in his

1512
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,349
closet without his grandma learning him

1513
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,909
let you know finding out he's doing it

1514
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,979
for a whole year I didn't get caught for

1515
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:39,538
a year anyone can grow their own

1516
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:42,239
cannabis it may not be worth much

1517
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:43,950
anymore to do it but you're also not

1518
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,210
gonna go to jail so you're not gonna

1519
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:47,939
lose your [ __ ] you're not gonna get your

1520
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:50,489
doors kicked in or your dog shot so have

1521
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,469
your Gardens I mean to me that's gonna

1522
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:53,818
be a beautiful day so I'm sorry a lot of

1523
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:55,200
people are gonna get flushed out of the

1524
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:57,808
industry but I'm really glad a lot of

1525
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,028
people are gonna are gonna really get

1526
00:56:57,809 --> 00:57:01,859
introduced to cannabis on an economical

1527
00:57:00,028 --> 00:57:03,778
level so that they can use as much of it

1528
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:05,909
as they want and people need to realize

1529
00:57:03,778 --> 00:57:08,190
that the worth of cannabis isn't all

1530
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:09,899
monetarily there is an incredible

1531
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:12,358
relationship to be had when you start

1532
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,568
using this plant when you start eating

1533
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:16,768
the essential oil rich seeds and oils

1534
00:57:15,568 --> 00:57:18,349
when you start consuming the

1535
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:20,419
cannabinoids whether oral

1536
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:22,639
or through vaporization or smoking there

1537
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,380
are relationships that are created

1538
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:27,889
through that and that to me has always

1539
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:31,490
been the worth of cannabis and people

1540
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:35,179
have to realize that high prices are

1541
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:38,619
really an artifact of prohibition there

1542
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:40,639
would be no high prices like this I mean

1543
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:43,789
traveling around the world

1544
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:47,299
I bought kilos of Simpson Mia for three

1545
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:51,440
dollars and fifty cents because it was

1546
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,580
barely prohibited in that area now look

1547
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,840
we didn't come up in the mountains I

1548
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:55,159
didn't come up here all those years ago

1549
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,690
to make a bunch of money

1550
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:58,489
I came up because I refused to stop

1551
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,840
smoking cannabis and put me in prison

1552
00:57:58,489 --> 00:58:01,099
they could do it but I was going to do

1553
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,660
what I wanted to and that's just the way

1554
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:05,179
it was and all the rest of the guys did

1555
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:06,379
I can tell you right now that you don't

1556
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:08,210
see the gauntlet in Northern California

1557
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,880
anymore there used to be people pulled

1558
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:12,980
over every day two or three as you drove

1559
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,390
down to the Bay Area they're gone

1560
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,949
those cops know they can't get a

1561
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:18,079
conviction even though it's not even all

1562
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:20,059
the way legal yet it's over there are no

1563
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,909
more gauntlet runs throughout Northern

1564
00:58:20,059 --> 00:58:24,380
California and hallelujah you know what

1565
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:25,789
they're bringing the cannabis down safe

1566
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,920
and easy nobody's going to jail like

1567
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:30,559
Todd said we've all gonna live in a

1568
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,680
great world and to me it's nothing but

1569
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:35,090
goodness and so I'm you know I just like

1570
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,589
I said the only is I think it happened

1571
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,120
very quickly but in some ways child

1572
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:42,250
we've been talking about this for 10 15

1573
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,250
years every year it's gonna be hit so I

1574
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:48,620
can go both so you know and I feel I

1575
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:51,169
feel my brothers and sisters growing in

1576
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:53,119
and that I get it I totally understand

1577
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:55,190
the loss of an economic opportunity

1578
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,319
opportunity but at the same time it's

1579
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:58,010
another opportunity that's good for

1580
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,930
everybody

1581
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:02,090
and you know hey cannabis for all I

1582
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:06,829
think should be our new motto to be

1583
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:09,140
honest yeah thank you for being as well

1584

1623
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,499
happened so that we can do these types

1624
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:32,568
of things so I'm really excited about

hey like that you really see the change

1632
01:00:46,668 --> 01:00:50,509
now do you think Alma had a lot to do

1633
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,839
with that Todd having his family move up

1634
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:56,179
in the last six months well or it's just

1635
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:59,268
the last five years it's it's been it's

1636
01:00:56,179 --> 01:01:01,608
been an evolution of change of culture I

1637
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:03,408
mean yet we were all afraid of putting

1638
01:01:01,608 --> 01:01:05,028
our families through what I've went

1639
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:07,608
through I mean etn had to clean up the

1640
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:10,130
mess of boy one of the messes of my life

1641
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:12,768
so you know I hate that burden on the

1642
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:14,509
people I love and to experience it with

1643
01:01:12,768 --> 01:01:16,518
the people that you're you know your

1644
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:19,668
family your your daughter's your your

1645
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:21,318
sons and to have them it's it's people

1646
01:01:19,668 --> 01:01:23,598
just sometimes don't understand or

1647
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:27,018
remember how friggin ugly it really was

1648
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:29,479
for a long time and to me it makes me so

1649
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:30,708
happy to hear that now he can with a

1650
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:33,228
paranoia

1651
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:35,418
invite the people he loves to the place

1652
01:01:33,228 --> 01:01:38,058
that he grows and and literally

1653
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:40,098
celebrate life instead of having to

1654
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:41,630
worry about that you know that the man

1655
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:43,809
was common and they're gonna kick down

1656
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:46,869
your still and shoot your dog and

1657
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:49,420
can ruin your life man I mean no way

1658
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:51,549
well now not only that he can attract

1659
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:53,289
now professionals to run that you know

1660
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:55,360
look we all specialize in our own

1661
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:58,360
aspects of what we're very good in and

1662
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:01,269
look I know when I don't have expertise

1663
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:03,730
in something I hire experts who do and

1664
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:06,130
when you when he listed off the cadre

1665
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:08,440
that he has running the show it shows

1666
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:10,180
how serious they were taking and that

1667
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,320
they really want to feel that level and

1668
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:12,789
that's what it takes you have to have

1669
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,309
production companies you have to have

1670
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:17,650
people running things properly that have

1671
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:18,909
done this before I mean it it helps

1672
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,430
greatly look I'm not saying that you

1673
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:23,259
don't do it but it very much helps when

1674
01:02:21,429 --> 01:02:25,389
you have all the contacts as you said

1675
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:27,610
when bands come to you as opposed to

1676
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:29,889
going to bands it's a whole different

1677
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:31,870
dynamic all together and let me throw

1678
01:02:29,889 --> 01:02:33,339
this out you know again I never wanted

1679
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:34,599
to be in a disrespectful way to high

1680
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,550
times because if it wasn't for the

1681
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:39,039
cannabis cups we would not have a lot of

1682
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:41,170
the cannabis consciousness we have so

1683
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,320
props to Haggar props the high times

1684
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:46,510
props to stand keeping up the torch lit

1685
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,430
and running with it and you know one of

1686
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:50,530
the things that I think is good is that

1687
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:52,839
high times now has new ownership they

1688
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:54,790
have very professional leadership that's

1689
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,650
going to come in and be able to execute

1690
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:58,960
the cannabis cup in ways that they've

1691
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:01,450
never been able to in the past so we're

1692
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,280
gonna see a whole new face on this and

1693
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:05,439
if they're listening I just say this I

1694
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,050
hope that they take on an environmental

1695
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,240
and and and a social event of social

1696
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,860
responsibility and high ethic and

1697
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:13,659
morality to what they're trying to do

1698
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:16,300
because we need to set a good example

1699
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:20,319
and if they don't who will

1700
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:22,570
I don't you know so well and you'll also

1701
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,370
see what Tim does ripple into other

1702
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:26,050
events you know we all know that there's

1703
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:29,019
how many events do you guys have up in

1704
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:31,360
there in Canada John and and bubble man

1705
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:35,320
you guys have you know competitions as

1706
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:37,120
well and we have so many here in the

1707
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,400
United States and so they're spread all

1708
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,679
over the world but they're looking to

1709
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:44,139
who's what standards are and so this

1710
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:46,539
gives us another standard set to compare

1711
01:03:44,139 --> 01:03:48,879
to to say hey this competition is doing

1712
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:50,699
this not only the environmentally sound

1713
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,680
but they're also doing it by terpenes

1714
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:56,439
it's it's accelerating the conversation

1715
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,739
so people laymen or force to get

1716
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,179
terpenes water Turkey

1717
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:01,250
it's gonna elevate the entire

1718
01:03:59,179 --> 01:04:03,919
conversation to a point of understanding

1719
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,840
that I think that the fringe are well

1720
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,430
aware of as because I'd consider us the

1721
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:11,240
fringe because we're the less than 10%

1722
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:13,759
of 10% but it brings an opening to the

1723
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:15,319
rest of the community so that people go

1724
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,060
away and then all these magazines

1725
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,610
because there's like 20 to 40 different

1726
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:21,019
magazines here in United States now that

1727
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,059
will cover that information and make

1728
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:24,800
people aware that oh this is how things

1729
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:27,259
are done at this competition this is how

1730
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,970
that's done there and it's gonna cause

1731
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:31,280
people like High Times to go hey maybe

1732
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:33,739
this we should it's gonna force them

1733
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,940
economically or through the competition

1734
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:40,129
and realizing how natural people go I've

1735
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,840
been to the High Times event up north

1736
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:46,010
and I've been to the Emerald cup and

1737
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:47,990
there is no competition in size that

1738
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:50,540
Emerald cup draws in comparison to High

1739
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:51,649
Times again no offense to high tech I

1740
01:04:50,539 --> 01:04:54,019
got married at the High Times Cannabis

1741
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:56,480
Cup God was my best man there I met

1742
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:58,880
bubble man there I met Sam Scott man

1743
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,409
there so it's without a doubt they they

1744
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,829
have their place in history but at the

1745
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:06,049
same time it's taking it and elevating

1746
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:08,358
it and it's great to see that this

1747
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:12,400
freedom with all mother's freedoms that

1748
01:05:08,358 --> 01:05:16,880
are given now with 64 that can push the

1749
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:19,820
allows this type of discussion not only

1750
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,858
that competition not only that that labs

1751
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:23,630
are calibrated and up to this point that

1752
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:26,869
we can actually having this conversation

1753
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:28,820
right now as opposed to hoping that one

1754
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:30,769
day so we still have a ways to go with

1755
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,809
with testing but at the same time it

1756
01:05:30,769 --> 01:05:34,730
shows us how far that we've come and

1757
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:37,340
very much excites me as down this

1758
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:39,619
precipice and is to look over the

1759
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:41,210
horizon to see what's coming no it's

1760
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:42,590
great I think a lot of good things are

1761
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:44,480
happening and you know and you know

1762
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:47,000
props to Steve a girl when the cannabis

1763
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,670
cup first started he was bringing in the

1764
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,010
whole environmental hemp information

1765
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:54,139
into cannabis and trying to expand the

that he's gone a little off the wagon

1782
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:36,529
these days with some of the accusations

1783
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:38,030
you've made and for you to say that is

1784

1787
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:45,829

I admire you a little more all the time

1789
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:51,799
sir that rumor is still going on and I

1790
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,889
got hit yesterday from some Instagram

1791
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:57,620
telling that same [ __ ] story a Sam's

1792
01:06:54,889 --> 01:07:00,829
a CIA agent yeah here at it every it's

1793
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:03,259
just such [ __ ] that I get quite

1794
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:05,480
offended when I get like where I come

1795
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:08,120
from it's really simple if you want to

1796
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:11,599
say that someone has ratted someone out

1797
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:13,819
you produce a document and that is the

1798
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,009
only way if you don't have that document

1799
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:18,019
you shut the [ __ ] up and sit down

1800
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:21,020
and that's just where I come from it's a

1801
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:23,210
very very very very dangerous accusation

1834
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:04,880
Wi-Fi sore a signal for my phone that I

1835
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:07,489
could get on to not Wi-Fi but my actual

1836
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,489
and I managed to pull it off each day so

1837
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:12,469

1838
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:14,659
of dirt bike riding many many many hours

1839

1842
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:26,449
toe but man I'll tell you I'm cool

1843
01:09:23,298 --> 01:09:29,630
though cool Wow sleeping in the tent was

1844
01:09:26,449 --> 01:09:30,769
a bit cold we were at 3,200 feet so you

1845
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,720
could see your breath it was probably

1846
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:34,460
one or two degrees above zero I think

1847
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,819
that's about thirty degrees Fahrenheit

1848
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:40,970
for the Americans did you bring the

1849
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:43,940
portable hidden like I was hitting this

1850
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:47,869
the whole time I just brought this that

1851
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:48,710
was fun I love taboo 1302 is freezing so

1852
01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:52,010
birdy

1853
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:57,199
no freezing okay so then it would be

1854
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:58,670
like 35 38 maybe III don't know under 40

1855
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,500
degrees you should have been making some

1856
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:04,250
hash of that there was only a couple

1857
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:08,020
degrees Celsius above zero so dry system

1858
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:10,880
there next time so so dabbers since

1859
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:13,600
bubbleman and Johnny and others here

1860
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:18,350
actually dab what is your preferred

1861
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:20,240
cotton-tipped user there's now a

1862
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,680
different manufacturers of course q-tips

1863
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:24,139
is of course the one that's out there

1864
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,640
but there's now different manufacturers

1865
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,960
or people that are promoting these

1866
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,600
different types I was just wondering

1867
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:32,270
what's your favorite item on your cotton

1868
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:36,239
and wood or something instead of any

1869
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:38,400
plastic yuck yep yep

1870
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,089
yep that's definitely on it but at the

1871
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:43,738
same time I will say this I also used

1872
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:45,390
mostly I like the big wood ones with the

1873
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:47,669
pointy tips because I was really

1874
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:51,060
thinking you had to scrape but as I

1875
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:53,670
learned to do the low low low temp I

1876
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:55,710
learned that at the end of my rip it's

1877
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:57,810
just a puddle I can just pick it up with

1878
01:10:55,710 --> 01:11:00,480
any kind of [ __ ] q-tip and especially

1879
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:02,760
because I use DC glass cleaner I just

1880
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:06,449
put a tiny bit on the q-tip and it just

1881
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,670
swoops right up I don't care what kind I

1882
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:11,149
use I think the more important thing for

1883
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:16,800
me is the DC glass cleaner I've taken

1884
01:11:11,149 --> 01:11:20,069
people tile 't paper as a glass cleaner

1885
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,409
if they can micro encapsulate it have it

1886
01:11:20,069 --> 01:11:28,079
stuck on the thing so it doesn't

1887
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:29,729
evaporate I've taken I forgot my patrina

1888
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:32,430
for I had something but it's all good

1889
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:34,079
I'm gonna hit a rip that's a great idea

1890
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,610
and somebody's gonna come up with that

1891
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,380
there's there's got to be something

1892
01:11:35,609 --> 01:11:39,960
where they'll actually have you know

1893
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:43,890
where it stays on the actual tip so you

1894
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:46,020
can actually just swab it to me the DC

1895
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:47,910
glass cleaner is wake more important

1896
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:50,010
than any q-tip because I can make a

1897
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:52,109
q-tip out of anything to clean the DC

1898
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:54,150
glass cleaner up if I can just pour some

1899
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:56,219
into my quartz it's gonna pick

1900
01:11:54,149 --> 01:12:01,979
everything up and boil it right out of

1901
01:11:56,219 --> 01:12:04,199
the out of the bowl press it I've used

1902
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:07,109
it a it is impressive when I've actually

1903
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:09,929
applied to my quartz it's it's

1904
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:16,439
dumbfounding how fast it actually causes

1905
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:19,940
everything marks Cal don't Sheldon in

1906
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:22,769
his non-chlorinated water karanji oil

1907
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:24,929
processed coconut extract processed kelp

1908
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:29,190
extract and process extract of sugarcane

1909
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:31,980
it's mostly water but the way it the oil

1910
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:34,229
kind of soaks up a little bit they've

1911
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:37,079
made videos of these greasy greasy like

1912
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:39,629
fully reclaimed like burnt black glass

1913
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:44,729
bowls putting it inside of this liquid

1914
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:47,550
boiling and it just literally melts the

1915
01:12:44,729 --> 01:12:50,149
resin off and D Chason eights I would

1916
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:54,449
have called it the D Chaz

1917
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:56,449

1918
01:12:54,449 --> 01:12:59,039

01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,869
smokey cloudy Bowl I'm talking if you

1924
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:15,119
get a little black on your bowl and you

1925
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:16,289
can be smart enough to not burn it with

1926
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:17,430
your torch because that's what we all

1927
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:18,689
want to do it's just like let's just

1928
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,460
burn it off I don't want to see it

1929
01:13:18,689 --> 01:13:22,369
anymore once you've done that you're

1930
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,659
[ __ ] the courts pretty good

1931
01:13:22,369 --> 01:13:26,309
from my perspective I it's just my

1932
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:28,880
opinion I'm not not an expert or

1933
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:31,920
anything but yeah become experts on

1934
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,650
coals because I the reason why is

1935
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,210
because the the mineral components were

1936
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:41,149
left behind i right into that's like a

1937
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:43,710
salt layer that sort of does not come

1938
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:46,170
right and once it starts building up

1939
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:49,260
right infuses and makes like a a mixed

1940
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:51,420
oxide with the glass itself so it sort

1941
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:53,280
of uses with it so it becomes like yeah

1942
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:56,880
if you start scraping it you're actually

1943
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:58,469
scraping the glass yeah but um so let me

1944
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,000
just understand I think we've talked

1945
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:03,840
about this cleaner once before right

1946
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,609
mark so you you you put this on but you

1947
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,260
immediately wipe it up right like it

1948
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:09,689
doesn't leave a residue behind here's

1949
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:12,270
the most important thing for me okay I

1950
01:14:09,689 --> 01:14:15,419
have a heightened sense of smell and

1951
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:16,830
taste kind of to the degree of it being

1952
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:19,319
more of a bummer

1953
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:21,539
than a good thing because trust me there

1954
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:24,659
are plenty of shitty tasting things and

1955
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:26,220
tons of bad smelling things like I'm

1956
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:28,109
that guy if I'm talking to someone and

1957
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:30,390
they have bad breath I can't be like

1958
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:32,309
three to four feet within them or I'm

1959
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:35,310
just like dude please go [ __ ] floss

1960
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:37,560
your teeth it's gonna throw up so it's

1961
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:40,680
it's kind of like if there's anything

1962
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:42,600
weird in anything I taste it this has

1963
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,460
never left a taste in my bowl it

1964
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,100
evaporates out completely like water it

1965
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:49,020
doesn't leave any residue at all and I

1966
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,329
just wipe it up with q-tips til it's

1967
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:54,420
till it's dry and then generally the

1968
01:14:51,329 --> 01:14:57,059
next time I go to smoke I heat my courts

1969
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,980
up so I don't even see smoke come off

1970
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,360
the courts when I'm heating it up unless

1971
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:02,369
I've left resin

1972
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:05,789
there'd been a little bit inefficient in

1973
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:08,729
my cleaning but you said it acts like a

1974
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:10,739
soap I got like a soapy kind of action

1975
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:11,369
to it did you say well there yeah that

1976
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:14,489
karanji

1977
01:15:11,369 --> 01:15:17,729
oil almost you know if I were to do this

1978
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:20,670
yeah seize it emotion right yeah well

1979
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:22,769
suffice not not not a huge percentage

1980
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:24,899
but there you know like I bet you the

1981
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:27,690
karanji oil content is very low like

1982
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:29,759
probably under 10 percent sure it's

1983
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:31,769
mostly water right most mostly water you

1984
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,250
can see the color even is very just off

1985
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:38,160
a little bit but mark if anyone else use

1986
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:40,140
grunt dog I use grunge off and in fact

1987
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:42,269
it's reminiscent of grunge often before

1988
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,890
I saw grunge off I'll never forget this

1989
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:46,490
I was in my friends coffee shop in

1990
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:49,350
Amsterdam the amnesia coffee shop and

1991
01:15:46,489 --> 01:15:51,869
I'm sitting there with the budtender and

1992
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:53,610
he's like I've got this new bomb cleaner

1993
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:55,380
and I'm like mom like what kind of bomb

1994
01:15:53,609 --> 01:15:57,420
cleaner he's like it's not from

1995
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:59,550
chemicals you know it's he's talking

1996
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:01,319
about how it was from an enzyme or

1997
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:03,510
something from a soybean like something

1998
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:05,699
they extracted from a soybean to produce

1999
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:07,289
this very organic you could drink it it

2000
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:09,599
wouldn't get you sick it tasted shitty

2001
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:11,729
but you could clean your bong and it's

2002
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,410
basically the next time I saw it and how

2003
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:16,409
I knew it was very much the same thing

2004
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:18,269
was because when I touched it it was

2005
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:20,039
almost impossible to get off your hands

2006
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:23,220
like you had to wash your hands for

2007
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:25,500
[ __ ] five minutes to get this [ __ ] to

2008
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:28,470
come off your hands and grunge off was

2009
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:30,899
was different but identical Richard took

2010
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:32,730
it and created a different property he

2011
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:34,589
marketed it and bottled it and I

2012
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:37,109
supported grunge off for years I still

2013
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:40,140
do it's a great product I just don't

2014
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:43,259
really my glass I cleaned so often with

2015
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:44,940
a little bit of hot water you give it a

2016
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,110
shake and dump it out at the end of the

2017
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:48,210
night maybe a shot

2018
01:16:46,109 --> 01:16:50,759
tiny little shot of ISO in there just

2019
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:52,350
cuz it's quick and fast but the my

2020
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,600
biggest deal nowadays is just cleaning

2021
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:57,030
my quartz I'm it would be interesting to

2022
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:00,240
see if grunge off worked to clean quartz

2023
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:02,429
in a similar way so Martin I squash

2024
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:04,439
question like if you have like a dirty

2025
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:06,869
rig like if you have your rig and you've

2026
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:08,460
poured all your rig water out yeah now

2027
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:11,609
you're ready to put the cleaner in and

2028
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:13,630
there's like globules of reclaim they're

2029
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:16,449
in there well well this stuff

2030
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:20,079
just act to dissolve all those globules

2031
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:22,149
you know like rule shaking and mark

2032
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,760
showed it to me it was he boiled water

2033
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:26,500
imported in his bong and Barcelona yeah

2034
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,900
that's what you have to do thick stuff

2035
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,609
and then used a little bit of ISO and

2036
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:32,109
cleaned it and it came out great and

2037
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:34,389
ever since he did that I have a hot

2038
01:17:32,109 --> 01:17:36,939
water tap at my house that's separate

2039
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:39,579
from my faucet so I used the you know

2040
01:17:36,939 --> 01:17:41,109
the the really hot water rinse it out

2041
01:17:39,579 --> 01:17:43,180
and get all that all what you're

2042
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:45,339
speaking of out of there cuz as soon as

2043
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:47,500
the heat hits it it loosens up and

2044
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,970
agitates and then I soak it with runs

2045
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,039
off and the stuff comes out mean I

2046
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:53,670
soaked this yesterday for that done your

2047
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:57,609
three entire effect you pour directly

2048
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:59,649
your liquid reclaim down a drain I I

2049
01:17:57,609 --> 01:18:06,519
wouldn't because it could gak up your

2050
01:17:59,649 --> 01:18:08,529
pee your fight poster what is inside the

2051
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,920
cold surface suwanee inside of your

2052
01:18:08,529 --> 01:18:13,929
pipes it's going to solidify like a

2053
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:16,060
arterial plaque inside an athlete's

2054
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:18,460
corrosive patient so yeah absolutely

2055
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:23,770
should not pour reclaimed down the sink

2056
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:25,630
hey Sam hey Sam yes would you mind

2057
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:29,560
would you mind enlightening these fellas

2058
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:32,020
too broken more glass pipes and any

2059
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:37,180
other human being on the planet earth

2060
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:40,420
who didn't mean to but I've also clogged

2061
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:42,220
more pipes cleaning my bones

2062
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:44,050
dude you're the reason I don't pour

2063
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:47,199
reclaimed down mice down my sink like

2064
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:50,380
today well you not for several years or

2065
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:52,420
even five or ten years but if you live

2066
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:54,609
in the same place you don't want to do

2067
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:59,340
it didn't you have to remove the pipe

2068
01:18:54,609 --> 01:19:03,579
and it was just like full of reclaim yes

2069
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:08,949
like a [ __ ] lilo I don't know how

2070
01:19:03,579 --> 01:19:09,729
much it was whether they called like

2071
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:13,840
snakes

2072
01:19:09,729 --> 01:19:18,519
you know those pipe snakes yeah and he

2073
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:22,390
says what the hell is this Oh black crap

2074
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:24,760
but it wasn't liquid anymore it dried

2075
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:26,190
and hardened out and it was like Chris

2076
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:31,020
Foley

2077
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:32,488
my god you're alright I can actually

2078
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:36,330
speak to this because I've actually I

2079
01:19:32,488 --> 01:19:38,519
dot I don't boil my glass I have done

2080
01:19:36,329 --> 01:19:40,590
actually cold soaks where I've just

2081
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,090
poured a grunge off directly into old

2082
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:44,460
pipes in fact I did this with a pipe

2083
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:48,360
that I had from the 90s an old pipe that

2084
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:50,100
I have from Oh glass blower that just

2085
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:52,529
had resident I just soaked it and then

2086
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:55,440
I'd pour it back into a separate

2087
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:59,399
container and then rinse it out but when

2088
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:00,779
I'd take that the grunge off if you put

2089
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:04,619
it through a coffee filter it'll

2090
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:07,829
actually go back into its container and

2091
01:20:04,619 --> 01:20:09,599
you can reuse it oh yeah yeah IV ivory

2092
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:11,069
used the same bottle of grunge off for

2093
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,600
months I actually just went by a couple

2094
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:15,509
swings and all fun if you have them for

2095
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,640
six months dude I have mine from years

2096
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,960
right and if you can if you have just

2097
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,510
making people where if you actually

2098
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,219
filter your stuff you can reuse this for

2099
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:26,280
years because it said well it's a great

2100
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:28,829
cleaner you can sit cold because again

2101
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:32,579
I'm fearful of that hot water in glass

2102
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:35,399
just myself because I've seen and people

2103
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:37,769
who do good things and Marcus what's the

2104
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:39,599
new glass cleaner as well that you're

2105
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:42,810
talking about I have that and I have to

2106
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,910
say I'm absolutely amazed and somebody

2107
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:46,620
said over here in the chat that Oh

2108
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:48,539
sponsored by I'm like no we're not

2109
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:50,729
sponsored by X by everything that I have

2110
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:52,319
and that stuff's not cheap but it's well

2111
01:20:50,729 --> 01:20:54,629
worth it and that's one reason why you

2112
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:57,090
can recycle it and reuse it is because

2113
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:59,430
it is expensive so you know just get

2114
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:01,650
some coffee filters and an actual a

2115
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:03,960
little spigot there to go in and you're

2116
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:05,939
good to go well this stuff is super

2117
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,890
cheap it's like eight bucks a bottle if

2118
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:10,139
you buy it buy the case or twenty bucks

2119
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,980
on Amazon or something and it's not

2120
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:13,199
reusable

2121
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:16,109
I don't own a shares in the company I'm

2122
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:20,069
not paid by the company but I do give

2123
01:21:16,109 --> 01:21:23,819
bottles of it away but Markus if you use

2124
01:21:20,069 --> 01:21:26,630
poured a bottle of that down my clogged

2125
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:29,399
pipe do you think it would have worked I

2126
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:31,650
think that if we poured boiling water

2127
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:33,539
down your pipe for quite a while and

2128
01:21:31,649 --> 01:21:36,329
then poured it down I think it would

2129
01:21:33,539 --> 01:21:38,069
have been quite effective yeah but it

2130
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:39,359
would have come out the top of your sink

2131
01:21:38,069 --> 01:21:42,329
yeah well

2132
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:46,049
that is how the pipes got clogged was

2133
01:21:42,329 --> 01:21:50,250
with dr. Bronner's yeah dr. Bronner's

2134
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:52,739
and boiling water Marcus is the pee the

2135
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:55,760
dead stuff I'm not sure that it says the

2136
01:21:52,738 --> 01:22:00,079
pH on here but I could ask Mick

2137
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:06,389
I'm gonna go throw it in a pH meter yeah

2138
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:08,189
each of that is I'm really curious leave

2139
01:22:06,389 --> 01:22:09,989
soaking into a glass is clean yeah so I

2140
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:12,118
haven't even cleaned glass with it I

2141
01:22:09,988 --> 01:22:14,549
just use it on my bangers but I'll tell

2142
01:22:12,118 --> 01:22:17,908
you I don't want to hit my torch my

2143
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:19,980
banger with a torch if I don't have the

2144
01:22:17,908 --> 01:22:22,019
DC glass cleaner if I don't have q-tips

2145
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:24,299
it's okay I can get something straight

2146
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,400
break off a little piece of paper or

2147
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,320
toilet paper or paper towel and make a

2148
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,479
ball and that's like my q-tip that's

2149
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:33,179
unimportant important is that I have

2150
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:37,849
this little bit of liquid to clean the

2151
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:37,850
bowl nicely important to me anyway

2152
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:45,750
greaser I'm thinking that it would you

2153
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:49,139
know like like grease is grease right

2154
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:51,479
well just to clean out pipes and it's a

2155
01:22:49,139 --> 01:22:56,039
real big thing in the in the wintertime

2156
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:59,729
when pipes start getting cold and and

2157
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:02,310
and oil becomes difficult to flow and

2158
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:05,158
yeah I mean anything that can you'd be

2159
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:07,020
used to degrease could be having all

2160
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:09,179
kinds of industrial applications yeah

2161
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:12,090
would you like me to send you a bottle

2162
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:14,569
mark can you of course

2163
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:17,610
yeah just send me an email with your

2164
01:23:14,569 --> 01:23:18,599
where you want it sent bc bubbleman at

2165
01:23:17,609 --> 01:23:22,618
icloud.com

2166
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:25,889
I always used a small amount of ethanol

2167
01:23:22,618 --> 01:23:29,009
it absolutely gets things sparkling

2168
01:23:25,889 --> 01:23:31,380
clean sure I just love the fact that

2169
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:33,750
this is non-toxic it's just simple it's

2170
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:36,150
like I put it in little I usually have

2171
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:38,189
it in these little vials I'll fill up

2172
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:39,689
like 10 of these and just roll with them

2173
01:23:38,189 --> 01:23:41,339
I give them to people too because it's a

2174
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:44,908
nice little thing you get maybe like 10

2175
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:48,300
or 15 cleans out of it and it does the

2176
01:23:44,908 --> 01:23:49,618
job it does the job I can hear my little

2177
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,570
guy in the other room getting all

2178
01:23:49,618 --> 01:23:52,589
excited I was away camping for quite a

2179
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:56,329
few days so we're

2180
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:59,069
have a nice day today for Father's Day

2181
01:23:56,329 --> 01:24:03,618
Father's Day what are you doing for dads

2182
01:23:59,069 --> 01:24:11,329
day dad's I see three three dads here

2183
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:14,759
yeah dad's lots of dads I honestly get

2184
01:24:11,329 --> 01:24:17,368
absolutely nothing for Father's Day that

2185
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,440
was different than any other day oh [ __ ]

2186
01:24:17,368 --> 01:24:20,670
I've rented a submarine and my family

2187
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,859
and I are going to be checking out the

2188
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:33,260
bottom of the ocean near the house sound

2189
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:37,250
I'm joking I like wish he had children

2190
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:39,810
no but that submarine sounds really cool

2191
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:42,060
allons you know recovery vessels but

2192
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:43,920
this whole yacht thing that seems like a

2193
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:46,139
lot of fun but I'll leave the kids

2194
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,899
tomorrow well one of the guys I camp

2195
01:24:46,139 --> 01:24:50,368
with he'd uh he builds sonars for

2196
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:52,289
submarines it's probably why it was on

2197
01:24:50,368 --> 01:24:55,019
my mind and why I made the joke but this

2198
01:24:52,289 --> 01:24:57,359
summer for two months he's going off to

2199
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:59,550
New Brunswick and there's this area of

2200
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:02,069
the Atlantic Ocean where like from the

2201
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:04,110
13th 14th century or whatever on there's

2202
01:25:02,069 --> 01:25:06,389
been thousands of boats sink in this

2203
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:08,819
area it's just brutal so he's going on

2204
01:25:06,389 --> 01:25:11,880
the submarine to go recover a particular

2205
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:16,439
vessel from like the 14th century how

2206
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:18,868
deep is the sub as deep as they go like

2207
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:22,198
he builds he did sonar for the British

2208
01:25:18,868 --> 01:25:24,539
Navy and he's been on military subs with

2209
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:29,039
the u.s. like this guy is said he's a

2210
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:32,579
serious sonar genius guy so he's yet he

2211
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:36,630
gets sick on submarines can you imagine

2212
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:39,479
I I get seasick quite easily but imagine

2213
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:41,520
your job was to build sonar systems and

2214
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:47,729
tests he has to go down and the subs to

2215
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:51,060
test it it's like Jesus okay so you

2216
01:25:47,729 --> 01:25:53,488
wanted to know the pH solution so yes

2217
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:56,969
kind of curious myself too so I ran up

2218
01:25:53,488 --> 01:26:00,529
to the garage ground pH meter it's

2219
01:25:56,969 --> 01:26:00,529
sitting out like six one

2220
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:10,539
does it surprise me it's mostly water

2221
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:13,030
move attire is it hitting ten three days

2222
01:26:10,539 --> 01:26:16,930
four so it's very much really really hot

2223
01:26:13,029 --> 01:26:18,579
out the line this question right and

2224
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:21,159
it's something I can do right quick for

2225
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:23,409
you guys so it's like right move yeah

2226
01:26:21,159 --> 01:26:24,159
then six seven so it's really really hot

2227
01:26:23,409 --> 01:26:25,960
yes

2228
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:28,930
yeah that's white immediately emulsifies

2229
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:33,189
the oil is way it just bubbles right off

2230
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:33,460
a little bit works it's like a magic

2231
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,619
trick

2232
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:36,720
it's like watching yeah I want to be a

2233
01:26:35,619 --> 01:26:39,130
chemist when I grow up

2234
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:41,050
dude you should man you know a lot about

2235
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:42,460
chemistry actually it always kind of

2236
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:46,750
surprises me I'm like this [ __ ]

2237
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:49,180
should get a degree oh wait someday I'll

2238
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:51,369
do something I want to be the king of

2239
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:56,260
mainstream cannabis when I grow up

2240
01:26:51,369 --> 01:26:58,059
oh dude the chemistry you can be the

2241
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:59,590
king of chemistry our Ian's already the

2242
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:04,510
king of cannabis so you can't be that

2243
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:08,079
but oh you got kraut

2244
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:11,020
I want to be able to do chemistry by

2245
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:13,840
just thinking about it so you don't have

2246
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:17,680
to touch it you just think about it and

2247
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:19,480
it did we even have our franco rip it

2248
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:21,310
seemed like that kind of dissipated did

2249
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:23,559
we all get together and say let's have a

2250
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:26,080
rip for Franco ie we all hit it at the

2251
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:29,080
same time let's get our bongs together

2252
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:32,909
we got a dabber remember doing this

2253
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:32,909
several times but let's do it again

2254
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:43,410
one minute time mr. Franco whatever you

2255
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:46,389
got everybody in the shower everybody

2256
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:56,699
everyone why don't we let Darren lead us

2257
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:56,700
into this one song riff everybody

2258
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:11,579
every lover while you mother loving

2259
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:19,050
father loving people out there happy

2260
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:28,289
father all right that was appropriate

2261
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:31,079
all right P Franco well I think he lived

2262
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:34,859
his life the way he wanted to and how

2263
01:28:31,079 --> 01:28:38,850
else that's that that is what to be able

2264
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:43,589
to live your dreams and manifest them

2265
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:44,100
that is the ultimate thing to me to be

2266
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:50,520
honest

2267
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:54,090
did you know personally Sam what is that

2268
01:28:50,520 --> 01:29:01,410
do you know him oh absolutely tell us

2269
01:28:54,090 --> 01:29:05,250
some stories about him I don't really

2270
01:29:01,409 --> 01:29:08,189
know him in-depth but I met him numerous

2271
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:12,689
numerous times and we talked about many

2272
01:29:08,189 --> 01:29:18,059
issues and I liked him well whereas his

2273
01:29:12,689 --> 01:29:19,649
partner I don't want to say anything if

2274
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:22,740
I can't say something good about

2275
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:23,729
something so I won't talk about what

2276
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:27,029
kind of strange

2277
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:28,769
did you know everybody loved

2278
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:34,279
Franco Franco has been involved in the

2279
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:34,280
European cannabis scene going back 90

2280
01:29:34,579 --> 01:29:40,859
obviously loved cannabis yeah we talked

2281
01:29:38,369 --> 01:29:43,199
to him about indica he loved his indica

2282
01:29:40,859 --> 01:29:44,969
I never deep conversation with Franco

2283
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:46,739
every time I saw him at the tea white

2284
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:48,390
copper when I was in Amsterdam and

2285
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:50,219
whenever I saw him about the see Franco

2286
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:53,310
always got the cups of the events once

2287
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:55,079
here in Vancouver and what he just loved

2288
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:57,960
to talk about the plant and the growing

2289
01:29:55,079 --> 01:30:00,300
and and and he was just so in depth with

2290
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:02,220
the way he fashioned and talked I love

2291
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,590
talking with Franco and he's definitely

2292
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:06,750
an inspiration and I know he definitely

2293
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:09,779
loved his indica and we talked about I

2294
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,430
definitely had seen him bumped into him

2295
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:12,859
in like

2296
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:15,020
half a dozen countries at least from

2297
01:30:12,859 --> 01:30:16,579
like all over Europe even in Jamaica the

2298
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:18,140
one of the last times I saw him was with

2299
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:20,119
Tony and they were just standing on the

2300
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:22,610
side of the road at a jerk chicken shack

2301
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:24,349
at like 1:30 or 2:00 in the morning and

2302
01:30:22,609 --> 01:30:26,059
we kind of pulled over cuz my soup guy

2303
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:28,490
was right next door across the street

2304
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:30,170
but I always go to the vegetarian soup

2305
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:33,819
guy and we look across the street and

2306
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:36,170
there's like Arion and dusty and Franco

2307
01:30:33,819 --> 01:30:37,849
pretty pretty funny too you know the

2308
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:39,800
love of cannabis brings the same people

2309
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:41,270
to the same places you know you can be

2310
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,550
in the middle of nowhere in the north of

2311
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:47,180
India you can be like in a ganja field o

2312
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:50,449
world it's a small world it's a small

2313
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:52,630
world getting smaller but when Franco if

2314
01:30:50,449 --> 01:30:54,529
you engaged in Franco with a

2315
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:56,779
conversation regarding cannabis a

2316
01:30:54,529 --> 01:30:58,759
serious conversation regarding cannabis

2317
01:30:56,779 --> 01:31:01,550
you were immediately a brother you were

2318
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:04,340
immediately a sister he just engaged you

2319
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:08,989
with just a love and an appreciation and

2320
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:11,270
yeah his his knowledge institutional

2321
01:31:08,989 --> 01:31:13,399
knowledge of cannabis and phenotypes and

2322
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:15,860
just smelling it I would watch him smell

2323
01:31:13,399 --> 01:31:18,170
a cannabis and look at it and in the way

2324
01:31:15,859 --> 01:31:21,859
that I you know I had learned to but he

2325
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:23,659
just his passion was so infectious and

2326
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:26,059
his love for cannabis was just

2327
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:27,859
undeniably it came through in every

2328
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:30,920
sentence that he spoke and he was very

2329
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:34,130
direct about what he expected one in his

2330
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:36,170
cannabis but his love and appreciation

2331
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:39,440
overall for every person who engaged

2332
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:42,350
with him was humbling and beautiful to

2333
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:44,989
watch because his his knowledge was just

2334
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:55,880
yeah very few people I know have that

2335
01:31:44,989 --> 01:31:58,279
type of knowledge in them thank you did

2336

2346
01:32:23,899 --> 01:32:26,599
bit of

2347
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:27,829
future and you came over here and you

2348
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,570
were like you had your little bag of

2349
01:32:27,829 --> 01:32:30,590
herb it was like a quarter pound or

2350
01:32:29,569 --> 01:32:32,059
something you're like I didn't have any

2351
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:34,069
concentrates so I thought I'd bring some

2352
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:35,680
herb we could squish well I did have

2353
01:32:34,069 --> 01:32:38,359
concentrates they were just not

2354
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:41,090
consumable by you right right I ate

2355
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:43,309
exactly yes not knows directed I didn't

2356
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:45,470
I didn't look I didn't want to wave in

2357
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:47,510
your face right right no problem that's

2358
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:49,820
cool but anyway the bud had this

2359
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:52,420
beautiful smile like it was very unique

2360
01:32:49,819 --> 01:32:54,769
it has there was a sweet skunk esque

2361
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:56,840
whatever that is I would have thought

2362
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:59,180
that was like terpene Helene what what

2363
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,310
what do you think that is chimera it's

2364
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:03,500
probably the pioneer combination with

2365
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:05,300
the lemony also wow yeah just the

2366
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:08,539
combination of the to make this most

2367
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:10,310
unique and Wow was the high every unique

2368
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:12,619
- we made some really nice Roz and I

2369
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:13,910
wished I had photographed it better

2370
01:33:12,619 --> 01:33:16,550
because we would have been able to throw

2371
01:33:13,909 --> 01:33:20,840
up a picture I like the name instead of

2372
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:22,279
mine pie at pie line well it was like he

2373
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,920
hadn't written like lime and pine or

2374
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:26,989
pine in lime on the bag as in the two

2375
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:28,880
dominant terpenes as in he didn't even

2376
01:33:26,989 --> 01:33:31,729
know the name of the cultivar I was like

2377
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:33,650
that's the [ __ ] right there I like that

2378
01:33:31,729 --> 01:33:34,939
yeah the names aren't important right

2379
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:38,000
it's the chemical profile that's

2380
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:40,279
important yeah and so I'm starting to

2381
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,720
rename things based on just based on

2382
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:44,029
that because I think it gives the most

2383
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:47,060
information right what do you think

2384
01:33:44,029 --> 01:33:49,639

01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:31,699
and Alex I don't know what happened Alex

2400
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:34,600
he tends to sleep in I'm guessing he had

2401
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:37,939
a really good good

2402
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:40,670
and some did fine so they back the cop

2403
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:41,299
down by does that oh you cut out there

2404
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:48,020
for a second

2405
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:50,060
your voice is breaking though go again

2406
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:51,470
right that's great well I be you know I

2407
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:53,360
would tell these guys they need to do

2408
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:58,130
this since you know we started doing the

2409
01:34:53,359 --> 01:35:01,250
terpene classes because it judge wine

2410
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:05,270
it's the same thing right like yeah it's

2411
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:12,079
it it close the similarity is to wine or

2412
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:12,680
beer to a lesser degree now that's

2413
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:15,800
pretty cool

2414
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:19,090
let's you know it's pretty cool so it's

2415
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:23,000
classified by the dominant terpene and

2416
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:27,860
it's for THC varieties rather than type

2417
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:31,369
2 or type 3 and you're gonna test both

2418
01:35:27,859 --> 01:35:34,819
the concentrate in the plant that's the

2419
01:35:31,369 --> 01:35:36,890
myth of the rumor yes that'd be cool I

2420
01:35:34,819 --> 01:35:38,569
think it's gonna be a Fanta as like that

2421
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:40,520
they're changing things I think it's a

2422
01:35:38,569 --> 01:35:43,009
fantastic way to change things based on

2423
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:45,860
science and not speculation and I've

2424
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:48,890
always thought that the that the classes

2425
01:35:45,859 --> 01:35:51,079
were stupid you know especially when

2426
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:53,150
mostly everything is is hybrids and

2427
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:54,949
there's no real true Hayes's in the

2428
01:35:53,149 --> 01:35:57,019
contest anyway that I would even almost

2429
01:35:54,949 --> 01:36:00,500
remotely almost want a mistakenly call

2430
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:02,690
sativa so it's always been this whack

2431
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:05,359
mix of hybrids that they try to identify

2432
01:36:02,689 --> 01:36:07,279
as sativa indica and other and I've

2433
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:10,039
always thought it was dumb so this at

2434
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:13,219
least is based on some accurate like a

2435
01:36:10,039 --> 01:36:16,100
profile a unknown terpene profile and

2436
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:18,920
then it comes I think varieties that are

2437
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:23,210
similar to each other a better chance of

2438
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:27,170
competing with one another yeah but I

2439
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:29,119
mean I mean when you look at all the

2440
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:31,340
terpene classes there's more to it than

2441
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:34,069
just the dominant terpene for example so

2442
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:36,489
I mean this is a good start and I don't

2443
01:36:34,069 --> 01:36:41,199
you know I'm not trying to poopoo their

2444
01:36:36,489 --> 01:36:43,729
their new method but it's it's not

2445
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:45,590
example is hiding like you can have

2446
01:36:43,729 --> 01:36:46,399
there's multiple different terpene

2447
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:50,000
classes

2448
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:52,339
the tiny superclass right right it's

2449
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,679
taking one instrument out of an entire

2450
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:57,289
Orchestra and trying to figure out what

2451
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:59,210
piece to the orchestras playing yeah

2452
01:36:57,289 --> 01:37:01,880
exactly so it's like maybe that is the

2453
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:03,619
loudest note but it's kind of and whare

2454
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:05,840
with music because that's what they did

2455
01:37:03,619 --> 01:37:07,819
a little genotype to music and it is

2456
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,130
it's like who's the loudest horn and and

2457
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:11,779
in a way it but it's a lot better than

2458
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:13,840
you know the made-up names that the

2459
01:37:11,779 --> 01:37:18,170
growers were calling it anyway even

2460
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:19,969
though it's too simple it's a start it

2461
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:22,670
is a start no it is a start and it's

2462
01:37:19,969 --> 01:37:27,230
it's putting us on the right behalf you

2463
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:29,658
know saying that it's like have you got

2464
01:37:27,229 --> 01:37:31,339
a cookies in an ogee like cookies no grr

2465
01:37:29,658 --> 01:37:33,679
relatively close

2466
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:36,319
I would I would say that they're you

2467
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:40,789
know they're in the same type right

2468
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:42,799
but typically og is especially what's

2469
01:37:40,789 --> 01:37:45,979
grown well it's like limonene dominant

2470
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,199
it's not usually Terry awfully dominant

2471
01:37:45,979 --> 01:37:50,779
but cookies for example is Kerri awfully

2472
01:37:48,198 --> 01:37:53,059
need ominous right so it's like those

2473
01:37:50,779 --> 01:37:54,408
are two plants that smell kind of

2474
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:58,340
similar but they're gonna end up in

2475
01:37:54,408 --> 01:38:00,198
different classes here well og is a an

2476
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:03,650
OG as a hell of a lot closer to cookies

2477
01:38:00,198 --> 01:38:05,809
then for example say Barry White right

2478
01:38:03,649 --> 01:38:08,689
so it kind of does chop them up in a way

2479
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:11,719
that's later we we've got to understand

2480
01:38:08,689 --> 01:38:15,109
the individual notes before we can

2481
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:18,739
understand the Suites when when there's

2482
01:38:15,109 --> 01:38:22,698
a a complex combination of notes you

2483
01:38:18,738 --> 01:38:25,729
know that that may be everybody's

2484
01:38:22,698 --> 01:38:26,569
favorite in the end but we have to start

2485
01:38:25,729 --> 01:38:31,279
someplace

2486
01:38:26,569 --> 01:38:33,139
ya know an allergy there's classic music

2487
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:35,059
there's bluegrass music there's jazz

2488
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:37,640
music these are all different classes

2489
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:39,679
that all get awarded Grammys right

2490
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:42,590
there's Grammys awarded in all of those

2491
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:46,119
categories so I think the categorization

2492
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:48,860
that Ryan is referring to something

2493
01:38:46,119 --> 01:38:51,559
based on how it actually tastes maybe

2494
01:38:48,859 --> 01:38:55,130
there could be more broader categories

2495
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:58,360
on citrus and how the terpene profile

2496
01:38:55,130 --> 01:39:00,309
expresses the citrus flavor could be a

2497
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:04,960
limonene dominance

2498
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:06,489
it could be a citral dominance so there

2499
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,250
could be all kinds of different other

2500
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:11,439
notes that are right underneath the main

2501
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:13,988
note and the predominant dripping there

2502
01:39:11,439 --> 01:39:16,348
to really give the overall flavor in

2503
01:39:13,988 --> 01:39:19,388
essence so why don't we just base it on

2504
01:39:16,349 --> 01:39:21,069
you know the human how that's yeah okay

2505
01:39:19,389 --> 01:39:24,400
when you do like the terpene suite so

2506
01:39:21,069 --> 01:39:25,988
imagine you have like you know it's like

2507
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:28,420
saying okay this is a three-piece band

2508
01:39:25,988 --> 01:39:31,538
with like a keyboard a drum and a bass

2509
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:33,130
player right and so you compare all

2510
01:39:31,538 --> 01:39:36,729
those different types of three-piece

2511
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:38,949
bands that are keyboard bass and and and

2512
01:39:36,729 --> 01:39:40,238
a drummer and a percussionist right and

2513
01:39:38,948 --> 01:39:44,408
that's gonna have a different sound than

2514
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:46,718
a guy on a guitar you know like a single

2515
01:39:44,408 --> 01:39:48,129
guy in the guitar or like a guitar and a

2516
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:53,230
bass and a drummer right like they're

2517
01:39:48,130 --> 01:39:55,510
gonna have different sounds so yeah it's

2518
01:39:53,229 --> 01:39:56,558
a start it's a start I think it's and

2519
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:59,320
it's you know we're teaching people

2520
01:39:56,559 --> 01:40:03,070
right so it's a start but it's also

2521
01:39:59,319 --> 01:40:06,189
predicated on very reproducible results

2522
01:40:03,069 --> 01:40:09,069
I mean so do all gorilla glues fit a

2523
01:40:06,189 --> 01:40:10,779
carry off lean the dominance or just

2524
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:12,308
certain well no that's that's what I'm

2525
01:40:10,779 --> 01:40:15,279
saying like environmental effects of

2526
01:40:12,309 --> 01:40:17,079
your grow contain your energy your seem

2527
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:18,788
dominant or they can push the limonene

2528
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:21,460
up and then it's limonene dominant but

2529
01:40:18,788 --> 01:40:23,738
really it's still beta carry awfully Mir

2530
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:26,230
seen and lemony right over the top 3 and

2531
01:40:23,738 --> 01:40:28,118
Ryan isn't it true that carry awfully

2532
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:29,799
and is essentially ubiquitous and all

2533
01:40:28,118 --> 01:40:32,049
green plants right I think if you

2534
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:34,270
extract just about any green plant on

2535
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:36,579
earth you'll find carry awfully it's one

2536
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:39,039
of those ubiquitous terpenes that just

2537
01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:40,719
everywhere yeah I mean it's really

2538
01:40:39,038 --> 01:40:42,788
prevalent it's not ubiquitous though

2539
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,469
because you can you can knock out the

2540
01:40:42,788 --> 01:40:46,689
sex kotor beings and have varieties that

2541
01:40:44,469 --> 01:40:49,270
are just monitoring there that are

2542
01:40:46,689 --> 01:40:51,460
almost only mono Terps right it's

2543
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:54,250
prevalent in most essential oils that

2544
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:56,319
i've looked at like mint oils gets in

2545
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:58,270
capital I know it's experiment

2546
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:01,058
peppermint too as well I just assume

2547
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:02,949
that it's just one of those compounds

2548
01:41:01,059 --> 01:41:05,469
that if if there are glandular trichomes

2549
01:41:02,948 --> 01:41:07,359
it's in there carey awfully just like

2550
01:41:05,469 --> 01:41:09,130
one of those basic molecules that

2551
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:10,658
subscribe yeah but it's funny though

2552
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:12,578
because let me when you know when they

2553
01:41:10,658 --> 01:41:13,658
pursued corn and they went after the

2554
01:41:12,578 --> 01:41:16,988
sweet corn and they start

2555
01:41:13,658 --> 01:41:19,238
Bradon for sugar content you know it's

2556
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:21,218
like like you with selections when you

2557
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:23,319
select for one thing you're

2558
01:41:21,219 --> 01:41:26,229
unconsciously selecting against

2559
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:28,748
something else right and it turns out

2560
01:41:26,229 --> 01:41:31,739
that most modern corn varieties have

2561
01:41:28,748 --> 01:41:34,599
actually purged at beta Kari awfully um

2562
01:41:31,738 --> 01:41:36,879
which is which is strange because beta

2563
01:41:34,599 --> 01:41:40,569
carotene is a compound that's kind of

2564
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:42,849
it's bitter tasting to bugs right or

2565
01:41:40,569 --> 01:41:45,429
it's even produced in roots right so

2566
01:41:42,849 --> 01:41:46,748
like there's corn variety they have

2567
01:41:45,429 --> 01:41:49,029
these corn varieties that are how the

2568
01:41:46,748 --> 01:41:51,519
high sugar varieties they get worked

2569
01:41:49,029 --> 01:41:53,768
over by you know certain grubs and stuff

2570
01:41:51,519 --> 01:41:55,748
in the soil and they're actually now

2571
01:41:53,769 --> 01:42:00,458
going back and breeding beta carotene

2572
01:41:55,748 --> 01:42:02,019
back into the court Wow I'll find out

2573
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:04,649
let me just give me two seconds I'll

2574
01:42:02,019 --> 01:42:11,650
find a paper post oh they're the

2575
01:42:04,649 --> 01:42:14,018
shrunken or the SU or the s you Yi or do

2576
01:42:11,649 --> 01:42:18,308
you know which version it is that you're

2577
01:42:14,019 --> 01:42:19,619
talking about I'll get the paper and put

2578
01:42:18,309 --> 01:42:24,429
them up and then you can have a look

2579
01:42:19,618 --> 01:42:26,469
okey-dokey wow that's crazy I know that

2580
01:42:24,429 --> 01:42:28,479
they were trying to put protein content

2581
01:42:26,469 --> 01:42:30,639
now I know this was like high lysine

2582
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:32,739
corns corns that you know are

2583
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:38,439
genetically modified to do all kinds of

2584
01:42:32,738 --> 01:42:42,908
stuff but man it's yeah it's they they

2585
01:42:38,439 --> 01:42:47,110
have what they call a you know sweet and

2586
01:42:42,908 --> 01:42:54,038
super sweet and the super sweets also

2587
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:57,339
have when you get the bits the corn seed

2588
01:42:54,038 --> 01:43:02,018
for planting it's it's shrunk up like a

2589
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:03,819
raisin I mean yeah I mean here here in

2590
01:43:02,019 --> 01:43:05,829
the mid-atlantic there's something

2591
01:43:03,819 --> 01:43:07,840
called Jersey white corn and I guess

2592
01:43:05,828 --> 01:43:12,099
it's maybe native to New Jersey it's

2593
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:14,199
small little pearl giblets and they're

2594
01:43:12,099 --> 01:43:16,538
just wonderful it's only basically

2595
01:43:14,198 --> 01:43:18,788
harvested at this time of year from now

2596
01:43:16,538 --> 01:43:21,698
to like maybe you know the end of

2597
01:43:18,788 --> 01:43:23,349
harvest but it's it's wonderfully sweet

2598
01:43:21,698 --> 01:43:26,319
it's great it's the best corn on the cob

2599
01:43:23,349 --> 01:43:27,470
you've ever had you can just eat it

2600
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:32,659
without even cooked

2601
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:36,789
that probably could he is laughing

2602
01:43:32,659 --> 01:43:36,789
butter salt over it is too he'll like it

2603
01:43:38,619 --> 01:43:48,229
right oh yeah all right so I've slipped

2604
01:43:46,279 --> 01:43:50,750
you papers in our chat and for anybody

2605
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:54,799
that's in the the viewers chat

2606
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:57,409
it's called amaze beta Kari awfully nice

2607
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:00,140
in phase implicated in indirect defense

2608
01:43:57,409 --> 01:44:01,909
responses against herbivores it's not

2609
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:07,820
expressed in most American mains

2610
01:44:01,909 --> 01:44:09,670
varieties that's what it's called that's

2611
01:44:07,819 --> 01:44:12,439
the paper yeah all right I'll try to

2612
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:15,590
paste that into the chat room so they

2613
01:44:12,439 --> 01:44:17,089
can try to find the link maybe I can

2614
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:18,800
even just paste the link into the chat

2615
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:21,529
room yeah they can just google that and

2616
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:23,930
they'll find it'll come up but and then

2617
01:44:21,529 --> 01:44:26,090
just you know if people are looking to

2618
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:28,039
want to find the paper sigh huh I don't

2619
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:30,500
see they weren't looking at the big

2620
01:44:28,039 --> 01:44:34,510
picture they were strictly focusing at

2621
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:38,029
the small picture and they were

2622
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:43,310
incredibly successful at creating what

2623
01:44:38,029 --> 01:44:44,929
they did do America but remember what

2624
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:47,270
they were doing was looking for corn or

2625
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:50,210
looking for high sugar content oh I know

2626
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:53,480
exactly what them and they were very

2627
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:56,600
very successful but they were only

2628
01:44:53,479 --> 01:44:58,759
looking at the picture right in front of

2629
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:00,110
them and not the big picture which is

2630
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,900
what you're talking about with this

2631
01:45:00,109 --> 01:45:04,639
paper yeah exactly when you go for one

2632
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:07,579
thing I mean there's trade-offs right so

2633
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:10,520
it's like it's like you said they're

2634
01:45:07,579 --> 01:45:12,470
looking at that one fine point right yep

2635
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:15,860
and they were quite successful at

2636
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:17,079
looking at about one fine point yeah

2637
01:45:15,859 --> 01:45:19,579
absolutely

2638
01:45:17,079 --> 01:45:23,210
but down line they realized that it was

2639
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:26,750
a bad sample it was it had other

2640
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:28,399
downstream effects right did you want to

2641
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:31,250
talk a little bit about the effects we

2642
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:33,019
got from that pine in line yeah the

2643
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:35,479
bottom limonene in finding the reason

2644
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:37,190
the variety is so special is that it's a

2645
01:45:35,479 --> 01:45:40,399
it's a rare terpene profile it falls

2646
01:45:37,189 --> 01:45:40,769
back to kind of the hippie weed of the

2647
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:45,000
seven

2648
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:46,410
you know it's like and it was really

2649
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,500
it's like I said it was just up and

2650
01:45:46,409 --> 01:45:58,949
focused right yeah they are both

2651
01:45:51,500 --> 01:46:01,859
potentiate errs and moderators yeah but

2652
01:45:58,949 --> 01:46:04,679
what broccoli should affect right it

2653
01:46:01,859 --> 01:46:06,089
basically opens up your Airways and lets

2654
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:09,300
all the other wonderful things from

2655
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:11,850
cannabis in yeah and like la moneda

2656
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:13,380
speeds up your heart rate and you know

2657
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:16,650
that kind of gives you that cut up and

2658
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:18,900
go feeling right yeah it was definitely

2659
01:46:16,649 --> 01:46:23,639
nice to dab we dabbed it out of

2660
01:46:18,899 --> 01:46:25,409
existence it would be interesting to see

2661
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:29,039
the difference between one that was

2662
01:46:25,409 --> 01:46:32,609
slightly Lima leaned dominant or piney

2663
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:35,100
down a minute mark resistancy of the

2664
01:46:32,609 --> 01:46:38,159
rosin was a tacky or sticky or what was

2665
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:40,470
it like was it you know it was quite you

2666
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:44,159
know pull and snap kind of sticky but it

2667
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:46,500
looked like very very like temperature

2668
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:48,539
pressure is sure it might even got one

2669
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:52,380
picture on my phone it was really

2670
01:46:48,539 --> 01:46:53,939
light-colored yeah Marcus but

2671
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:59,060
temperature and pressure you're pressing

2672
01:46:53,939 --> 01:46:59,059
it we press that eighty psi and the Tim

2673
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:08,789
what was the temperature I missed that

2674
01:47:04,619 --> 01:47:13,380
oh it was about like 190 to 200 hundred

2675
01:47:08,789 --> 01:47:16,560
I knew there was a glassy or buttery it

2676
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:17,940
was kind of in the middle of both of

2677
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,260
them it wasn't butter in the sense that

2678
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:21,689
you could pull it and it would like

2679
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:24,720
stretch but it had the color of

2680
01:47:21,689 --> 01:47:27,899
something that like looked because the

2681
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:31,289
color does do it yeah yeah but it wasn't

2682
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:38,279
there was uh we did two squishes with

2683
01:47:31,289 --> 01:47:41,069
this one well I was I can say is isn't

2684
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:42,869
life wonderful I mean I was really

2685
01:47:41,069 --> 01:47:45,960
impressed with that Sasquatch machine I

2686
01:47:42,869 --> 01:47:49,109
mean the the lemon pine it's such a low

2687
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:52,079
yielding variety but you know making

2688
01:47:49,109 --> 01:47:53,908
extracts by putting it in the column is

2689
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:55,198
not really an efficient way to go I mean

2690
01:47:53,908 --> 01:47:57,478
sure he'd make it you wouldn't get very

2691
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:59,399
much why you'd be able to have that

2692
01:47:57,479 --> 01:48:01,139
sasquatch and just put in like you know

2693
01:47:59,399 --> 01:48:02,698
a couple of grams or whatever it was the

2694
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:05,099
squeeze it out it was I mean that's a

2695
01:48:02,698 --> 01:48:08,129
beautiful thing it really was so right

2696
01:48:05,099 --> 01:48:11,130
why is that is that is that variety just

2697
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:15,029
that is a low oil producer is that just

2698
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:17,279
a no the amount of biomass that you get

2699
01:48:15,029 --> 01:48:19,679
off of a light it's not it's like it's

2700
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:22,168
hard to say oh those three like that

2701
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:23,668
3000 watts of electricity in like 12

2702
01:48:22,168 --> 01:48:26,279
weeks or 10 weeks or whatever we were

2703
01:48:23,668 --> 01:48:27,958
growing it for the yields such a slow

2704
01:48:26,279 --> 01:48:29,550
amount of flowers that some like just

2705
01:48:27,958 --> 01:48:32,158
take it all and load him into a column

2706
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:33,869
and economically really economically

2707
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:37,859
viable right so we've been really been

2708
01:48:33,868 --> 01:48:39,208
consuming in his flowers but you know

2709
01:48:37,859 --> 01:48:41,069
like we took it and put it in the

2710
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:44,429
Sasquatch press with it it coughed out

2711
01:48:41,069 --> 01:48:46,259
some beautiful it really was the essence

2712
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:49,559
of the plant I mean it was it was a

2713
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:53,489
really really nice - - was that a fresh

2714
01:48:49,559 --> 01:48:57,269
squash or a dried bud squash it was cure

2715
01:48:53,488 --> 01:48:59,399
it was cured bud okay yeah it had a nice

2716
01:48:57,269 --> 01:49:02,070
moisture content and it wasn't like

2717
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:04,859
powdery snappy but at the same time it

2718
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:07,649
certainly wasn't wet yeah it was just

2719
01:49:04,859 --> 01:49:09,058
cure it was well cured bud that's

2720
01:49:07,649 --> 01:49:10,618
something that steps is about six or

2721
01:49:09,059 --> 01:49:13,380
eight weeks from harvest so it's been in

2722
01:49:10,618 --> 01:49:15,538
a bucket but it's did you know it

2723
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:20,248
maintained its proper eight to ten

2724
01:49:15,538 --> 01:49:22,139
percent water content so this a squash

2725
01:49:20,248 --> 01:49:23,188
yeah it's a great little machine for

2726
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:25,979
sure I'm sure they're gonna make a

2727
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:29,099
smaller one so that people can you know

2728
01:49:25,979 --> 01:49:30,599
feel feel a little more like there might

2729
01:49:29,099 --> 01:49:33,840
be a little bit much having this giant

2730
01:49:30,599 --> 01:49:35,639
thing on at your house I got a kick out

2731
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:37,050
of watching me squash it too I mean it

2732
01:49:35,639 --> 01:49:38,458
wasn't me weren't just watch you weren't

2733
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:41,610
just using your eyes you're using your

2734
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:44,929
ears and your nose to like you know kind

2735
01:49:41,609 --> 01:49:44,929
of like the resin whisperer

2736
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:51,349
just a second man I'm listening quiet

2737
01:49:51,948 --> 01:49:58,038
herb talking to him it was saying

2738
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:05,750
that was cool those I mean really I I'll

2739
01:50:03,859 --> 01:50:09,649
come back and squish more cuz it's like

2740
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:12,079
that's the way to consume it those death

2741
01:50:09,649 --> 01:50:15,199
so tasty I mean they were just so tasty

2742
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:17,359
even the way it smells like fresh you

2743
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:21,109
know you could just be like oh my god

2744
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:23,750
some of those terpenes they're just very

2745
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:26,329
nice don't write your opinion that

2746
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:29,510
that's something that can be done you

2747
01:50:26,329 --> 01:50:32,119
know commercially the squishing you know

2748
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:35,570
to make rosin as a concentrated product

2749
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:38,930
in Canada yeah absolutely this is not a

2750
01:50:35,569 --> 01:50:40,880
very active all can up to a process

2751
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:46,610
where you're you know I saw someone

2752
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:48,050
posted a 300 gram shatter pad Pattie

2753
01:50:46,609 --> 01:50:49,549
that they had done looks a lot like

2754
01:50:48,050 --> 01:50:51,260
that's the type of process that you need

2755
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:53,000
you need to be producing at 300 grams at

2756
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:55,730
a time like producing a gram at a time

2757
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,199
isn't gonna cut it in a legalization

2758
01:50:55,729 --> 01:50:59,839
world right like that's more of a home

2759
01:50:57,199 --> 01:51:03,079
user kind of type of thing oh yeah

2760
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:06,050
even 3,000 you know like 30,000 grams

2761
01:51:03,079 --> 01:51:08,630
like who knows how it's crazy to think

2762
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:10,460
that well I guess there is enough

2763
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:12,590
cannabis being grown in the sense but

2764
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:14,659
just not by licensed producers but like

2765
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:16,489
licensed producers if they all got

2766
01:51:14,659 --> 01:51:18,139
together now could not they would not

2767
01:51:16,489 --> 01:51:20,149
have enough cannabis for even like a

2768
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:21,470
fraction of the people that want to use

2769
01:51:20,149 --> 01:51:23,779
it right now it's so it's kind of

2770
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:26,480
laughable that there's even this up this

2771
01:51:23,779 --> 01:51:29,869
option of a monopoly like that and they

2772
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:32,629
can't even supply it's not a monopoly I

2773
01:51:29,869 --> 01:51:36,529
mean are you talking about supplying

2774
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:40,190
herbally or long times that much so that

2775
01:51:36,529 --> 01:51:42,800
they can all make something like this I

2776
01:51:40,189 --> 01:51:45,139
would like concentrates myself I think

2777
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,860
that the main reason why dispensaries

2778
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:51,130
have a strong position is that they're

2779
01:51:48,859 --> 01:51:55,519
still offering concentrates to people

2780
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:56,810
and the LPS are unable to yeah the

2781
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,500
government really needs to deal with

2782
01:51:56,810 --> 01:51:59,390
that issue

2783
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:01,039
I mean the whole thing is when they're

2784
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:04,130
creating this legal market they need

2785
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:05,630
they need Canadians to buy in right they

2786
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:08,989
need to them accept that that is gonna

2787
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:11,690
be the new the new source for flowers

2788
01:52:08,989 --> 01:52:13,609
and if you keep you know if you say

2789
01:52:11,689 --> 01:52:15,198
they put the dried with the dried

2790
01:52:13,609 --> 01:52:17,259
cannabis at first I said no you can only

2791
01:52:15,198 --> 01:52:19,609
consume dry cannabis you can't have oils

2792
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:21,530
right you can't have extract so they

2793
01:52:19,609 --> 01:52:23,029
don't have the extracts available of

2794
01:52:21,529 --> 01:52:24,829
course the black market is gonna still

2795
01:52:23,029 --> 01:52:26,809
persist I know guys that are like MMAR

2796
01:52:24,829 --> 01:52:28,579
growers and they produce for

2797
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:32,510
dispensaries and stuff but they've moved

2798
01:52:28,579 --> 01:52:35,238
a hundred percent to production for

2799
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:37,520
extracts right that's what they do if

2800
01:52:35,238 --> 01:52:39,589
they grow green as we image and let's

2801
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,540
not forget this though one major thing

2802
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:44,270
the LPS would have been doing a lot

2803
01:52:41,539 --> 01:52:46,488
better had they not maintained the exact

2804
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:48,230
same prohibition based prices for

2805
01:52:46,488 --> 01:52:52,939
cannabis what the [ __ ] is that

2806
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:54,109
well this again it's it's typically LPS

2807
01:52:52,939 --> 01:52:56,479
are owned by people that are from

2808
01:52:54,109 --> 01:52:58,189
outside the cannabis industry I mean it

2809
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:00,559
like it takes ten million dollars to get

2810
01:52:58,189 --> 01:53:02,389
a license right so that's not your

2811
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,980
average stout or a grower that can come

2812
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:06,920
in and compete in that they can't play

2813
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:08,809
in that pool so it ends up being a bunch

2814
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:10,069
of money guys and with money guys the

2815
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:13,130
first thing is how do they get their

2816
01:53:10,069 --> 01:53:14,960
money back yeah of course the same

2817
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:17,020
prohibition based prices so that's what

2818
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:19,279
I mean like I think the black market

2819
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:22,100
would have been more drastically

2820
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:23,659
affected just like anything if all of a

2821
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:26,690
sudden people can buy something it's

2822
01:53:23,659 --> 01:53:28,849
good quality and it's not expensive like

2823
01:53:26,689 --> 01:53:31,279
make it inexpensive and go for the long

2824
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:33,860
game but let's flip the script I mean

2825
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:35,689
how much would five star go for in in

2826
01:53:33,859 --> 01:53:39,500
the new model like five star should

2827
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:41,689
command the highest price right but but

2828
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:43,939
that price will be dependent upon how

2829
01:53:41,689 --> 01:53:45,619
much material we can get to grow that

2830
01:53:43,939 --> 01:53:47,599
kind of material you know to process

2831
01:53:45,619 --> 01:53:51,890
into that product and what was the cost

2832
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:54,530
on doing it it was never as much as have

2833
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:57,650
been based on prohibition

2834
01:53:54,529 --> 01:54:01,219
yeah but missions gone then the price

2835
01:53:57,649 --> 01:54:04,939
will be supply and demand and what the

2836
01:54:01,219 --> 01:54:06,350
real price to produce cost right that's

2837
01:54:04,939 --> 01:54:07,849
what I mean it's not there's a little

2838
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:10,280
bit of a gap there in the actual

2839
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:11,810
production cost and I mean they're

2840
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:13,698
making it seem like well the production

2841
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:15,500
costs are high because you know that

2842
01:54:13,698 --> 01:54:17,089
some of them are putting 30 40 million

2843
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:19,159
dollars into their facilities so yeah

2844
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:20,659
that is a high production cost but in

2845
01:54:19,159 --> 01:54:22,880
the long run it's like a toll bridge

2846
01:54:20,659 --> 01:54:23,869
they don't need to charge you $100 each

2847
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,119
time because the

2848
01:54:23,869 --> 01:54:28,130
assistance II and the growth and the

2849
01:54:26,119 --> 01:54:31,099
sheer volume that will move through that

2850
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:32,900
bridge will pay it off like tenfold in

2851
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:35,510
like you know 20 years or something to

2852
01:54:32,899 --> 01:54:37,789
think about the Lyman pine again so say

2853
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:40,940
say they're growing like BC grapefruit

2854
01:54:37,789 --> 01:54:42,829
for example their produce and two ounces

2855
01:54:40,939 --> 01:54:45,289
of square foot or her like you know

2856
01:54:42,829 --> 01:54:47,539
they're doing a gram per watt right

2857
01:54:45,289 --> 01:54:50,960
well the Lyman pine is gonna produce

2858
01:54:47,539 --> 01:54:53,449
like 200 grams for per thousand walk

2859
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:56,270
light it's not going to produce a kilo

2860
01:54:53,449 --> 01:54:57,979
so it's it's five tighter therefore the

2861
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:59,630
footprint is five times more expensive

2862
01:54:57,979 --> 01:55:02,359
many of your growing a high yielding

2863
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:04,130
variety exactly right so instead of like

2864
01:55:02,359 --> 01:55:06,710
four bucks a G it will be twenty bucks

2865
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:08,539
well but you're not thinking about the

2866
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:10,069
rest of the world getting involved in

2867
01:55:08,539 --> 01:55:13,489
that same cultivar being grown in

2868
01:55:10,069 --> 01:55:16,159
Jamaica or Brazil or India and being

2869
01:55:13,489 --> 01:55:18,469
able to express that terpene expression

2870
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:20,659
even better under the Sun under a hue

2871
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:22,159
you know on an acreage and now we're

2872
01:55:20,659 --> 01:55:24,380
getting into you know the supply and

2873
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:27,309
demand an agricultural product and the

2874
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:29,210
price is not gonna be as high yeah

2875
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:31,550
that's possible I mean that's

2876
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:33,289
theoretically possible the regular don't

2877
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:35,960
really we don't really go for that yet

2878
01:55:33,289 --> 01:55:38,630
they will they they have to once that

2879
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:40,340
once America goes federal all the other

2880
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:42,079
countries are just like they're so

2881
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:43,579
confused by this state thing that's

2882
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:45,949
happening and money that's being made

2883
01:55:43,579 --> 01:55:47,869
and Colorado made 200 million like it's

2884
01:55:45,949 --> 01:55:49,880
just like constant right all over the

2885
01:55:47,869 --> 01:55:52,579
world trust me beautiful governments are

2886
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:55,940
seeing this [ __ ] the future of cannabis

2887
01:55:52,579 --> 01:55:59,269
and extract just look look at how many

2888
01:55:55,939 --> 01:56:01,879
countries can you buy wine from how many

2889
01:55:59,270 --> 01:56:06,460
countries can you buy distilled spirits

2890
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:09,050
problems is the future of cannabis

2891
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:11,630
international trade item and you know

2892
01:56:09,050 --> 01:56:14,210
what I think you can't trick go from

2893
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:17,000
state to state but that's gonna change

2894
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:19,640
really fast no I think you're right Sam

2895
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,300
and I think that certain places will

2896
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:24,890
uncover certain cultivars that Express

2897
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:27,440
almost you know the highest expression

2898
01:56:24,890 --> 01:56:29,360
the the one of the in the I don't know

2899
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:31,339
how to really word it properly but yeah

2900
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:33,739
you know the way I bring it up all the

2901
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:35,569
time French is the France is known for

2902
01:56:33,739 --> 01:56:37,719
some of the best lavender because for

2903
01:56:35,569 --> 01:56:39,429
whatever reason in that region all the

2904
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:41,530
variables environmental everything adds

2905
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:43,329
up to a beautiful expression of terpenes

2906
01:56:41,529 --> 01:56:45,639
yeah absolutely it's the same with white

2907
01:56:43,329 --> 01:56:48,729
I mean that's why Australians known for

2908
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:50,320
sure as our Syrah grapes right they grow

2909
01:56:48,729 --> 01:56:55,629
really well in that area they make a

2910
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:58,750
really nice product so it's obvious

2911
01:56:55,630 --> 01:57:01,539
cannabis will be that way both grown

2912
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:05,590
outdoors in perfect conditions that

2913
01:57:01,539 --> 01:57:09,340
allow it to finish bully and also in

2914
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:13,569
greenhouses with without supplemental

2915
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:18,640
lights and darkening and in indoors

2916
01:57:13,569 --> 01:57:23,250
under lights if that is required for

2917
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:31,140
some reason whether be legal problems or

2918
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:34,109
weather or maybe medical requirements

2919
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:36,220
yeah I mean we saw it will happen when

2920
01:57:34,109 --> 01:57:37,689
you know right now again and remember it

2921
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,980
is all growers and they're expecting

2922
01:57:37,689 --> 01:57:40,869
these high prices but remember what

2923
01:57:38,979 --> 01:57:43,389
happened when Scott and our shanty Baba

2924
01:57:40,869 --> 01:57:45,609
and and all those folks were growing

2925
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:48,100
down in Switzerland and they went to the

2926
01:57:45,609 --> 01:57:49,179
tomato growers and they said hey you

2927
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:50,500
know if you get a plant we're gonna give

2928
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:51,850
you the clones and if you get the plants

2929
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:53,439
to knee-high they'll be worth this much

2930
01:57:51,850 --> 01:57:57,310
and if they get to waist high they'll be

2931
01:57:53,439 --> 01:58:00,069
worth this much and you know to the

2932
01:57:57,310 --> 01:58:01,690
tomato growers they were making like you

2933
01:58:00,069 --> 01:58:04,539
know a dollar two dollars or whatever

2934
01:58:01,689 --> 01:58:06,969
was per square foot so when when you

2935
01:58:04,539 --> 01:58:08,229
offered them five they were stoked I

2936
01:58:06,970 --> 01:58:09,490
mean the growers were so thrilled to

2937
01:58:08,229 --> 01:58:11,259
grow cannabis rather than tomatoes

2938
01:58:09,489 --> 01:58:15,340
because they made five times as much but

2939
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:16,869
the reality is that to a joke or I mean

2940
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:18,400
they were for the guys that were buying

2941
01:58:16,869 --> 01:58:20,559
it from them it was worth like twenty

2942
01:58:18,399 --> 01:58:24,219
dollars square foot or $30 a square foot

2943
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:27,100
right so when you get the growers from

2944
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:28,990
other industries involved there they're

2945
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:30,730
gonna that's when the costs are really

2946
01:58:28,989 --> 01:58:32,679
gonna drop right because they don't have

2947
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:34,719
the expectations in a cannabis grower

2948
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,950
they have the expectation of someone

2949
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:37,690
that's producing they're getting by just

2950
01:58:35,949 --> 01:58:40,269
producing like just a couple of dollars

2951
01:58:37,689 --> 01:58:42,669
per square foot yeah I will say that I

2952
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:45,850
see well sorry son go ahead in the

2953
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:48,730
Netherlands the margin used to be 25

2954
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:50,910
cents or what could make or break would

2955
01:58:48,729 --> 01:58:54,839
be 50 cents of square me

2956
01:58:50,909 --> 01:58:59,399
but that was in the street in flower and

2957
01:58:54,840 --> 01:59:00,930
vegetable market yeah so when you know

2958
01:58:59,399 --> 01:59:03,329
on the laws change enough that all those

2959
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:06,030
guys can actually get into the game

2960
01:59:03,329 --> 01:59:08,340
without having to go through these

2961
01:59:06,029 --> 01:59:11,550
insane restrictions to become a licensed

2962
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,930
producer you know that's when we're

2963
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:14,940
gonna really see the chief cannabis

2964
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:16,619
coming up because it will shift from

2965
01:59:14,939 --> 01:59:17,699
those few people that are growing

2966
01:59:16,619 --> 01:59:20,489
cannabis now

2967
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:22,979
- like Todd's been saying for so long

2968
01:59:20,489 --> 01:59:27,359
it'll be an agricultural crop where any

2969
01:59:22,979 --> 01:59:29,419
pot of it prices are gonna crash hey

2970
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:33,029
Ryan did you see this um

2971
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:34,890
PCR tool that Kevin's company released

2972
01:59:33,029 --> 01:59:37,139
for rusted mites

2973
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:38,460
I'm putting the link up right now mark I

2974
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:41,970
don't know if you can put that link in

2975
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:42,270
the in the YouTube chat absolutely I

2976
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:45,780
will

2977
01:59:42,270 --> 01:59:47,460
but um yeah yeah I was it was powdery

2978
01:59:45,779 --> 01:59:49,590
mildew and rusted mites right so it's

2979
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:53,369
the other one yeah I mean PCR is great

2980
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:56,130
method actually detecting unique DNA

2981
01:59:53,369 --> 01:59:58,890
sequences right so the every every

2982
01:59:56,130 --> 02:00:01,409
species has unique DNA sequences so you

2983
01:59:58,890 --> 02:00:03,950
can help are those unique sequences then

2984
02:00:01,409 --> 02:00:06,329
you can use them to as a probe to see

2985
02:00:03,949 --> 02:00:10,199
they're there I mean yeah I don't

2986
02:00:06,329 --> 02:00:14,189
again I don't I don't know sober killer

2987
02:00:10,199 --> 02:00:15,720
I'm just trying to say this will be yeah

2988
02:00:14,189 --> 02:00:17,519
it's another little tool in the toolbox

2989
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:20,010
what I mean it's only useful is because

2990
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:22,470
it only like I said I'd only detects

2991
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:24,329
that one unique sequence to or that

2992
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:28,140
they've identified in Britain Russert

2993
02:00:24,329 --> 02:00:31,140
might so so it useful for both broad my

2994
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:33,660
trusted Knights and using it on little

2995
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:35,910
tiny clones that you were taking if you

2996
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:38,399
were gonna grow them to be a big mother

2997
02:00:35,909 --> 02:00:41,430
it might be no nice to know that they

2998
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:45,599
were free of these problems it's so it

2999
02:00:41,430 --> 02:00:48,780
can be what is the diagnosis it can only

3000
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:51,720
be used once the infection is taking

3001
02:00:48,779 --> 02:00:54,439
place or could it could look at the I

3002
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:57,750
think Kevin told me that it was

3003
02:00:54,439 --> 02:00:59,969
effective on a single spider mite yeah

3004
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:02,760
they are there well that's the beauty

3005
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:04,469
thing about how PCR works is that's what

3006
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:07,110
they use and we're in crime

3007
02:01:04,469 --> 02:01:10,890
to identify blood samples because you

3008
02:01:07,109 --> 02:01:13,319
can take a tiny tiny little piece of DNA

3009
02:01:10,890 --> 02:01:15,360
and you amplify it in the process and

3010
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:17,130
you can say oh wow there's this you know

3011
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:19,289
in that little tiny piece of DNA we

3012
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:22,289
found this sequence right and so that

3013
02:01:19,289 --> 02:01:24,090
the reason I think it's useful for for

3014
02:01:22,289 --> 02:01:26,609
us at mites are for cyclamen mites or

3015
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:29,069
whatever they are is that they're so

3016
02:01:26,609 --> 02:01:30,299
small they're hard to identify I can't

3017
02:01:29,069 --> 02:01:33,179
see him really

3018
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:35,670
I mean without some handheld device I

3019
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:37,710
can't see them no you see the damage but

3020
02:01:35,670 --> 02:01:38,730
you don't yes exactly you know

3021
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:41,340
something's wrong

3022
02:01:38,729 --> 02:01:45,179
yeah so that'll help them you know it'll

3023
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:47,159
help people identify but like if you

3024
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:49,680
have an infection in one part of the

3025
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:51,569
plant that's isolated from the rest of

3026
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:53,969
the mass of the plant and you sample

3027
02:01:51,569 --> 02:01:57,029
from the rest of the mass will you also

3028
02:01:53,969 --> 02:01:59,279
come up with a positive hit even though

3029
02:01:57,029 --> 02:02:02,250
were you sampled from isn't necessarily

3030
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:06,359
in fact don't think so no but you have

3031
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:08,789
to have a DNA yeah that's part of the

3032
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:10,710
creature now DNA doesn't deep right

3033
02:02:08,789 --> 02:02:14,069
these are the already moving on the

3034
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:17,399
plant right right so there's nothing

3035
02:02:14,069 --> 02:02:19,609
systemic about infection in the plant

3036
02:02:17,399 --> 02:02:21,750
that now creates some kind of

3037
02:02:19,609 --> 02:02:25,500
biomolecule that can be worried there

3038
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:28,560
might be a virus transmitted but that's

3039
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:34,488
not part of the of the might directly

3040
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:34,489
it's a virus but mites do spread viruses

3041
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:39,359
right I mean this is how they test for

3042
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:42,390
e.coli in the food supply I mean it's a

3043
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:44,819
very very sensitive methodology I was

3044
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:47,820
just wondering is it really and I don't

3045
02:02:44,819 --> 02:02:50,069
have any other person that I think is

3046
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:51,659
more qualified than Ryan to understand

3047
02:02:50,069 --> 02:02:54,389
you know whether or not this is like

3048
02:02:51,659 --> 02:02:57,869
overkill or is this something that's

3049
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:59,369
gonna be in every lab like everyone's

3050
02:02:57,869 --> 02:03:01,559
gonna have one of these things because

3051
02:02:59,369 --> 02:03:03,659
this is just repeat like the bee's knees

3052
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:06,000
when it comes to how to determine

3053
02:03:03,659 --> 02:03:08,670
whether and I read ever a headdress it

3054
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:14,069
might I'm not saying you can't but I

3055
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:16,319
think going for forty years I've never

3056
02:03:14,069 --> 02:03:18,429
had breasts at mites I've never had

3057
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:20,809
broad mites

3058
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:24,230
yeah I mean in question as to whether

3059
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:26,210
it's the overkill is it's really like do

3060
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:28,279
you have the problem then it's not

3061
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:30,020
overkill exactly but I mean for example

3062
02:03:28,279 --> 02:03:32,149
like you don't need it to identify the

3063
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:33,680
two spotted spider mite because the

3064
02:03:32,149 --> 02:03:35,779
damage is apparent I mean it's pretty

3065
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:37,460
clear when you see that right me right

3066
02:03:35,779 --> 02:03:39,800
know you've got mice you don't need to

3067
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:41,539
code and get a PCR test to say if you

3068
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:48,350
actually get webs and you're really

3069
02:03:41,539 --> 02:03:50,600
styling you can really tell yeah but I

3070
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:52,640
mean like I said the cyclamen mites are

3071
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:54,200
so small and the leaked it like it's

3072
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:56,180
it's one of those one of those things

3073
02:03:54,199 --> 02:03:57,679
where it's like growers are like there's

3074
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:58,850
something wrong with my plant what the

3075
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:02,450
hell is going on

3076
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:05,210
right you get the sampling symptom but

3077
02:04:02,449 --> 02:04:07,130
it's hard because you the mites are so

3078
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:09,500
so tiny you can't see them it's hard to

3079
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:10,789
identify that this is the pest so for

3080
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:13,430
that type of thing sure it would be a

3081
02:04:10,789 --> 02:04:15,649
really it would be a cool way to say no

3082
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:21,500
no you've got you've got rust mites you

3083
02:04:15,649 --> 02:04:24,019
need to do this right right can't be

3084
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:26,960
with a new material that you were gonna

3085
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:28,970
bring in from outside of leverage if

3086
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:31,279
your greenhouse is quarantined then

3087
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:32,930
you're gonna bring fresh material in to

3088
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:36,139
be able to test it with something like

3089
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:38,090
this might be a half something Andy the

3090
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:39,440
thing the way I feel better than this is

3091
02:04:38,090 --> 02:04:40,789
they've got you've got you know there's

3092
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:42,409
there's sample prep and there's

3093
02:04:40,789 --> 02:04:44,479
collecting and all that stuff takes time

3094
02:04:42,409 --> 02:04:49,069
when you're when you're when you're

3095
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:51,199
doing that right but so to get back like

3096
02:04:49,069 --> 02:04:53,989
one piece of information like Mike's

3097
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:56,960
present yes or no or y-chromosome

3098
02:04:53,989 --> 02:04:58,729
present yes or no it's like who cares it

3099
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:00,920
when it's like one at a time you're

3100
02:04:58,729 --> 02:05:03,199
getting me straight however you can get

3101
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:06,440
them all together in a gene panel or on

3102
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:07,939
a gene Chandni and there's that you know

3103
02:05:06,439 --> 02:05:10,099
that needs to bit that to the lab and

3104
02:05:07,939 --> 02:05:12,529
you get back information on a hundred

3105
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:14,450
markers or a thousand things right all

3106
02:05:12,529 --> 02:05:17,059
the pathogens all the ones that are bad

3107
02:05:14,449 --> 02:05:19,750
so so you can do this as I understand

3108
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:22,430
not on just live plants but on on

3109
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:24,409
harvested material and cured material as

3110
02:05:22,430 --> 02:05:26,240
well yeah if it's DNA based it doesn't

3111
02:05:24,409 --> 02:05:27,649
this as long as you haven't yeah as long

3112
02:05:26,239 --> 02:05:30,769
as the DNA is present you can do these

3113
02:05:27,649 --> 02:05:31,439
tests right right so basically you can

3114
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:34,710
you

3115
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:36,859
do that test up to the processing of the

3116
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:39,899
material right because I'm sure after

3117
02:05:36,859 --> 02:05:44,698
it's it's processed into a concentrator

3118
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:48,329
extract if it was mite infested extract

3119
02:05:44,698 --> 02:05:49,679
also have the DNA yeah most likely I

3120
02:05:48,329 --> 02:05:51,029
mean definitely especially if it's

3121
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:53,130
coming from stuff like there's no

3122
02:05:51,029 --> 02:05:55,649
chemical process like for example if you

3123
02:05:53,130 --> 02:06:00,840
were squishing right there's gonna be

3124
02:05:55,649 --> 02:06:02,099
DNA in the squish to you huh right so

3125
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:03,900
yeah I would be interesting I mean these

3126
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:06,060
are all experiments that need to be done

3127
02:06:03,899 --> 02:06:08,759
it's like where's is such a new science

3128
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:15,060
I'm gonna copy write the name mighty

3129
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:24,480
resin no you're gonna have people lining

3130
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:26,940
up to buy the mighty mighty resin well

3131
02:06:24,479 --> 02:06:29,369
yeah no it's it's cool it's it's like I

3132
02:06:26,939 --> 02:06:31,319
said it'll be it'll be we're working I

3133
02:06:29,369 --> 02:06:33,510
think these single tests are like I kind

3134
02:06:31,319 --> 02:06:35,039
of you know I kind of roll my eyes out a

3135
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:37,560
little bit because it's like having

3136
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:39,779
information on one marker is not that

3137
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:44,010
exciting but what is exciting is that

3138
02:06:39,779 --> 02:06:46,948
we're on the path to you know Kevin

3139
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:48,930
slowly building his army of his his he's

3140
02:06:46,948 --> 02:06:51,149
expanding the toolbox and right now he's

3141
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:52,829
got a cool tool box with a couple of

3142
02:06:51,149 --> 02:06:54,960
tools in it but one day it'll be full

3143
02:06:52,829 --> 02:06:56,670
with tools and that's when it'll be

3144
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,489
really useful to growers and breeders

3145
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:01,770
yes I'm like I you know as much as I I

3146
02:06:59,488 --> 02:07:04,829
don't get all excited about ok yeah we

3147
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:06,210
got a marker for Mike tests now I mean

3148
02:07:04,829 --> 02:07:08,039
it doesn't that doesn't really excite me

3149
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:11,250
but what excites me is that we're on the

3150
02:07:08,039 --> 02:07:13,380
path it also is getting the conversation

3151
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:14,819
going I guess in a sense you know with

3152
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:17,940
some people that might not otherwise be

3153
02:07:14,819 --> 02:07:21,469
having it and and having people who are

3154
02:07:17,939 --> 02:07:23,669
have that expertise to be able to have

3155
02:07:21,469 --> 02:07:25,500
the wherewithal to be able to bring

3156
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:28,289
those products to fruition what we

3157
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:33,020
really need instead of a mildewed test

3158
02:07:28,289 --> 02:07:35,579
is a mildew susceptibility test

3159
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:40,190
Strangler thing where we can test the

3160
02:07:35,579 --> 02:07:43,319
genome before it was was very tall and

3161
02:07:40,189 --> 02:07:44,969
you would determined no this should not

3162
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:50,939
be saved because it's a

3163
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:53,240
credibly susceptible to mildew so like

3164
02:07:50,939 --> 02:07:58,500
most of the cultivars on the west coast

3165
02:07:53,239 --> 02:08:00,719
I have pretty much come here I just was

3166
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:03,090
looking at some of the approved products

3167
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:06,480
in California and there was one called

3168
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:09,119
regalia that is a natural organic

3169
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:10,799
fungicide and I put a link to it in the

3170
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:13,050
chat that we have and I was just

3171
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:16,890
wondering if you had any information on

3172
02:08:13,050 --> 02:08:18,239
that yeah I think it's I think regalia

3173
02:08:16,890 --> 02:08:21,710
is a bacteria right it's like one of

3174
02:08:18,239 --> 02:08:25,319
those ones that call my leaf surface and

3175
02:08:21,710 --> 02:08:28,380
makes it more difficult for the for the

3176
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:29,460
foot for the spores to you know they

3177
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:30,960
caught like I said they call hives a

3178
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:33,449
leaf surface so they kind of occupy the

3179
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:35,699
real estate on the leaf so when the the

3180
02:08:33,449 --> 02:08:38,429
spore lands germinates it's it's harder

3181
02:08:35,699 --> 02:08:40,590
for it to control if you use that kind

3182
02:08:38,430 --> 02:08:46,110
of a control when they test your

3183
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:49,260
cannabis for purity and cleanliness will

3184
02:08:46,109 --> 02:08:50,789
that set the desk top depends on the

3185
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:53,130
type of test that they do so if they're

3186
02:08:50,789 --> 02:08:54,930
doing might make it float yeah

3187
02:08:53,130 --> 02:08:56,670
especially if they're doing like for

3188
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:58,590
example like Kevin MacLaren's test if

3189
02:08:56,670 --> 02:09:01,020
they're using a DNA right if you're

3190
02:08:58,590 --> 02:09:04,619
probing it for DNA you can find these

3191
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:08,490
like really mine you my new amounts so

3192
02:09:04,619 --> 02:09:10,979
they're doing a DNA base force of the

3193
02:09:08,489 --> 02:09:14,279
mildew which didn't germinate but

3194
02:09:10,979 --> 02:09:17,309
instead landed on this other thing

3195
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:20,219
you're talking about it's just for you

3196
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:24,539
guys it's AM it's a it's an extract from

3197
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:27,840
the plant giant not weed yeah no I

3198
02:09:24,539 --> 02:09:30,210
understand exactly what it is and I'm

3199
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:33,539
saying if you sprayed your plant with it

3200
02:09:30,210 --> 02:09:36,149
then a spore from mill down landed on it

3201
02:09:33,539 --> 02:09:39,689
it might die rather than germinate on

3202
02:09:36,149 --> 02:09:42,809
the plant and if you then took a DNA

3203
02:09:39,689 --> 02:09:49,439
sample of that leaf you would still get

3204
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:53,100
the B spore from the node ow so it would

3205
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:56,789
maybe test positive or can it tell the

3206
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:58,369
difference between dead and alive now if

3207
02:09:56,789 --> 02:10:01,099
it was DNA it just

3208
02:09:58,368 --> 02:10:03,168
just is DNA present or not yeah that's

3209
02:10:01,099 --> 02:10:05,029
what doesn't that make the DNA test kind

3210
02:10:03,168 --> 02:10:07,609
of floored because you know dust you

3211
02:10:05,029 --> 02:10:09,559
know is organic and it president in our

3212
02:10:07,609 --> 02:10:11,058
atmosphere so if you know certain

3213
02:10:09,559 --> 02:10:13,099
particles landed on it you're just

3214
02:10:11,059 --> 02:10:14,989
screwed it would be post-processing

3215
02:10:13,099 --> 02:10:16,819
everything you did was right you grow

3216
02:10:14,988 --> 02:10:19,638
these perfect organic strawberries and

3217
02:10:16,819 --> 02:10:22,609
you know XYZ lands on it and then you

3218
02:10:19,639 --> 02:10:26,300
flunk the test yeah yeah I mean they

3219
02:10:22,609 --> 02:10:29,328
could do what are called calibration

3220
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:31,309
curves right like you test a sample like

3221
02:10:29,328 --> 02:10:33,018
we saw this a long time ago but if it's

3222
02:10:31,309 --> 02:10:34,878
powdery mildew resistant or powdery

3223
02:10:33,019 --> 02:10:37,099
mildew contamination you can detect

3224
02:10:34,878 --> 02:10:40,429
between low medium and high levels of

3225
02:10:37,099 --> 02:10:41,958
contamination right so but again they

3226
02:10:40,429 --> 02:10:44,118
got it they got to do those calibration

3227
02:10:41,958 --> 02:10:46,609
curves like yeah best show you have to

3228
02:10:44,118 --> 02:10:48,109
have low high and medium levels of

3229
02:10:46,609 --> 02:10:50,448
contamination and then be able to say

3230
02:10:48,109 --> 02:10:59,569
this is the chemical of the DMA signal

3231
02:10:50,448 --> 02:11:00,918
it's coming off that but if you eat have

3232
02:10:59,569 --> 02:11:03,018
you look on that little graph that they

3233
02:11:00,918 --> 02:11:04,609
post it up on the if you if you scroll

3234
02:11:03,019 --> 02:11:06,168
down the first graphed on the graph on

3235
02:11:04,609 --> 02:11:10,598
the left you can see they've compared it

3236
02:11:06,168 --> 02:11:13,010
to things like actinovate right so

3237
02:11:10,599 --> 02:11:14,869
actinovate is a it's again it's a

3238
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:18,079
biocontrol but it's a bacteria that they

3239
02:11:14,868 --> 02:11:19,819
swear down the leaf so you know the one

3240
02:11:18,078 --> 02:11:22,069
all I'm saying is that DNA signal is

3241
02:11:19,819 --> 02:11:27,198
gonna be in the plant or on the lawn the

3242
02:11:22,069 --> 02:11:30,078
flower right on the leaf yeah I'm just

3243
02:11:27,198 --> 02:11:32,918
wondering what will happen with those

3244
02:11:30,078 --> 02:11:37,488
DNA signals will they pass or not pass

3245
02:11:32,918 --> 02:11:39,260
when it comes to looking for fungus and

3246
02:11:37,488 --> 02:11:43,218
bacteria and everything else

3247
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:45,079
maybe it'll set it off yeah well and

3248
02:11:43,219 --> 02:11:48,979
that's you know why it's so important to

3249
02:11:45,078 --> 02:11:51,109
choose the test because we're not trying

3250
02:11:48,979 --> 02:11:53,899
to detect who cares if there's like the

3251
02:11:51,109 --> 02:11:55,368
fact that you can find my DNA on your

3252
02:11:53,899 --> 02:11:57,320
flower it doesn't mean that it's

3253
02:11:55,368 --> 02:12:01,538
contaminated right because again you're

3254
02:11:57,319 --> 02:12:07,219
amplifying these tiny tiny tiny levels

3255
02:12:01,538 --> 02:12:08,840
of DNA right so yeah so Sam they're

3256
02:12:07,219 --> 02:12:11,288
saying that you can spray at the day of

3257
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:12,969
harvest on strawberries

3258
02:12:11,288 --> 02:12:16,658
right well they rock where they watch

3259
02:12:12,969 --> 02:12:20,679
strawberries right we can't watch

3260
02:12:16,658 --> 02:12:22,359
cannabis you know cannabis I can it's a

3261
02:12:20,679 --> 02:12:26,199
different type of planets because that's

3262
02:12:22,359 --> 02:12:30,009
so oily right like it's bubble man

3263
02:12:26,198 --> 02:12:33,879
washes cannabis great about losing that

3264
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:35,530
resin though is but remember it happened

3265
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:39,578
when people were doing the sulfur -

3266
02:12:35,529 --> 02:12:41,139
right like the resin glands people would

3267
02:12:39,578 --> 02:12:42,578
say when they're burning the herb but

3268
02:12:41,139 --> 02:12:43,900
they couldn't tell that it had sulfur

3269
02:12:42,578 --> 02:12:45,099
most people couldn't tell but when you

3270
02:12:43,899 --> 02:12:47,348
extract it down

3271
02:12:45,099 --> 02:12:49,840
it tasted like [ __ ] burning matches

3272
02:12:47,349 --> 02:12:51,639
yeah it was unbelievable and so that was

3273
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:53,949
just a flavor thing but imagine it was a

3274
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:56,199
compound that didn't have flavor but it

3275
02:12:53,948 --> 02:12:58,988
had toxicity right so you couldn't taste

3276
02:12:56,198 --> 02:13:01,779
it but the resident lands are sucking up

3277
02:12:58,988 --> 02:13:05,468
those those chemicals so it's like it's

3278
02:13:01,779 --> 02:13:07,569
it's it's all I'm saying is that it's

3279
02:13:05,469 --> 02:13:09,368
not the same thing as strawberries it's

3280
02:13:07,569 --> 02:13:10,868
not the same it's safe to spray on

3281
02:13:09,368 --> 02:13:12,908
strawberries because you can wash

3282
02:13:10,868 --> 02:13:14,348
strawberries it's not the same thing

3283
02:13:12,908 --> 02:13:17,578
with cannabis doesn't mean that it's

3284
02:13:14,349 --> 02:13:19,750
safe to spray on cannabis up til a

3285
02:13:17,578 --> 02:13:21,460
little couple days before harvest or

3286
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:25,750
even like at like four weeks or five

3287
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:29,920
weeks because we used to use BT bacteria

3288
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:32,979
thuringiensis a lot and we tried to use

3289
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:35,889
it right up until the plants we're about

3290
02:13:32,979 --> 02:13:40,709
to start flowering you know try to do

3291
02:13:35,889 --> 02:13:45,550
the use all vegetative and also it is is

3292
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:52,029
a organized by organism it's it's

3293
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:56,739
nothing dangerous but people using

3294
02:13:52,029 --> 02:13:59,259
chemicals during flowering is just 'men

3295
02:13:56,738 --> 02:14:01,029
think of what to call them well let me

3296
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:02,199
say this - I totally subscribe to it

3297
02:14:01,029 --> 02:14:04,840
ryan saying and when you start seeing

3298
02:14:02,198 --> 02:14:07,210
flowers form on your plants it like even

3299
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:09,760
week 3 I don't recommend you spent you

3300
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:11,800
spray duck jet anything on those damn

3301
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:14,170
things and then that's partly

3302
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:15,969
responsible to be honest well even no

3303
02:14:14,170 --> 02:14:18,699
matter how safe it is like oh it's a

3304
02:14:15,969 --> 02:14:20,408
safe biologic it's like okay but safe to

3305
02:14:18,698 --> 02:14:21,748
like burn and inhale into your lungs

3306
02:14:20,408 --> 02:14:23,338
because that have they done

3307
02:14:21,748 --> 02:14:24,929
research because that's generally what's

3308
02:14:23,338 --> 02:14:27,958
happening now are cannabis and our

3309
02:14:24,929 --> 02:14:29,998
resident know they have it right so

3310
02:14:27,958 --> 02:14:32,188
that's gonna change let's go through

3311
02:14:29,998 --> 02:14:35,068
some of the chemistry and just how much

3312
02:14:32,189 --> 02:14:37,679
change goes on smoking leaves you have

3313
02:14:35,069 --> 02:14:40,379
to be careful about what any-anything

3314
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:43,798
lee gets on the leaves if you look in

3315
02:14:40,378 --> 02:14:47,278
flowers then what what's on the leaves

3316
02:14:43,798 --> 02:14:52,168
probably won't have any effect on you if

3317
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:55,349
you're only smoking resin yeah but it

3318
02:14:52,168 --> 02:14:57,168
also depends if using a biological it

3319
02:14:55,349 --> 02:14:59,519
you know these things are not

3320
02:14:57,168 --> 02:15:02,429
intrinsically gonna harm the resin

3321
02:14:59,519 --> 02:15:05,069
whereas some of the chemical sprays I'm

3322
02:15:02,429 --> 02:15:09,179
positive but they do poison the resin

3323
02:15:05,069 --> 02:15:11,339
itself so the US EPA regulates these are

3324
02:15:09,179 --> 02:15:13,229
so called biopesticides they're viewed

3325
02:15:11,338 --> 02:15:14,939
as being sort of more you know

3326
02:15:13,229 --> 02:15:17,668
environmentally friendly and I think

3327
02:15:14,939 --> 02:15:20,189
even neem oil falls into that my cat

3328
02:15:17,668 --> 02:15:22,588
mint insect repellent Falls its fat so

3329
02:15:20,189 --> 02:15:24,779
they're the biological resource and

3330
02:15:22,588 --> 02:15:27,509
think of it is what you're doing is your

3331
02:15:24,779 --> 02:15:29,759
automatic the local biome of a plant by

3332
02:15:27,509 --> 02:15:32,639
just changing the the natural biology

3333
02:15:29,759 --> 02:15:36,588
that's already happening by giving a new

3334
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:38,759
little bio chemical which is really a

3335
02:15:36,588 --> 02:15:40,588
biologically derived system so you're

3336
02:15:38,759 --> 02:15:42,779
just admitting the biology it's not a

3337
02:15:40,588 --> 02:15:45,618
spring chemical but you know those

3338
02:15:42,779 --> 02:15:48,859
chemicals again or those you know

3339
02:15:45,618 --> 02:15:51,448
enzymes extracts those types of

3340
02:15:48,859 --> 02:15:54,179
preparations are usually not as

3341
02:15:51,448 --> 02:15:56,759
effective and not quite systemic as the

3342
02:15:54,179 --> 02:16:01,588
as the chemicals are but remember that

3343
02:15:56,759 --> 02:16:05,458
if the onus is on the the company who

3344
02:16:01,588 --> 02:16:08,359
registers those things with the EPA to

3345
02:16:05,458 --> 02:16:13,408
get through EPA registration for those

3346
02:16:08,359 --> 02:16:18,298
end-use products and so exactly in order

3347
02:16:13,408 --> 02:16:20,098
for you to show the efficacy and the

3348
02:16:18,298 --> 02:16:24,439
safety of those products you have to

3349
02:16:20,099 --> 02:16:26,369
conduct trials with humans which take

3350
02:16:24,439 --> 02:16:30,689
institutional review board

3351
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:32,968
okay's and many millions of dollars to

3352
02:16:30,689 --> 02:16:35,610
actually get approved and actually do

3353
02:16:32,968 --> 02:16:38,429
and so Scott's

3354
02:16:35,610 --> 02:16:41,850
miracle-gro click claim this week in the

3355
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:44,700
news to actually start that process with

3356
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:48,510
the EPA on one particular thing they're

3357
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:50,820
registering something for specific use

3358
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:53,520
on cannabis which tells me that they've

3359
02:16:50,819 --> 02:16:56,909
done efficacy and they've done some type

3360
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:58,979
of probably bridging to human safety

3361
02:16:56,909 --> 02:17:02,190
studies because there's been so much

3362
02:16:58,979 --> 02:17:04,979
work done in agrochemicals to assess

3363
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:08,069
their safety and as we've always pointed

3364
02:17:04,979 --> 02:17:09,959
out you know vegetables a lot of

3365
02:17:08,069 --> 02:17:11,940
vegetables are washed and a lot of those

3366
02:17:09,959 --> 02:17:13,619
things are applied and what makes it

3367
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:15,600
agrochemical today is not necessarily

3368
02:17:13,620 --> 02:17:17,341
one that kills bugs and fungus and mites

3369
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:19,950
and all that it's one that breaks down

3370
02:17:17,341 --> 02:17:21,809
safely by the time that produce gets the

3371
02:17:19,950 --> 02:17:25,200
Whole Foods and gets sold through

3372
02:17:21,809 --> 02:17:27,059
anything so by the time all that process

3373
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:29,760
happens that thing will have either

3374
02:17:27,059 --> 02:17:31,579
photolytic ly degraded hydrolytically

3375
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:33,960
degraded actually in some cases

3376
02:17:31,579 --> 02:17:36,569
biologically degraded by other microbes

3377
02:17:33,959 --> 02:17:39,719
so the whole point of this is actually

3378
02:17:36,569 --> 02:17:43,229
to get human studies to actually show

3379
02:17:39,719 --> 02:17:45,420
that you can effectively use these

3380
02:17:43,229 --> 02:17:48,209
treatments in the cultivation of

3381
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:49,920
cannabis and here's our efficacy studies

3382
02:17:48,209 --> 02:17:53,009
that gives us the label requirements

3383
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:55,829
that helps the farmer understand what I

3384
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:58,260
do have this type of infestation here's

3385
02:17:55,829 --> 02:18:00,000
the label use rates and so this is the

3386
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:02,880
use rates that basically they have

3387
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,370
established studies for to show that if

3388
02:18:02,879 --> 02:18:07,769
you use this product at these use rates

3389
02:18:05,370 --> 02:18:11,130
you'll be able to control this

3390
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:13,920
particular pest and most importantly you

3391
02:18:11,129 --> 02:18:15,779
won't have any bad effects in the

3392
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:18,360
products that are derived from that

3393
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:22,320
that's what's called a registration that

3394
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:24,301
registration cost 10 maybe a hundred

3395
02:18:22,319 --> 02:18:26,550
million dollars once you have that

3396
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:28,949
registration then you can start selling

3397
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:31,680
this product in the cannabis space so

3398
02:18:28,950 --> 02:18:33,841
that's the hill that this company has to

3399
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:36,780
climb Todd thanks for bringing this up

3400
02:18:33,841 --> 02:18:38,520
because it was really important well

3401
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:40,079
you're gonna see a lot more conversation

3402
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:42,120
about this because California is

3403
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:45,139
starting to release these lists of

3404
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:47,190
approved chemicals for cultivation and

3405
02:18:45,139 --> 02:18:49,019
so a lot of people are going to be

3406
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:49,500
bringing up these codes where they might

3407
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:51,780
be

3408
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:54,269
and again they're bridging data without

3409
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:56,489
actually having all of the studies in

3410
02:18:54,269 --> 02:18:58,920
place to say what happens when not

3411
02:18:56,489 --> 02:19:01,319
supplied to cannabis during flower and

3412
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:03,450
residues to end up in the extracts and

3413
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:05,010
kids are dabbing this on a hot email

3414
02:19:03,450 --> 02:19:08,340
those studies I can tell you

3415
02:19:05,010 --> 02:19:10,260
categorically have not been done studies

3416
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:14,429
are done and won't have all that safety

3417
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:16,590
information then they can basically have

3418
02:19:14,429 --> 02:19:19,260
free not great to sell those kinds of

3419
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:21,030
products but I think the approach that

3420
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:24,090
they're taking right now is to use

3421
02:19:21,030 --> 02:19:27,170
biological control these enzymes and

3422
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:28,380
extracts again are viewed more straight

3423
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:30,629
spinosa

3424
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:33,569
is another natural product that again is

3425
02:19:30,629 --> 02:19:37,138
actually on one of the hot lists of what

3426
02:19:33,569 --> 02:19:39,539
to look for if you get contaminated

3427
02:19:37,138 --> 02:19:41,729
stuff in Colorado there's all kinds of

3428
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:45,000
natural products like neem oil they

3429
02:19:41,729 --> 02:19:47,809
really are making incredible claims now

3430
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:50,489
that neem oil has some connection to

3431
02:19:47,809 --> 02:19:52,439
cannabis related hyperemesis I don't

3432
02:19:50,489 --> 02:19:54,059
know I've looked at some of the data I

3433
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:57,450
don't know that that's absolutely true

3434
02:19:54,059 --> 02:19:59,549
but neem is supposed to have that effect

3435
02:19:57,450 --> 02:20:01,110
so you know God you know is there a

3436
02:19:59,549 --> 02:20:04,649
correlation between the two who knows

3437
02:20:01,110 --> 02:20:06,750
clinical trials will tell mmm so it's

3438
02:20:04,649 --> 02:20:09,359
good that research is happening yeah I

3439
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:15,870
haven't used neem on my plants in two

3440
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:19,260
decades plus yeah well I guess if you're

3441
02:20:15,870 --> 02:20:22,170
facing a huge economic loss and you know

3442
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:25,110
you're pressured to do whatever you have

3443
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:27,510
to do to recover that economic loss and

3444
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:30,540
you're forced to buy some kind of

3445
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:32,219
treatment to help you mitigate your pest

3446
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:34,440
I mean wouldn't it be great to have the

3447
02:20:32,219 --> 02:20:37,889
knowledge up front like I think Ryan was

3448
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:40,460
pointing to and and to understand the

3449
02:20:37,889 --> 02:20:42,930
genetic susceptibility of certain

3450
02:20:40,459 --> 02:20:45,209
varieties and certain grow conditions

3451
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:47,550
and certain climates to succumb to

3452
02:20:45,209 --> 02:20:49,649
certain pests and maybe what we would do

3453
02:20:47,549 --> 02:20:52,049
is hey let's not grow the Sour Diesel

3454
02:20:49,649 --> 02:20:53,010
that time of year let's grow the cookies

3455
02:20:52,049 --> 02:20:55,799
that time of year

3456
02:20:53,010 --> 02:20:58,350
change your cultivation planning and

3457
02:20:55,799 --> 02:21:00,329
your cultivation practices based on what

3458
02:20:58,350 --> 02:21:01,870
may or may not be more susceptible to

3459
02:21:00,329 --> 02:21:04,129
pests

3460
02:21:01,870 --> 02:21:06,311
yeah we were just I was just helping a

3461
02:21:04,129 --> 02:21:09,049
client lay out a really big grow and

3462
02:21:06,310 --> 02:21:10,610
they were using their variety as their

3463
02:21:09,049 --> 02:21:14,090
genetics to put in and they wanted to do

3464
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:15,771
all these boxes market varieties but

3465
02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:18,771
because of the regulations at their end

3466
02:21:15,771 --> 02:21:20,239
they can't they can't spray anything for

3467
02:21:18,771 --> 02:21:22,250
powdery mildew they have to you know

3468
02:21:20,239 --> 02:21:23,840
essentially what we did is I totally

3469
02:21:22,250 --> 02:21:25,670
changed their grow around and put in

3470
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:30,250
only varieties that were resistant to

3471
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:30,250
powdery build it right just because

3472
02:21:30,940 --> 02:21:35,030
that's it's kind of like unfortunately

3473
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:36,680
the market dictated that they want you

3474
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:39,230
know the most popular things that was

3475
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:40,790
really quick you know cookies og all

3476
02:21:39,229 --> 02:21:43,100
that kind of stuff all the cushions

3477
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:45,590
there they're all there the badness all

3478
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:47,149
the powdery mildew magnets so it's like

3479
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:48,380
filling up your facility with a bunch of

3480
02:21:47,149 --> 02:21:50,000
stuff that's going to attract problems

3481
02:21:48,379 --> 02:21:53,270
that you have to deal with it's really a

3482
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:56,299
good idea microscopic problems that you

3483
02:21:53,271 --> 02:21:57,530
can't see until they're very very much

3484
02:21:56,299 --> 02:21:59,840
prevalent everywhere

3485
02:21:57,530 --> 02:22:02,930
well that that's just a question for

3486
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:05,420
Kevin is that how infected does your

3487
02:22:02,930 --> 02:22:09,130
growl have to be with powdery mildew to

3488
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:14,750
get a positive result on this kind of

3489
02:22:09,129 --> 02:22:18,379
one single spore he can test for no wait

3490
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:22,639
as the death seemed out of out of whack

3491
02:22:18,379 --> 02:22:25,279
biologically Ryan that's that's the way

3492
02:22:22,639 --> 02:22:27,260
the tests work right that's what PCR

3493
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,811
does PCR again for those that don't know

3494
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:31,790
you can google it but it's called

3495
02:22:28,810 --> 02:22:35,629
polymerase chain reaction and polymerase

3496
02:22:31,790 --> 02:22:39,050
chain reaction and a DNN a method for

3497
02:22:35,629 --> 02:22:41,420
amplifying specific pieces of DNA right

3498
02:22:39,049 --> 02:22:43,549
so if that's the beauty of the text if

3499
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:47,450
you can take my Newt my new little

3500
02:22:43,549 --> 02:22:48,770
almost undetectable little I mean that's

3501
02:22:47,450 --> 02:22:49,820
what they do in the clue but the cops do

3502
02:22:48,771 --> 02:22:51,590
when they go into a murder scene and

3503
02:22:49,819 --> 02:22:53,959
they can find they'll they'll tape

3504
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:56,149
they'll take a tiny little dab of blood

3505
02:22:53,959 --> 02:22:58,159
that might have been left by the killer

3506
02:22:56,149 --> 02:23:01,639
right and then they can amplify the DNA

3507
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:04,430
in it to see and and get a signal out of

3508
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:06,409
that dividing that your sample contains

3509
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:08,659
a little bit of the DNA and so I guess

3510
02:23:06,409 --> 02:23:10,789
the the caveat to what Kevin is saying

3511
02:23:08,659 --> 02:23:13,369
is if there is a huge grow and there's

3512
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:14,330
one spore in there that's on one plan in

3513
02:23:13,370 --> 02:23:16,280
the corner of the room

3514
02:23:14,329 --> 02:23:19,159
and you sample over here you're not

3515
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:20,930
gonna find it right I mean no you know

3516
02:23:19,159 --> 02:23:23,629
because it happened DNA has to be

3517
02:23:20,930 --> 02:23:25,489
example that they're testing I think

3518
02:23:23,629 --> 02:23:28,339
it's more likely that he's saying that

3519
02:23:25,489 --> 02:23:32,209
it there could be a single spore on the

3520
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:32,898
test sample India yeah I I get that yeah

3521
02:23:32,209 --> 02:23:34,188
totally

3522
02:23:32,898 --> 02:23:36,199
well you know what it's good that it's

3523
02:23:34,189 --> 02:23:38,659
this well I mean for cannabis anyway I'm

3524
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:39,979
sure there's probably other industries

3525
02:23:38,659 --> 02:23:42,379
that have been using this for a long

3526
02:23:39,978 --> 02:23:44,629
time but it's like chimeras to get a

3527
02:23:42,379 --> 02:23:47,389
hundred or 200 of those in your toolbox

3528
02:23:44,629 --> 02:23:49,879
that would be an extreme value yeah just

3529
02:23:47,389 --> 02:23:51,108
imagine if you could swipe a little

3530
02:23:49,879 --> 02:23:54,469
piece of a bud

3531
02:23:51,109 --> 02:23:58,520
on a stick and it would you know change

3532
02:23:54,469 --> 02:24:03,519
colors if it if it had milled out in

3533
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:03,520
other words that the grower [ __ ] up

3534
02:24:05,049 --> 02:24:14,478
they speak English it's mildew he'll do

3535
02:24:09,879 --> 02:24:21,228
I'm doing you the European version you

3536
02:24:14,478 --> 02:24:25,059
say banana I'll say mildew no doubt you

3537
02:24:21,228 --> 02:24:28,670
say tomato I say tomahto

3538
02:24:25,059 --> 02:24:32,949
I'm just giving you [ __ ] daddy yeah it's

3539
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:36,500
quite all right I don't mind at all

3540
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:39,140
if you're German root let me guess both

3541
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:43,370
pronunciations copyrighted impounded

3542
02:24:39,139 --> 02:24:45,139
right both of them correct not not to

3543
02:24:43,370 --> 02:24:51,560
mention the Italian and Portuguese

3544
02:24:45,139 --> 02:24:53,239
version yeah i think what i'm just

3545
02:24:51,559 --> 02:24:54,889
looking at this county fair thing i

3546
02:24:53,239 --> 02:24:56,090
think it's a great first step these are

3547
02:24:54,889 --> 02:24:59,260
guys are did going by the dominant

3548
02:24:56,090 --> 02:25:01,159
terpene but I think the inevitable

3549
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:03,290
evolution of this is that we're gonna

3550
02:25:01,159 --> 02:25:07,100
get like this is what we call terpenes

3551
02:25:03,290 --> 02:25:08,660
superclasses right but eventually what's

3552
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:12,500
gonna happen is these terpene classes

3553
02:25:08,659 --> 02:25:14,840
will get broken down another step into

3554
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:17,389
and then they'll start well then then it

3555
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:20,299
really will be like will compete against

3556
02:25:17,389 --> 02:25:22,010
like like for example like you know the

3557
02:25:20,299 --> 02:25:24,858
lime and pine would fit into the pioneer

3558
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:26,300
class but it would be competing against

3559
02:25:24,859 --> 02:25:27,681
blue dream which is a totally different

3560
02:25:26,299 --> 02:25:29,329
flower

3561
02:25:27,681 --> 02:25:31,431
right there really even though they both

3562
02:25:29,329 --> 02:25:33,739
are PI D dominant it's really not the

3563
02:25:31,431 --> 02:25:35,750
same if you're not comparing you're

3564
02:25:33,739 --> 02:25:39,050
comparing apples to oranges right and

3565
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:40,880
the idea that I think is the the real

3566
02:25:39,050 --> 02:25:43,670
evolution of these cannabis cups is

3567
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:44,959
where you compete you from air it's like

3568
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:46,880
you know it's like a dog show you

3569
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:51,350
compare Huskies to Huskies and pugs two

3570
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:55,430
pugs and labs two labs right and then

3571
02:25:51,351 --> 02:25:56,870
you do the best and show but you know

3572
02:25:55,431 --> 02:25:58,431
really like you don't want to be

3573
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:59,570
comparing the Pug to the lab because

3574
02:25:58,431 --> 02:26:03,771
they're totally different animals

3575
02:25:59,569 --> 02:26:07,220
they're different beasts well I like to

3576
02:26:03,771 --> 02:26:08,960
compare the pugs to a Great Dane because

3577
02:26:07,220 --> 02:26:11,869
the Great Danes always win they're

3578
02:26:08,959 --> 02:26:13,729
obviously a bigger better dog well cross

3579
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:23,120
the two salmon come out with the great

3580
02:26:13,729 --> 02:26:24,739
pug yeah it really is an important thing

3581
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:27,920
that you're comparing because they are

3582
02:26:24,739 --> 02:26:30,649
such like like I said like let the lime

3583
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:32,210
and pie and it's it's not og you can't

3584
02:26:30,649 --> 02:26:38,649
compare to og because they're totally

3585
02:26:32,209 --> 02:26:38,649
different types of experiences right so

3586
02:26:39,729 --> 02:26:47,569
needs to be listed is the top ten

3587
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:52,820
terpenes and in with some sort of a

3588
02:26:47,569 --> 02:26:57,351
display so you can see that terpene the

3589
02:26:52,819 --> 02:26:59,931
pining is got the most it's 50% of the

3590
02:26:57,351 --> 02:27:03,920
total of terpenes even the top three is

3591
02:26:59,931 --> 02:27:05,540
enough to really differentiate yeah it

3592
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:07,521
would be a good start you're right

3593
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:09,771
yeah I mean it's it is enough it's like

3594
02:27:07,521 --> 02:27:13,551
Tom if you have a top three it's like

3595
02:27:09,771 --> 02:27:15,829
now you're you're actually comparing I

3596
02:27:13,550 --> 02:27:18,439
have a slightly different idea and and

3597
02:27:15,829 --> 02:27:21,159
again it falls along less long the dog

3598
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:25,011
analogy and more along the music analogy

3599
02:27:21,159 --> 02:27:27,261
so out of bluegrass festival they have

3600
02:27:25,011 --> 02:27:29,899
competitions and have competitions for

3601
02:27:27,261 --> 02:27:31,819
bands but they also have competitions

3602
02:27:29,899 --> 02:27:36,829
for individual instrumentalists like

3603
02:27:31,819 --> 02:27:39,119
they'll be a bluegrass or a banjo an

3604
02:27:36,829 --> 02:27:42,299
upright bass competition a man

3605
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:44,880
in competition and so maybe a way to do

3606
02:27:42,299 --> 02:27:48,539
a competition along this analogy is to

3607
02:27:44,879 --> 02:27:51,000
do the best in show which is that hey no

3608
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:54,359
matter what terpene you can pack into it

3609
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:56,609
this is just the best [ __ ] and it goes

3610
02:27:54,359 --> 02:27:59,630
right best in show but maybe the other

3611
02:27:56,609 --> 02:28:03,359
way to characterize these is to say okay

3612
02:27:59,629 --> 02:28:06,089
if the root means that we see most

3613
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:09,059
predominant in cannabis or these five or

3614
02:28:06,090 --> 02:28:12,898
these ten your strain has to fit a

3615
02:28:09,059 --> 02:28:15,539
terpene dominance in that category to

3616
02:28:12,898 --> 02:28:17,879
compete in that competition right and so

3617
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:20,310
you use the terpene dominance and again

3618
02:28:17,879 --> 02:28:23,159
I think the more you use the rather than

3619
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:25,379
five do the first ten or the first 15

3620
02:28:23,159 --> 02:28:27,059
that are all found in cannabis before

3621
02:28:25,379 --> 02:28:29,938
you know it you'll have all these

3622
02:28:27,059 --> 02:28:31,978
instrumental competitions as well as the

3623
02:28:29,939 --> 02:28:34,079
overall band competition which is sort

3624
02:28:31,978 --> 02:28:37,549
of what it's all about right I don't

3625
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:41,010
know just an idea

3626
02:28:37,549 --> 02:28:44,429
yeah I think that's the way that'll be

3627
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:46,559
all so you're always gonna have best of

3628
02:28:44,430 --> 02:28:49,710
show right that's what they are now but

3629
02:28:46,559 --> 02:28:52,379
it's like you got to give I think you

3630
02:28:49,709 --> 02:28:55,559
got to give props to the best grows in

3631
02:28:52,379 --> 02:28:57,209
every class right because they are such

3632
02:28:55,559 --> 02:28:59,549
a different assistant to different user

3633
02:28:57,209 --> 02:29:00,719
experience like the experience of smoke

3634
02:28:59,549 --> 02:29:02,340
in an OG or vers

3635
02:29:00,719 --> 02:29:04,679
oak in that lime and pine I mean they're

3636
02:29:02,340 --> 02:29:06,780
totally different animals roses are

3637
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:09,870
actually a good example because the

3638
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:15,210
modern Rose is not scented they bred

3639
02:29:09,870 --> 02:29:18,210
from a beauty right now I wonder how

3640
02:29:15,209 --> 02:29:24,989
much that had to do with you PAH rules

3641
02:29:18,209 --> 02:29:26,608
being so based on morphology like yeah

3642
02:29:24,989 --> 02:29:28,920
it seems like there could be another

3643
02:29:26,609 --> 02:29:35,189
scent another competition that is the

3644
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:37,290
the nicest froze right where does the

3645
02:29:35,189 --> 02:29:39,079
rose competitions happen is it only once

3646
02:29:37,290 --> 02:29:42,120
a year

3647
02:29:39,079 --> 02:29:43,920
I'm sure they happen all over you know I

3648
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:45,329
know they think they do they bloom in

3649
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:48,620
different times of the year right

3650
02:29:45,329 --> 02:29:48,620
depending on the country you're in

3651
02:29:50,729 --> 02:29:58,300
yep google it there's the Rose today

3652
02:29:55,540 --> 02:30:01,149
there's the rose a two-day competition

3653
02:29:58,300 --> 02:30:02,979
that seems to be the big one

3654
02:30:01,149 --> 02:30:04,570
there's a massive competition well

3655
02:30:02,979 --> 02:30:06,671
there's a mango representation every

3656
02:30:04,570 --> 02:30:10,601
year where they have representation of

3657
02:30:06,671 --> 02:30:13,511
every all 3,000 types of mangoes I need

3658
02:30:10,601 --> 02:30:15,851
to go to that so I mean you can see at

3659
02:30:13,511 --> 02:30:18,551
some point somebody will you know maybe

3660
02:30:15,851 --> 02:30:21,820
they'll just be you know the the green

3661
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:25,180
crack festival or they the haze festival

3662
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:27,040
things become more specific you know

3663
02:30:25,181 --> 02:30:30,551
becoming a region because some will

3664
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:33,610
become regional genetics you know yes

3665
02:30:30,550 --> 02:30:35,700
it's just the evolution of those

3666
02:30:33,611 --> 02:30:38,980
competitions where they become less

3667
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:41,140
competitive and less dick waving and

3668
02:30:38,979 --> 02:30:44,800
more just appreciating of the beauty you

3669
02:30:41,140 --> 02:30:46,630
know like it's like if you it's like you

3670
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:48,520
believe you win the biggest dog at the

3671
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:51,790
at the County Fair it's like that's not

3672
02:30:48,521 --> 02:30:53,381
that big a deal you know and it'd be

3673
02:30:51,790 --> 02:30:55,600
nice if it was more about the

3674
02:30:53,380 --> 02:30:57,939
cultivation in the cannabis or the or

3675
02:30:55,601 --> 02:30:59,681
the extract than it was about the ego

3676
02:30:57,940 --> 02:31:02,381
and the bump in sales like a lot of

3677
02:30:59,681 --> 02:31:06,310
people or what we were talking about

3678
02:31:02,380 --> 02:31:08,950
with forests whoever donates the most to

3679
02:31:06,310 --> 02:31:11,110
children whoever right whatever whoever

3680
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:14,020
does the most for the industry you know

3681
02:31:11,111 --> 02:31:18,041
who those are the ones a different

3682
02:31:14,021 --> 02:31:21,161
measurement though I mean the people who

3683
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:23,890
help out everybody and not just not just

3684
02:31:21,161 --> 02:31:26,740
themselves and not just push themselves

3685
02:31:23,890 --> 02:31:28,751
forward talking about comparing apples

3686
02:31:26,740 --> 02:31:33,581
to apples so to speak you know what I

3687
02:31:28,751 --> 02:31:35,081
mean it's just flowers that's again and

3688
02:31:33,581 --> 02:31:36,701
you can't really award people like

3689
02:31:35,081 --> 02:31:39,911
forests for what they're really doing in

3690
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:42,070
my opinion because we should also be

3691
02:31:39,911 --> 02:31:47,310
supporting his work in my opinion we

3692
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:49,931
should all be yes wanting to accomplish

3693
02:31:47,310 --> 02:31:53,050
having a competition where rather than

3694
02:31:49,931 --> 02:31:55,060
submitting extracts that you could

3695
02:31:53,050 --> 02:31:57,880
actually submit extracts rather than

3696
02:31:55,060 --> 02:32:00,729
some judge panel to actually patients

3697
02:31:57,880 --> 02:32:02,831
who need medicine you know that's what I

3698
02:32:00,729 --> 02:32:05,200
said last week when for I told forest

3699
02:32:02,831 --> 02:32:06,701
I'm just gonna donate whatever that was

3700
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:09,070
a person writing that I said but at the

3701
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:11,620
same time like forest you know you know

3702
02:32:09,070 --> 02:32:13,450
in we were supporting him last week it

3703
02:32:11,620 --> 02:32:15,490
was amazing to see everyone donating by

3704
02:32:13,450 --> 02:32:19,090
the way you guys donated almost seven

3705
02:32:15,490 --> 02:32:20,470
hundred US dollars to the khalad rias

3706
02:32:19,091 --> 02:32:22,810
network and that'll go into buying

3707
02:32:20,470 --> 02:32:25,180
little jars and lids as stuff for the

3708
02:32:22,810 --> 02:32:27,370
the creams to go in for for some of

3709
02:32:25,181 --> 02:32:29,531
those kids with the skin diseases so

3710
02:32:27,370 --> 02:32:31,330
it's the good work it's a good thing not

3711
02:32:29,531 --> 02:32:33,221
trying to say shut down competitions but

3712
02:32:31,331 --> 02:32:34,690
definitely I hear what both Todd and

3713
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:36,161
Mark are saying it's like yes continue

3714
02:32:34,690 --> 02:32:38,980
to have the competitions but Wow like

3715
02:32:36,161 --> 02:32:40,601
you know putting everything all we're

3716
02:32:38,979 --> 02:32:43,689
trying to do is figure out ways this

3717
02:32:40,601 --> 02:32:45,341
community can put things aside you know

3718
02:32:43,690 --> 02:32:46,810
while it's kind of like that I'll put a

3719
02:32:45,341 --> 02:32:49,060
couple of plants in the back of the grow

3720
02:32:46,810 --> 02:32:50,800
room for a good cause you know so it's

3721
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:53,229
like in this community when we're doing

3722
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:55,899
things if there's an event where we're

3723
02:32:53,229 --> 02:32:57,761
gonna drop like 23 thousand dollars to

3724
02:32:55,899 --> 02:33:00,280
promote our company cuz we're all about

3725
02:32:57,761 --> 02:33:02,501
the patients maybe kick a thousand bucks

3726
02:33:00,281 --> 02:33:05,471
down or something down sometimes some

3727
02:33:02,501 --> 02:33:08,710
energy some focus something that just

3728
02:33:05,470 --> 02:33:10,689
shows that you're also and your time the

3729
02:33:08,710 --> 02:33:12,700
most valuable of all commodity

3730
02:33:10,690 --> 02:33:15,190
absolutely mine can I toss this out

3731
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:18,100
there to your attention your time and

3732
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:22,511
your attention can be way more valuable

3733
02:33:18,101 --> 02:33:24,221
than a dollar donation yeah yeah and one

3734
02:33:22,511 --> 02:33:26,261
of my thoughts is also is in line with

3735
02:33:24,220 --> 02:33:28,899
what Tim Blake was saying is that you

3736
02:33:26,261 --> 02:33:30,791
know they're seeing growers without door

3737
02:33:28,899 --> 02:33:32,501
that's really good cannabis having an

3738
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:34,990
impossible time to get rid of it and

3739
02:33:32,501 --> 02:33:37,841
what that really means is it's lowering

3740
02:33:34,990 --> 02:33:40,060
the price threshold that people need to

3741
02:33:37,841 --> 02:33:41,591
meet to be able to get into it and we

3742
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:43,240
are gonna see more and more of that

3743
02:33:41,591 --> 02:33:46,601
cannabis going to people that really

3744
02:33:43,240 --> 02:33:48,251
need it because now people can afford to

3745
02:33:46,601 --> 02:33:50,230
give it away and they can afford to be

3746
02:33:48,251 --> 02:33:52,031
more generous because literally the

3747
02:33:50,229 --> 02:33:54,490
stuffs not worth that much in the first

3748
02:33:52,031 --> 02:33:56,681
place anymore like it used to be so and

3749
02:33:54,490 --> 02:33:58,870
I think this is where people like him

3750
02:33:56,681 --> 02:34:00,399
could benefit if we could focus our

3751
02:33:58,870 --> 02:34:03,790
generosity because I don't want to say

3752
02:34:00,399 --> 02:34:06,460
that the little bits of crumbs that go

3753
02:34:03,790 --> 02:34:08,050
to the competitions are really what we

3754
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:11,530
should be donating to the kids we should

3755
02:34:08,050 --> 02:34:13,300
be giving you know maybe on too much of

3756
02:34:11,531 --> 02:34:13,950
a socialist you know what I mean but I

3757
02:34:13,300 --> 02:34:15,239
believe we

3758
02:34:13,950 --> 02:34:17,040
should be helping our neighbors you know

3759
02:34:15,239 --> 02:34:19,771
when I started the san diego compassion

3760
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:21,750
club i was donating the cannabis i had

3761
02:34:19,771 --> 02:34:23,641
and i was having a lot of the friends I

3762
02:34:21,750 --> 02:34:25,560
worked with read allowing me to

3763
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:27,029
redistribute stuff because once they've

3764
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:29,039
realized you're visiting hospitals

3765
02:34:27,030 --> 02:34:31,320
you're actually seeing people that are

3766
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:34,021
sick that have had cancer - I'll give

3767
02:34:31,319 --> 02:34:35,610
you pot and it was like we just didn't

3768
02:34:34,021 --> 02:34:38,340
know there was anyone doing that to give

3769
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:40,560
pot - and that's really what the bridge

3770
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:42,960
became and I just became the happy

3771
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:46,170
deliverer of other people's generosity

3772
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:47,640
and we all need to do that and when I

3773
02:34:46,170 --> 02:34:50,399
was asked about that on the san diego

3774
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:53,010
media my my comment was is that look

3775
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:55,170
when your kid or your relative is sick

3776
02:34:53,010 --> 02:34:57,960
it's a question of compassion it's not a

3777
02:34:55,170 --> 02:34:59,729
question of capitalism you know so we

3778
02:34:57,959 --> 02:35:02,339
really all need to get into this thing

3779
02:34:59,729 --> 02:35:03,719
of compassion and you know my mom didn't

3780
02:35:02,340 --> 02:35:05,960
sell me weed when I was going through

3781
02:35:03,719 --> 02:35:09,569
chemo imagine if that was the situation

3782
02:35:05,959 --> 02:35:12,149
you know and this is what I think we can

3783
02:35:09,569 --> 02:35:14,760
all do is we can find outlets like guys

3784
02:35:12,149 --> 02:35:18,420
like Forrest and we can foster that

3785
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:21,149
generosity and help little kids and old

3786
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:22,739
ladies and people you love that's the

3787
02:35:21,149 --> 02:35:25,979
whole point of this you know I'm sure

3788
02:35:22,739 --> 02:35:28,619
that if we hooked up even Tim Blake with

3789
02:35:25,979 --> 02:35:31,469
Forrest that he would somehow involve

3790
02:35:28,620 --> 02:35:33,360
you know it would be a good thing just

3791
02:35:31,469 --> 02:35:35,010
to forward the you know along because

3792
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:39,450
people that are doing big things and

3793
02:35:35,010 --> 02:35:41,101
making moves always need to you know and

3794
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:43,290
and that's what Tim's whole thing is

3795
02:35:41,101 --> 02:35:45,120
community and like doing the right thing

3796
02:35:43,290 --> 02:35:47,431
and you know like I bet you he would

3797
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:50,101
have a great relationship with Forrest

3798
02:35:47,431 --> 02:35:55,230
is your campus up up in Canada is it

3799
02:35:50,101 --> 02:36:02,159
tax-free for patients no but that isn't

3800
02:35:55,229 --> 02:36:03,420
a last year they subjected GST they're

3801
02:36:02,159 --> 02:36:05,601
trying it because it's weird because

3802
02:36:03,420 --> 02:36:07,829
medicine typically isn't right so no

3803
02:36:05,601 --> 02:36:09,630
hill and a whole bunch people have been

3804
02:36:07,829 --> 02:36:12,569
really lobbying hard to get that removed

3805
02:36:09,629 --> 02:36:14,909
right they don't call charge provincial

3806
02:36:12,569 --> 02:36:16,739
though right

3807
02:36:14,909 --> 02:36:18,899
currently they don't but I bet that'll

3808
02:36:16,739 --> 02:36:20,729
change under the new legalization the

3809
02:36:18,899 --> 02:36:23,100
obviously the provinces will grab their

3810
02:36:20,729 --> 02:36:24,689
piece - yeah I was a test case for

3811
02:36:23,101 --> 02:36:26,760
California for the State Board of

3812
02:36:24,690 --> 02:36:29,370
Equalization because we went with the

3813
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:31,200
argument that it is medicine and the

3814
02:36:29,370 --> 02:36:33,720
State Board of Equalization said we

3815
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:35,579
don't care we're taxing it so that's why

3816
02:36:33,719 --> 02:36:37,590
you've we pay an over-the-counter tax

3817
02:36:35,579 --> 02:36:39,029
and so I saying well it should be

3818
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:41,130
tax-free these donations well

3819
02:36:39,029 --> 02:36:43,260
unfortunately we can't get nonprofit

3820
02:36:41,129 --> 02:36:45,509
status for medical cannabis it's illegal

3821
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:47,460
federally so there is no tax write-off

3822
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:50,550
everything that we donate so just we

3823
02:36:47,459 --> 02:36:55,318
give free medicine to 250 qualifying

3824
02:36:50,549 --> 02:36:57,659
patients and up 2% to Berkeley patients

3825
02:36:55,318 --> 02:36:59,609
every single year we do that free you

3826
02:36:57,659 --> 02:37:02,340
know that's just the realities of what

3827
02:36:59,609 --> 02:37:04,380
it is you know there's no ability for

3828
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:06,689
anyone to actually have an ability to

3829
02:37:04,379 --> 02:37:08,429
actually acts right off something like

3830
02:37:06,689 --> 02:37:10,200
that something that we're trying to work

3831
02:37:08,430 --> 02:37:12,000
on on the state level right now is I

3832
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:14,189
want to continue to be able to donate

3833
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,989
and give those patients free cannabis

3834
02:37:14,189 --> 02:37:18,510
but with the new laws that are being

3835
02:37:15,989 --> 02:37:20,219
passed that becomes much more difficult

3836
02:37:18,510 --> 02:37:23,670
so we're actually trying to lobby on

3837
02:37:20,219 --> 02:37:25,379
Capitol Hill you know it's tough well

3838
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:27,689
can I point out something that is [ __ ]

3839
02:37:25,379 --> 02:37:31,978
up in California you don't pay tax on

3840
02:37:27,689 --> 02:37:33,600
your pets medication okay because they

3841
02:37:31,978 --> 02:37:35,608
could they have they have considered

3842
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:37,559
that it creates a financial hardship on

3843
02:37:35,609 --> 02:37:40,020
the pet owner so that they shouldn't

3844
02:37:37,559 --> 02:37:41,939
have to pay taxes on if your dog gets

3845
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:43,409
hurt but if your grandma is going

3846
02:37:41,939 --> 02:37:46,889
through chemo and she's need some

3847
02:37:43,409 --> 02:37:48,689
medical cannabis taxer and that's that's

3848
02:37:46,889 --> 02:37:50,430
it where we got to get into a different

3849
02:37:48,689 --> 02:37:52,290
conversation and demand equal we should

3850
02:37:50,430 --> 02:37:55,529
at least have equal rights as pets right

3851
02:37:52,290 --> 02:37:57,450
well I spent that out I spent six

3852
02:37:55,529 --> 02:37:58,560
figures on a lawyer that was the former

3853
02:37:57,450 --> 02:38:01,890
head of the State Board of Equalization

3854
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:03,539
and still lost well it's not on you it

3855
02:38:01,889 --> 02:38:06,059
doesn't matter no no I understand I just

3856
02:38:03,540 --> 02:38:07,170
want a little bump in their road and

3857
02:38:06,059 --> 02:38:09,750
they were trying to make a point with

3858
02:38:07,170 --> 02:38:11,790
BPG that was a [ __ ] up point but you

3859
02:38:09,750 --> 02:38:13,139
know now technically they're now in a

3860
02:38:11,790 --> 02:38:15,600
situation where if you do have your

3861
02:38:13,139 --> 02:38:18,629
California card you do not totally pay

3862
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:20,100
taxes on that um and the only taxes it

3863
02:38:18,629 --> 02:38:22,278
should be collected and I'm not sure if

3864
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:25,109
this is correct going forward will be on

3865
02:38:22,279 --> 02:38:28,140
recreational or adult use sales if you

3866
02:38:25,109 --> 02:38:30,450
have a California a cannabis card you

3867
02:38:28,139 --> 02:38:32,760
will be tax exempt for your your

3868
02:38:30,450 --> 02:38:36,689
purchases of medical cannabis and but

3869
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:39,290
that tax is 15% and that tax is 15%

3870
02:38:36,689 --> 02:38:40,370
that'll be January 18th or is that

3871
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:45,290
Junior

3872
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:47,540
I mean January 1st 2018 the the tax on

3873
02:38:45,290 --> 02:38:50,510
cannabis will be 15% is can I ask you

3874
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:56,601
this on top of the 10% we pay or 9% we

3875
02:38:50,510 --> 02:38:58,851
pay a sales tax yes there is to my

3876
02:38:56,601 --> 02:39:01,730
knowledge there is no waving of the OTC

3877
02:38:58,851 --> 02:39:04,101
tax per County so like in Alameda County

3878
02:39:01,729 --> 02:39:06,350
we paid 9.0 percent over the counter tax

3879
02:39:04,101 --> 02:39:08,870
so you'll pay that to my knowledge as

3880
02:39:06,351 --> 02:39:11,090
well as 15% and then I'm Berkeley I've

3881
02:39:08,870 --> 02:39:15,079
done I have as at 2.5% wholesale tax

3882
02:39:11,090 --> 02:39:19,880
another 2.5 percent retail tax so you're

3883
02:39:15,079 --> 02:39:22,579
talking a tax of 29% but what about this

3884
02:39:19,879 --> 02:39:25,009
is it possible that we start selling

3885
02:39:22,579 --> 02:39:27,590
this herb as medication for dogs and

3886
02:39:25,010 --> 02:39:29,271
cats and then just let our grandmas and

3887
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:31,101
our dads and moms and all these other

3888
02:39:29,271 --> 02:39:32,900
people just use it can we get around

3889
02:39:31,101 --> 02:39:34,489
this is there a loophole we can fight

3890
02:39:32,899 --> 02:39:37,100
well can I throw this out there in all

3891
02:39:34,489 --> 02:39:39,319
honesty they're the people that I think

3892
02:39:37,101 --> 02:39:40,909
that the whole medical everybody needs a

3893
02:39:39,319 --> 02:39:43,610
medical card thing is going to evaporate

3894
02:39:40,909 --> 02:39:45,619
when nobody needs a medical card and the

3895
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:47,630
people that are really sick you know are

3896
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:49,250
obviously gonna continue to be really

3897
02:39:47,629 --> 02:39:51,709
sick because that's the [ __ ] cards

3898
02:39:49,250 --> 02:39:53,601
they were done in life but and and

3899
02:39:51,709 --> 02:39:56,539
they're gonna pursue medical cannabis

3900
02:39:53,601 --> 02:39:59,601
use because they have to I'm not because

3901
02:39:56,540 --> 02:40:01,340
you know they feel like alternating beer

3902
02:39:59,601 --> 02:40:03,500
with some cannabis on a Friday night and

3903
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:05,060
now they don't need a damn doctors no so

3904
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:07,879
I think doctors notes are gonna go the

3905
02:40:05,060 --> 02:40:09,170
way of you know nowhere because you're

3906
02:40:07,879 --> 02:40:12,709
not gonna need it you're just gonna need

3907
02:40:09,170 --> 02:40:14,629
to be 21 or over you know who's gonna

3908
02:40:12,709 --> 02:40:16,369
need to pay a doctor a hundred bucks for

3909
02:40:14,629 --> 02:40:19,969
some freedom papers when you're already

3910
02:40:16,370 --> 02:40:21,680
free patients that don't want to pay

3911
02:40:19,969 --> 02:40:24,139
those taxes that so you don't have to

3912
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:25,700
pay those taxes legitimate patients will

3913
02:40:24,139 --> 02:40:26,959
still be in relationships with their

3914
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:28,909
doctors and you know I don't mean

3915
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:30,829
legitimate like everyone that says they

3916
02:40:28,909 --> 02:40:32,119
use cannabis is illegitimate I just mean

3917
02:40:30,829 --> 02:40:34,190
like look if you're seeing a doctor all

3918
02:40:32,120 --> 02:40:35,870
the time did you [ __ ] you know a step

3919
02:40:34,190 --> 02:40:38,300
away from dying that's not gonna change

3920
02:40:35,870 --> 02:40:40,610
you know so you're gonna still be there

3921
02:40:38,299 --> 02:40:42,289
like hey and if you can save fifteen

3922
02:40:40,610 --> 02:40:44,390
twenty nine whatever percent until end

3923
02:40:42,290 --> 02:40:46,610
of work on B and people should get their

3924
02:40:44,389 --> 02:40:48,500
their California cannabis cards and they

3925
02:40:46,610 --> 02:40:51,430
should avert the taxes because it's

3926
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:51,430
their right to do so

3927
02:40:54,309 --> 02:40:59,809
crazy you know that said though even

3928
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:02,180
with the taxes I still think stuff's

3929
02:40:59,809 --> 02:41:03,889
gonna drop alcohol and tobacco piss got

3930
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:05,899
taxes on it that are ridiculous when I

3931
02:41:03,889 --> 02:41:07,250
used to go get my mom cigarettes when I

3932
02:41:05,899 --> 02:41:09,289
was a little kid they were under a buck

3933
02:41:07,250 --> 02:41:10,489
you know and now they're stupid money I

3934
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:12,500
don't even know how much they're cuz I

3935
02:41:10,489 --> 02:41:16,190
never smoked them but they're taxed

3936
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:17,659
incredibly and you know the FT they're

3937
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:20,409
still legal and no one's shooting each

3938
02:41:17,659 --> 02:41:23,239
other up over packs of cigarettes

3939
02:41:20,409 --> 02:41:28,940
twenty-nine percent it's just like such

3940
02:41:23,239 --> 02:41:30,319
a ridiculous that's well the discussion

3941
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:33,350
back in the day is hey we don't care

3942
02:41:30,319 --> 02:41:35,360
until it's time let's just pay a tax on

3943
02:41:33,350 --> 02:41:37,520
it well this is what happens when you

3944
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:39,020
you know and people are keeping a

3945
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:41,360
diligent eye on this it's just the

3946
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:44,120
reality of you know the potentiality of

3947
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:47,270
these local governments that have passed

3948
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:48,920
these laws in the absence of regulation

3949
02:41:47,270 --> 02:41:53,479
or state regulation

3950
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:57,260
you know what the tax on alcohol is not

3951
02:41:53,479 --> 02:41:58,359
even close to that you know what it is I

3952
02:41:57,260 --> 02:42:00,920
have no idea

3953
02:41:58,360 --> 02:42:02,329
not off the top of my head I used to

3954
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:05,710
have that in my head but apparently got

3955
02:42:02,329 --> 02:42:05,709
pushed up by other facts and figures

3956
02:42:08,770 --> 02:42:13,880
III think I'll get like this though I

3957
02:42:11,299 --> 02:42:15,920
mean granted we'll be paying taxes but

3958
02:42:13,879 --> 02:42:18,170
it's not even close to the friggin tax

3959
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:20,389
so that we've paid for prohibition and

3960
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:22,520
an ounce of weed shouldn't cost 400

3961
02:42:20,389 --> 02:42:24,289
bucks man I don't give a [ __ ] what you

3962
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:28,520
grew up with or how much love you gave

3963
02:42:24,290 --> 02:42:30,320
it that is all cut early ridiculous so I

3964
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:32,390
think get cannabis into the hands of the

3965
02:42:30,319 --> 02:42:34,399
people and whatever I mean it'll be nice

3966
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:37,489
to see also tested weed that's not you

3967
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:39,170
know basically laden with pesticides and

3968
02:42:37,489 --> 02:42:41,899
growth hormones and every other thing we

3969
02:42:39,170 --> 02:42:47,030
can't see or smell so it's in many ways

3970
02:42:41,899 --> 02:42:48,260
I I'm I look forward to the change yeah

3971
02:42:47,030 --> 02:42:49,820
me too

3972
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:53,050
it's coming there's no stopping it

3973
02:42:49,819 --> 02:42:56,119
that's for certain acres will be grown

3974
02:42:53,049 --> 02:42:57,259
sections well with this also as well you

3975
02:42:56,120 --> 02:42:59,300
also have more labs

3976
02:42:57,260 --> 02:43:01,370
you know because regional areas will now

3977
02:42:59,299 --> 02:43:03,019
have laboratories so that people can

3978
02:43:01,370 --> 02:43:04,490
actually sit and get their a cannabis

3979
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:05,870
tested and that's going to elevate

3980
02:43:04,489 --> 02:43:06,689
everything because that's when you'll

3981
02:43:05,870 --> 02:43:09,090
start to see

3982
02:43:06,689 --> 02:43:10,979
oh saying yes this is tested when you

3983
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:13,439
start hearing that that's a whole change

3984
02:43:10,978 --> 02:43:15,208
in the gambia there's no discussion on

3985
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:16,979
that level that I know from anybody's

3986
02:43:15,209 --> 02:43:18,479
like yeah man I got this [ __ ] tested and

3987
02:43:16,978 --> 02:43:21,118
here's why it's this price you know I

3988
02:43:18,478 --> 02:43:24,809
know it at the retail and Erised methods

3989
02:43:21,119 --> 02:43:27,479
by certified laboratories that have to

3990
02:43:24,809 --> 02:43:32,309
hold up to a scrutiny of a third-party

3991
02:43:27,478 --> 02:43:34,618
testing every quarter the only way you

3992
02:43:32,309 --> 02:43:38,238
have to you know these labs have to be

3993
02:43:34,619 --> 02:43:41,699
watched like any other consumer product

3994
02:43:38,238 --> 02:43:44,368
absolutely need to be ring tested like

3995
02:43:41,699 --> 02:43:45,810
you say affordably or whenever it'll

3996
02:43:44,369 --> 02:43:48,060
start to happen though you know when

3997
02:43:45,809 --> 02:43:50,010
when the labs themselves are not you

3998
02:43:48,059 --> 02:43:52,318
know quasi activists for what they're

3999
02:43:50,010 --> 02:43:54,478
doing I mean a lot of these people that

4000
02:43:52,318 --> 02:43:57,180
initially started the labs are heroes to

4001
02:43:54,478 --> 02:43:59,728
me because they were facing a ridiculous

4002
02:43:57,180 --> 02:44:02,760
fine like ten thousand dollars per test

4003
02:43:59,728 --> 02:44:05,278
they did and he did it anyway and you

4004
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:07,289
know what this is this is the kind of

4005
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:08,729
Pro activity we need or we're not going

4006
02:44:07,289 --> 02:44:10,590
to have an industry you know this stuff

4007
02:44:08,728 --> 02:44:12,958
didn't start out and nothing it started

4008
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:16,738
out of people risking their ass and

4009
02:44:12,959 --> 02:44:19,800
taking a chance and making what was now

4010
02:44:16,738 --> 02:44:21,118
commonplace science it which is

4011
02:44:19,799 --> 02:44:23,368
something that wasn't available I mean

4012
02:44:21,119 --> 02:44:25,319
20 years ago when I was in the bel-air

4013
02:44:23,369 --> 02:44:27,149
place I got arrested I was looking for

4014
02:44:25,318 --> 02:44:30,180
all my own equipment because there was

4015
02:44:27,148 --> 02:44:31,738
no labs I could take anything - and if I

4016
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:33,510
didn't acquire my own equipment I would

4017
02:44:31,738 --> 02:44:35,788
never be able to get cannabinoid tests

4018
02:44:33,510 --> 02:44:38,309
of what I was making and that's why I

4019
02:44:35,789 --> 02:44:40,439
have three labs and I do read and test

4020
02:44:38,309 --> 02:44:42,778
them all the time it's it's more than

4021
02:44:40,439 --> 02:44:44,699
quarterly because you know we were kind

4022
02:44:42,779 --> 02:44:46,078
of we were pioneers in this so it's kind

4023
02:44:44,699 --> 02:44:47,819
of always been one of those things where

4024
02:44:46,078 --> 02:44:50,309
always keeping everybody on their toes

4025
02:44:47,818 --> 02:44:51,898
but now that they're calibrated once you

4026
02:44:50,309 --> 02:44:53,818
have a good calibrated lab and they're

4027
02:44:51,898 --> 02:44:54,930
actually calibrating their machines and

4028
02:44:53,818 --> 02:44:58,859
cleaning it and doing everything

4029
02:44:54,930 --> 02:45:01,709
properly as dr. Sheldon will will admit

4030
02:44:58,859 --> 02:45:03,090
you get exact science and that's what we

4031
02:45:01,709 --> 02:45:06,079
need and know more that you're seeing

4032
02:45:03,090 --> 02:45:09,630
conjecture anymore we get real data

4033
02:45:06,078 --> 02:45:11,219
replicatable data that will then spread

4034
02:45:09,629 --> 02:45:13,528
into these other states that will then

4035
02:45:11,219 --> 02:45:15,059
spread into these local regions so you

4036
02:45:13,529 --> 02:45:17,010
know because each agriculture department

4037
02:45:15,059 --> 02:45:19,618
in the county are like in Louisiana you

4038
02:45:17,010 --> 02:45:20,578
know I grew up in sugar cane country so

4039
02:45:19,619 --> 02:45:23,279
there was a reg

4040
02:45:20,578 --> 02:45:24,958
there was a certified regional

4041
02:45:23,279 --> 02:45:27,869
representative that actually came and

4042
02:45:24,959 --> 02:45:29,159
tested and made sure that everybody is

4043
02:45:27,869 --> 02:45:31,439
growing proper to the regulatory

4044
02:45:29,158 --> 02:45:34,228
standards that's the accepted standards

4045
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:36,299
for you know what is growing and so that

4046
02:45:34,228 --> 02:45:37,978
was backed up by actual science they

4047
02:45:36,299 --> 02:45:39,869
actually have testers and things that

4048
02:45:37,978 --> 02:45:43,438
they can take into the field that are

4049
02:45:39,869 --> 02:45:46,168
calibrated to that specific you know you

4050
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:48,988
know agricultural product so it will

4051
02:45:46,168 --> 02:45:51,718
become that way in point in time with

4052
02:45:48,988 --> 02:45:54,118
the with cannabis where you'll have you

4053
02:45:51,718 --> 02:45:56,398
know even because we had a US Department

4054
02:45:54,119 --> 02:45:59,189
of Agricultural representative in the

4055
02:45:56,398 --> 02:46:01,858
region as well to back up the local

4056
02:45:59,189 --> 02:46:06,328
regional data and testers and and

4057
02:46:01,859 --> 02:46:08,369
laboratory which will of course employ

4058
02:46:06,328 --> 02:46:10,199
lots of people throughout the United

4059
02:46:08,369 --> 02:46:12,359
States because you're talking all these

4060
02:46:10,199 --> 02:46:14,789
regional oversight and things that these

4061
02:46:12,359 --> 02:46:17,189
taxes are gonna go to pay for that are

4062
02:46:14,789 --> 02:46:20,279
necessary evils you know people who hate

4063
02:46:17,189 --> 02:46:21,779
regulation but at the same time we have

4064
02:46:20,279 --> 02:46:24,810
to have somebody out there that's

4065
02:46:21,779 --> 02:46:26,998
unitarily making sure everybody is doing

4066
02:46:24,809 --> 02:46:29,429
things properly otherwise we're back to

4067
02:46:26,998 --> 02:46:31,888
the same point where we were before so

4068
02:46:29,429 --> 02:46:34,020
it's it's it's very important steps that

4069
02:46:31,888 --> 02:46:36,118
we're making toward and by having

4070
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:37,588
laboratories that are properly testing

4071
02:46:36,119 --> 02:46:39,539
and then showing other laboratories

4072
02:46:37,588 --> 02:46:41,398
through brain testing how to actually

4073
02:46:39,539 --> 02:46:43,649
calibrate their machines and get them up

4074
02:46:41,398 --> 02:46:46,019
to standards besides you know becoming

4075
02:46:43,648 --> 02:46:47,968
proprietary you know knowledge it now

4076
02:46:46,020 --> 02:46:50,759
becomes universal knowledge for everyone

4077
02:46:47,968 --> 02:46:52,708
so that everyone has access to their

4078
02:46:50,759 --> 02:46:54,568
testing and a reasonable rate because

4079
02:46:52,709 --> 02:46:56,459
let me tell you it's expensive testing

4080
02:46:54,568 --> 02:46:57,689
and it costs hundreds of thousands of

4081
02:46:56,459 --> 02:46:59,099
dollars and I've spent hundreds of

4082
02:46:57,689 --> 02:47:01,439
thousands if not millions of dollars on

4083
02:46:59,099 --> 02:47:03,539
testing but it's necessary evil to get

4084
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:06,809
to the point that we're testing is real

4085
02:47:03,539 --> 02:47:08,279
and we have real data and so that we can

4086
02:47:06,809 --> 02:47:09,778
actually take forward knowing that

4087
02:47:08,279 --> 02:47:13,199
everything that we have is actually

4088
02:47:09,779 --> 02:47:14,729
properly done and tested and now that

4089
02:47:13,199 --> 02:47:17,520
everybody else is held to the same

4090
02:47:14,728 --> 02:47:19,288
standards it's it's gonna ripple across

4091
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:22,349
the effect because I'm no longer bearing

4092
02:47:19,289 --> 02:47:24,838
that personal responsibility which I

4093
02:47:22,349 --> 02:47:25,828
have and willfully now it will be spread

4094
02:47:24,838 --> 02:47:28,349
across through all these different

4095
02:47:25,828 --> 02:47:30,898
regulatory agencies and oversight bodies

4096
02:47:28,349 --> 02:47:32,998
that will actually make sure that one

4097
02:47:30,898 --> 02:47:34,478
I'm not making sure that my labs are

4098
02:47:32,998 --> 02:47:36,389
calibrated they're at standard

4099
02:47:34,478 --> 02:47:39,129
that I'm actually making them happen

4100
02:47:36,389 --> 02:47:41,189
agricultural centers and on top of that

4101
02:47:39,129 --> 02:47:44,108
we'll have hopefully in the future

4102
02:47:41,189 --> 02:47:45,789
Organic Standards and certifications so

4103
02:47:44,109 --> 02:47:47,738
that you can actually go through the

4104
02:47:45,789 --> 02:47:50,439
two-year process to actually become a

4105
02:47:47,738 --> 02:47:52,658
certified organic grower so then you can

4106
02:47:50,439 --> 02:47:55,029
actually have certified organic cannabis

4107
02:47:52,658 --> 02:47:57,908
that's gonna be the next step we still

4108
02:47:55,029 --> 02:48:00,039
have to pierce that veil and once that

4109
02:47:57,908 --> 02:48:02,439
is actually broken through through these

4110
02:48:00,039 --> 02:48:05,020
regulations which we should see here in

4111
02:48:02,439 --> 02:48:07,210
California but national certification

4112
02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:09,248
may still say that well we're gonna hold

4113
02:48:07,209 --> 02:48:10,328
off until it's federally there because

4114
02:48:09,248 --> 02:48:12,789
we haven't seen that certification

4115
02:48:10,328 --> 02:48:14,799
really pop up in Colorado have you heard

4116
02:48:12,789 --> 02:48:19,630
any discussion of organic certification

4117
02:48:14,799 --> 02:48:21,398
in Pennsylvania dr. Sheldon no I haven't

4118
02:48:19,629 --> 02:48:24,038
even heard of it in Colorado I think I

4119
02:48:21,398 --> 02:48:26,648
heard of it in the HAMP side of the

4120
02:48:24,039 --> 02:48:28,710
Colorado industry but I'm not familiar

4121
02:48:26,648 --> 02:48:33,398
with it on the medicinal or recreational

4122
02:48:28,709 --> 02:48:36,688
side but I it happens real fast because

4123
02:48:33,398 --> 02:48:41,469
yeah Oh Whole Foods can't sell it until

4124
02:48:36,689 --> 02:48:43,689
it's certified organic and Amazon just

4125
02:48:41,469 --> 02:48:46,568
bought Whole Foods so of course they'll

4126
02:48:43,689 --> 02:48:50,800
force cannabis to be allowed to be

4127
02:48:46,568 --> 02:48:53,198
organic also yeah if anything I would

4128
02:48:50,799 --> 02:48:57,038
expect Amazon to be the first online

4129
02:48:53,199 --> 02:49:04,658
deliverer of cannabis well I didn't say

4130
02:48:57,039 --> 02:49:07,180
it I know they're friendly they bottle

4131
02:49:04,658 --> 02:49:12,549
foods they bought Whole Foods for 14

4132
02:49:07,180 --> 02:49:14,738
billion dollars the other day yeah yeah

4133
02:49:12,549 --> 02:49:16,509
that's going shopping for sure that's

4134
02:49:14,738 --> 02:49:18,368
just through a whole thing because you

4135
02:49:16,510 --> 02:49:20,318
know Walmart and those have had their

4136
02:49:18,369 --> 02:49:23,590
you know their super stores and there's

4137
02:49:20,318 --> 02:49:27,129
Sam's and their food centers but this is

4138
02:49:23,590 --> 02:49:30,279
a huge volley for Amazon they say that

4139
02:49:27,129 --> 02:49:33,278
there's about a million existing Amazon

4140
02:49:30,279 --> 02:49:35,949
fresh customers this is Amazon's food

4141
02:49:33,279 --> 02:49:37,689
fresh food delivery business they

4142
02:49:35,949 --> 02:49:39,939
imagined that that number is going to

4143
02:49:37,689 --> 02:49:42,729
peak about a hundred million it's gonna

4144
02:49:39,939 --> 02:49:46,479
go from 1 million to a hundred million

4145
02:49:42,728 --> 02:49:48,099
people buying their groceries through

4146
02:49:46,478 --> 02:49:51,549
Amazon

4147
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:54,090
on their phone closing doors down hey

4148
02:49:51,549 --> 02:49:56,109
well I was interesting because it's like

4149
02:49:54,090 --> 02:49:58,889
everything's been going towards the

4150
02:49:56,110 --> 02:50:00,970
Internet in favor of brick-and-mortar

4151
02:49:58,889 --> 02:50:02,319
but now one of the biggest companies

4152
02:50:00,969 --> 02:50:04,929
essentially what they did is they went

4153
02:50:02,319 --> 02:50:09,549
shopping for brick-and-mortar right well

4154
02:50:04,930 --> 02:50:12,370
yeah it was on the food market and to

4155
02:50:09,549 --> 02:50:14,829
change it they need well and and the

4156
02:50:12,370 --> 02:50:17,590
fresh food market really is is is

4157
02:50:14,829 --> 02:50:21,039
directly tied to the price of fossil

4158
02:50:17,590 --> 02:50:24,250
fuels like it or not as elitist so right

4159
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:27,790
now their distribution network has just

4160
02:50:24,250 --> 02:50:30,040
become this huge web of whole food

4161
02:50:27,790 --> 02:50:31,600
stores but you'll see them make a deal

4162
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:33,550
with Tesla and they'll all of a sudden

4163
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:35,771
have the first electric vehicles that

4164
02:50:33,549 --> 02:50:39,309
are delivering all these things across

4165
02:50:35,771 --> 02:50:42,280
the country arc drones right there

4166
02:50:39,309 --> 02:50:45,069
flying around dropping food and that's

4167
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:47,230
scary they're gonna have intelligent

4168
02:50:45,069 --> 02:50:49,270
drones no they're gonna have driverless

4169
02:50:47,229 --> 02:50:51,010
trucks that Tesla and them will create

4170
02:50:49,271 --> 02:50:52,630
that are already solar power

4171
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:55,300
you're not already replacing the

4172
02:50:52,629 --> 02:50:56,799
supercharged centers with solar so now

4173
02:50:55,299 --> 02:50:59,529
they're gonna be solar supercharged

4174
02:50:56,799 --> 02:51:01,359
centers on top of that and on top of

4175
02:50:59,530 --> 02:51:03,460
that they're gonna be autonomous so oh

4176
02:51:01,360 --> 02:51:04,630
you come out in it and be on your front

4177
02:51:03,459 --> 02:51:07,539
porch it's already that way with

4178
02:51:04,629 --> 02:51:09,639
instacart and Google delivery this is a

4179
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:12,070
huge shoot shout against Google's

4180
02:51:09,639 --> 02:51:14,590
delivery as well because I get a Google

4181
02:51:12,069 --> 02:51:16,719
delivery where I can order my food and

4182
02:51:14,590 --> 02:51:18,399
all my non perishables and they come in

4183
02:51:16,719 --> 02:51:20,590
boxes to my house and I order my

4184
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:22,659
instacart and I can have all my fresh

4185
02:51:20,590 --> 02:51:25,299
fruits and vegetables delivered to my

4186
02:51:22,659 --> 02:51:27,280
house as is right now I do this all the

4187
02:51:25,299 --> 02:51:29,379
time I don't even go into stores anymore

4188
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:32,130
because the convenience is acceptable

4189
02:51:29,379 --> 02:51:34,689
there so it's already drones are a

4190
02:51:32,129 --> 02:51:37,089
concept but they're already doing this

4191
02:51:34,690 --> 02:51:39,250
all the spread of the stores miss you

4192
02:51:37,090 --> 02:51:41,530
the stores miss you the stores want you

4193
02:51:39,250 --> 02:51:44,350
back eight yeah but some people will

4194
02:51:41,530 --> 02:51:46,060
always love to choose their produce yeah

4195
02:51:44,350 --> 02:51:49,059
I think it's great

4196
02:51:46,059 --> 02:51:51,129
IIIi look we found we found that with

4197
02:51:49,059 --> 02:51:53,409
delivery of cannabis when when we were

4198
02:51:51,129 --> 02:51:55,959
shut down by the government for a

4199
02:51:53,409 --> 02:51:57,729
temporary I went to delivery exclusively

4200
02:51:55,959 --> 02:51:59,889
and what we found out from deliver

4201
02:51:57,729 --> 02:52:02,020
exclusives exactly that is a majority of

4202
02:51:59,889 --> 02:52:04,149
people especially Californians

4203
02:52:02,021 --> 02:52:05,681
highly educated on cannabis and they

4204
02:52:04,149 --> 02:52:07,359
want to see their cannabis they don't

4205
02:52:05,681 --> 02:52:10,211
want to be like here's what you have

4206
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:12,251
choice of this one thing good day they

4207
02:52:10,210 --> 02:52:14,649
want to be able to to like at the store

4208
02:52:12,251 --> 02:52:17,200
they get whenever somebody asked for a

4209
02:52:14,649 --> 02:52:18,909
genetic we pull out three to four

4210
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:20,829
different one of that same kind so they

4211
02:52:18,909 --> 02:52:22,239
can pick between those and they'll be

4212
02:52:20,829 --> 02:52:23,319
like ooh this looks better than this and

4213
02:52:22,239 --> 02:52:25,390
that's what their should their choices

4214
02:52:23,319 --> 02:52:28,239
to just show up with the delivery and

4215
02:52:25,390 --> 02:52:30,640
just be told exactly that's a something

4216
02:52:28,239 --> 02:52:33,789
that the market does not necessarily

4217
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:35,501
want for cannabis how do you find that

4218
02:52:33,790 --> 02:52:37,061
like with your avocados and your

4219
02:52:35,501 --> 02:52:38,771
tomatoes and your produce that gets

4220
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:40,569
delivered directly to your house I mean

4221
02:52:38,771 --> 02:52:42,489
I like to go to the store and pick out

4222
02:52:40,569 --> 02:52:44,351
my cantaloupe I like to feel it and

4223
02:52:42,489 --> 02:52:47,050
smell it and I don't want someone else

4224
02:52:44,351 --> 02:52:49,239
picking out my cantaloupe for me how do

4225
02:52:47,050 --> 02:52:51,489
you like that procedure I mean is nine

4226
02:52:49,239 --> 02:52:53,771
times out of ten they nail it you know

4227
02:52:51,489 --> 02:52:55,931
as the thing is is you know it's listed

4228
02:52:53,771 --> 02:52:57,579
as what it is if is you want organic

4229
02:52:55,931 --> 02:52:59,739
cantaloupe they will pick up an organic

4230
02:52:57,579 --> 02:53:01,601
cantaloupe it you can select know that

4231
02:52:59,739 --> 02:53:03,880
if there isn't that organic cantaloupe

4232
02:53:01,601 --> 02:53:05,860
then cancel it or select something else

4233
02:53:03,880 --> 02:53:07,720
so they can have a choice where you can

4234
02:53:05,860 --> 02:53:10,030
select either another organic cantaloupe

4235
02:53:07,720 --> 02:53:14,020
or a conventional so you can have that

4236
02:53:10,030 --> 02:53:16,841
selection in the menus currently on if

4237
02:53:14,021 --> 02:53:18,551
that that organic cantaloupe isn't there

4238
02:53:16,841 --> 02:53:21,069
now could I pick something right myself

4239
02:53:18,550 --> 02:53:22,779
better than somebody most likely but as

4240
02:53:21,069 --> 02:53:25,329
I said nine times out of ten they get it

4241
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:28,480
right and for me the convenience is

4242
02:53:25,329 --> 02:53:30,069
better than actually going down I prefer

4243
02:53:28,479 --> 02:53:31,899
to go down to a farmers market to a

4244
02:53:30,069 --> 02:53:33,940
local farmers market which I tend to do

4245
02:53:31,899 --> 02:53:35,890
but even they're doing that now they're

4246
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:37,659
going to local farmers markets so even

4247
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:39,850
that takes a hell of a lot of the

4248
02:53:37,659 --> 02:53:41,619
guessing games out so instacart not only

4249
02:53:39,851 --> 02:53:43,181
goes to local my local market but on

4250
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:44,771
certain weekdays that go to local

4251
02:53:43,181 --> 02:53:46,780
farmers market so you can actually

4252
02:53:44,771 --> 02:53:48,730
select that as well and you know you're

4253
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:50,591
getting organic local and locally

4254
02:53:48,729 --> 02:53:52,390
supporting and that's where your dollars

4255
02:53:50,591 --> 02:53:54,690
are going you're just not having to deal

4256
02:53:52,390 --> 02:53:59,350
with the driving around the parking and

4257
02:53:54,690 --> 02:54:01,899
all those really is my wife would grow

4258
02:53:59,351 --> 02:54:04,900
up Amish farm on the other side of the

4259
02:54:01,899 --> 02:54:07,270
hill and by all armistice all throughout

4260
02:54:04,899 --> 02:54:10,270
this time of the year so we have our I

4261
02:54:07,271 --> 02:54:12,790
like some Amish farmer you know 20 yard

4262
02:54:10,271 --> 02:54:15,181
or Woody's wife Laura had a company in

4263
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:17,461
Los Angeles called yoga niché's

4264
02:54:15,181 --> 02:54:19,801
and they home-delivered organic fruits

4265
02:54:17,460 --> 02:54:21,751
and vegetables and you they gave you a

4266
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:23,911
list of all the ones that were available

4267
02:54:21,751 --> 02:54:25,380
the week and you would check them all

4268
02:54:23,911 --> 02:54:27,810
off the ones you wanted and they would

4269
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:29,251
prioritize those in your box and you

4270
02:54:27,810 --> 02:54:31,710
would get other stuff but you know we

4271
02:54:29,251 --> 02:54:33,421
were pretty open-minded to other organic

4272
02:54:31,710 --> 02:54:36,180
fruits and vegetables but every week we

4273
02:54:33,421 --> 02:54:37,470
used to get a couple boxes we were on we

4274
02:54:36,181 --> 02:54:39,541
would get the fruit and we get the

4275
02:54:37,470 --> 02:54:42,511
vegetables and I thought it was

4276
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:45,060
fantastic because it also it really

4277
02:54:42,511 --> 02:54:47,280
helped the farmers in a lot of ways to

4278
02:54:45,060 --> 02:54:50,399
get to their customer but it also gave

4279
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:52,081
you recipes as well so that was also so

4280
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:54,661
you got recipes if something was

4281
02:54:52,081 --> 02:54:56,610
regional or seasonal it gave you

4282
02:54:54,661 --> 02:54:59,341
seasonal recipes so it also broadens

4283
02:54:56,610 --> 02:55:00,450
your recipe base so that you if you've

4284
02:54:59,341 --> 02:55:01,649
already had something in mind for the

4285
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:04,471
fruits and vegetables that were coming

4286
02:55:01,649 --> 02:55:06,720
to you great but if you didn't because

4287
02:55:04,470 --> 02:55:08,430
we do something or did something for our

4288
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:10,591
hospice patients where it was farm-fresh

4289
02:55:08,431 --> 02:55:12,271
to you it's a local organic farm and

4290
02:55:10,591 --> 02:55:15,601
they do the same thing they would

4291
02:55:12,271 --> 02:55:16,771
deliver organic vegetables we realized

4292
02:55:15,601 --> 02:55:19,411
when we were dealing with hospice

4293
02:55:16,771 --> 02:55:21,661
patients that cannabis is is it's an

4294
02:55:19,411 --> 02:55:23,101
essential tool but it is a tool you need

4295
02:55:21,661 --> 02:55:26,310
to take care of your health eating

4296
02:55:23,101 --> 02:55:27,961
properly is one thing so I highly

4297
02:55:26,310 --> 02:55:31,050
recommend supporting these types of

4298
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:32,189
local box organic vegetable delivery

4299
02:55:31,050 --> 02:55:34,859
services because you're supporting the

4300
02:55:32,190 --> 02:55:37,649
farmers and even if it's not ripe

4301
02:55:34,860 --> 02:55:39,121
you know as you know dr. Sheldon you

4302
02:55:37,649 --> 02:55:41,279
just leave it on the shelf a couple of

4303
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:43,470
days and it can it will ripen in time

4304
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:45,480
you know it's it's I've never gotten

4305
02:55:43,470 --> 02:55:47,040
past right things from that type of

4306
02:55:45,479 --> 02:55:50,399
delivery I've usually gotten things that

4307
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:52,620
are you know pre ripe yeah I think they

4308
02:55:50,399 --> 02:55:54,989
pick them pre right because they know

4309
02:55:52,620 --> 02:55:57,720
it's gonna ripen on the on the delivery

4310
02:55:54,989 --> 02:56:00,831
service but yeah how good it's packaged

4311
02:55:57,720 --> 02:56:02,880
because certain vegetables will bruise

4312
02:56:00,831 --> 02:56:05,130
quite a bit when they're when they're

4313
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:07,439
shipped and so you last thing you know

4314
02:56:05,130 --> 02:56:10,501
you want to get is a apple that's all

4315
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:11,280
bruised up or avocado or a pear to chop

4316
02:56:10,501 --> 02:56:12,690
bruised up

4317
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:14,911
you know dr. Sheila I [ __ ] you not

4318
02:56:12,690 --> 02:56:16,831
because I worked in Pennsylvania on a

4319
02:56:14,911 --> 02:56:19,560
horse farm and I used to go to the the

4320
02:56:16,831 --> 02:56:22,649
Amish or a mesh and depending on I want

4321
02:56:19,560 --> 02:56:25,501
to try Amish grown pot I bet you they're

4322
02:56:22,649 --> 02:56:26,940
organic cannabis if [ __ ] dick in the

4323
02:56:25,501 --> 02:56:28,469
dirt amazeballs

4324
02:56:26,940 --> 02:56:31,800
I mean yeah

4325
02:56:28,469 --> 02:56:35,898
do the Amish grow tobacco I don't yes

4326
02:56:31,799 --> 02:56:39,269
they do yes thank you really yes they do

4327
02:56:35,898 --> 02:56:42,238
yeah if there's a market for it and it's

4328
02:56:39,270 --> 02:56:45,420
agriculture the Amish grow it the Amish

4329
02:56:42,238 --> 02:56:55,648
will grow anything they don't smoke do

4330
02:56:45,420 --> 02:57:01,049
they watch TV or not that are mint

4331
02:56:55,648 --> 02:57:03,180
tobacco oh um I don't think so I don't

4332
02:57:01,049 --> 02:57:07,769
think they're alive really not even a

4333
02:57:03,180 --> 02:57:10,068
pilot oh maybe maybe they are I I don't

4334
02:57:07,770 --> 02:57:13,140
know I I know they're not allowed to

4335
02:57:10,068 --> 02:57:15,389
consume alcohol I mean the strict Amish

4336
02:57:13,139 --> 02:57:16,260
folks I mean they don't they don't use

4337
02:57:15,389 --> 02:57:19,559
electricity

4338
02:57:16,260 --> 02:57:22,648
they don't use shoes they're always in

4339
02:57:19,559 --> 02:57:23,488
bare feet they're they have dirt floors

4340
02:57:22,648 --> 02:57:25,889
in their homes

4341
02:57:23,488 --> 02:57:28,618
the Pennsylvania men and I it's they

4342
02:57:25,889 --> 02:57:30,180
have like motorised tractors and

4343
02:57:28,619 --> 02:57:32,130
vehicles and [ __ ] like that

4344
02:57:30,180 --> 02:57:34,498
but you'll see him at an Amish guy out

4345
02:57:32,129 --> 02:57:36,179
there with a team of horses plowing a

4346
02:57:34,498 --> 02:57:38,728
field like his great-great-great

4347
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:41,520
grandfather's did you know it's crazy

4348
02:57:38,728 --> 02:57:44,908
that they're still farming in this very

4349
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:48,119
very you know it make they control when

4350
02:57:44,908 --> 02:57:52,529
I when I went to the the the mills the

4351
02:57:48,119 --> 02:57:54,390
sawmills cuz I got the the sawdust for

4352
02:57:52,529 --> 02:57:56,248
the animal bedding and they controlled

4353
02:57:54,389 --> 02:57:58,019
it so every time I went down there I

4354
02:57:56,248 --> 02:58:00,840
would actually have to wear long sleeves

4355
02:57:58,020 --> 02:58:02,310
so my tattoos wouldn't show otherwise it

4356
02:58:00,840 --> 02:58:04,978
wouldn't deal with me you know a they're

4357
02:58:02,309 --> 02:58:07,469
that strict still back in the 90s you

4358
02:58:04,978 --> 02:58:08,879
know they're they're socially about what

4359
02:58:07,469 --> 02:58:11,219
they are but it also depends there's

4360
02:58:08,879 --> 02:58:13,948
different sects there's do I you know

4361
02:58:11,219 --> 02:58:16,858
that they are there can be as strict and

4362
02:58:13,949 --> 02:58:19,170
by-the-book or as close to Mennonite is

4363
02:58:16,859 --> 02:58:20,340
even possible you know so you have the

4364
02:58:19,170 --> 02:58:22,828
whole gamut but for the most part

4365
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:26,309
they're very strict and I can't say I've

4366
02:58:22,828 --> 02:58:29,430
ever seen an Amish smoked smoked tobacco

4367
02:58:26,309 --> 02:58:31,708
myself but I know that they grow it they

4368
02:58:29,430 --> 02:58:33,359
grow everything great they don't [ __ ]

4369
02:58:31,709 --> 02:58:37,380
around when it comes to farming them in

4370
02:58:33,359 --> 02:58:39,209
barns you want an Amish barn yeah they

4371
02:58:37,379 --> 02:58:41,639
do lots of barn raisings but you know

4372
02:58:39,209 --> 02:58:42,360
the one thing about the Amish is again

4373
02:58:41,639 --> 02:58:46,409
they know that

4374
02:58:42,360 --> 02:58:48,931
you of what they they bring in terms of

4375
02:58:46,409 --> 02:58:50,789
marketing you know like there's I've

4376
02:58:48,931 --> 02:58:52,829
said this story before probably not on

4377
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:56,221
has to church but we went in one time to

4378
02:58:52,829 --> 02:58:59,729
buy our our Turkey and there was a line

4379
02:58:56,220 --> 02:59:02,909
again Range Rovers and BMWs parked at

4380
02:58:59,729 --> 02:59:06,209
the Amish place where there's horses and

4381
02:59:02,909 --> 02:59:09,470
buggies lined up and then you basically

4382
02:59:06,209 --> 02:59:11,939
have these people who buy their Amish

4383
02:59:09,470 --> 02:59:13,529
turkeys well this girl behind the

4384
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:15,810
counter was probably like about I don't

4385
02:59:13,530 --> 02:59:18,000
know 14 or 15 years old and she was

4386
02:59:15,810 --> 02:59:20,970
rifling through a stack of 20s like a

4387
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:23,399
Vegas dealer I'll be right with you sir

4388
02:59:20,970 --> 02:59:28,619
and just as very stark image a very

4389
02:59:23,399 --> 02:59:30,841
simple lifestyle but just huge in

4390
02:59:28,620 --> 02:59:33,391
understanding the business is what they

4391
02:59:30,841 --> 02:59:35,431
do and there was this line of people out

4392
02:59:33,390 --> 02:59:37,619
the door who wanted their Amish this and

4393
02:59:35,431 --> 02:59:41,069
their Amish that and so they know the

4394
02:59:37,620 --> 02:59:43,410
value of a buck that's for sure awesome

4395
02:59:41,069 --> 02:59:44,640
well I think that is the high note of

4396
02:59:43,409 --> 02:59:47,011
hashed Church and we should probably end

4397
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:51,239
it on the high note an Amish story above

4398
02:59:47,011 --> 02:59:53,310
turkeys and Range Rover no no that's

4399
02:59:51,239 --> 02:59:54,720
okay I honestly I said I was gonna end

4400
02:59:53,310 --> 02:59:56,909
it at 12 and it's 12

4401
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:59,100
