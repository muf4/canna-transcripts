177
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:21,240
once winner of

178
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,239
the it's true right that

179
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,759
true how did that to you it's an honor

180
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,399
to be here you know I first came here 20

181
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,360
years ago and was one of the first group

182
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,320
of people that walked into the canvas

183
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,759
Castle when then opened it up to the

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,360
public and was inspired forever this was

185
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,319
a castle in the South somewhere in the

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,320
South Nas right yeah sort of paradise

187
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,079
for an American coming out from the drug

188
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,519
war it was Paradise it was a dream to

189
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,638
have a basement full of cannabis and a

190
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,879
beautiful farm and yes so and the

191
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,839
education is a huge part of it and to be

192
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,679
part of this Museum and part of what

193
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,279
we're doing which is educating everybody

194
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,319
to the wonders of the plant is very

195
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,360
honorable so it's great to be here

196
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,399
fantastic and then we

197
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,000
have maybe it's sound almost cliche

198
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,799
right like you called prince the prince

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,600
and princess of pot is

200
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,838
that the prince and pot and I just kind

201
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,440
of got princess along the

202
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:26,600
way so you married a prince yes yes I

203
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:29,839
did and and it's also true maybe all of

204
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,240
you know that you just you're a free man

205
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,240
you just moved out of uh jail yes Rec

206
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,600
right got out of US federal prison on

207
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,600
August

208
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:46,799
[Music]

209
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,320
12th and I blame Ben Dron

210
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,078
that oh because he got up in this very

211
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,360
spot in this very town on this very day

212
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:58,638
20 years ago and boasted in his calm

213
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,240
smug way that he had planted millions

214
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,799
and millions of and plants around the

215
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,480
world through his service at sensey

216
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,199
seeds and that this was creating

217
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,079
disturbances and revolutions and changes

218
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,120
of opinion and heart and politics

219
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,919
everywhere in the world and I was so

220
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,360
inspired by that I got up and I said I'm

221
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,278
going to do just like

222
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,360
him I'm going to do just like I'm going

223
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,159
to go home and I'm going to do that for

224
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,560
all of North America and I did do that

225
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,559
and so it's his

226
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:24,559
fault

227
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:33,720
heavly we're also very happy uh to could

228
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:36,838
could could the mic at least uh of Mark

229
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:42,959

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,600

233
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:52,399
High Times Cannabis Cup which is

234
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,839

235
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,839
with you at all

236
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,838
amazing

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,120
that

238
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,920
first May Restaurant came over $600 to

239
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,360
start the Canabis C and we did it with

240
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:18,479
case hooker famous uh artist from from

241
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,480
Amsterdam who for

242
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:28,439
one so these guys they they started the

243
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:32,838
Cannabis C and okay so you're guilty by

244
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,399
association was yes okay fair enough I

245
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,880
propose by the way so it's a bit the

246
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,839
program is a bit shaky because uh our uh

247
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:46,639
lost guest Mr Nice I guess everybody

248
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:50,040
knows any kind of sort of is a bit late

249
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,360
because what what was the reason his

250
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,759
flight got canell flight got cancelled

251
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,639
another flight he was not allowed board

252
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,560
another flight well something like that

253
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,240
he's coming he's in the a he's in here

254
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:06,559
high

255
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,079
iny right so I propose let's roll a

256
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,799
video

257
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:12,799
now maybe lower the

258
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,958
light to discover the

259
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,720

260
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,120

durable

268
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,839
future no wonder this influential plant

269
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,879

yeah now maybe it is time to get a bit

283
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:57,278
more serious because apparently as far

284
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,159
as I'm aware somehow I have the

285
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,240
impression that around the world we see

286
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:06,958
more and more places or States at least

287
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,600
the United States where uh U at least

288
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,559
some kind of legalization uh takes

289
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,480
place uh I don't know officially in

290
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:21,599
Canada it is October 19 2015 is

291
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:25,199

292
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,560

293
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,000
yes which is the GRE part or the LI

294
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,318
Party of Canada now the Liberal Party of

295
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,839
Canada Liberal Party which has governed

296
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:37,759
our nation for most of its

297
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,399
history um but let's get more serious

298
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,120
because funny enough or strange enough

299
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:46,078
or tragically enough in this lovely

300
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,879
little uh country this Delta somehow

301
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,000
things are changing or we feel sort of I

302
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,879

most experts you can't explain it it is

307

time I interviewed uh Ben so that's why

350
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,678

congratulations you know who

356
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,400
are anyway this has been a this has been

357
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,000
a wild week um you know the Dutch coffee

358
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,159
shop industry is who we depend on and

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,640
they have been incredibly uh sympathetic

360
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,320
and Incredibly supportive and they're

361
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,480
appalled by what has gone down here and

362
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,000
I have to correct some information here

363
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:43,279
the fact is we have been coming here 26

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,119
years we get our permits in order we

365
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,798
don't go anywhere whether it's LA or

366
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,918
whether it's San Francisco or Denver

367
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,960
without dealing with the local

368
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,120
authorities this is what we have done we

369
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,400
have dealt with the authorities all the

370
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,158
all the way along we had Dutch lawyers

371
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,720
dealing dealing with the mayor's office

372
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,039
and in the end he shut us down there's

373
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,679
been some misinformation out there that

374
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:07,279
we needed a permit that is incorrect the

375
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,640
mayor was threatening the permits of the

376
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,558
venues that we were trying to enter okay

377
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,559
it is simple as that they targeted the

378
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:18,279
Cannabis Cup after 26 years and shut

379
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,079
down the Expo part which is the industry

380
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,079
the people who are supporting the

381
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,639
Pioneers the real Rebels who are out

382
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,319
there on the front lines every day not

383
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,120
the activists the people who are in

384
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:31,038
business because their lives are at

385
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,158
stake other people's jobs are at stake

386
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,558
so this is a chance for the Cannabis

387
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,320
Community to network for the public to

388
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,519
meet the merchandisers the people to

389
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,319
meet the companies and it's been shut

390
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,679
down and we're appalled you know the

391
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,720
fact is what Ben said before we're

392
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,880
moving backwards here in Holland and I

393
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,759
say we because my roots are here too

394
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,919
that's where the Cannabis Cup roots are

395
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,480
and SK and in the United States we're

396
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,759
making tremendous progress we have

397
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,240
cannabis cups now six times a year and

398
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,158
every yes go ahead

399
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,079
uh if this if this will be the same next

400
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,400
year could it mean that you will leave

401
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,960
the Netherlands and go I hope not as I

402
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,640
said the roots of the Cannabis Cup are

403
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,200
here in Amsterdam but I don't really

404
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,520
particularly I can't say that we

405
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,840
particularly feel welcome this week the

406
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,079
fact is you know on Sunday I was down

407
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,798
there after the cup you know blew apart

408
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:20,038
um I was down there in the you know in

409
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,158
the coffee shop district and all the

410
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,158
people are smoking and having a

411
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:27,760
wonderful time you know cannabis culture

412
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,039
is part of Dutch culture at this point

413
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,480

414
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,240

415

422
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,240
question question one question just I

423
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,759
just wanted to ask why do you think they

424
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,440
are doing this this year I would like to

425
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,839
know that I would like to know why we've

426
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,798
been targeted this particular is there

427
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,558
anybody here who knows the answer why

428
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:06,440
the Dutch mayor

429
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,440
or some people say

430
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,039
because I know for a fact they use this

431
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,599
as an excuse many

432
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:19,599
times thank you very much

433
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:29,879
folks to your to to answer your question

434
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,960
I got to get going I got to go got

435
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,440
I know the excuse is the European Union

436
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,558
and there has been this

437
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,159
contract sort of that we are not we

438
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:45,678
cannot but one of our former winners uh

439
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,120
and and former prime minister of the

440
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,320
Netherlands already stated on the

441
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,759
Cannabis culture Awards in

442
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:58,079
2010 that it's

443
00:22:52,759 --> 00:23:00,558
B but they do use it I have a theory our

444
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,158
movement is making enormous games in

445
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:06,639
many different places but our enemies

446
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:09,880
hate us they still hate us the and when

447
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,640
they're losing they'll fight back harder

448
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,559
just like we have to fight back harder

449
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,120
if we're losing so you know even though

450
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,000
we're making progress they're going to

451
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,839
fight back if they really want to and

452
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,480
some people in positions of authority

453
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,439
perhaps want to flex that muscle even if

454
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,079
they feel alone they feel like a warrior

455
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,038
just like many of our activists perhaps

456
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:34,319
down in South Africa feel alone so they

457
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:36,839
feel like a warrior for their cause so

458
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,038
I'm just floating that theory that maybe

459
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:42,678
this is one lone Guy s i ha what they're

460
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:45,240
doing then again then again though it

461
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:49,679
may be true and we have somebody here in

462
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,558
the a farmer he's now very famous yeah

463
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:56,880
you know maybe he wants to be a little

464
00:23:51,558 --> 00:24:01,440
Prof today who is now in how we call

465
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:06,120
this uh because they and he was a a bona

466
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,480
fight Bona fight uh farmer grower uh so

467
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:12,519
things are changing then again we are

468
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,360
still kind of Liber liberal this country

469
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,679
I mean still we are sitting here you

470
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,678
know well this could be this could

471
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,360
happen in can to now or it could happen

472
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:27,880
in Vancouver or Toronto how much can you

473
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:30,959
have with you there your no legal amount

474
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,840
unless Fally allowed from the government

475
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,240
the tolerance is there could this happen

476
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,240
now in there are many events with a lot

477
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,240
of marijuana yes okay our journalist go

478
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,720
to probably several locations in Canada

479
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,679
where they have regular Canabis

480
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,720
expositions and judging Jo all day

481
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,919
parties but we also have a government

482
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
that has cracked down and has stopped

483
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,799
letting people and patients grow their

484
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,798
own PL so no they're not getting

485
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,480
licenses anymore nobody now can get a

486
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,398
license

487
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,919
that very soon I propose that we

488
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:07,038
although we know although we all know

489
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,278

538
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:22,759
I don't remember who it was who came

539
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,399
with the idea like we got to force

540
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:28,519
legalization by our seeds just by

541
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:31,759
spreading spreading the seeds all the

00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,720
Freedom overgrow the government and

544
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,519
overgrow is like a biological way

545
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,798
instead of overthrow which is a violent

546
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,119
way of changing the government against

547
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:43,319
their will and I thought they're not

548
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,319
going to come around to us

549
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:49,119
philosophically but we will force them

550
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:51,158
to bend to us and by doing so by having

551
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,839
my idea for me was that I wanted to be

552
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:56,760
the person that produc more marijuana in

553
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,599
Canada and the United States than the

554

police forces of both count could

destroy in the same but to one person

you were sick right yes so does that

633
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,599
mean that you are more let's say from

634
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,480
the the side of the medical Mar is that

635
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:26,599
where you originated from or you how you

636
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,679
start it most definitely when I was a

637
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,798
child I had cancer and my mother was

638
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:35,278
back in 1979 I was only 9 years old and

639
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,720
U my mom gave me some medical cannabis

640
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,599
uh she had read about it in Good

641
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,200
Housekeeping magazine which in America

642
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:43,519
is pretty pretty square and she was

643
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,558
sitting in a waiting room one day and

644
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,880
said she read about the therapeutic

645
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:50,158
effects of marijuana and she just

646
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,278
decided to try it because at that point

647
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,919
I had had T much nine times between ages

648
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:58,839
2 and 10 and my mother was just at at a

649
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,919
loss of things to do and and she decided

650
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:03,678
to talk to my doctor about it and he was

651
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,399
also at a point of feeling like there

652
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,038
wasn't much to lose because I had a

653
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,959
tumor in my soft in soft tissue between

654
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,119
my left lung and my heart and they

655
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,919
figured why not so we started using it

656
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,719
after I was going to

657
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,159
radi and it

658
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,839
was interesting interesting

659
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,240
interes enough uh quite recently I

660
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,038
believe two years ago something uh there

661
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,638
was a big story in United States um

662
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,679
child the sick child the parents they

663
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,638
tried to get marijuana in their state

664
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,278
was not allowed and they got contact

665
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:39,479
with these brothers

666
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:42,720
in Colorado and it became a big affair

667
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,960
because a journalist used to be anti or

668
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,798
swap during this it's true right what

669
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,679
you're speaking of is the CNN journalist

670
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,200
sanj gup he did a episode called lead

671
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,480
which I find mildly

672
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,360
offensive uh he he made a conversion he

673
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,919
actually wrote an editorial against

674
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,359
proposition 19 which was a ballad

675
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,960
initiative which would have legalized

676
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:08,838
cannabis in California and what they did

677
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,398
was somehow he tuned into what we would

678
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,759
been talking about for many a decade now

679
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,598
and had a real turnaround and he did a

680
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,359
CNN Special that was seen by very many

681
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:21,119
people and when this family saw it it

682
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,719
caused a lot of people to realize that

683
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,440
some of these children dealing with

684
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:29,398
intense seizure disorders are benefiting

685
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,878
from CBD now diol CBD everybody knows

686
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,878
who this is

687
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,240
oh and now there's been a refocus on

688
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,200
this because now they're starting to

689
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,959
look at children in these disorders if

690
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,799
you will and uh the children are pure

691
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,358
test subject when I was 9 years old I

692
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:52,359
had no politics I just wanted to feel

693
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:56,000
better and it helped how did you

694
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:59,679

[Music]

761
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:40,159
how and how are you actually are you

762
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,599
Mark and I met 19 years ago when he came

763
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:45,759
to the canas cup was 95 your first cup

764
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,400
uh 9496 94 then yep then our first year

765
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,880
was 20 years together were you then

766
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,720
already also on the F of Med medical

767
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,280
marijuana were you already interested in

768
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:58,318
that field when I came here in 1994 it's

769
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,400
because in Canada in 199 when I started

770
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:04,000
there was nothing and I tried to find a

771
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,240
book that Todd later becomes involved

772
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,920
with the EM wears no clothes the 1990

773
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,639
Edition by Jack R who's probably my you

774
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,639
know one of the more profound influences

775
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,759
in my lifelong with Ben and some others

776
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,078
and this book was banned in Canada you

777
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,560
couldn't get and then I it was banned in

778
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,519
Canada and magazine was banned in Canada

779
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:25,799
everything about marijuana was no longer

780
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,960
allowed pipes bong we only have it home

781
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,160
M which is B

782
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,159
well

783
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:37,480
actually a up to

784
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,960
$100,000 to distribute a book about

785
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,559
Maryland or or a magazine so it had

786
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,599
scared everybody and no one anymore so

787
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:48,078
uh when I came here um it was after we

788
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,280
had broken this band and we had

789
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:55,480
reintroduced to Canada uh the books uh

790
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,920
by Jack rare the magazine High other GRS

791
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,079
by Rosen and then we brought back pipes

792
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,000
and bongs and gave it a political cover

793
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,039
and reintroduced everything and then

794
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,119
when I came here 20 years ago I was

795
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,960
inspired to add seeds because we needed

796
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,559
to raise millions of dollars to give it

797
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,760
away so subsequently for 10 years what

798
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:15,239
do you mean give it away we gave away

799
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,880
all our profit so we were able to give

800
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:20,118
$5 million to all these actors groups

801
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,440
and valid initiatives in the US

802
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,280
political parties we did everything we

803
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,838
sued the US federal government we paid

804
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,720
for valid initi signature drives we form

805
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,639
political parties and bro can we gave

806
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:34,719
money to the Israeli Green Leaf party

807
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:36,759
the New Zealand cannabis party any place

808
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,719
we could change theal system with our

809
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,960
money I was excited to do it I can't

810
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,559
believe to this day that a Canadian was

811
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,880
able to give money to get medical

812
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:49,199
Washington DC Colorado few and even

813
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,039
Arizona that same year that I was able

814
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,519
to use that money to get things on the

815
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,279
ball I thought that was just the most

816
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:56,280
awesome thing Happ

817
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:06,159

818
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,838
more or less well I don't know to go you

819
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:13,679

820
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:15,719
uh spokesperson such maybe 10 years ago

821
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,519
and moved to Vancouver and got involved

822
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:21,879
with Mark and then the year following in

823
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,880
2005 is when the US government came into

824
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,760
Canada and had him arrested at facing 30

825

printed on him and pot TV which is a

833
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:52,519
video news network which he started as

834
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:56,399
one of his first video websites ever on

835
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:59,559

837
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:03,639

British Columbia I've run with the DC

846
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,358
don't trust the government we don't

847
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,000
trust the establishment and it makes

848
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:34,960
sense that you wouldn't because they've

849
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,639
been the oppressors the drug war and

850
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,800
prohibition have been created by the

851
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:43,480
people with power that's the police the

852
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,559
politicians the government and they have

853
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,880
oppressed the marijuana people and the

854
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:53,319
marijuana growers for so many years but

855
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,800
in our activism even before my time

856
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:59,558
activists have said Legalize It Legalize

857
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,039
It Stop arrest in people for pot and in

858
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,640
order to stop arresting people for pot

859
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,759
you need to get the arresters to stop

860
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,879
doing

861
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:14,520
that so you have to convince them to see

862
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,200
it our way and it's difficult to trust

863
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:18,039
the people who have worked against us

864
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,439
the people who have put us in prison the

865
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:22,400
people who have created the laws that

866
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,760
have destroyed so many lives it's hard

867
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,680
to trust them but you've got to work

868
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,680
with them and I would say that as scummy

869
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:33,480
and corrupt and unjust and evil as

870
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,558
government and politicians and all of

871
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,880
that can be they do govern Our Lives

872
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,920
whether we like it or not and if they're

873
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,880
going to go with us and Legalize It in

874
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,559
the form they have in Colorado or the

875
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,640
Forum they have in Uruguay or even this

876
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,200
Amsterdam type of legalization they

877
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:54,358
referred to for years whatever model it

878
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:57,239
is we have to be the ones to go to the

879
00:43:54,358 --> 00:44:01,440
oppressors to go to the powerful ones

880
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:03,759
say do it this way do it the right way

881
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,838
do it with the consciousness of medical

882
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,440
marijuana of H of the industrial

883
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:12,480
purposes of the jobs you can create do

884
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,200
it from these perspectives but if we as

885
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,880
the activists say we don't trust them

886
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:22,279
and we don't want to work with them they

887
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,960
will go seek others to work with so we

888
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,960
must be the ones

889
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,199
[Applause]

890
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,760
so if they're going to accept me and I

891
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:37,118
can run for office and get into the

892
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,960
government of Canada and help the

893
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,200
Liberal Party follow through on their

894
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,760
promise to legalized I would do my

895
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,239
utmost to make sure it's the best

896
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,760
legalization in the world so that

897
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,239
America and Obama and everyone else can

898
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,920
say Canada's pretty big they've got it

899
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:56,669

900
00:44:52,920 --> 00:45:00,200

legalization but let's make a quick note

917
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:57,000
about that these titles of liberal

918
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:59,118
Democrat Left Right conservative we have

919
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,440
to work with them all ending prohibition

920
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,000
is nonpartisan the Republicans and

921
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,920
conservatives can see it from a liberty

922
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,318
and financial perspective and the

923
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,599
Socialists and the left wing can see it

924
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:13,759
as a freedom and togetherness issue you

925
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,760
know this naturopath yeah there's

926
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,599
everybody has their own approach and

927
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,079
especially remember people who don't

928
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,200
smoke who agree with us like Dr San

929
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,839
they're going to help us win so keep

930
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,000
talking keep networking and never turn

931
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,679
away from anyone I used to want pot to

932
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,960
be illegal by the way I was a pro what

933
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,399
you I didn't like pot and I thought

934
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:38,039
people who smoke pot should go to prison

935
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,800
I did I did and then I smoked

936
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:42,199
it

937
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,160
SM

938
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:47,639
the

939
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,399
elaborate I started out in high school I

940
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:51,838
didn't like marijuana I didn't think

941
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,519
people use it I didn't I thought people

942
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,318
should go to prison but then I slowly

943
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:00,880
changed my mind because think of think

944
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:03,480
of think think of think of this think of

945
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,240
how think of how it is first you think

946
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,679
marijuana should be legal because it's

947
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,239
good but how many of you also thought

948
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,440
that maybe hard drugs should stay

949
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:14,000
illegal when you first became interested

950
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,119
in pots like some people start with

951
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,119
being proot and then they learn that

952
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,760
prohibition is a problem so never turn

953
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,160
your back on someone who is against you

954
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,160
because if they come around to your side

955
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,399

in this country you must be aware uh we

blackface tradition but the Dutch didn't

your philanthropy and your your passion

and your drive for decades honestly now

1018
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,798
and you know there was a few of us I

1019
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,039
think in that bus 20 years ago that

1020
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:12,679
realized that our voice meant something

1021
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:14,318
and you were one of those people and you

1022
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,358
know the world could like it or not yet

1023
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,199
something to say and we all heard it and

1024
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:21,078
that message was great and thank you you

1025
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,078
know from us all for for Having the

1026
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,400
courage to sell seeds to places where

1027
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:28,280
you weren't allowed to sell seeds to and

1028
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:31,119
for taking the proceeds and not you know

1029
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,680
buying yourself a space airplane or a

1030
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,519
ticket to Mars but instead trying to use

1031
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:39,199
it as a responsible resource to do good

1032
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:41,759
deeds and I admire that greatly because

1033
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:44,039
in this hippie type movement where a lot

1034
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,400
of people looked at wealth as a burden

1035
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:48,798
and not a blessing you looked at it as a

1036
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,160
responsibility and you redistributed in

1037
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:53,798
ways that a lot of people might not have

1038
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:57,239
done and then I forever am grateful to

1039
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:58,920
you that for that and I know that maybe

1040
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,558
from being behind the scenes and knowing

1041
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,599
the people that you've supported and the

1042
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,599
initiatives that you've gotten behind

1043
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:07,119
and the change that we have experienced

1044
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:09,400
in America was from generous people like

1045
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,720
you and from the bottom of my heart

1046
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:15,240

1047
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:17,598

prisoner you really did an am amazing

1060
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:19,318
job I've run into you at all these

1061
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,519
different rallies Seattle Hempfest and

1062
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:22,960
she was out there all the time pounding

1063
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,159
the pavement trying to get people to

1064
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,079
listen and and keeping the magazine

1065
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:29,519
going which has been a beacon of

1066
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,720
education and and really that's what

1067
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,318
we're here for because we believe that

1068
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:35,798
we have a message that everybody else

1069
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:37,679
needs to hear and in all honesty I'm

1070
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:39,239
only hoping that we inspire you to go

1071
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,679
carry the message to the people that we

1072
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,919
don't know to turn them on like we were

1073
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:46,318
turned on so that we can all take over

1074
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,920
and I joke that Timothy Larry had it

1075
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,558
only two-thirds right where he used to

1076
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,440
say turn on tune in and drop out it's

1077
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,319
really turn on tune in and as you were

1078
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,440
saying take

1079
00:53:54,318 --> 00:54:00,759
over because that's what find the power

1080
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,200
James and we're not victims here we're

1081
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,880
really in control of Our Own Destiny and

1082
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,838
that's what can social R and we need

1083
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,400
more strong women like you in this

1084
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:12,639
movement and I admire you so much and

1085
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,318
thank you for being so supportive Mark

1086
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,719
and thank you for changing your mind I

1087
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,798
wouldn't have liked you so much that I

1088
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,480
met you in high school obviously but

1089
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:23,519
high school thank you congratul

1090
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,760
fantastic I have a question from the

1091
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,400
public I have many questions but I can I

1092
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,920
hope okay I'll get to that later on but

1093
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,280
a message for question for you Jody uh

1094
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,200
do you think there's still more s stigma

1095
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,160
surrounding woman smoking than

1096
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,358
[Music]

1097
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:41,239
men I don't think there's so much of

1098
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,480
stigma but women have always been looked

1099
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:45,838
to as the nurturers the caretakers they

1100
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:48,719
give birth they raise children the men

1101
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:52,000
help them you know I it's a group effort

1102
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:53,679
um I just think in general people ask

1103
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,519
why are women under representing the

1104
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:56,919
marijuana movement and I would say

1105
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:00,400
there's a fair argument under

1106
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:03,838
represented generally um but they do

1107
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,559
make up half of the game I mean it's it

1108
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,000
you could say it's a man's world but I

1109
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,680
tend to see everyone as an individual I

1110
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,679
mean every individual has their merits

1111
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,719
and there are men who stay at home and

1112
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,759
raise children and there are women who

1113
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:17,679
don't take care of kids so you you you

1114
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,680
can't make these generalizations but it

1115
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,480
is fair to say that throughout human

1116
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:26,279
history women have taken care of the

1117
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,199
home while the men go out and do work

1118
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,319
work Gathering and whatever or hunting

1119
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,719
you know but even in terms of working

1120
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,920
women are only recently recently entered

1121
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,719
into the workforce so women have been

1122
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,280
there to back the men while they go out

1123
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,159
and do so even right now today there are

1124
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,960
a lot of men in the movement who go out

1125
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:46,078
and their women help take care at home

1126
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,000
but so many women are active these days

1127
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,000
so many women are out there I mean if

1128
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,760
you want to go on Facebook or any of

1129
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,400
these group women are very powerfully

1130
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,880
involved so I don't think there's so

1131
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,000
much underrepresented as just

1132
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,200
it's kind of the way the world is you

1133
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,480
know men seem to take more of the

1134
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:07,279
prominent positions but battles shift

1135
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,880
can change one question uh from uh Mr

1136
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,359
Rolling

1137
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,200
Stone um if you could live your life

1138
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:18,358
over again what would you do

1139
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:21,239
something anything yeah I probably

1140
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:22,679
wouldn't have started pot TV if I knew

1141
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,439
it was going to cost me a million

1142
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:29,519
dollars over 6 years and make no Revenue

1143
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,280
you and but it turns out to be a

1144
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,358
historically really amazing thing we

1145
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,519
started January 1st 2000 I

1146
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:38,239
mean there are things I would do

1147
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,239
differently I would have spent every one

1148
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:43,439
of that $5 million I gave away on

1149
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:46,919
ballting issues instead of like a quar

1150
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,679
million uh I valid issues are the way to

1151
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,039
go I would have paid used every $5

1152
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:55,078
million if I had have really realized

1153
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:57,440
the good that can come from that prison

1154
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:00,000
I think it's the same for

1155
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,318
uh based on the handwriting

1156
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,119
uh did prison learn you any valuable

1157
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:06,119
lesson in life I

1158
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,720
can yeah is there anything that

1159
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,880
you prison brought you

1160
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,879
something yeah if you're a good person

1161
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,599
you'll be welcome

1162
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,079
anyway that's

1163
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,960
good meeting in 4 and A2 years I have

1164
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,839
nothing bad to say about my experience

1165
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,119
fellow inmates they were all they were

1166
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:29,038
great

1167
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,640
yeah I got to play with Incredible

1168
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,799
musicians who taught me how to play I

1169
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:36,000
knew nothing uh people were very kind to

1170
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:38,239
me I rarely ever heard an unkind word

1171
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,920
spoken to me in six prisons did you ever

1172
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:43,679
smoke a reer in prison not didn't even

1173
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:46,240
get near it because the punishment is

1174
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,719
too severe and I I actually had no

1175
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,759
desire to get high in that four and a

1176
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:51,519
half

1177
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,119
years no in prison because I'm in the

1178
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:56,280
present tense I didn't really think much

1179
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,880
about anything beyond my own confin so

1180
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,000
that was all the books I was reading the

1181
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,960
magazines I was reading The

1182
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,639
Correspondents I was writing uh I was

1183
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,599
very much in the present moment I wasn't

1184
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:07,838
thinking about what I had done or where

1185
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,039
I was going or what was coming only in

1186
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:13,619
the present moment Mr alen wait wait

1187
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:14,920
we'll get to Mr alen now uh I by the

00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:17,960
[Music]

1189
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,119
way also knows do you know something

1190
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,798
about prisons

1191
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:25,880
too you can't hear me or

1192
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:29,599
not you know the thing is like I said

1193
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:31,680
you know know uh like you make a joke

1194
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,920
about it and I like the joke you know

1195
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:41,798
but we could be all like we convicts we

1196
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:47,480
ex EXs what and but it yeah and you know

1197
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:49,440
what and that the terrible irony of it

1198
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:53,440
is there's so many people in prison

1199
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:57,000
still now I I just met two beautiful

1200
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,720
young kids and they're going for 25

1201
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,480
years or I don't know what and I I

1202
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:04,159
cannot give you the details but it's

1203
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,199
it's it's amazing that people go in

1204
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:09,558
prison and there's so many people in

1205
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:11,798
prison and we got out and I was lucky I

1206
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:14,240
was only busted more than 80 times and I

1207
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:18,038
didn't do more than 6 weeks the longest

1208
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:20,798
but many more than 80 but I was in

1209
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:23,760
Holland and I was lucky to do no more

1210
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:26,159
than 6 weeks and then I do 3 weeks and

1211
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,359
two weeks and 5 days and 10 days and

1212
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,399
community service and all the [ __ ] you

1213
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:32,519
know but that that but in other

1214
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,920
countries you know in the world people

1215
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:36,759
still go to prison for you know you look

1216
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,159
in the museum you have a Str of lives

1217
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:43,240
from Mickey and and Chris Conrad a long

1218
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,519
time ago and so that's a tragedy so we

1219
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:48,279
we we can and it should be light we we

1220
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:51,000
stoned and ey and it's an event you know

1221
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,798
but we should be taking the seriousness

1222
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,760
of our activism because there's people

1223
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:59,199
in jail there and they shouldn't be

1224
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,960
there for a p and that is the anger or

1225
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:04,480
the the the heart where we come from

1226
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:08,960
that is what we do all

1227
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:11,039
right a little iry irony oh irony yeah

1228
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,400
in Colorado and Washington where we've

1229
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,960
declared victories no one's been let

1230
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,079
off any cannabis offenses in either of

1231
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,920
those two states and while it's nice

1232
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,039
that we feel like we're not slaves

1233
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:25,639
anymore we can't turn our backs to the

1234
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:28,520
people that still rotten in jail as

1235
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:30,519
slaves and that's really what I walked

1236
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:32,719
away from prison realizing a lot of good

1237
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:35,480
people go to prison in America they got

1238
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:37,199
25% of the world's prison population and

1239
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,639
a lot of those people are nonviolent

1240
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,159
offenders that were just trying to get

1241
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:43,318
high because their High wasn't alcohol

1242
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:45,960
and tobacco their I was one of the the

1243
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:50,079
other drugs that were not legal so we we

1244
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,639
can't really stop trying to to to see

1245
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,359
equal rights until we've really released

1246
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:55,598
the people that have already been locked

1247
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,719
up for things that shouldn't have been

1248
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,720
crime in the first

1249
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:09,798
place before we get to uh Mr update Mr

1252
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:18,279

1253
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:20,719
yes maybe we can have short break but

1254
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,839
but I just want to ask you because what

1255
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:25,118

the people who did something or who give

1294
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:15,519

1296
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:23,440
literally spent days in this Museum uh

Ben and me and all ay my brothers so

1299
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:36,680
Albert so many people and and we thought

1300
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:39,960
of one question actually for you uh Alan

1301
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:42,919
and um you're forgetting about it but I

1302
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:46,838
really would like to know um what would

1303
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:51,200
be your most interesting finding in in

1304
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:54,358
in Canabis history because I I'm very

1305
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,639
curious to the answer okay that's true

1306
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:57,639
I yes

1307
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:03,358
Mr Professor please

1308
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:06,519
answer you know that that was a question

1309
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:09,159
I heard it before and it's very very

1310
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:11,159
hard to answer there's there's so many

1311
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,519
beautiful things about this plant and I

1312
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:16,960
think that the true answer is that most

1313
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:19,759
beautiful thing is the plant itself

1314
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,159
because that is what inspired Us in all

1315
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,920
these years to make this collection here

1316
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:27,519
and make the museum in

1317
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:30,798
Barcelona and inspired us to start a h

1318
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:34,400
Factory and start do all these things

1319
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:38,038
that we are doing today

1320
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,760
and um what is the most beautiful about

1321
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:43,760

1322
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:47,039

1323

1324
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,839

1330
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:08,119
but we have we know where it comes from

1331
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:10,920
we know you know the passion behind and

1332
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:12,920
it's uh it's beautiful it's just if if

1333
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,760
people are able if you're ever in Spain

1334

in Barcelona please visit the museum

1335
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,278

01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:23,960
Museum on that side and here the hemp

1337
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:27,519
Gallery but there we have yeah my father

1338
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:31,880
has created such a wonderful space that

1339
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,880
wonderful Museum should all check it

1340
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:42,480
out I'd like to make a

1341
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:45,720
comment the fact that we are in a newsum

1342
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:48,358
now marijuana is in the news a lot right

1343
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:50,480
now because legalization is happening

1344
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:52,598
politically but we also know that

1345
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,400
worldwide or particularly North America

1346
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:57,039
there's a baby boom there's an aging

1347
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,720
population and medical marijuana is

1348
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:03,559
becoming more and more popular as well

1349
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:06,078
but once they stop arresting people once

1350
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:08,798
we're really done with that once they

1351
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:11,400
look at it as a massive human rights

1352
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:13,880
violation and they start apologizing for

1353
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,760
it in some way people are going to say

1354
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:18,920
tell us more about this plant tell us

1355
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,680
more about what it does because

1356
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,960
apparently it doesn't just make you feel

1357
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:26,239
better when you're sick it also holds

1358
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,920
the cure for cancer and so many elment

1359
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:31,078
it builds buildings that keep you warm

1360
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,519
in the winter and cool in the summer and

1361
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:37,400
remove pollution from the air this plant

1362
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:39,239
does so much and when people find out

1363
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,039
how much it does when they learn the

1364
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:43,000
history through the preservation of

1365
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,440
things like pot TV I'm glad you did pot

1366
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,519
TV and through things like the museum

1367
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,519
when people come and they find a history

1368
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:51,838
because it's been preserved they'll be

1369
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,239
kind of upset that they were lied to

1370
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:56,119
that's what happened to me I was really

1371
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:58,278
upset I was lied to about marijuana

1372
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:00,798
and that's why I changed my mind so

1373
01:07:58,278 --> 01:08:03,318
active because they're ruining lives

1374
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:05,440
they say it causes cancer and it cures

1375
01:08:03,318 --> 01:08:07,838
caner I mean there's so much ahead

1376
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,798
there's so much ahead so places like

1377
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:13,000
this that hold our history our cannabis

1378
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,719
culture history are valuable for

1379
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,439
hundreds of years to come because

1380
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,000
they're going to say they put people in

1381
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:21,919
prison for this they shock them for this

1382
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,759
they ruin children's lives for this

1383
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,759
plant look what it does so make sure you

1384
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:30,369
do we look at what it does because I'm

1385
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:33,560
continuously blowing away

1386
01:08:30,369 --> 01:08:33,559
[Music]

1387
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,679
[Applause]

1388
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:43,679
still but I know the weirdest marijuana

1389
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:45,440
fact in existence and I'll tell you um

1390
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,960
and this is a real change in tone

1391
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,678
actually um it's from Michael pollen's

1392
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,119
botney of Desire

1393
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,359
very and it's the idea of where we get

1394
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:57,079
the modern idea of the witch flying on a

1395
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:59,400
broom that's so Halloween it originates

1396
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:01,479
from the middle-aged practice of healing

1397
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:04,198
women known as witches sometimes but

1398
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:06,318
healers uh putting a dildo before them

1399
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:08,678
and putting a bunch of cannabis resin on

1400
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:10,560
it and inserting it right up the vagina

1401
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:12,359
which is mucous membrane that is very

1402
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,719
absorbent and then they would call it a

1403
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:16,239
flying ointment and then they would have

1404
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:18,798
outof body experiences for several hours

1405
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:20,639
and I bring that up only to point out

1406
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:25,519
that every time you see these children

1407
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,520
as witches you don't have to explain

1408
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:36,439
we we proposed a short break no because

1409
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:38,759
he's on his way right and I want to I

1410
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:41,678
want to make because because I have one

1411
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:46,039
more nice uh thing that I would like my

1412
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:47,480
father actually to talk about why why is

1413
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:49,560

it in this way uh he would like to you

1434
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,400
know the museum was small you need you

1435
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,560
need a larger Museum and in Amsterdam

1436
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:59,839
Now situation is that you don't get per

1437
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,920
all kind of re so that's why they open

1438
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,440
up a gallery But A G they're not allowed

1439
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,679
to make it into official music so it's

1440
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:09,639
called Gallery so you can buy this stuff

1441
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,840

1442
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:14,840
try

1443
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,840
