00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:26,879
welcome to Bubble man's world pretty

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,240
exciting again here today uh with new

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,599
genetics um I was going through my seed

5
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,159
collection the other day as I was going

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,719
to pop these seeds that subcool sent me

7
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,439
recently and I was peeling through all

8
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,760
these old collections in the fridge and

9
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,640
I got down to the bottom and I found

10
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,199
these two particular things now I found

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,239
an enormous amount of things in there

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,480
from the last 20 to 25 years that I've

13
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,799
been uh smoking cannabis and collecting

14
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,839
the seeds smoking hashish I should say

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,319
now it's been for the last 12 to 13

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,239
years I collected these particular seeds

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,439
um I have eight seeds here they're a

18
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:04,158
white seed very very light light colored

19
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:07,438
tan almost and I collected them in 1995

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,640
in Negril Orange Hill Jamaica West

21
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,758
Morland the furthest part of of uh of uh

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,079
the West Morland area Orange Hill for

23
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,280
any of you that are familiar

24
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,319
unbelievable ganja and this particular

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,719
ganja back then I remember when I was

26
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,599
smoking it it had made my mouth numb

27
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,920
with how much resin was seeping out of

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,759
the joint of course it was sungrown

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,519
tropical sungrown resin so it was it was

30
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,920
excellent quality but

31
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,719
basically the gentleman who had passed

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,320
it to me said that his friend from uh

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,158
Eugene Oregon had brought some really

34
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,839
nice seeds and they had uh bred them

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,118
with the local um Lamb's bread style

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,560
strain so it is indeed a lamb's bread

37
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:50,118
hybrid uh super excited to crack these

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,840
so we've got these little eight seeds

39
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,478
and I'm going to open this container I

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,600
haven't opened this little plastic

41
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,679
container for almost 20 years so I'm

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,879
just opening it right now and Out Come

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,200
the the seeds onto the plate they still

44
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:10,639
look like they're in growable shape now

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,199
um also I found from not quite as old

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,000
but around 96 97 there was a strain that

47
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,759
used to be quite prevalent back in

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,598
British Columbia in Vancouver here

49
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,479
called the hash plant when it was grown

50
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,878
to Perfection they often called it the

51
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:29,039
champagne hash plant and this was that

52
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:32,239
La style lime green Bud that sold itself

53
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,598
perfect you never saw any other grade

54
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,200
other than Perfection out of this strain

55
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:38,479
it was apparently clone only there was

56
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,000
never seeds available but out of all of

57
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,359
it that I ever saw I remember pulling

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,800
two seeds out of out of a bud and these

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,640
two seeds are right here with me now so

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,959
I just wanted to take you through my

61
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,238
method of uh cracking seeds and we're

62
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,039
going to see if it works for 20-year-old

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,239
seeds so I had called a couple of

64
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,799
different friends I talked to Matt the

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,719
great Gardener and he told me about a

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,480
trick that s had told him about about

67
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,878
putting putting it into a glass of water

68
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,518
which I had heard about uh myself as

69
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,079
well and letting the seeds float and uh

70
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,480
I guess once they sink you pull them out

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
and you plant them and that means the

72
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,399
seals cracked and that they're ready to

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,680
grow I personally am just more

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,519
comfortable for whatever reason with

75
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,439
doing what I always did and I always

76
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,920
just did the old paper the old paper

77
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,959
towel and plate moisten the paper towels

78
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,359
open it up throw the seeds inside and

79
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,438
then put this in a nice uh uh dark place

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,319
and hope for germination so that's what

81
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,239
we're going to do today here the seeds

82
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:41,318
look completely different so there's

83
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,239
really no worries on on mixing them up

84
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:45,000
uh show you with the lens there that

85
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,840
some of these seeds are

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,039
literally White and the couple of hash

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,000
plant ones are uh quite quite a bit

88
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,400
darker so we're going to put these all

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,360
in their little place you know give them

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,920
a little bit of space there there is an

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,519
excellent thing I found on on

92
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,639
seed uh germination and I'll put the

93
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,840
link in the

94
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,119
comments um I was really impressed with

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,319
this uh this particular post that I

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,959
found on seed uh germinating and it

97
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,519
really told a lot of the different

98
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,680
stresses that can help increase your

99
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,879
numbers of males which generally isn't

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,800
something you want so he's giving a list

101
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,639
of things to avoid uh simple things like

102
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,040
uh you know obviously don't uh crack

103
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,960
your seeds and allow them to get a

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,439
quarter of an inch to an inch long

105
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,560
before you plant them that shocks them

106
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,800
and that can produce males temperature

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,360
variances can produce males um uh the

108
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,960
lack of uh light he says that you want

109
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,919
your light right above your soil your

110
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,239
t5s when those seeds come out it's good

111
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,240
for them to have that light right there

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,038
uh if they have to stretch any amounts

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,600
if they're falling over this is another

114
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,478
thing that can produce males so I'll go

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,280
over a couple of these things in the

116
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,159
upcoming videos that I do about these

117
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,478
particular seeds and uh we'll let you

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,960
know what kind of female ratio we we get

119
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,240
because we've just cracked 3 four 5 yeah

120
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,079
so there's eight and two so we're going

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,879
to have 10 seeds total not a high number

122
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:11,359
of seeds by any by any

123
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:14,959
means you'd think we should get a

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,560
solid five uh five plus females so

125
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,079
they've got their place on the on the

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,280
paper towel I'm going to close that

127
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,879
paper towel up and we're going to mist

128
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,879
it get it nice and

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,399
moist and of course keep it moist don't

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,959
let it dry out that's a good way to uh

131
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,959
affect your seeds in a very negative

132
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,759
way so we just want to get this nice and

133
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,720
wet through and through not soften by

134
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,160
any means but still nice and wet and if

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,919
I open it up in the middle it's still

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,960
completely dry in here so we're going to

137
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,959
give some moisture in there

138
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,478
too

139
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,639
20-year-old

140
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,639
seeds let's see what you got for

141
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,038
us so feel free to you know add your

142
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,800
comments and your tips I know everyone's

143
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,000
got a way of doing this and I'm not

144
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,680
really promoting this as the only way to

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,560
do this by any means but it is the way

146
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,879
that I'm the most comfortable doing it

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,439
moisten this the paper towel uh I've got

148
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,879
a nice coal uh not Cal but you know not

149
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:36,759
warm at the same time either space for

150
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:41,279
this to be in the dark and just allow

151
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:44,720
for those seeds to uh to tap into that

152
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,918
natural mechanism of sprouting once we

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,520
produce the um conditions that it

154
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:54,240
requires really excited Jamaican Lamb's

155
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:57,240
bread hybrid and hash plant stay tuned

156
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,400
keep watching Bubble man's world and uh

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,400
have a great

158
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,399
day

159
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
hey

160
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
that's
