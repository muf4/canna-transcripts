00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,439
welcome to Bubble man's world here with

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,320
John H beer fellow on a beautiful puff

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,160
Wednesday thanks for coming out as

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,199
always

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,719
brother always a pleasure to have you

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,079
out here I guess today we're going to be

8
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,719
doing a little bit of dry sifting um I

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,160
did some dry sifting with d420 K last

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
week in Prince George and although I

11
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,159
thought it was going to be more of a

12
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,320
video where I would be involved I felt

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,839
that it was really cool to show d420

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,198
techniques that he's learned from uh

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,120
getting his res into a pure state but

16
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:55,198
today I wanted to go over really more

17
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,640
the technique that I shared with him

18
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,198
initially and uh show that you can

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,480
actually card a little bit harder than

20
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,319
what people think you can card I want to

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:09,000
really show the carding process um we'll

22
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,478
do an initial bounce with medic Haze no

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,840
this is actually um py headband oh it's

24
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,478
the headband okay great and that's this

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,640
right here

26
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,118
yeah I'll be able to take a good look at

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,439
it it's going to be the headband of the

28
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,040
Packy yeah so we got a I can't remember

29
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,279
little over a quarter pound anyway that

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,439
we're going to uh John will do his uh

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,478
gentle bounce over his screen I think

32
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,559
it's always nice to just let uh let the

33
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,359
grower do that initial bounce and get

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
that that is beautiful Triple A quads

35
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,359
whatever you call it yes number four

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
beautiful herb the sun really makes it

37
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,519
look good too we'll take a few shots for

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,879
you before we bounce this uh we'll say

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,840
we'll just put a couple of the nugs

40
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,560
aside first twoo off the top get a

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,079
couple of pictures and then we'll put

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,478
that over the screen and uh we'll go

43
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,559
through it's going to be a quick video

44
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:58,078
today of dry sifting um probably should

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,519
turn that Dil

46
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,839
on here we go get that going cuz I'm

47
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,239
sure we're going to need a denail hit

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,320
sooner than

49
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:09,840
later all right so we got the air

50
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:12,239
pressure pump pumped up to about 75 Psi

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,200
Psi yeah and uh we're going to just do a

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,560
quick clean on these screens cuz John's

53
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,598
noticed there's a little bit of resin on

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,120
them from last time and he wants his

55
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:24,560
resin uncontaminated so let's do it want

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,640
to actually hold this screen up for me

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,640
and I'll blow it through like this

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,920
perfect get that one down

59
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,560
there nice forced pressure you'll see

60
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,119
this one there's quite a bit of more

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
powder in

62
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,318
here you know it doesn't have to be

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,479
every single drop of powder but

64
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:01,199
just we'll use all the air we have here

65
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,679
I'd rather not turn the pump on so

66
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,679
but basically gives you an

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,799
[Music]

68
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,239
idea all all right so yeah that cleaned

69
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,519
us up a

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,519
bit can always use your hand as

71
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,560
well over it

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,598
too little bit of dust

73
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,360
falling that's aot little bit of resin

74
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,560
head everywhere you can see all these

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,159
little heads everywhere so this is our

76
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,799
70 Micron we're going to put on the

77
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,798
bottom if you want to pass me the

78
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,239
140 all

79
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,120
right we'll be back in a few seconds

80
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,319
when we put the herb on the

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,120
screen all right yeah just beautiful

82
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,199
nugget yeah well I'm bouncing all the

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,120
resin off yeah it's definitely you don't

84
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,078
want to play around in the bag too much

85
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,079
like that but that's uh that's really

86
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,719
nice

87
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,719
that was that

88
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,438
blond all right

89
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,438
well that's cold I'll tell you that much

90
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:13,078
may out

91
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:17,519
here chenel

92
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:20,519
bounce really really nice looking

93
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,519
herb

94
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,600
killing nice I'm quite happy

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,560
with you can even see the little resin

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,160
look at all the little balls there oh

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,079
yeah we got a few hair in here huh I

98
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,199
have cats yeah they usually find their

99
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,879
way in that's why we're getting rid of

100
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,680
all the Chafe hairs are going to have a

101
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,839
hard time getting their way through the

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,038
screen so what I normally do is I just

103
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,679
do

104
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:54,680
this many ways to extract the resin off

105
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,079
the buds and it's a personal choice and

106
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,079
it's directly related to also cleaning

107
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,758
of the resin you know the more gentle

108
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,639
you are the less cleaning you're going

109
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,879
to do the rougher you are I mean after

110
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,000
initially doing this you could get to

111
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,759
the point two or three sifts down the

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,600
line where you grind this into powder

113
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:18,160
and then you run it through a p a tumble

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,600
now or a tumbler um 4x2 screen basically

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,280
run it through screen as powder you get

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,560
a very very low grade

117
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,000
material but there's there's resin to be

118
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,720
had in there so there's a variety of

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
ways you can even funny enough I know

120
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,520
it's a misnomer and it goes against dry

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,479
sifting but you can actually make dry

122
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,240
sift large quantities of it and um run

123
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:40,800
it through bags afterwards I've seen it

124
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,079
run through through water of course

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
you're going to lose your water soluble

126
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,279
turpins and it will defeat a lot of the

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,038
fact but it's still an easy way to run a

128
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,079
large amount of product into a smaller

129
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,399
amount of product and then run that into

130
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:57,439
actual final product heads and for me

131
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,120
this is my favorite I do but I love the

132
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,519
foam melt fresh frozen this herbs just

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,280
beautiful in the Sun the the the colors

134
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,478
and stuff I'm going pull like my phone

135
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,239
out of my pocket and take a picture do

136
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,560
it do it but even look this see all this

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,038
that's I was talking about like how can

138
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,478
I harvest just those look at all those

139
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,879
heads mhm cuz they're not going to go

140
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,598
through the screen so those are actually

141
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,598
a bigger head

142
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,080
totally it almost looks like little

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,079
granulars of

144
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:31,038
sugar they are going yeah see so it's

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,279
cing a lot heavier as and that's what

146
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,759
this is all about today showing people

147
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,799
that there's a different way to do it

148
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,000
you're being so gentle here you're not

149
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,639
cting the actual heads through they're

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,959
trapped in there so we just do a little

151
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,160
bit of cting you know not too much cuz

152
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,359
there is a lot of contaminant in there

153
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,479
but definitely enough for sure this is

154
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,560
140 microns green there's definitely the

155
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:59,800
potential that you know all the 160 all

156
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,038
140 or 150 heads in bigger will end up

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,639
staying on top of the screen but

158
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,318
generally our favorite heads aren't in

159
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,759
that range anyway our favorite range is

160
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,720
between

161
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:13,840
120 140 and

162
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,319
70 oh yeah I love I always love just

163
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,399
that first bounce I know it fell through

164
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,199
there that's what I collect right away

165
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,038
and then I start slowly breaking down

166
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
these buts excellent so I want to grab

167
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:27,279
that first bounce yeah absolutely other

168
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,598
than this little piece right

169
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,679
yeah can I see be okay what do you think

170
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:33,680
take a look underneath there for a

171
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,520
second cuz we're going to like take a

172
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,680
hit of this right now we're going to get

173
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,680
to work it is a hit it is isn't it

174
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,918
that's what I mean it's that first

175
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,120
bounce it's like the best of the best

176
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,560
you going to pick it up so I can put the

177
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,319
screen back down awesome just like that

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,439
beautiful beautiful all right so yeah

179
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,639
load her up that looks beautiful nice

180
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,879
gentle sift you can see from 100 G you

181
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,598
got

182
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,800
about one maybe two

183
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,878
rips of this so when you're going gentle

184
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,240
you're obviously being extremely

185
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,400
inefficient in your extraction rate

186
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,800
you're going for the the nicest heads

187
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,878
that you can

188
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,520
get however at one point we're also

189
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,240
going to show you getting this herb down

190
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,198
to a better State and getting it

191
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,560
actually you know some product run

192
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
through here and then once we have that

193
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,158
we'll get back into the cing you know it

194
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,000
does take a while so we're not going to

195
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:36,038
show you the 40 minutes that it takes me

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,559
to clean but in a half an hour to 40

197
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,319
minutes I can clean a nice little pile

198
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:43,599
of dry sift with the cing technique and

199
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,680
get a nice melting uh bubbly final

200
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,800
product so

201
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,759
yeah look at that herb right there on

202
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,759
camera so

203
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,879
um so basically I'll change spots with

204
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,200
you and I'll hit the it's um hit the

205
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,480
we're going to grab a couple nice buds

206
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,480
out of

207
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:11,679
here just random some randoms just some

208
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,720
randoms all

209
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,720
right denail rips in the sunshine

210
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,278
and the

211
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,278
rest as you can even see it just

212
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,720
flaking very

213
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,320
nice I love that when you break it's

214
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,519
nice and cold out here so when you break

215
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,640
you can just see the dust can hear snap

216
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,240
too yeah nice and dry

217
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,559
sign's nice and just like so basically

218
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,759
John's going to do this for a a little

219
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,679
while longer we're going to um come back

220
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,240
at the point where we've got resin to

221
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,439
work with on the bottom screen cuz

222
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,639
that's really the part I want to show

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,519
you today so we'll be back uh right away

224
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,439
so just getting a little rougher now

225
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,720
with the with the herb John's worked the

226
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,880
pile of uh smaller debris worked it down

227
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,920
the way I was showing um carted it out

228
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,519
and now he's got the the smaller nuggets

229
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,879
out and he's going to be you know doing

230
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,600
a little bit more bouncing you know we

231
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,200
will probably get to the point with this

232
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,278
if John wants to get get all the resin

233
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,519
off of it where we will like powderize

234
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,879
this this this this herb and we'll

235
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,399
tumble it for not too too long but for

236
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,679
certainly long enough that we're certain

237
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,958
that we've gotten all the glands out and

238
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,958
then um and then at that point I'll

239
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,239
probably clean that resin for John cuz

240
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,719
that kind of resin it becomes extremely

241
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,039
difficult to clean uh when you got 10%

242
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,560
uh heads versus 90% contaminant

243
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:01,559
sometimes even higher but uh

244
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,199
uh we'll get to our secondary carding

245
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,679
real soon

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,920
sweet my hand

247
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,919
this nice

248
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,559
resin most people wear gloves but I like

249
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,559
to touch my

250
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,278
resin son of

251
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,278
DK 420s res right

252

Dil really sweet the way they're

256

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,560

260

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,120
more of that uh

266
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,560
wizard

267
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,560
rander to

268
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,799
left-hander oh what a perfect drop that

269
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,199
was ladies and

270
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:30,198
gentlemen it's got a nice little slit in

271
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:31,919
this particular carb cap so it just uh

272
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,240
just lets you keep taking a perfect hit

273
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,240
without

274
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,679
really much

275
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,759
worry sure's a beautiful day out here

276
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,918
[Music]

277
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:25,078
for as mildly chilly that it

278
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:27,519
is cuz you're explaining it so just uh

279
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,039
when you do this initial Harvest of

280
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,679
resin heads you get dirt

281
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,480
but we can clean this and you can see

282
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,399
underneath that there's there's stuff

283
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,959
that's worth having but it's still quite

284
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,600
dirty so we spread it as thin as we

285
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,879
can and you end up left with a cleaner

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,879
and cleaner product see how clean I got

287
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:51,120
this one right here in a real quick

288
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:53,480
hurry a lot a lot compared to well I

289
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,639
think there's a decent

290
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,800
amount and so then we gently card we

291
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,159
don't want to push through a ton of

292
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:03,399
contaminant but we want those

293
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:06,078
heads and they just need a little bit of

294
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,078
help to go

295
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,519
through yes vibration would be helpful

296
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,919
in this particular instance vibration

297
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,278
tumbling any of these varieties are

298
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,559
going to be helpful for

299
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,559
extracting all right so we've gotten

300
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,758
that quar pound broken down nicely into

301
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,359
smaller

302
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,360
buds getting smaller and smaller as John

303
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,000
works it it's it's a good idea as he

304
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,759
does this to set like at this point I

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,320
would have him separate the nugs out get

306
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,519
all his nugs separated out and do

307
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,399
another one of those gentle carings over

308
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,799
the dust that's left and separate the

309
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,799
cha from that dust card that dust

310
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,838
through card that dust through and then

311
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,319
uh move to the next level I would have

312
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,279
gave in

313
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,480
because that's just what you do with

314
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:55,480
it's money

315
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,879
we realized

316
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:14,318
[Music]

317
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,839
I'm gently you know I'm not really

318
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:17,838
crushing them kind of more

319
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,278
gently these nugs still have a tiny bit

320
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,159
of

321
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,480
moisture sitting for a for dry sift I

322
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,278
guess if we knew 100% that that we would

323
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,240
have dry sifted this we should have had

324
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,639
a sit on it would have been out and dry

325
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,799
I said that the whole time but it is

326
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,318
still dry don't get me wrong no I can

327
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:40,078
see that it shouldn't be this I like

328
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,439
we're going to dry SI that one day I

329
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,078
said we're going to crush that whole

330
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,920
thing and that's what we're doing what I

331
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:50,719
want to do except for those Medicine Man

332
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,719
huh your medicine oh why wouldn't

333
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:02,959
you I won't be else

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,958
I might also do it myself

335
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,799
if it makes it over here it's

336
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,720
going no problem and will we run that

337
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:57,119
through the tumbler later or oh sure why

338
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,279
not prob take down take everything

339
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,918
from I got so I tried doing that and

340
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:05,319
that's what I have in that little jar is

341
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,320
I took up some of this but the other

342
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,918
stuff all right so you want to just

343
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,480
clean that herb up off the screen yeah

344
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,000
it's pretty much down to nothing we'll

345
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,000
get down to our next screen

346
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,480
yeah tiny little popcorn tiny tiny

347
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,640
little these little hard bugs work

348
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,159
really well for

349
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,440
missing definitely when doing the

350
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,080
secondary screen and we start cting you

351
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,960
don't want to wear a long sleeve shirt

352
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,879
like John's wearing you can see his cuff

353
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,319
going in the herb each time he picks it

354
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,120
up and that's just uh for the herb it's

355
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,558
not a big deal it will get fibers in

356
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:51,079
there but um for the I personally don't

357
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,759
I just would wear a short sleeve shirt

358
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:56,480
if you could otherwise um like you said

359
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,440
earlier the gloves and uh just any way

360
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
to secure the material and keep it as

361
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,240
clean as

362
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,600
possible Right you want to give the

363
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,480
final screen a wipe before you lift it

364
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,480
yeah a blow even

365
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,240
better this quite a bit one thing I've

366
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,359
realized is you always get a little bit

367
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,759
of flakes on your body and stuff and you

368
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,959
lift it up

369
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,759
and it gets full so I'm just going to

370
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,259
actually pick this up and move the

371
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,390
screen over here

372
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:29,390
[Music]

373
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:51,519
give this card a quick

374
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,519
clean there use all the

375
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,120
cards how's the color looking looks

light should we photograph it with the

378
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,158
uh macro lens before we oh you should

379
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,359
yeah move it all off the screen do a

380
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,559
closeup as I'm ping this in we'll do a

381
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,558
quick

382
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,679
one how's the color looking looks

383
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,038
beautiful yeah nice and

384
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,840
light should we photograph it with the

385
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,599
uh macro lens before we oh you should

386
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,918
yeah off the screen do a closeup as I'm

387
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,480
ping this in we'll do a quick

388
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:41,200
one okay

389
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,200
so collected our

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,720
sift single screen we've done a small

391
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:55,079
amount of macro photography on uh on

392
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,079
what's here

393
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,019
[Music]

394
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,558
nice pile of near I would say it's a

395
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,558
good 50%

396
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:20,558
heads

397
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:27,119
50% not heads so because we're

398
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,558
collecting this to flip to the other

399
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,918
side of the screen I want to I want to

400
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,480
get the shadow out of the way so I'm

401
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,120
going to put this on the other side of

402
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,079
the

403
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,000
screen got a plate

404
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,480
there there you

405
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,919
go D

406
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
du D

407
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,519
du go for clean

408
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,798
one for that last

409
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,798
little little

410
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,969
[Music]

411
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,038
trickle all right so now we've got a

412
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,960
little bit more more in the Sun for you

413
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:35,359
guys so you can see this is our I want

414
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,200
to grab those two for a second this one

415
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:41,158
one here sure go ahead clean the whole

416
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,038
screen do do 20 like it's if if you see

417
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,480
dirt get her clean cuz we definitely

418
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:50,720
don't want to um put beautiful hash down

419
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,400
on a dirty screen so like John just

420
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,839
pointed out if you see a hair you see

421
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,440
anything this is the time where taking

422
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,439
your time is a worthwhile

423
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,759
look at that beautifully stuck to the

424
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:10,000
plate not moving at all good sign right

425
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,440
off the bat considering you guys know

426
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,759
how powdery this

427
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,360
is we're going to be carting it so I

428
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:20,359
like it to somewhat fall back on the

429
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,359
screen

430
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,989
[Music]

431
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,679
get all of that off there blowing a

432
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:38,759
little wind in the in the

433
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,679
hash

434
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,480
so now we're going to do our carting in

435
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,440
order to do our carting Technique we

436
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:51,440
want to we want to card a small amount

437
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,519
at a time nice small amount at a time

438
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,519
you can hear the sound the resin is

439
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,519
definitely

440
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,599
prevalent and then you can everyone in a

441
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,159
while get in a larger amount if you want

442
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,759
to feel the difference on the

443
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,840
efficiencies of if you feel like a small

444
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,519
amounts just taking too long try a

445
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,918
larger amount and you'll see that it's

446
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,599
actually going to slow you down even

447
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,200
more

448
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:20,959
so I usually

449
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,120
separate my grade my initial from what I

450
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,000
carred uh this is when it's nice to have

451
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,989
one of those brushes that d420 K has as

452
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,058
well very nice little cards to have

453
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,058
[Music]

454
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:36,519
we're going to push through

455
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,679
contaminants and we're going to push it

456
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,158
a good amount of it through I don't

457
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,120
doubt which is always the case and

458
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,200
because it's cold right now so it's

459
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,079
actually working quite

460
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:53,759
nicely can even see it somewhat sticking

461
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,759
the contaminant sticking in the

462
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,679
screen so basically this is a process

463
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,159
that we'll do

464
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,320
uh until we can get the resin as clean

465
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:08,200
as possible and I've shown this on

466
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:10,558
camera before I've shown this process of

467
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,919
basically carting this resin back and

468
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:13,678
forth back and forth and you'll see that

469
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,880
you're

470
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,640
losing

471
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,520
quantity and you're gaining

472
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,159
quality so I'm going to work this small

473
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,519
pile of resin I'll be carting for the

474
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:30,679
next oh I'd say 35 to 45 minutes easy

475
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:34,119
and I'll bring this down to a much

476
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,679
cleaner pure product and it already

477
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,839
looks really much whiter than the gold

478
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,480
pile that I have over here when you're

479
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,038
cleaning off the little pieces there's

480
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,798
these little pieces that will gather up

481
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,839
on your cards here you want to clean

482
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,918
those up you want to keep them out of

483
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,240
your hash keep them over to the side

484
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,840
they're a nice quality and they're

485
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,440
definitely not to be thrown away but

486
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,000
there's something that uh will

487
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,159
definitely mess up the carting process

488
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,919
good so so I'll continue on cleaning and

489
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:07,919
carting and we'll come back and show you

490
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,919
the final product and do a little puff

491
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:15,240
down all right welcome back guys we're

492
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:16,558
uh Sun H sun has set and I'm not sure if

493
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,038
I'm going to show it to you before the

494
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,359
video or right at the last thing but it

495
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:22,480
was definitely a beautiful sunset some

496
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,759
nice orange color in there it was quite

497
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,440
ni and then uh we cleaned up some of

498
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,119
this dryft so we have a few different

499
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,720
piles you can kind of see the different

500
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:32,278
uh colors this one looks pretty top

501
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,720
grade right here we'll probably have a

502
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:38,519
few rips of that um that was a lot of

503
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,399
cing whole lot of caring carted for

504
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:45,038
probably an

505
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:46,759
hour and this is what we've got so full

506
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,079
melt dry sip we'll show you some macro

507
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:51,398
shots as

508
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:55,678
well uh so let give you a pile of the of

509
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:55,678

510
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,879
all right here you go we've taken the

511
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:09,440
ceramic tip off for the time being it's

512
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,720
over here if you want it I want what's

513
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,240

nice and bubbly and melty how did that

516
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:44,640
taste oh it tastes so nice and smooth

517
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:47,918
nice all right well I'm going I'm going

518
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,919
to make the attempt on some of

519
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:59,240
that that's going I

520
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:59,240
needed oh there's The Taste now

521
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,200
wow that taste is

522
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,159
U very deep TK like

523
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,278
a it's

524
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,278
nice very nice

525
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:26,798
yeah that was beautiful flowers like

526
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,798
about an hour and a bit ago and now it's

527
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:32,278
just like really

528
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:35,278
super tasty incredible dry

529
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,200
sift very good definitely a thumbs up

530
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,480
experience uh still more resin to be

531
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,960
taken off that herb it's by no means the

532
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,360
end of it this is what we call the cream

533
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,399
of the cream the Holy Grail hash you

534
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,038
could still run that bud through the wet

535
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,000
wash method and probably get four or

536
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,640
five or 6% return on it you could

537
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,240
definitely even after doing that run it

538
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,159
through a coconut oil soak it in coconut

539
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,240
oil and extract the last of the the

540
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,880
heads that are in there and just

541
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,159
continue to use the plant right down to

542
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,799
the last little bit so you get

543
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,159
everything we don't want people to think

544
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:10,480
of this is a waste but this is

545
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,640
definitely the next part for me is I

546
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,480
actually throw in a pot with some butter

547
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,679
and boil it down and make some nice for

548
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,120
for Edibles sure yeah exactly as long as

549
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,360
you're getting it with some sort of a

550
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,079
fat and you're extracting that last

551
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,038
little bit of resin then this is could

552
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,599
never be considered a waste it only is

553
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:31,679
to be considered uh something you do uh

554
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,959
in order to not sacrifice your best for

555
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,798
anything that you're doing I'm going to

556
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,480
bake my stuff in the oven excellent some

557
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:40,639
tin foil there you go well that doesn't

558
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,720
sound as good as extracting the heads

559
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,799
off with screens and puffing pu heads

560
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:51,200
very very definitely all

561
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,000
gone it's definitely um the last of the

562
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,640
last instead of throwing it away you

563
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
decarbox it exactly that's but uh I'm

564
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,600
not sure how much would be left if you

565
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,319
soaked it in butter oil but probably a

566
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,319
little bit butter and oil it goes into

567
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,798
garbage that's what I'm saying that's

568
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,960
the last little bit so hopefully you

569
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,480
guys have learned a little bit today

570
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,079
that you can card a little bit harder I

571
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,120
know I didn't show a long time I just

572
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,678
wanted to basically show you the force

573
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,959
that I was able to use that you want to

574
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,880
be in a colder environment um you don't

575
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,079
want to be in too warm of an environment

576
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,559
when you're dry sifting and uh yeah

577
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,519
happy sifting let us know how you're

578
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:30,470
doing in the comments we'll uh talk to

579
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:34,690
you guys later see

580
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,690
