12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,359
little session with uh a little bit of

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,039
rosin that I squeezed out earlier from

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,359
some older hash and some really

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,640
beautiful West Coast concentrate uh

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,558
rosin that they passed on my way some of

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,000
the dragon breath which you got to taste

18
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,358
it was delicious not bad we also have

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,960
that freeze-dried bubble somewhere

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,439

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,400
but today actually uh first we have to

22
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,519
tell you we're on the smallest [ __ ]

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,759
deck you could ever possibly imagine

24
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,759
we're so jammed in trying to fit into

25
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,759
the screen that it's actually quite

26
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,640
hilarious uh we're literally what would

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,719
you say like 50 ft from The Whistler

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,680
downhill mountain bike uh course yeah

29
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,039
they keep going by yeah and maybe about

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,880
100 ft from The Whistler Gondola and the

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,280
Whistler villag is just in behind us

32
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,199
here I'll give you a little bit of bee

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,599
footage later in the video but today

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,399
what I actually wanted to talk about is

35
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,798
the

36
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,280
Sasquatch um not sasquash resin press

37
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,320
rosin press but the

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,320
Sasquatch zip Tre zip line that goes

39
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,519
from the blackholm mountain over to

40
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,039
Whistler Mountain it's apparently over 2

41
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,359
km long um I think you go upwards of

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,079
close to 100 km an hour on that bloody

43
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:57,280
thing flying across the uh mountain side

44
00:01:53,078 --> 00:02:00,359
at 7,000 ft in uh 7,000 vertical feet

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,680
that you that you cover super stoked and

46
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,200
figured uh maybe we'd hit a few dabs

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,159
with you guys while we laugh about the

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,439
small deck that we're on you had to see

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,920
it when we were trying to set up the

50
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,400
camera knocking this knocking that torch

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,958

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,239

then we'll go hit that zip line think

72
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,359

73
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,359
have a GoPro so I should be able to take

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560
course afterwards we'll have another

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,360

212
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,838
changed my shirt zip lining was a little

213
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,439
bit sweaty and a little bit insane but

214
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,120
holy Christ I'm telling you if you guys

215
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,959
are coming up to Whistler you'd be well

216
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,198
off to check out the Sasquatch zip Trek

217
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,919
uh tour it's very short in the sense

218
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,838
that it takes you know about an hour an

219
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,039
hour and a half of your day to get there

220
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,839
and do the thing learn and put the

221
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,240
harness on and then travel in the van

222
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,399
and all of that stuff takes a little bit

223
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
of time but the zip line itself is a

224
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
minute and 30 seconds you're going like

225
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,680
100 km an hour hour you're traveling 2

226
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,959
km distance it's unbelievable how uh how

227
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,799
fast it is so I figured I'd end the

228
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:42,319
video as I end all the bubble man videos

229
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,439

259
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,199
variet of kilometers under our belts and

260
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,000
it was just beautiful getting to all

261
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,679
these different little areas and Vistas

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,120
and Lookout points you just uh can't get

263
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,799
enough of it with Whistler so watching

264
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,839
the mountain bikers finish their day

265
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,799
right here as I sit next on Whistler

266
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,920
Mountain in fact while the gondola goes

267
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,240
by me and the mountain bikers are flying

268
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,719
by at high speeds it's uh reminds me

269
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,480
that people celebrate life in places

270
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,480
like Whistler it's really a celebration

271
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,680
of life there's a lot of dangerous

272
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,639
things to do and you got to pay

273
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,958
attention but at the same time it's a

274
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,000
