today giving you guys a little bit more

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,759
of a tease of some of my life up in

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,558
Whistler and in the pton area Back

7
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,320
Country I had uh quite a few uh emails

8
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,599
and messages from you guys uh asking me

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,600
about different different concepts and

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,640
you know asking me where I ride where

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,439
what kind of sled I ride and what you

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,280
know whether I do the ice climbing

13
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,238
whether I do crampons what what kind of

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,679
split boarding and so I kind of wanted

15
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,679
to give you guys a little background um

16
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,878
I've been doing back country photography

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,960
up in Whistler for the last four or five

18
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,159
years uh not professionally by any means

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,558
but really more as a hobby just whatever

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,478
gets me out there uh I get to ride with

21
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,640
awesome Riders uh got a really good crew

22
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,560
for the uh for the snowmobiling aspect

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
my buddy Ryan NAD who you may or may not

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,118
have seen in my Facebook feed but he is

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
uh kind of one of my mentors in the sled

26
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,799
world and he sort of brought me under

27
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,280
his wing and took me in and brought me

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,280
to some of these amazing places that I'm

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,400
going to show you today and today I'm

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,719
just going to do three-part clip uh

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,280
three different clips I'm going to add

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,640
into this video and I'll talk a little

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,599
bit before each one um but the the area

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,519
is Rutherford Creek it's the pton ice

35
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,359
caps and it's about maybe 10 minutes uh

36
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,959
south of pton and maybe 20 25 minutes

37
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,799
north of Whistler on the SE to Sky

38
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,718
Highway uh there's a creek bed there and

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
there's a sort of little turn in parking

40
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:52,199
lot on the right side and the left side

41
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,239
and I think now they're actually um um

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,478
plowing the road so you end up paying 15

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,478
or 20 bucks each time you go up there as

44
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,840
the road is fairly long and so after

45
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,399
driving up to Whistler pton area takes

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,039
me an hour an hour and a half from my

47
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,920
house takes me another 45 to an hour

48
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,439
just to get the sled off the truck and

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,560
get ridden up into the Alpine uh and

50
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,280
then that's where we're going to start

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,640
this video today so this video the first

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,110

just you go

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,840
to and

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,100
[Music]

93
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,560
don't all right so that was an

94
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,520
absolutely beautiful video you have to

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,439
admit some of that fresh powpow you may

96
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,120
not have seen Ryan and Chris till the

97
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,519
end of the video they were quite a bit

98
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720
ahead of me and you could see the few

99
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,038
tracks that were ahead of me uh were

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,800
theirs so once we got up onto the top of

101
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,439
that Ridge we ended up dropping down to

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,800
the right uh driving a little bit more

103
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,719
uh on the sleds up into the ice caps and

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,960
then we found a really nice little sort

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,800
of open face um Mountain that we were

106
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,638
able to drive up on our sleds ride up on

107
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,560
our sleds jump off St tra you know put

108
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,400
the boards on put the skis on and then

109
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,199
send the sleds down ghost riding uh

110
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,159
ghost riding is really only possible

111
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,280
when there's no trees or rocks or

112
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,919
crevasses that are potentially going to

113
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,079
be in between you and where you're

114
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,399
sending the sled it does still feel a

115
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,719
little sketchy to do but I'll tell you

116
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,279
when you just rip down on your on your

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,720
snowboard and then your sled's just

118
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,879
sitting there it is one of the just most

119
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,360
beautiful thing so this is me

120
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:46,159
snowboarding up on Rutherford Creek just

121
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,160
a real quick clip

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,039
enjoy oh

123
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:55,038
yes

124
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,638
again on highest the

125
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,038
highest looking at me eyes so red

126
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,478
because head people always ask me say

127
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,159
why you so humble I don't smoke Co

128
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:16,159
that's why I don't

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,918
Grumble stly s

130
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,399
me

131
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,279
[Music]

132
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,279
must be burned like

133
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,439
must all right well that was kind of fun

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,400
a little bit of slow motion there where

135
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,279
you can kind of see the the the power

136
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,598
and the speed that I'm actually going by

137
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,559
first slowing it down and when the slow

138
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,360
motion turned to fast motion which was

139
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,038
really just regular life it seemed like

140
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,680
I was Trucking pretty good I'd say a

141
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:04,759
solid 70 km an hour or 5050 M an hour

142
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,598
for my American Breen out there I think

143
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,120
it's time for a rip we've watched two

144
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,079
clips and I haven't hit one so I'm going

145
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,280
to hit three rips right now starting

146
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,279
with

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,800
this so yeah Rutherford Creek is where

148
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm going to try and bring you guys

149
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,319
again this winter I've got plans to go

150
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
up there this is the area where we H

151
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,720
where we found the ice cave so we

152
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,160
definitely want to show you guys the ice

153
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,160
cave this

154
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,079
year I've teased and threatened probably

155
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,959
two or three times in my videos that I'm

156
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,478
going to be making hash in the pton ice

157
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,638
caps up in the ice

158
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,918
cave I'm not going to share a video of

159
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,478
the ice cave today cuz literally I want

160
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,359
you guys to see it For the First Time

161
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,038
Fresh when we show up with the hash

162
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,038
screens and the bags and and all

163
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,319
that probably one of my most excited

164
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:13,799
projects that uh oh jeez that's really

165
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,800
going isn't it I better finish my

166
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,959
rip all

167
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,839
right put a little more in there than I

168
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,478
thought all right so that was number one

169
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,158
let's have a quick number two we got

170
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:35,519
some really nice Astro Boy

171
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:39,918
here sitting out on the card uh 73

172
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,918
Micron um well cured 6 months

174
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,000
stuffo I'll tell you that hit right

175
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,600
there

176
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,000
that's a hit that you take a few seconds

177
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
after you

178
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,519
rip

179
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:13,000
beautiful and maybe one more of this

180
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,639
very nicely aged cure now the first hit

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I took was actually the CBD Renee

182
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:24,480
pressed out into a lovely disc pancake

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,639
Patty whatever you would like to call it

184
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,278
the second rip was the Astro Boy that's

185
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,639
out here on the card very little left of

186

that

187
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,559
and then the final one is going to be

188
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,159
this really old Hindu cush that I have

189
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,838
this stuff is old like I'm going to say

190
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,399
older than 5

192
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,278
about an a cured bubble is when I drop
