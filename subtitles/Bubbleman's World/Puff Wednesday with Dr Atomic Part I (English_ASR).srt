00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:19,539
[Music]

2
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,879
hey guys welcome back to Bubble man's

3
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,198
world doc Atomic is back in the house

4
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,278
how you doing super good to see you

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,000
again dude yeah [Â __Â ] that was a good

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,839
that was a great video a couple of

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,039
videos I spliced it into one yeah I know

8
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,558
we spliced it into one I was kind of in

9
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:38,159
a hurry I didn't know what to expect we

10
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,679
were there for hours of things in your

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,199
defense I think I had blown through at

12
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,200
least 3 hours of your time that on that

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,680
day oh really well you stayed for

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,760
probably close to 3 hours yeah oh my God

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:53,719
I know I thought it was like 20 minutes

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,839
anyway so what have you been up to since

17
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,518
last we well I brought a few gifts for

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,760
you and um gifts gifts from the doctor

19
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,798
yeah well as as you people out there in

20
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,478
gangel land probably know I've been

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,880
associated with the Northern Lights this

22
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:14,438
is one of my favorite one of the uh

23
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,879
there's there's many fenos of course

24
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:23,478
generation to generation cousins uh

25
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:26,599
sisters Etc this particular one is very

26
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:30,879
interesting in the fact that it it show

27
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:34,239
it when it it it has a classic

28
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:38,359
Afghani uh finish to it so you'd expect

29
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:42,078
it to smell skunky but it smells Super

30
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:45,118
Lemon super Citrus which is a recessive

31
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:50,438
gene from a sativa past so what you've

32
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:55,319
got is a short Afghani type Afghani

33
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:58,359
plant M fairly quick flowering uh 8 to n

34
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:02,319
weeks beautiful lemon

35
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,759
Aroma uh in incredible High coming in

36
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,839
from both the recessive sativa genes I'm

37
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,800
suspecting yeah and and the dominant

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
Afghani jeans which is showing in the

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,959
structure of the plan and so for the

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
people that don't really know cuz I'm

41
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,199
sure you've got your Google but the

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,560
northern lights and and Doc mentioned it

43
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,359
last time a little bit in the video I

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,360
believe that it's it's this classic

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,400
afghan that they then bred

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,319
into um all these exotic sativas that

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,159
were coming in probably Colum I

48
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,119
cambodians and that's right of the day I

49
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,759
mean it's it's hard to nail down exactly

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,680
which SAS they were since this occurred

51
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,719
you know in the 70s and people were

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,920
keeping bag seed from these strains

53
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:50,158
these are the same sativas actually that

54
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,799
be became named hay in the by the Hayes

55
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:55,560
Brothers back in the late 60s early 70s

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
in San Francisco in Santa Cruz area

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,120
those guys were you know collecting all

58
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,318
these incredible sativas as well from

59
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,640
Central and South and Asia and they were

60
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:09,280
basically those were the the original

61
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:11,639
hazes wasn't really any one strain it

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,039
was just these amazing exotic long

63
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,318
flowering tropical sativa grown right

64
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,199
and then back there what we used to get

65
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:22,000
from Afghanistan was strictly the

66
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,839
hashish which was of course because of

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,959
smuggling Etc um it's only when the

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,959
indoor grow thing came into Vogue um the

69
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:37,920
late 70s early ' 80s and and uh Growers

70
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,640
back then be can disc began to discover

71
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,359
the merits of the high press sodium H

72
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,878
lighting which which of course was made

73
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,239
for stadium lighting sure and lighting

74
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,919
streets yeah I remember actually

75
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,120
probably quite a few years later but I

76
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,839
guess it would have been in the 80s when

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,840
people I knew would go and Jack a light

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,479
bulb from like the ski hill and then go

79
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,799
go grow a crop in their closet or

80
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:06,919
whatever whatever exactly and funny

81
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:09,760
stuff um later on of course um we be

82
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,759
began to develop specialized bulbs uh

83
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,359
one that comes to mind right away is the

84
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:18,399
the Hilux bulb uh which was originally

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,280
made by iwasaki in Japan and they added

86
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,478
more blue to the Spectrum uh because the

87
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,559
regular high pressure C has caused the

88
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,038
plants to elegate oh yeah uh without

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,360
enough blue in the Spectrum uh um

90
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:35,879
there's uh a number of companies are

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,280
starting to do that uh to tweak the

92
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,560
Spectrum so to speak yeah I've noticed

93
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,679
that I talked to um I think his name was

94
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,038
Allen one of the owners of

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,120
solc and they were talking about doing

96
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:51,639
these chips that were like 2K and 5K and

97
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,079
10K and they're measured in kelvin now

98
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,400
which is something different for LED

99
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,959
lighting but they're doing these full

100
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,560
spectrum LED sort of hoods that have all

101
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,799
these different chips to try and create

102
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,639
create this full spectrum of light now

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,560
there's all sorts of argument online

104
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,280
which why bother having the yellow

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,000
Spectrum or why bother having this

106
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,279
spectrum but I I I tend to believe that

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,240
the sun got it right and that everything

108
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,758
the sun has we might want in our

109
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,560
artificial light and that potential

110
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
synergies are occurring on levels that

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,280
we ourselves can't perceive or even our

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,120
scientific instruments can't perceive

113
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,719
them well I I've heard I I know people

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,000
that are now using LED lights uh they're

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,680
very effective very cool

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,240
they're quite expensive still I've got

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,519
one on the way oh yeah I've got one on

118
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,038
the way in fact I'll make a point on

119
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,560
pudding um potentially one of these

120
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,639
Northern Lights under there so you can

121
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,560
try some of your strain grown under an

122
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,759
LED light yeah I've I've yet to sample

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,839
any real product nor have I that was

124
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:55,120
grown nor have I with LED lighting so I

125
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,359
I can't really say I I just know that uh

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,360
it makes sense M yeah I mean I've seen a

127
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,240
friend of mine online Kingston herb uh I

128
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,520
respect him uh he posts quality every

129
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,879
time and he's been growing with them and

130
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,478
he's been showing beautiful buds under

131
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,319
the pink light and he's been extracting

132
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,560
the resin it's melty and bubbly so I'm

133
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,080
uh he was really the one that put me in

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,959
the belief that this could be something

135
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,198
that I should try and he was also the

136
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,318
one that hooked me up with Lush and they

137
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,720
sent me a a light on on Just for review

138
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,720
so it's going to be going into the tent

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,960
that John Bell is actually on his way

140
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,840
here with right now I've got my second

141
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,918
8x4 uh secret jardan tent on the way and

142
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,519
hopefully you know within a day or two

143
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,719
from that that led light will come in

144
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:45,719
and I'll literally be able to put these

145
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:49,199
um my next batch which is uh Congo sweet

146
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,240
skunk Barb and Afghani so that's what's

147
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,879
going in the tent next so you had

148
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,598
another little uh special something

149
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:00,360
there as well saw Yes uh this particular

150
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,519
strain uh is called

151
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,280
Harmony Harmony now this comes from a

152
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:10,318
breeder called reeferman who H reeferman

153
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,478
I'm sure uh some of you out there hey

154
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,759
you know what say what you want about

155
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,598
reefer man but he always has the quality

156
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,598
he does so that's let's that's what I'll

157
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,598
say about reer man I'll give you thumbs

158
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,439
up Charles you got the fire yeah and uh

159
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,719
a lot of people

160
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,000
that that he created that got stuff from

161
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,240
him and then renamed renamed called it

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,038
theirs and this won't be getting renamed

163
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,199
this will hold the reeferman name of

164
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,878

174
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:07,720
Kush cross to a lemon

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:10,598
thae so it is an incredible plant um G

the most incredible Aroma of of any

179
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:21,279

the fire this is the

187
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,679
fire so nice to be sharing good genetics

188
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,679
with friends I'm uh tomorrow I go see

189
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,278

world's all about putting the

197
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,399
interesting characters of the Cana

198
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,680
Community bringing them together here

199
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,679
you go

200
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,278
dog dabbing with the

201
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,278
dock it is

202
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,879
2014

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
boom

204
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,720
nice

205
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,600
rip so what's going on in the world of

206
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,240
breeding with the doc I know you're

207
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,159
always never

208
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,600
stopping even though you're probably

209
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,199
trying to uncomplicate your life and

210
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,000
relax a little bit you've still got

211
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,040
things in the plans I know I'm trying to

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,159
focus down on just right now I have five

213
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,719
strains I'm trying to keep it to that I

214
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,879
I could never figure out people that

215
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,120
have 50 strains or or it's a lot of work

216
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,320
they must have big teams of people well

217
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,480
yeah or they're not all they say they

218
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,440
are but well that's maybe a little bit

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:17,440
more likely yeah because I know it's

220
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,120
involved and it's quite

221
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:25,000
involved yeah and time consuming and

222
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:29,560
time consuming because every single

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,360
feno or to put it in plain English in

224
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:36,399
individual plant

225
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,560
um has to be for instance let's say we

226
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,839
we're we're choosing from a number from

227
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,278
a gene pool we're growing out as many

228
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,480
plants as we possibly can and we have to

229
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,320
number them we have to identify them

230
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,560
exactly and we have to take cuting from

231
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,079
them that correspond to that so we only

232
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,399
know four to 6 months later what we

233
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:00,439
really have so we have to have the

234
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,278
facility to go back to that clone that

235
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,320
was the chosen

236
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,759
one and and then go forward from there

237
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,200
uh so as you can

238
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:13,439
see the importance of labeling labeling

239
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,959
and and the ability to maintain those

240
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,040
labels you know I had I had just uh last

241
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,000
year U my

242
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:26,639
helper uh mixed up some

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,958
labels and although I'm pretty good at

244
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,759
telling what's what uh it have set me to

245
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:35,119
no end that I had to spend a couple of

246
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:38,720
months just to

247
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,519
verify what was what right in terms of

248
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,440
two particular fan I'm just going to

249
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,240
turn that fan off real quick cuz it'll

250
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
drive me nuts in the editing you can

251
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,440
keep

252
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,958
talking

253
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,480
go

254
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:01,639
right but

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,560
um yeah I'm uh I've I've mainly been a

256
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,320
Northern Lights man I think it's one of

257
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,599
the most versatile indoor strains around

258
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,480
it's synonymous with your name to me you

259
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,360
know doc Atomic the Northern Lights yeah

260
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,278
well it's because it's it I've had it so

261
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,278
long and I've tried my best to preserve

262
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:26,480
it uh I found it it has been washed out

263
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:28,360
a bit um not to slag anybody or anything

264
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,639
but just through my own personal

265
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,680
selection and I've found that I've tried

266
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:39,159
to keep it as as

267
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:43,719
close to its uh you know short flowering

268
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:45,879
super potent uh very uh High yielding

269
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,480
stocky has the taste changed much over

270
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:52,240
the years uh not really it's it's still

271
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,000
that Citrus

272
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,000
again when we think when I think sativa

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,720
I think Citrus I think lemon yeah both

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,639
the Congo and the sweet skunk uh

275
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,320
strongly have the strong lemon flavor

276
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
yeah the other thing I find about the

277
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,278
sweet skum lemine turine is what it is

278
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,198
yeah is it has a bubble gummy oh a

279
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:16,399
bubble gummy Aroma that sounds more like

280
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:18,120
the island sweet skunk yes you might

281
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,679
have the island sweet skunk that's a

282
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,480
hybrid it grows bigger nugs yeah it

283
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,679
looks like sweet skunk on like steroids

284
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,639
oh you'll see the one I gave you you can

285
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,399
grow it big but it'll be um

286
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,278
more lury well see it won't be dense see

287
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,278
here's an interesting thing that I I

288
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:40,278
have a pheno of the so-called sweet Scar

289
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,078
and then Mark has and other people have

290
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:45,000
and then they say they're the same but

291
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,838
maybe they're not the same so here's a

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,198
way we're going to do yeah we're going

293
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,279
to have three of them in the same room

294
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,639
all bloomed out together to see what's

295
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:58,039
what exactly you know but of course this

296
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,959
process takes months months and not only

297
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,000
that just being left with the herb in my

298
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,399
opinion isn't an accurate representation

299
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,078
you'd want to then extract resin off of

300
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,360
each one you know small amounts and then

301
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,319
do your denail dab and literally be like

302
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,759
okay like I can just tell you from The

303
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,079
Taste which one is Steve sweet skunk you

304
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:22,199
know Steve sweet skunk unfortunately was

305
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:24,439
kind of in the the same uh group as the

306
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,919
Congo that it was protected and then it

307
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,279
was shared very little and you really

308
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:31,000
had to be someone to be able to get your

309
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:33,399
hands on on it and so now I think once

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,958
more people have it or sorry let me go

311
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,679
back the reason that it was held back

312
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,799
like that that made it so um the island

313
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,719
sweet Gunk came to be which was a hybrid

314
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,078
and I don't know what if it was Jordan

315
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,839
or if it was Cash C Ken I'm not I can't

316
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,159
remember who did the um sweet skunk it's

317
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,040
a very nice strain but it isn't the

318
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,439
sweet skunk and any person that has the

319
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,159
sweet skunk that you show the island

320
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,959
sweet skunk to it it it looks great to

321
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,519
anyone that doesn't know sweet skunk but

322
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:04,399
someone that knows sweet skunk will look

323
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,759
at it and go oh it's it's got it it's

324
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,440
there but it's not the sweet skunk know

325
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:13,919
that's how I always sort of

326
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,040
uh sort of explained it that that they

327
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,559
it had something that's sweet lemony

328
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,000
kind of what about the stature of the

329
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,439
plant is it especially a tall plant is

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,120
it stretch it grows you know the the

331
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,519
well you can see my sweet skunk out

332
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,078
there look at how stretched it is it's

333
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,679
the tallest plant out there and it's

334
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,439
just super super

335
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,000
stretched just turn that off real quick

336
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,319
so yeah it stretches now the island

337
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
sweet skunk I've never personally grown

338
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:40,198
I've seen it budding and it was also

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,519
fairly tall and lanky but you know maybe

340
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,399
some of our viewers out there can

341
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,159
comment in the on the island sweet skun

342
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,559

343
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,719

00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:02,638
seeds both uh great Gardener and and the

349
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:05,599

them are exclusive to Rebecca at the

351
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,199

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,519
them out I exclusively sell them now

353
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,719
because there's the the internet is Rife

354
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,240
with

355
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,160
uh yeah you open yourself up to some

356
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,680
real um well just get potential fraud

357
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:26,000
yes oh right people selling hemp seeds

358
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,239
well are people lifting pictures and

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,440
information and calling them something

360
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,399
else to be honest it's the it's why

361
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,360
nowadays it's important to have that

362
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,360
official YouTube page and that official

363
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,120
uh Facebook page because you have a a

364
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,480
port hole for people to go to they don't

365
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,839
have to find you in little places

366
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,399
they're concentrated right to you and

367
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,480
then how you let them know that you're

368
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,000
you is by going and doing a short little

369
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,000
video and saying look I just made these

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,440
seeds I'm dropping them off there's this

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,480
many we'll let you know when they sell

372
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,279
out and you can control um the people

373
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,839
out there that are trying to be a little

374
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,439
a little bit dishonest completely

375
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:04,400
fraudulent in fact and selling and uh

376
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,240
seeds that they don't even have it's a

377
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,400
classic well anyways being an

378
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,120
underground guy for all these years you

379
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,160
know I've just learned from Mark about

380
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,918
the the latest the latest and the

381
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,558
greatest yes you know it's all this

382
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,959
Facebook and YouTube and you know

383
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,879
verification it all makes sense perfect

384
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,199
sense to me and the fact that we're

385
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,120
legal I mean listen the only reason

386
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,279
we're not criminals the only reason we

387
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,918
were underground is because they made us

388
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,678
criminals that's right without that

389
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,240
criminal element without you know with

390
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,320
the license on the wall I am a

391
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,160
completely different person I'm allowed

392
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,000
to be more honest I'm allowed to help

393
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,000
and share and educate and most

394
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,160
importantly I'm allowed to connect and

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,839
learn because there's a lot of people

396
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,000
out there that are inspired by well you

397
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,319
know all of that energy was sucked up in

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,919
being paranoid yeah of course what's

399
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,639
that car door it was the fuel for why is

400
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,679
that car been parked down there so long

401
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,000
that guy drove by four times yeah who's

402
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,400
that guy taking pictures of over there

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,839
that's right oh it was terrible I know

404
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
listen I was visiting a friend in

405
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,038
Portland one day if you think we had it

406
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,798
bad our poor American Brethren down

407
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,839
south you guys got a good now some of

408
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:15,400
you but wow I'd say 15 years ago I was

409
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,959
down in Portland for a fish show and I

410
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,320
was visiting my friend and it was on

411
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,640
Hawthorne Street right by the Safeway

412
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,960
and he was in those apartments right

413
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
across the street from the Safeway on

414
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,519
Hawthorne and hofor is kind of like the

415
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:28,399
hippie area Jack herrer son has a hemp

416
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,519
store there and there's a couple of head

417
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,360
shops and glass shops in that area and

418
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,639
so we're just puffing he's got a shitty

419
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,719
little glass spoon and we're just

420
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,038
puffing some herb and I guess a cop

421
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,279
pulls someone over outside in front of

422
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,000
his house and he just loses it dude I

423
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,798
mean running around his house collecting

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,599
everything flushing [Â __Â ] down the toilet

425
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,720
like completely believing that the cops

426
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,959
are here to come and get us and our

427
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,759
little amount of weed it was it was

428
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,120
weird to to feel that Vibe I mean I felt

429
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,480

448
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,960
the Manali cream famous Valley so I'm

449
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:58,038
flying out of Deli uh expecting to get a

450
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,120
flight directly to London and then back

451
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,319
here here and everything was planned

452
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,918
when I got to the airport I was informed

453
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:08,519
because of uh equipment or some such

454
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:12,880
changes that I would have to be changing

455
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:16,839
planes in Beirut Lebanon oh un be knows

456
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,559
to me at the very last moment Jesus now

457
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:23,798
this is back in the 70s and and there

458
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,480
was a lot of [Â __Â ] going on there like

459
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,440
you know was the beginning of terrorism

460
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,038
and hijacking and all that kind of stuff

461
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,038
and I'll never

462
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:33,960
forget uh because we had to get out of

463
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,440
the plane and we had to wait and change

464
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,360
planes and we had to walk through a new

465
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,640
metal

466
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,798
detector and I was walking through this

467
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,799
metal detector and the sound of these

468
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,918
boots going over I'm my God and the

469
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,079
guard is looking straight at my

470
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,840
boots with his

471
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:56,839
ak47 and his bu thing he was looking

472
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,918
straight at my boots and I'm thinking to

473
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:04,038
myself as we used to say in the 60s and

474
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:09,038
70s when we were high maintain man

475
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:12,679
maintain maintain yeah and he looked the

476
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:16,558
other way and I went sat

477
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:19,600
down waited for that flight to call and

478
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:24,038
the moment we lift it off you're

479
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:26,798
like so anyway give us an idea now what

480
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,599
was your worry cuz in India for me my

481
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,319
worry was 10 years I'm doing in 10 years

482
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,639
if they find this 10 years for sure so

483
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:36,119
what was your worry was it uh death

484
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,919
penalty was it life in prison was it 10

485
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,319
you know what was the realistic worry in

486
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,600
your mind most of my business I was

487
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:47,720
conducting in Nepal MH and I had

488
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:50,918
connections and I wouldn't have gone to

489
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,839
jail there in where in Nepal no no but

490
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,480
in your fear of Beirut Landing in barut

491
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,439
where you just told the story what is

492
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,759
the fear is it death is it life in

493
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,919
prison is it

494
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:05,599
what flashed back to me was was Billy

495
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,200
Hayes in Turkey I don't know if you guys

496
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:11,278
Midnight Express Express okay this was

497
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,720
the exact same situation it's what I

498
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,400
pictured as you were telling me cuz they

499
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,919
have to get off the plane and he's got

500
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,960
all the hash wrapped around him and they

501
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,038
think it's a bomb well I wasn't quite as

502
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,640
greedy as Billy you know and I had it in

503
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:26,879
my boots and it was quite a a rough go

504
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,080
stitching him in there and by the way

505
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,880
this pure Manali cream was only 1,200

506
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,639
bucks a pound in Montreal in

507
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,120
1972 just to give you an idea where the

508
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,400
prices have gone in this whole thing but

509
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,558
anyway I would be back Montreal and have

510
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,798
three or four or five grand whatever it

511
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,960
was in a small time but back then you

512
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:52,119

120Â° and 98% humidity so all I wanted to

543
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:30,119
do was go and crash out in a

544
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,759
hotel and uh which I did and and I

545
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,199
thought to myself well I want to go to

546
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,480

I'm in New Deli right now so the next

549
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,000
morning I wake up and I think okay I'm

550
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,439
going to go down to the public taxi

551
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,119
stand and I'll find a private car or a

552
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,919
taxi and I'll haggle with them anyway

553
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,599
turns out it was like about 25 bucks and

554
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,720
this is for a 200 kmet ride with a

555
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:57,038
private driver which is not going to be

556
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,000
a 2hour drive for those of you that have

557
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:03,038

558
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,599

559
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,398

560
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,639

561
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:12,639

562
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,000
got some blot acid with me Christ you

563
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,799
know and I thought should I or shouldn't

564
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,480
I definitely and I said I

565
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:25,480
should I should so I took a blot off we

566
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,399
go little did I know that the main Trunk

567
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,399
Road which link

568
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:34,558
rishikes was actually two lanes but

569
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:38,079
there was eight Lanes of traffic of

570
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:41,960
donkeys of cows of Rick Shaws of trucks

571

carts that they've been using for like

573
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,960
2000 years and there's like all along

574
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,278

577
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,798
and potentially a little bit of death

578
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,200
mixed in there that's right and I was

579
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:04,200
sitting back going like this is like a

580
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,000
IMAX felini

581
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,960
movie times 100 for you young guys out

582

I remember Pink Flamingos I must be old

589
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,759
I remember all of it anyways we're

590
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,319
diverting here again so he's tripping on

591
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,158
acid he's driving up to rishik mer cash

592
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:41,558
I'm in the back SE this taxi there's

593
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,720
there's eight Lanes of chaos going on

594
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:46,879
outside we're weaving in and out Indians

595
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,240
have a sick sense about when when they

596
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,640
don't hit any they just kind of

597
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,278
Miss I don't know man we were just

598
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:58,120
weaving in and out and I was like just

599
00:26:54,278 --> 00:27:00,440
totally tripped w i I thought man I'm I

600
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,519
can't imagine actually I'm over it's

601
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,759
heavy it is heavy were you saying to

602
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:08,000
yourself maintain

603
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:10,720
maintain I was saying maintain but the

604
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,759
best thing all we finally got there to

605
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,120
rishy cash he brought me to this nice

606
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:18,319
hotel and as I walked in the lobby they

607
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:23,479
were doing Puja which in India is a

608
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:26,439
ceremony ringing bells and these candles

609
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,079
and these bramman priests and chanting

610
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,640
and I felt like oh God surreal like your

611
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,918
to your arrival too when you're tripping

612
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,399
on acid it's all about like timing and

613
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,559
the you know in that moment and I could

614
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:41,678
imagine that would have brought a tear

615
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:46,000
to your eye well it as they

616
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,038
say and it is true with acid or any

617
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,119
psychedelic or even ganja for that

618
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:53,319
matter set and setting

619
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,839
are of the most

620
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,678
importance in terms of the result of

621
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,720
your experience yeah they should should

622
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,759
definitely be in the same vein of

623
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,120
quality as the substance you've sought

624
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:08,919
out absolutely and I think when people

625
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:11,719
have bad trips I think the main cause is

626
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,120
the set and setting were disregarded or

627
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,159
or weren't taken seriously I'd say

628
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,798
that's like 95% of the time yeah the bar

629
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,799
setting let's go drink a bunch of beer

630
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,440
and get super high we're Prairie boys

631
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:27,038
woohoo it's like

632
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,759
o that's not going to be F I mean us us

633
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,079
just being aware of that fact we choose

634
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,440
to take our ethnog in the proper set and

635
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,918
setting absolutely and we're here on the

636
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,480
beautiful west coast of Canada it's not

637
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,840
hard to do no usually just get away from

638
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,880
people get your small group and get into

639
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,720
a group it's a very personal thing so

640
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,720
you want to be around people that that

641
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,240
you're willing to be uncomfortable

642
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,038
around and sometimes it's a simple it's

643
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,679
why you connect so deeply with people on

644
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,480
psychedelics on anthens because I'm just

645
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,080
wondering Mark you know with all with

646
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,480
our freestyle of talking and

647
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,798
interviewing I don't even know what you

648
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,399
call it anymore is that it's called

where the the like did you ever notice

695
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,839
smoking marijuana uh in increases your

696
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,599
musical ability and then the guy goes in

697
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,199
the shower he's in the shower and

698
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,038

701
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,519
sure so he takes a hit oh before that he

702
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,319
was singing and he was singing really

703
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,319
badly he was

704
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:25,398
like super bad he takes the hit and then

705
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,439
all of a sudden he he turns that into

706
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:29,319
this crazy Funk song and it just builds

707
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,278
he's

708
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:33,879
like then horns and like bass come in

709
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:35,839
and he's got backup singers and it's all

710
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,840
an album you just hear it but I'm

711
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,038
telling you man like when I was young

712
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,759
getting high listening to this album it

713
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:44,398
was funny [Â __Â ] and the the reason that

714
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,038
reminded me of it was because there was

715
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:49,719
another skit where the dude's like

716
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:52,079
there's three ways to to get grass and

717
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,120
so one of the ways was to like you know

718
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,798
he's talking to a guy on the street and

719
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,398
he like creates a distraction and the

720
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:00,879
guy drops his grass and it's like and

721
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:03,879
you cop that [Â __Â ] and run it's a comedy

722
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,600
album if you've heard it you'll laugh if

723
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,080
not Google it you can hear it on YouTube

724
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,158
I'm surprised you don't know that Al

725
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,038
well it almost reminds me of uh I don't

726
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:15,039
know if you remember the fire sign

727
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,720
theater that that's old hippie stuff

728
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,879
right from the from the 60s even late

729
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,880
60s that that was about the dawn of FM

730
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,200
radio I was only born in the 70s oh

731

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,960
genetics awesome and a lot of the times

758
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,880
I was told I had to wait

759
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,519
and because of the paranoia it's so

760
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,440
going on there sure what's happened

761
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,759
there I I just want to comment on that a

762
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,519
bit is that a lot of these uh indigenous

763
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:55,879
genetics in Southeast Asia have been

764
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:57,638
lost to the cultivation of heroin um and

765
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,440
that of course invites

766
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:04,319
violence yeah oh yeah uh and all that

767
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,519
kind of stuff and then it the government

768
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:11,159
and the police lump all of it together

769
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,918
as drugs drugs mhm including cannabis

770
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,480

810
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:12,879
God and we all get it from somewhere

811
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:14,880
else so yeah I've never pulled it out of

812
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,838
my ass

813
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,559
no I collect seeds from living plants

814
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,199
but even that plant was planted by

815
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,480
someone someone or something I know and

816
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,519
we could go back forever in the past and

817
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,079
forever into the future but here we are

818
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,239
in this particular moment yeah with

819
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,119
access to these particular genetics and

820
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,719
access to the resources like it's

821
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,318
important for guys like you who have the

822
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:41,078
resources that have put in all these

823
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:43,318
years decades in fact uh to continue to

824
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,280
do what they do because you get better

825
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:47,920
at it well this is true you know and as

826
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,880
you get better at something and then you

827
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,519
realize oh like I've done all this

828
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,680
amazing land I've I've I've traveled the

829
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:57,318
globe to collect landra sativas well now

830
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,799
maybe I'll use a couple that are that

831
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:03,039
are right here that I have access to you

832
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:06,000
know well I think right now in British

833
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,960
Columbia we have access to the best

834
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,880
genetics in the world yeah with the help

835
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,079
of the internet I feel like right now in

836
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,680
the world if you're the right person and

837
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,440
you're the you can get online and and

838
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,118
and show your passion and become a part

839
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,159
of this community it seems pretty

840
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,800
possible for anyone to acquire almost

841
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,118
almost anything you know and the more we

842
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,720
break down that barrier of you know

843
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,480
giving out Cuts with

844
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:35,318
rules it's just uh you know I understand

845
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,838
the fear that there's not enough for you

846
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:40,079
but it's not a good enough reason to

847
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:42,920
keep ganja from everyone it's just not a

848
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,920
good enough reason but that's true of

849
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,358
the business side of anything MH you

850
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,240
know that one protects one's product

851
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:52,838
absolutely you know I mean to a degree

852
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:55,598
yes but we're talking about something

853
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,679
different here one of the business side

854
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,318
of it says that but the spiritual side

855
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,039
and you know I hate using the word

856
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:05,920
spiritual the life affirming side of

857
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:09,159
cannabis that is which should definitely

858
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,480
be shared yeah 100% And it's when it

859
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,920
becomes a

860
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,880
business and we get into this that's

861
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,440
mine well I talked I talked to someone

862
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,079
online who was like they were like oh

863
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,159
you guys are all into sharing then send

864
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,560
me seeds and I sort of was like well

865
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,239
listen okay it's just like anything we

866
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,639
share safely with people that we can

867
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:31,399
trust and then the seed business is

868
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:34,159
created to get seeds to the rest of the

869
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,519
people you know there has to be if guys

870
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,039
like you and Matt and uh breeder Steve

871
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,679
and S if they don't breed genetics and

872
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:44,960
sell them on the open market then other

873
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:47,118
people will just produce a lesser

874
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,519
product use the same pictures use the

875
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,680
names and people won't get what they

876
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,599
need to get so I understand the business

877
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,838
aspect of it is necessary but I don't

878
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:01,119
believe that hoarding or controlling the

879
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:04,838
mothers should be you know what I mean I

880
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,838
think that it's just uh you know sure

881
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:08,440
you you work with your strains and

882
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,119
create your things that's not to say

883
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,800
someone else can't take Congo and and

884
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,640
sweet skunk can make something else that

885
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,760
they make you know what I mean if you

886
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:17,039
want to bring something that's unique

887
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,280
then don't collect a strain that

888
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,199
everyone has go to the land race strains

889
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,880
like you did and pull it out of nature I

890
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,799
did the same thing I literally that

891
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,200
Jamaican strain that I have man it is a

892
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,160
wild one I cannot wait it's a mutant

893
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:35,519
it's got two branches coming off one

894
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:38,000
leaf two full growths and a horal phytol

895
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:41,559
axi with the three leaves growing out so

896
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,559
we love our mutants in the world of

897
