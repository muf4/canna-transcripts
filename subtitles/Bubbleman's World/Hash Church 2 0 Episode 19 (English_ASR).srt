like episode 16 and then 17 and then 18

5

the title quite a few times fingers

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,390
crossed that it works today fingers

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,838

nervous about starting hashed Church I'd

127
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,180
get so not aggressive but just kind of

128
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,650
like I would just want it to work I

129
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,810
would just want hashed churches to work

130
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:36,179

what better way to start hash search

162

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,589
technical problems let's have a little

166
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,940
dab of doodle here my speakers are

167
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:35,728
working yeah you're cutting out a lot

168
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:41,159
your [ __ ] is not on point right now I

169
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:44,460
don't know what's going on all right

170
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,980
turning me up into headphones turn me up

171
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,860
into headphones turn it up turn it up

172
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,220
remember that scene from Dave Chappelle

173
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,490
show I think it was Dylan I spit

174
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,620
via I'm guessing he'd probably know he

175
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,629
was the one that said it in chat all

176
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,039
right Wendy Turner said she's running a

177
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,449
little late and she'll show up as soon

178
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,899
as possible so I think it's good time

179
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:09,708
for a bond rib for those of you that can

180
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:13,100
do bong rips I don't know what's going

181
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:17,869
on over there and in middle America oh

182
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,220

183
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,259

184
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,360

185
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:26,600

191
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,609
everyone working with their microphones

192
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:51,980

194
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,740

00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:56,509
bit I don't know if it's when other

196
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,360

197
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:03,350
have our microphones needed or what it

198
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,839

273
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,899
little dark but it's great to see your

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,470
silhouettes

275
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:59,289
yeah hopefully it gets changed here soon

276
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,019
we get a little light but nice to see

277
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,399
you all this morning how you doing today

278
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,399
it's good man it's been a nice slow

279
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,110
start to church mostly we've been

280
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,568
technical difficulty in our mics and our

281
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,370
you know you know the longer we take

282
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:14,409
that we don't do a church the more it's

283
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,169
kind of like rusty when you get in the

284
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:19,240
room but I did a little wake and bake

285
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:21,429
yesterday just before church just to

286
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,889
suss out the vibes and I smashed an hour

287
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:26,258
on my wake and bake just by myself so I

288
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,058
figured if we can't like there's so much

289
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:30,818
to talk about right now because if you

290
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:34,480
haven't noticed hash Church was a pretty

291
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:36,729
big sort of place for us to talk about

292
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,519
these important situations and with

293
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:42,278
hashed Church not really around there's

294
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,470
not really another spot like it you know

295
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:46,509
there's there's spots like it there are

296
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,970
there are many spots like if there's no

297
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,500
real spot like it so I thought you know

298
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,809
we kind of owe it to the community and

299
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,698
ourselves to a get together and shoot

300
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,528
the [ __ ] see how everyone's doing maybe

301
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:59,740
mewed Sam while they [ __ ] coughs in

302
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:01,600
my ear for the 15th time in a row and I

303
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,459
just joking Sam but I didn't you you and

304
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
just have a conversation you know

305
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,088
obviously we're gonna get into some

306
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,639
things here today I definitely want to

307
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,800
talk about Philo's I haven't had a

308
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,750
chance to talk to maglia and invite him

309
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,729
in and I know Kevin mckernon who has

310
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,470
been one of the big opposition's online

311
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,320
is also unable to come in because he's

312
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,820
having a barbeque but

313
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,350
it'd be kind of cool to have a little

314
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,089
conversation about that but also a

315
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,129
conversation about all these different

316
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,500
things that are going on in Canada and

317
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,610
in the US and the farm bill and all

318
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,769
these different things that are

319
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,470
occurring in Colombia and the Caribbean

320
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:37,620
and in Europe and there's a lot going on

321
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,139
in the industry right now a lot going on

322
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,409
and I just feel that when we're not able

323
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:48,480
to gather we don't that information kind

324
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:57,600
of doesn't really get you know put into

325
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:59,069
yeah Justin put into a really yeah and

326
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,659
obviously hash search has always been a

327
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:02,789
great gathering of the minds you know

328
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,439
what it doesn't matter what what you do

329
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,149
in the industry it's a great place where

330
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,790
we can all kind of gather around the

331
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:11,789
campfire and talk about things as they

332
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:13,740
pop up so obviously we're open

333
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:15,419
invitation to moglie open invitation to

334
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,769
Kevin let's try and get them on and

335
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:21,899
actually hash this out and we can we can

336
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,990
certainly talk about that a little bit

337
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,980
of that controversy because there's

338
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,629
there's a lot of stuff that's kind of

339
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,170
popped up but for the last month and

340
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:34,230
it's it's all things that your growers

341
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:37,289
and breeders industry both paint need to

342
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,350
kind of understand because it's you know

343
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:43,230
the intellectual property right of

344
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:46,860
cannabis as much as we want to keep this

345
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,589
at a fair and open community we have to

346
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,480
be able we have to be able to protect

347
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,220
will protect the breeders we have to

348
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,300
first and foremost we have to be able to

349
00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:00,949
protect the patients and I've I have my

350
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:07,948
personal thoughts on it obviously I'm a

351
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:12,209
you know being a medication we want we

352
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:14,519
want to see the patients have safe

353
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,230
access no matter where they are but at

354
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,099
the same and obviously if you know

355
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,169
growers breeders genetics companies

356
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:25,230
anybody starts spending you know lots of

357
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:28,290
time money resources developing IP

358
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,929
whether that be genetics or processes or

359
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:34,048
potentially developing patents you know

360
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,030
we we as industry leaders have to be

361
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:38,759
able to set the example that way you

362
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:41,789
know when as Wall Street or the public

363
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,250
companies kind of form and we set that

364
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:46,289
good example and you know for best

365
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,720
example is some of the predatory uh

366
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:51,658
patents out there for cannabis cultivars

367
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,269
a lot of those the cannabis cultivar

368
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:57,150
patents are fairly broad and they're

369
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:59,579
gonna have to get you know fought in

370
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,500
court but you know when you look at the

371
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:04,139
transition from black marketed gray

372
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,119
market to regulated markets there's a

373
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,370
big learning curve that has to go

374
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,039
through and you know the USPTO doesn't

375
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:14,879
go to the black market to research

376
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,649
potential patents so you know we have to

377
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,320
be able to set the example and you know

378
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,480
for the word patents you know the

379
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,399
government's that pull that issue those

380
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,110
patents make just as much money when the

381
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,900
patents get challenged as they do when

382
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:29,969
the patents get issued so what we've

383
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,630
kind of seen come up is you know a

384
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,710
couple different intellectual property

385
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,790
developments in the industry both

386
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,470
genetics as well as technologies and we

387
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:43,470
have to be able to not only develop that

388
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:46,230
IP protect that AG key but also be able

389
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:50,700
to provide that IP to the public I know

390
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,860
there's I I was a cannabis refugee 15

391
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,069
years ago moving to a state that you

392
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:59,339
know because I needed CBD in my life and

393
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:00,720
in Texas you did 15 years ago there

394
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:04,980
wasn't CBD available

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,740
so yeah tons of the cool stuff it's

396
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,269
going to be an interesting year um west

397
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,909
coast it looks like weather weather

398
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:13,259
report going to the Farmers Almanac West

399
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:16,500
Coast is gonna have a fairly phenomenal

400
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,750
year but a little bit dry so there's

401
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,519
gonna be some forest fires kind of pop

402
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,069
up on the west coast

403
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,740
kind of where we're at Central America

404
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:28,439
in the Midwest it's actually a fairly

405
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,259
wet spring a lot of the farmers we've

406
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,420
been talking to you know when you when

407
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,849
you apply for crop insurance the

408
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,259
Cannabis aside cannabis can't have crop

409
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:40,169
insurance yet but there are some federal

410
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:43,319
bills that would include crop insurance

411
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,910
poor industrial hemp but in the Midwest

412
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:49,439
you know they we've had a fairly wet

413
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:51,210
spring and yep all the corn farmers you

414
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,940
know normally in order to have crop

415
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,950
insurance for growing corn you have to

416
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,080
be able to you know plant it in the

417
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,880
ground before Memorial Day that way

418
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,549
there's a hundred days of sunlight for

419
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,620
your crop to be able to grow what if

420
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:08,759
that's corn and what we're kind of

421
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:11,039
seeing in the Mississippi River area of

422
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,079
the Midwest of the u.s. is you know that

423
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,289
hundred day mark is Memorial Day which

424
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,629
is today tomorrow so a lot of corn

425
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:21,990
farmers because these you know a fairly

426
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,970
wet spring a lot of the farmers haven't

427
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,579
yet plant planted their crops

428
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,558
hundred-day frogs so we're starting to

429
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,169
see some talk about okay well rather

430
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,920
than growing corn they're gonna

431
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,250
potentially have to grow soybeans

432
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,330
because soybeans have slightly shorter

433
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:42,058
growing cycles but you know the current

434
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:44,460
trade worth with Asia is kind of causing

435
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:47,339
issues with tariffs as well as value of

436
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,650
soybeans so it'd be great if you know

437
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:52,678
farmers in the Midwest had a you know

438
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:56,970
fifty to seventy day crop that they

439
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,950
could plant instead of corn hopefully

440
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,799
more sustainably and still be able to

441
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,110
pull off the harvest this year it looks

442
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,639
like knock on wood yeah and that's and

443
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,949
then we're starting to see that happen

444
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,410
and a lot of states you know industrial

445
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,620
hemp is kind of slowly making its

446
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,300
progress across the u.s. I think there's

447
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:19,409
four states that don't have industrial

448
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:21,779
hemp or cannabis laws and the vast

449
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,269
majority of Americans as as well as

450
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,069
people in North America are in

451
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:28,170
jurisdictions where they can cultivate

452
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:33,700
either medical marijuana medical

453
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:38,509
cannabis industrial hemp or cannabis so

454
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:41,090
I want to know what how it Josh and

455
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:42,829
Kelly how's it up in the up and where

456
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:44,658
you were part of the world how's your

457
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:48,740
spring been you I saw some pictures of

458
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:50,630
you guys greenhouses yeah well we just

459
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,429
probably about two and a half maybe two

460
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,950
weeks ago we just got done with some

461
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:58,100
soup or a cold evening so how to really

462
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:01,220
hard frost it seemed like spring went

463
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:03,769
from really really cold super hard frost

464
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:07,100
to really hot to like almost like thirty

465
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:09,319
degree days so we've had to transplant

466
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,000
all of our starts over and over again

467
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,099
not necessarily their cannabis at all

468
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,048
but like our chard and our beets they

469
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:17,209
didn't really like that super hot

470
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:19,759
temperatures our brassicas we had to

471
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,500
replant twice but everything's coming up

472
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,500
now and now we're feeling like a true

473
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,329
spree it's been really dry actually I

474
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,190
mean it's wet right now like right

475
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:30,589
because it just rained last couple days

476
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,870
which is sweet but it's been extremely

477
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:34,278
dry unbelievably so to where you're

478
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:36,918
walking around in the forest and its

479
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:38,269
really pretty brittle so that was you

480
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,909
know that was interesting it's been good

481
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,849
for the the GaN just starts we got a

482
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:46,640
bunch of seeds started on April 20th

483
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:49,099
4:20 and they're coming up really nice

484
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,559
really beautiful right now all of our

485
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:53,538
soils are totally prepped all of our

486
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:56,599
greenhouses are totally prepped and

487
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:59,629
we're really excited for the year right

488
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:03,648
now we got Otto flowers we're gonna try

489
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:07,278
this year we got a bunch of hemp a bunch

490
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:09,408
of cultivars that were you know are

491
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,058
growing in Canada would have been you

492
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:13,669
know come from wherever they've come

493
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:16,129
from to to grow so we're gonna try that

494
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:18,730
out we're also going to test whether

495
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,840
they finish up here in British Columbia

496
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,929
because a lot of the hemp strains

497
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:27,349
haven't finished all the auto the auto

498
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:31,220
one the auto two the cherry wine the box

499
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:33,619
the spectrum all of those really didn't

500
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,990
finish good in our area and couldn't

501
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:37,579
couldn't be in the field right now so

502
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,308
we're feeling really blessed we got like

503
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:42,288
a really long breeding project maybe

504
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:46,038
like a 40 year breeding project from

505
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:47,509
heart Rock and those guys gave us some

506
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:49,160
Otto flowers so

507
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:52,490
we're gonna be able to do some crossing

508
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,560
and really our our big goal this year

509
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,750
and you know probably the next five

510
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,419
years is coming out with a super high

511
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,210
CBD hemp strain that finishes up here in

512
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,800
Canada so we're really really focused on

513
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,460
that that's that's what we're gonna be

514
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,339
working on

515
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,360
yeah it's it's it's also you know

516
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:10,459
something we're working on as a

517
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,169
collective and as a pure certified group

518
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,769
a lot of us farmers we're doing a

519
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:19,759
breeding project together and you know

520
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:22,970
we're interested in genetics and public

521
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,879
domain and what that means and you know

522
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,250
what are the rights within public domain

523
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,630
what what rights are we giving up and

524
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,039
stuff like that so you know that's

525
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,560
something we're really exploring and

526
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,240
we're talking to people inside the

527
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,309
cannabis realm we're talking to people

528
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,289
outside the cannabis realm that are in

529
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,349
the food realms because food has been

530
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:44,299
hijacked you know long ago you know in

531
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:46,490
ways that cannabis might be just facing

532
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:49,159
now and I think part of ray of

533
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:52,370
legalization that we really always

534
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,880
feared was really this right now was the

535
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:58,189
you know the federal takeover and what

536
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,510
Lari agriculture does with crops is

537
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,370
something that you know we really don't

538
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:03,680
want to see in the cannabis industry so

539
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:05,629
it's putting a huge challenge to us

540
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,880
right now and I and we are excited

541
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,440
you're not excited but you know we are

542
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,330
excited but interested in just talking

543
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,779
about it more and fine and and for us

544
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:17,240
you know I I've been a really long time

545
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:19,279
friend of madly and Mowgli's you know

546
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,079
family is good friends of mine so

547
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,000
there's personal relationship there as

548
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,789
well and I personally want to thank

549
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,730
Philo's right now for opening up our

550
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:30,529
eyes to a lot of things a lot of people

551
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,660
in the industry have been asleep and

552
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,480
they haven't recognized that we needed

553
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,370
to protect this IP or that we needed to

554
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,839
share these seeds you know we're like

555
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,599
Josh said we're really in the public

556
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,519
domain we're reaching out to every

557
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,189
single expert that we know of anybody

558
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,470
that can mentor us so it really like

559
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,110
sparked a fire under our booties at this

560
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,390
time to really get going and what we

561
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:54,829
came up with was that we're going to be

562
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,780
putting it in the public domain we've

563
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:59,089
already starting a breeding project with

564
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:01,308
40-plus farms and the pure certification

565
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:02,658
we've got a whole bunch of data that

566
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:05,329
people can collect that we keep within

567
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:07,460
ourselves and then that actualizes your

568
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:09,349
seeds you know the thing that we worry

569
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,120
about patenting and marking it and

570
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:13,849
markering and all these things in the

571
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,398
cannabis plant is she's an adaptogen

572
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:17,808
she's gonna adapt so you know it's

573
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:19,908
really interesting there's a whole lot

574
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:22,369
of money in corporate cannabis and

575
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:24,799
people that are dumping into this sort

576
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:26,989
of patenting idea in cannabis but she's

577
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,269
an adaptogen so I could take a patent

578
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,339
seed and somebody could spend 2 million

579
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:33,079
dollars on patenting that seed and get

580
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,999
all of the rights and everything to it

581
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,069
and then I could put it in my deep

582
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,798
beautiful living soil beds for four

583
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:41,749
years and you wouldn't even recognize it

584
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,609
because she's an adaptogen so I'm just

585
00:26:41,749 --> 00:26:46,909
you know I guess we're kind of putting

586
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:49,128
it out there wouldn't wouldn't cannabis

587
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:52,429
already have been genetically modified

588
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:56,148
back in the 30s or the 40s when they

589
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:58,369
made the cross over from him to cotton

590
00:26:56,148 --> 00:27:00,319
or from hemp to something else what is

591
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,490
someone's thought on that one maybe it's

592
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,439
not really actually

593
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,470
pathetically modified but not

594
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,730
genetically engineered but it hasn't

595
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:13,399
been or what no it's dating back

596
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,278
thousands of years just dude of

597
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:20,418
Mendelian breeding cannabis has been

598
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:22,460
bred from a dioecious plant which the

599
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:26,269
industry will call from a frenetic and

600
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:29,419
you Manisha's plants and that was all

601
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:31,730
based on selective breeding so but

602
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:33,889
that's not the qualification that's

603
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:37,069
that's a selection

604
00:27:33,888 --> 00:27:38,719
yeah it's its selection and for genetic

605
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,368
modification but it's not genetic

606
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,558
engineering so we're not actually

607
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:45,618
creating genetically modified organism

608
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:48,368
TMO but just due to Mendelian genetics

609
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:51,349
ever the simple act of you know doing a

610
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:54,259
analytical test to select for CBD and

611
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:56,269
then taking the CBD cultivars to

612
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:59,298
incorporate into your breeding pollen is

613
00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:03,259
the form of genetic modification now I

614
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:04,668
personally am a big fan yeah my my

615
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:07,128
educational background is on molecular

616
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:08,990
bio genetics so you know before getting

617
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:12,500
into the industry I was looking at you

618
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:14,149
know developing biofuels for abuse and

619
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,140
because you know biofuels are far more

620
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:18,139
sustainable than the other

621
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,390
sources of energy but ultimately you

622
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:24,259
know we don't want to pull the wool over

623
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:27,020
our eyes and say that cannabis is a the

624
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:28,609
same cannabis that was around you know

625
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:31,069
ten thousand fifty thousand years ago

626
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:34,039
you know we have numerous different

627
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:36,379
landraces that but locally adapted to to

628
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,450
their growing regions and the simple act

629
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,310
of taking those you know genetics from

630
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,870
one part of the world to another part of

631
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:44,079
the world cultivating them for

632
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:46,819
successive generations you're gonna get

633
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,549
adaptation of that those hybrids or

634
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:53,000
those cultivars to your bio region and

635
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:56,569
that's that's a form of selecting four

636
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,210
cultivars and you Mendelian genetic

637
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:01,069
selection and that's the case all plants

638
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,410
on earth I mean there's you know that's

639
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:05,409
the case for walnut trees and and

640
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,309
everything is in constant evolution so

641
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,240
ya know there's a big difference between

642
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:15,589
you know I I could go in-depth into you

643
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,049
know the concerns that I have about

644
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:20,079
genetic genetic engineering the last

645
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,339
thing we want to do is to start you know

646
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,470
inserting genetic inserting gene

647
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:27,639
sequences into cannabis cultivars that

648
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:31,640
make them you know produce antifreeze or

649
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,820
produce pesticide resistance or produce

650
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,740
there's even ways that you can make them

651
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:38,839
possible fluorescent so glow in black

652
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,730
lights are glowing lights you could

653
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,059
gross you could genetically engineer it

654
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:46,610
inserting Rose thorns so you have Rose

655
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:50,349
thorns there's even genetic selection

656
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:53,599
that's going on for actually hybridizing

657
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:55,750
different traits into from non cannabis

658
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,819
varieties into cannabis varieties and

659
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,470
those are those genetic engineering

660
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:02,389
where you're taking non cannabis

661
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:05,660
genetics and putting them into cannabis

662
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:09,350
potentially have side effects we don't

663
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:12,650
know you know with big cases in corn you

664
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:14,839
know they've not only create pesticide

665
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,269
resistance so that they can spray really

666
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,519
bad pesticides onto corn fields that's

667
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:21,589
really bad for the ecosystem but you

668
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,900
know they've genetically modified

669
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:26,720
engineered corn so that it can resist

670
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,220
that now I think that is a travesty to

671
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,470
the ecosystem and

672
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,110
we have starting this new industry we're

673
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,819
gonna be able to promote new avoiding

674
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:37,219
that sort of thing by developing

675
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:40,099
sustainable ecosystems why would you

676
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,319
grow why would you Jenny I modify it to

677
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:44,089
be resistant to a pesticide instead of

678
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,678
genetically modify it to be resistant

679
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:48,829
against the bug yeah

680
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,870
told you in the first place yeah so

681
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:52,788
being able to select four cultivars that

682
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:54,798
grow well in but your bio region you

683
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:56,628
know the strains that grow grow well in

684
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,548
Florida are gonna be you know more

685
00:30:56,628 --> 00:31:00,259
equatorial sativas with narrow leaves

686
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:03,019
were versus the ones that grow well in

687
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,240
the mountain areas were in different

688
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:08,960
different different Appalachians

689
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,509
so I I'm a big fan of being able to

690
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,240
incorporate a sustainable ecosystem

691
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:16,909
because every every bad thing in our

692
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,000
that could potentially affect our crop

693
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:23,320
has a natural bed the last thing we want

694
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,528
to do is start inserting genetics into

695
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:31,028
cannabis that could have adverse side

696
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:33,919
good example I've seen frost resistant

697
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:37,250
frost resistant genetic engineering

698
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,669
where they're taking genes that produce

699
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,429
antifreeze in arctic and putting those

700
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:45,320
into plant cultivars how do you feel

701
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,690
about feminized seed then I mean on that

702
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,599
note you know all the farmers using

703
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:53,450
feminized seed on a large scale in hemp

704
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:58,699
agriculture does that raise a flag to

705
00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:00,379
you yes and no so I you know I I don't

706
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,470
consider myself a breeder by any means

707
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:05,509
but you know there are there are for

708
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:09,139
every pool there's there's a use right

709
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:10,519
if I'm plant there's several hundred or

710
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:15,638
several thousand acres

711
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:18,048
those the farmers the farmers that are

712
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:20,569
the farmers that are growing hundreds or

713
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:23,028
thousands of acres don't have the time

714
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:24,648
or money or resources to be able to go

715
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:28,128
through those and select for the

716
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:32,778
dioecious or hermaphroditic plants so in

717
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:35,329
some cases we need those those you know

718
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:37,179
feminized seeds but as a home grower

719
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:40,460
you're probably not going to find me

720
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:41,840
cultivating feminized seeds because the

721
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,450
male plants are the base

722
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,250
of breeding projects so being able to

723
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,159
select for you know good females good

724
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,109
males doing that hybridization and then

725
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,100
in in the case of feminized seeds you

726
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:57,109
know the commercial breeders can then

727
00:32:54,099 --> 00:33:00,439
develop them and I see release them in

728
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:02,839
mass to farmers and hopefully have you

729
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,640
know any given farmer will grow a few

730
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:09,199
cultivars inter inter planted and it's a

731
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,179
good way to be able to create a form

732
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,940
that not only has you know industrial

733
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,590
hemp that's primarily feminized with the

734
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,649
low with a lower risk of

735
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:20,359
cross-pollination but then you know the

736
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:22,639
farmer can spend his time doing other

737
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:25,879
things like you know trying to inter

738
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,788
plant trying to get cover crops going

739
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,110
between the hemp plants and so that I

740
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:32,629
think there's pros and cons with

741
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:33,949
everything it's a lot of people hate on

742
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,870
strains that are that produced

743
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,819
hermaphrodite Didache traits but that's

744
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:40,849
really just the plant doing what it

745
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:43,189
evolved to do thousands of years ago so

746
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:46,428
I'm you won't see me growing feminized

747
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,470
plants but you know I may I may use

748
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:50,298
incorporate feminized plants into some

749
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,429
of the breeding but I think that the

750
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:56,028
bigger concern is when I when I see

751
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:59,360
people selling feminized seed and part

752
00:33:56,028 --> 00:34:00,619
of the material transfer agreements

753
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,750
include that you're not allowed to

754
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:05,019
replant them you're not allowed to

755
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:08,539
hybridize them you're not allowed to

756
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:11,389
bless the seeds and there's there are

757
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:13,128
you know fairly large well known seed

758
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:16,059
distributors that aren't allowing people

759
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:21,079
new breeders to breed with their stock

760
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:24,019
and which cool that's not cool no cuz

761
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,659
you know they know any pieces they're

762
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:28,820
they're incorporating genetics that they

763
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,128
acquired on the open market exactly

764
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,530
doing the doing the work be able to

765
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:36,079
hybridize and stabilize those drinks and

766
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,359
then preventing other people from

767
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,918
hybridizing analyzing those prints so

768
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:41,210
there's there's pros and cons but we

769
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,368
what we want to be able to do is you

770
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,010
know we understand that there is a ton

771
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,409
of money and ton of work incorporated

772
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,570
into developing new lines and we want

773
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:53,210
those breeders to be able to protect

774
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,730
those block but at the same time we

775
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,880
don't want that to new animal

776
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:01,579
all the way point where you know it's

777
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,670
because I'm I'm doing work on genetics

778
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:07,460
from my farm doesn't mean that you if

779
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:10,369
that seed or pollen get out into other

780
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:13,250
people's farm then you have potential

781
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,990
litigation where you do down the street

782
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,108
or over the hill accidentally got

783
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:22,909
pollinated and we've actually seen

784
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:25,608
Monsanto Bayard do that where the BT

785
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:30,289
resistant a pesticide resistant corn got

786
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:35,358
bas pollinated in this due to born being

787
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:38,719
a aerial and feces and then you know

788
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:42,619
those large companies going after it so

789
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:45,169
I you know I have mixed feeling about

790
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:47,630
what some of the genetics companies have

791
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,340
done I'm a big fan of being able to do

792
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,780
genetic testing because I think that

793
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,850
that's going to start developing

794
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,460
intellectual property rights before the

795
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:57,349
breeders but in the same hand we want to

796
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,269
be able to have the open transparency

797
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:01,699
and I think it's a huge conflict of

798
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:04,070
interest or if if I was running a

799
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:06,980
testing lab and all of a sudden I opened

800
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:09,200
up a extraction lab or a farm there's a

801
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,340
potential conflict of interest it's the

802
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,149
same as if you're doing a genetic

803
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,289
testing lab and then start opening up a

804
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,530
genetic distribution pump

805
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:21,590
so I think that any any once you commit

806
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,570
to doing that genetic testing lab you

807
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,440
have to kind of keep that in your as

808
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,330
your wheelhouse

809
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,280
because then you're gonna be the one

810
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:30,380
that's developing the it helping to

811
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,859
develop intellectual property rights for

812
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:36,380
those breeders and I've spent tens of

813
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:39,079
thousands of dollars through company on

814
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,750
doing genetic research getting stuff

815
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:45,139
sequence thirteen for rare phenotypes in

816
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:47,449
the genetics p1 and it's a concern of

817
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:49,879
mine that you know some of those

818
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:52,608
genetics I don't think that any of those

819
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,190
genetics were stolen but I do think that

820
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:57,590
some of that data should have should be

821
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:00,650
available in the public art and as well

822
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:03,519
as should be you know Kirk right because

823
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:07,579
if I find the end-all-be-all genetic

824
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:09,170
mutation that produces entirely CBD V or

825
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:10,848
CBGB

826
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,440
or some of the other rare nab annoys

827
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:15,140
obviously we want to protect those

828
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,179
develop those and then as part of you

829
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:20,029
know raising money to become a business

830
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:22,368
being able to sell them but the last

831
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,380
thing I want to see is you know people

832
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:26,568
like cold and not being able to have

833
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,970
active people like myself and you know I

834
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:32,449
was I left Texas would be able to move

835
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:36,739
Colorado 15 years ago just so I could

836
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:38,088
have access to medicine and I travesty

837
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:40,009
that we have almost a hundred years of

838
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:46,789
prohibition preventing stuff from going

839
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:48,670
you know being available yeah I mean

840
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:53,139
there's a lot of great points there

841
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:56,930
feminize seed to to coal that many

842
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:58,759
plants on an acre per acre basis is a

843
00:37:56,929 --> 00:38:01,818
tremendous amount of infrastructure and

844
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,869
to be able to start non feminized seed

845
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:04,750
takes a lot tremendous money

846
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:06,920
infrastructure and when you're a farmer

847
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,750
you don't have a tremendous amount of

848
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,940
infrastructure always set aside for

849
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:14,989
individual crops it's the main main

850
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:17,980
mainly a catch-all so it's it's

851
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:20,649
extremely difficult when you get into a

852
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,909
large acreage to be able to manage that

853
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,710
it's something I've had to deal with

854
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:26,899
it's something that and continuing I

855
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,639
having to deal with and what's large

856
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:36,500
acreage to you just for the listeners

857
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:38,409
large acres is over over 40 40 acres

858
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,690
I think that's large stars to become

859
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:44,899
something that is requires management

860
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:48,200
and in a much larger scale than then you

861
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,329
can do individually it requires

862
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:54,409
equipment that's much larger than

863
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:56,839
yourself it can be done by humans but

864
00:38:54,409 --> 00:39:00,739
it's it's a tremendous amount of work so

865
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:02,808
that's you know 40 acres and up all the

866
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:09,469
way up to thousand hundreds of thousands

867
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:12,200
of acres so of cannabis of of hemp so

868
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:13,939
yes cannabis sativa L so I just think

869
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,379
it's it's really hard to manage that

870
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,298
when you're when you're coloring things

871
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,640
and it it it requires such

872
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:21,829
infrastructure to start your your your

873
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:23,170
program your genetics so early to be

874
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:24,460
able to select for that and

875
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,559
put them out at the right time so they

876
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,970
actually don't get too big or and then

877
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,480
there's the management of them of the

878
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:33,548
canopy in itself and you know it's why

879
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,650
in the East Coast we don't plant until

880
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:38,318
the second first second week of June

881
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:41,440
because their plants just get too big we

882
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:44,769
can't manage it so that's that's

883
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,750
something I see firsthand and and you

884
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:48,969
know as we learn about this I always

885
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,559
consider cannabis to be an ornamental

886
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,779
that we're attempting to industrialize

887
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:59,559
and there's a lot of things that we have

888
00:39:52,780 --> 00:40:02,019
to understand before we can attempt to

889
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:05,589
start like you said before start taking

890
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:09,130
away things from the gene pool or adding

891
00:40:05,588 --> 00:40:10,750
things to the gene pool so there's those

892
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,599
are major concerns in to bring it back

893
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,639
into the Philo scope I you know I've

894
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,849
worked with Philo's personally and and

895
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:21,818
and like yourself Kelly I I really am

896
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:24,480
fond of the people over there and what

897
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:30,250
they were they've opened my eyes up to

898
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:32,980
it is a very scary thing to me what is

899
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,960
happening amongst the the industry and

900
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,599
and in the world at large in terms of

901
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,760
genetics however I do think that there's

902
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,289
several ways that we can attempt to

903
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,329
protect ourselves and protect the

904
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:46,000
legacies that have gone before us and

905
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:49,359
the preservation aspect is extremely

906
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,130
important and we're all just trying to

907
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,650
make sense of it and I think and not

908
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,599
many people truly understand what is

909
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:58,059
actually truly happening around and I

910
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,940
just wanted to point yeah I just wanted

911
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:02,349
to just say that although you know

912
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,000
Mowgli's been a good friend of mine for

913
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:06,789
a long time what I didn't say is that

914
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,679
what happened and and the rock you know

915
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:11,710
and the shaking that it did within the

916
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:14,588
industry you know is absolutely not okay

917
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:17,798
and it was deceiving and it wasn't what

918
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:19,539
they started out as and it's not a way

919
00:41:17,798 --> 00:41:22,329
to look forward and it's not a way to

920
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:24,750
build trust and that's why we're

921
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:26,920
thankful because it's like yeah chicken

922
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,900
corporations are here and it's for real

923
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,568
and you can lose some [ __ ] ah ha are you

924
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,818
doing best yeah and I just wanted to kid

925
00:41:31,568 --> 00:41:36,099
just to continue that I worked with them

926
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:37,730
submitted 24 samples of my own personal

927
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,230
work

928
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,730
it was not on the pretense that they

929
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,550
were going to open up their own program

930
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,190
and my heart dropped

931
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,359
when I got the call I knew about that

932
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,608
six months before they did the

933
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,289
announcement and my heart was broken I

934
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:54,199
mean this is something that I've done

935
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,670
since I was 14 years old you take away

936
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:58,639
license you take away this whole

937
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:02,570
industry I still do this and it's it's

938
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:05,029
something that deeply profoundly hurt me

939
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,789
on on a deeper level than just in a

940
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:11,060
business move so I just want to point

941
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:13,159
that out that it's it's it isn't okay I

942
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:14,989
don't know how we move forward honestly

943
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,460
I'm trying to make sense of that and I

944
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:19,250
just want to be really open to that if

945
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,220
Mowgli and the team's listening Alicia I

946
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,480
would really like to figure out a way to

947
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:26,149
understand more about what you believe

948
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,800
that you can do for us but I'd really

949
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:31,970
don't see it I just don't so you know

950
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,990
I'd love for them to come on the show

951
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:38,239
Marcus if you can have that and I really

952
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:39,649
love a lot more transparency to the to

953
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,868
the general community and not saying

954
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,430
that you know since all this has

955
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:45,980
happened you haven't attempted to do all

956
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:52,279
that but you've got it we've got to make

957
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:53,900
make this right somehow it's almost

958
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,640
impossible to have a conversation about

959
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,619
it even now while we have this

960
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,150
conversation there's people in the chat

961
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:02,358
room who are claiming we're fully

962
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,430
censoring everything there it's like oh

963
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,619
it's a big conspiracy we're all a part

964
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:09,139
of this conspiracy it's like man listen

965
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:10,940
like everyone thought it was a great

966
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:12,829
thing in the beginning and maybe some

967
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,599
things kind of bounced and bumped and

968
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:16,369
now that people are feeling a little you

969
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:19,369
know for me I still acknowledge that

970
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:21,380
it's confusing to me because I hear a

971
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:23,780
lot of what people are upset about is

972
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,559
not really possible or happening it's

973
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,780
like this made-up

974
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,449
Instagram thing that's not even be it

975
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:31,310
based in reality it's like we're taking

976
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:33,079
old material and they're taking the

977
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:35,630
genetics out and they're creating new

978
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:37,460
plants like no they're not that's

979

1009
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,910

everything I have to say so you know I

1011
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:10,940
hope that that that they fix the thing

1012
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:12,710
so I'm the executive director of the

1013
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:18,590
open cannabis project which is closing

1014
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:21,050
on Friday and I am I'm here to join the

1015
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:25,430
conversation to support and answer

1016
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:27,370
questions and like like Steve and I kind

1017
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:30,769
of talked about yesterday I think that

1018
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:32,569
you know part of what has been I mean at

1019
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,610
this point like I think everyone knows

1020
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,970
the story I've spoken to the press my

1021
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,829
story is out there people can read it

1022
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:43,009
and I think that now I think I'm in a

1023
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:46,599
place they're really being ready to well

1024
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:51,590
1 make space for grieving and processing

1025
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:54,259
2 to make space for you know really

1026
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:57,410
defining like ok if an ethical boundary

1027
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:59,780
has been crossed which it has then we

1028
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:02,788
need to define as a community what our

1029
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:06,109
ethics are so that we can better

1030
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:10,709
I defined what it is that we stand for

1031
00:46:06,108 --> 00:46:13,228
and face and then thirdly you know I

1032
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:15,509
think that I'm ready to just be in a

1033
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:17,748
place that moving forward and solutions

1034
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:20,699
and to do so in a respectful manner and

1035
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:22,168
you know this has been really I I missed

1036
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:24,059
the early part of the call but you know

1037
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:24,538
I heard Kelly mentioned you know that

1038
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:26,849
Mowgli

1039
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:29,549
is a friend and Magli is a friend of

1040
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:32,009
mine too you know like my heart hurts

1041
00:46:29,548 --> 00:46:35,130
for my friend and for our damaged

1042
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:39,059
friendship right now and I think that

1043
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:42,929
you know I want to see amends main on

1044
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:44,640
all sides and I want to find solutions

1045
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:48,088
and I'm here to talk about and I'm

1046
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,650
really great all to have the space and

1047
00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:54,478
hear what people have to say and all of

1048
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:57,028
that I've got a question for Wade I I

1049
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:58,889
have had the honor of cultivating

1050
00:46:57,028 --> 00:47:03,329
harlequin for a little bit over ten

1051
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:06,088
years and you know that was one of the

1052
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:07,919
strains that not only saved my life but

1053
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:10,918
saved multiple other children's legs

1054
00:47:07,918 --> 00:47:13,739
around me and I've done my best to try

1055
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:16,739
and spread those CBD genetics to as many

1056
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:19,019
patients as possible but obviously we're

1057
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:21,539
starting to see some of those genetics

1058
00:47:19,018 --> 00:47:24,958
now getting incorporated into lines that

1059
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:27,509
are being trying to be protected so you

1060
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:29,759
know taking it back kind of we obviously

1061
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:33,958
want to be able to have strains openly

1062
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:38,519
available but you know how do we develop

1063
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:40,798
lines make them publicly available not

1064
00:47:38,518 --> 00:47:43,738
only to the patients but to breeders to

1065
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:46,018
work with and then obviously let's bring

1066
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:48,329
it back to Beth and see how can we not

1067
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:51,328
only you know preserve genetics and the

1068
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:53,489
prior art but also be able to develop

1069
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:57,140
those genetics into potential you know

1070
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:57,139
intellectual property for the companies

1071
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:09,380
great question wish I had an answer if

1072
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:12,318
you look at the model of Harlequin like

1073
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:16,230
THC B was found in the Harlequin as well

1074
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:24,599
which is super interesting see

1075
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:28,469
easiest way yes hello yes I know I can't

1076
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:31,019
hear anyone if anyone doesn't have their

1077
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:33,059
mic muted we won't hear Sam he's only

1078
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:35,009
gonna come in clear if everyone not

1079
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:36,900
talking has their microphone muted

1080
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:50,369
otherwise he's gonna come in choppy like

1081
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:54,980
that I'm not hearing him at all no now

1082
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:59,519
he's stopped talking completely well

1083
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:03,800
I'll try and answer your question I I

1084
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:06,989
love that idea that cannabis is

1085
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,490
incredibly elastic and able to give us

1086
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:13,078
whatever we're looking for if we're

1087
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:14,250
willing to go looking for it so what if

1088
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:32,160
you look at what happened with the

1089
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:36,719
Harlequin I see you guys I hear you guys

1090
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:46,289
Josh and Kelly okay I heard that what

1091
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:48,358
just happened I wanna take I wanted to

1092
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:49,469
take a pause and I want to get back to

1093
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:51,059
this conversation because it's very

1094
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:53,098
important but I want to I want to hear

1095
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,299
from Wendy and Colton as well because we

1096
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,099
haven't heard from them in a long time

1097
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,630
and then Wendy said she had some news

1098
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,550
she wanted to share with us and I always

1099
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,960
like to hear from those guys so we're

1100
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,060
just gonna take a little pause we've got

1101
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,720
lots more to talk about in regards to

1102
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:08,759
Philo's but let's hear from the Turner's

1103
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:13,699
how is the world turning for the

1104
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,720
Turner's oh no no no now their

1105

1107
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,210
this somehow some way let's see

1108
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,699
Turner's thumb and today it's been a

1109
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:31,500
quite a

1110
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:36,989
a lot of technical difficulties let's

1111
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:39,210

1112

1113
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:46,679
is so strange didn't we hear them when

1114
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,690

1115
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:52,619
I don't know if you're on a Mac but I

1116
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:53,579
have found that yeah reconnected maybe

1117
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,349
try Chrome

1118
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:58,650
it's the Google it works best with

1119
00:50:55,349 --> 00:51:00,509
Google Chat so yeah nobody's nobody's

1120

00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:03,330
want to hear from you I don't want them

1122
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,010
to you know have to wait around for

1123
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:06,900
hours while we discuss Philo's because

1124
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:08,670
we can go back and and have more of a

1125
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,559
discussion and I want to hear you know

1126
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,180
there's there's people going off in the

1127
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,239
chatroom they want to hear about you

1128
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:17,069

1129
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,449
part in Philo's in the beginning they

1130
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,100
were the two of the first people that

1131
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:22,199
brought it to my attention for sure and

1132
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:27,360
so we want to hear from them let's let's

1133
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:30,239
see if we hear you guys now no oh my

1134
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,099
goodness I hate when this stuff happens

1135
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,809
this is like the last time I basically

1136
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,579
stopped doing hashed Church because I

1137
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:38,250
couldn't get my I couldn't hear anyone

1138
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:41,670
it but it's not just me nope that's not

1139
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:43,619
hearing so we recycled our page and just

1140
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,570
refreshed it and that helped us and

1141
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,409
maybe somebody else can do that we'll

1142
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,390
see how that goes

1143
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:54,839
you just refreshed just your thing and

1144
00:51:48,389 --> 00:52:00,269
you got a saying I am plugged my

1145
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:05,539
microphone I mean I'll just maybe if

1146
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:11,519
anyone can hear us I think I feel like

1147
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:15,029
it's large corporations act differently

1148
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:17,070
than the common like person on the

1149
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:19,470
street you know and it's not to say that

1150
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:22,019
corporations are bad because a lot of us

1151
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,429
have corporations and we can do a lot of

1152
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:25,230
good with them and there's even be

1153
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:27,480
corporate you know B Corp and B

1154
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:29,219
corporations which are really awesome

1155
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,079
and allow you to take you know

1156
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:36,419
foundation money tax free and that's

1157
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:38,759
really important but I think with people

1158
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,010
like Philo's and different companies and

1159
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,210
and even other big distribution

1160
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,109
companies that are out there you just

1161
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,838
start

1162
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:47,159
investment and you start getting

1163
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:49,650
millions and hundreds of millions of

1164
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:52,170
dollars and then it's nearly impossible

1165
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:55,318
for you to keep an authentic true

1166
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:57,298
rightful vision when you have hundreds

1167
00:52:55,318 --> 00:53:00,028
of millions of dollars coming in because

1168
00:52:57,298 --> 00:53:02,670
the energy just shifts and it takes it

1169
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:04,768
away from the original mission and I

1170
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:07,139
think that's what we're seeing on so

1171
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:09,479
many fronts you know here in Canada you

1172
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:11,518
know farms are either having to join a

1173
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,489
large corporation or be incredibly savvy

1174
00:53:11,518 --> 00:53:16,379
on their own to be independent of that

1175
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:17,789
so I think that is a big part of the

1176
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,858
problem and right now we're having

1177
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:22,230
discussions on you know what we were

1178
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:25,710
talking about earlier with acreage and

1179
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:27,690
how big can a farm you know scale and

1180
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:30,239
still be regenerative and it goes into

1181
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:32,220
the same notion of how big can a

1182
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,309
corporation scale and still be

1183
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:37,919
regenerative you know how can we create

1184
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:40,380
systems really that are brand new to us

1185
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,269
you know we've seen really small

1186
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,910
businesses go to big massive

1187
00:53:42,268 --> 00:53:47,008
corporations and how can we blend those

1188
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:50,940
so that people are still having a say

1189
00:53:47,009 --> 00:53:52,829
and as well and that that that the rules

1190
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,499
and the regulations are for the people

1191
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:59,009
and I think that cannabis is really

1192
00:53:55,498 --> 00:54:01,348
giving us this new voice or this new

1193
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:03,690
idea to you know how are we going to

1194
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:05,910
tackle these things and I'm really

1195
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:09,108
thankful that so it's opened our eyes to

1196
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:13,618
a lot of different things there's some

1197
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:14,759
social responsibility so all I could

1198
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:17,249
call it

1199
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:18,778
yeah I'll introduce a term that everyone

1200
00:54:17,248 --> 00:54:22,498
should be using corporate social

1201
00:54:18,778 --> 00:54:24,088
responsibility you know as you know

1202
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:26,248
independent growers are becoming

1203
00:54:24,088 --> 00:54:29,338
companies and then they transition into

1204
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:32,068
publicly traded companies they have a

1205
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:33,748
responsibility to their shareholders but

1206
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:36,929
part of that responsibility to the

1207
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:40,498
shareholders you know you can't include

1208
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:42,239
corporate social responsibility so since

1209
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:44,699
we are the people that are everybody

1210
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:48,690
who's watching this everybody who is on

1211
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:50,578
this call has the were creating an

1212
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,380
industry and part of that industry we

1213
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:55,019
have the opportunity to create good

1214
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,880
corporate social responsibility and that

1215
00:54:55,018 --> 00:54:59,119
comes down to the decisions

1216
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,539
that we make you know do we cultivate

1217
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,519
using pesticides do we cultivate

1218
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:07,949
regenerative ly do we do we extract

1219
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,920
using sustainable methods or non

1220
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:15,049
sustainable methods and while there's

1221
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:17,880
plenty of money to be made while the

1222
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:20,610
price of cannabis is artificially

1223
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,099
inflated due to regulation as we

1224
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:24,690
transition into a commodity crop I'm I'm

1225
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:27,019
a firm believer that a lot of the people

1226
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,240
that are not cultivating sustainably

1227
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:36,980
aren't going to be able to compete

1228
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:40,649
because you know we can produce acres as

1229
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:42,570
cheaply is you can home grow and even

1230
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,639
cheaper you can you can if you're

1231
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:46,260
cultivating using cover crops you don't

1232
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,759
have to pay for a Newton as many

1233
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,300
nutrients and that makes it far more

1234
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,880
sustainable but you know when it comes

1235
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,650
to developing IP companies that are

1236
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,320
developing intellectual property have

1237
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:00,780
have a responsibility to be able to make

1238
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,390
those products available to as many

1239
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,550
people as possible and what part of the

1240
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:08,789
reason why I've been I consider it such

1241
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:10,680
an honor to be that mark and everyone

1242
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:12,239
has kind of popped on the church the

1243
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,059
church train is because we've been able

1244
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:17,629
to disseminate some of this prior art to

1245
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:20,099
the public while at the same time

1246
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:27,930
promoting good corporate social

1247
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:30,059
responsibility so well put Mike thank

1248

coming up here next month and how people

1263
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,119
can learn how to cultivate more

1264
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:16,949
sustainably

1265
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:20,489
perfect how's it going dude dude sorry

1266
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:23,129
my battery died out in the farm Hey yeah

1267
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:25,259
I'll see if I can i can't unplug is my

1268
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:28,160
battery dad but I'm not transplanting

1269
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:32,130
these clones first part the seedlings

1270
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:34,949
and I was cool that Sam is an because I

1271
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:36,840
remember hearing and a hash search maybe

1272
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:40,379
about about this time last year he was

1273
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:42,240
talking to Eric for Jim about yes this

1274
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:45,300
German so I'm doing I'm using this tool

1275
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:48,239
so I'm behind and so I'm transplanting

1276
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:51,750
into four inches so I can cut these

1277
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:53,549
seedlings in the dark for 24 hours and

1278
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:55,199
then bring them back outside and in two

1279
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,780
weeks down the road they they'll show

1280
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,389
the sexes and so I can call my males

1281
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,390
from there and so pretty cool tech I

1282
00:58:00,389 --> 00:58:05,039
appreciate that

1283
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:07,199
well yeah so you're talking about the

1284
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,949
the aquaponics course we're doing here

1285
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:10,829
in a couple weeks

1286
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:14,009
yeah Steve excuse me Steve and I I'm

1287
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:16,110
really excited I've never hosted people

1288
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:18,840
on my farm so I'm a little bit nervous

1289
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,970
about it you know it's kind of feels

1290
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,680
like I'm getting down to my underwear or

1291
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:24,599
something and showing my my really

1292
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:27,239
special spot you know it's just mines in

1293
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:29,579
my spot so but I'm really excited and

1294
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:31,289
we're gonna basically just kind of share

1295
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:33,179
everything that we have it'll be really

1296
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:34,889
you know because it's on my farm I can

1297
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:38,789
walk through you know how I do my seeds

1298
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:42,539
how do i do my clones my whole processed

1299
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:44,250
and so yeah and then it there of course

1300
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:47,400
it's an aquaponics focused and we're

1301
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:50,480
gonna build a system here on my farm

1302
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,980
I've already got the reservoir dug and

1303
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,079
it'll be just a way for the folks can

1304
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,240
walk away and say this is how I can

1305
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,250
simply build a commercial scale you know

1306
00:58:57,239 --> 00:59:01,289
a foot wide aquaponic bed that'll be a

1307
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:04,920
hundred feet long you know and you think

1308
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:06,900
you can scale from there so great

1309
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,510
information to be sharing I mean I I'm

1310
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,880
sure that people will get a lot out of

1311
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:14,400
it I know that from going to your last

1312
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,250
conference there that you did it was

1313
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,410
just it was simultaneous to lift which

1314
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:22,739
was very unique in the sense that I saw

1315
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:24,119
them both I just saw them as both like

1316
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:25,859
parts the

1317
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:28,199
need to like fit into one another you

1318
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:31,470
know like so much of lift had no idea

1319
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:33,509
what was going on at your conference and

1320
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:36,149
so much of what was going on at your

1321
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:38,550
conference was everything that was

1322
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:40,559
missing from the lift conference and

1323
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,910
everything those people needed I just

1324
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,679
thought oh my god like if only these

1325
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:45,179
[ __ ] realize like they just

1326
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:48,059
need to walk two blocks down the street

1327
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:49,289
and all of their consultants all of

1328
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:52,860
their like they're just sitting right

1329
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:54,869
there the people that they need and it's

1330
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:57,450
just it's just you know I think that

1331
00:59:54,869 --> 01:00:00,179
with humans we just only know how to

1332
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:02,039
divide and it's just so much like I'm

1333
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:04,889
really as I get older all about this

1334
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:07,679
cuivre idea and concept of having many

1335
01:00:04,889 --> 01:00:10,289
arrows in my quiver rather than a single

1336
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,000
arrow in my quiver you know like from an

1337
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:14,250
extraction standpoint being a part of a

1338
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,840
company that has seven different types

1339
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,969
of extraction including solvent

1340
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,490
extractions that has never been my

1341
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:22,319
interest or focus whatsoever but I did

1342
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:27,089
get to the point where I realized that

1343
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:29,519
my opinion is may be smaller than the

1344
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:31,079
opinions of the masses and what they

1345
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:32,759
want to have access to people want to

1346
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,409
have access to everything they don't

1347
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,790
want just one or the other you know

1348
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:37,619
although they make it seem like that

1349
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:40,860
when they put a fence down the middle

1350
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:44,069
and sort of pick one or the other you

1351
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:46,230
just it's it's hard it's a hard thing

1352
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:47,820
man it really is because like what

1353
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:50,460
everyone's been talking about is there's

1354
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:52,740
this part of us that's lost and like

1355
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:55,320
I'll personally want to see you know the

1356
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:57,089
world be full of small farmers you know

1357
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,090
I think that would change the world in a

1358
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:01,680
better way a hundred percent but you

1359
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,210
know and this is where I guess you would

1360
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,940
never hear the 14 year old me saying

1361
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:07,500
this about this but part you know what

1362
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:11,700
we have is is a large agricultural

1363
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,590
system and to take advantage of it to be

1364
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:15,929
able to hop into it and change it from

1365
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:17,309
within is the opportunity we have with

1366
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:20,219
him right now and I'm just kind of

1367
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:21,539
realizing that and myself right now with

1368
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:24,029
you actually just getting to meet some

1369
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:26,070
folks from the conference Tara Lee who

1370
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:29,190
hops on all the time her and her husband

1371
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:30,750
they they service you know big AG in

1372
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:34,039
Washington and all the hemp farmers they

1373
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:36,750
sell fittings and sprayers and tanks and

1374
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:38,009
they explained to me that folks will set

1375
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,869
up these nutrient ARDS

1376
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:42,510
you know we'll be a two three five acre

1377
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:44,730
facility and they'll don't be making big

1378
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:47,250
new tanks and these semis will come in

1379
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:49,050
and feed off these these new tanks and

1380
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:51,539
then go out and you know apply to the

1381
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,769
fields and her thought was like why

1382
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:55,170
don't you and Layton do that with your

1383
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:57,360
compost tea and why don't you grow hemp

1384
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:59,220
and you know in Eastern Washington you

1385
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,950
know it's just like yeah that's kind of

1386
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:04,529
cool but as I've gotten involved in hemp

1387
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:06,210
in the last couple weeks I planted

1388
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:08,610
thirteen hundred seeds last night I'm

1389
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:09,960
actually applied for my permit I'm doing

1390
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,490
hemp up here on my property and I'm

1391
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,470
really stoked on it I'm kind of just

1392
01:02:11,489 --> 01:02:15,419
figuring it out and and I'm realizing

1393
01:02:13,469 --> 01:02:16,799
that that's a huge way to make an impact

1394
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:18,659
and so we're talking about kind of

1395
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,970
partnering together and I'm gonna you

1396
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:23,069
know grow the seed that we can then use

1397
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:25,469
to sell to farmers and kind of get them

1398
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:26,880
on a different path you know you want to

1399
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:29,279
start on a new crop and here's a way

1400
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,619
that we can help facilitate building up

1401
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,470
your soil you know in the same token so

1402
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:37,079
I kind of see it I feel both sides of it

1403
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:39,589
honestly you know it's just it's the

1404
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:42,150
world we live in in some some respects

1405
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,950
well cannabis is unique in the sense

1406
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,930
that it's been in the shadows it's been

1407
01:02:43,949 --> 01:02:49,109
in the closets it's been in the basement

1408
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:51,119
and it has this like attachment to it

1409
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:53,610
unlike anything else I've ever seen

1410
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,859
where there's this real like like I

1411
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:57,660
think it teaches people compassion and

1412
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,880
empathy and they're rooted in those

1413
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:02,099
experiences with cannabis and then they

1414
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,230
can't remove it even though they're also

1415
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:06,690
like it's removed them from this prison

1416
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:09,119
of being a slave to a monetary system

1417
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:10,470
usually at a young age you like you

1418
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,239
figure out like holy [ __ ] like if I

1419
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:14,549
bring like a couple ounces of this [ __ ]

1420
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:16,169
like all my friends will buy it and then

1421
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,789
they've got friends that will buy it you

1422
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:22,039
figure out pretty early on that you can

1423
01:03:17,789 --> 01:03:24,449
make money selling cannabis it's it's

1424
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,940
yeah it's crazy well you know I

1425
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:28,799
definitely think cannabis is special in

1426
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,440
that respect for sure Kelly talks about

1427
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,900
it a lot and i you know but i believe

1428
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,400
all plants really have that in them and

1429
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,349
i've been listening to like the

1430
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:40,079
regenerative agriculture podcast with

1431
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:41,789
this this john kemp guy and he's got

1432
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,529
these old school farmers on there that

1433
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:46,320
are converting over to regenerative

1434
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,760
style and I'm so damn impressed you know

1435
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,320
because at the heart of it all these

1436
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,710
farmers even the guys that are using

1437
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:56,269
using chemicals they really

1438
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:57,829
the earth you know yeah they can't make

1439
01:03:56,269 --> 01:04:00,170
money they're pressed and they're making

1440
01:03:57,829 --> 01:04:02,390
bad decisions and like if you can show

1441
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:04,519
them of the right way they're all about

1442
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:05,900
it you know be in this is out on this

1443
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:08,150
podcast I just want to shout it out

1444
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:09,889
because it's just brought showed me how

1445
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:11,450
how you know these old farmers are

1446
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:12,529
converting anger it's changing their

1447
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:13,848
lives and the way they look at

1448
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:16,460
agriculture and the way they look at

1449
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:17,660
their their own happiness you know and

1450
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,490
well-being it's just it's really

1451
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:21,139
powerful you know what I feel the police

1452
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:23,209
are having the same revelation with

1453
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:25,429
enforcing cannabis laws as these

1454
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:26,900
cannabis laws deteriorate it's it's much

1455
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:29,779
the same thing where they're just like

1456
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:32,358
any cop can tell you like obviously

1457
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:35,480
people who use cannabis do not cause us

1458
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:37,699
any problems like that's the no you ask

1459
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,440
any cop or anyone that works at 911 I'll

1460
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:41,659
tell you like alcohol is a big problem

1461
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,940
you know like gangs are a problem

1462
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:46,429
there's drunk driving and but like

1463
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:48,950
people just using cannabis not a problem

1464
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:51,379
yeah in the farming's away of life as

1465
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:53,899
well you know so it's and they're better

1466
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:56,960
drivers as we found out you know through

1467
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:58,548
signs which i think is very awesome to

1468
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:17,750
take some hits and go on a nice little

1469
01:04:58,548 --> 01:05:20,210
drive it's partly our responsibility

1470
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:22,460
that way we feel about you know just

1471
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:24,170
your growing you know in a way that's

1472
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,900
better for the earth it's just like you

1473
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,730
know we're even big large agriculture

1474
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:30,740
whatever everyone's gotten sick at one

1475
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:32,059
point we've talked about this before or

1476
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:34,298
me know they see some kind of

1477
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:38,410
degradation and so I just think it's

1478
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:41,150
important for us to do our best to

1479
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:42,558
regenerate life on Earth so you know

1480
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:44,030
people say well you know what is

1481
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,710
regenerative farming regenerative

1482
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:47,690
farming is soil that's better at the end

1483
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:51,170
of the year than when it started or

1484
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:54,108
you've planted more new things on your

1485
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:56,539
property every year and that's a good

1486
01:05:54,108 --> 01:05:58,159
start and earlier you know you all we're

1487
01:05:56,539 --> 01:06:00,139
talking about that it's great you know

1488
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:02,358
people want different choices well I

1489
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:04,429
think that if people are educated on the

1490
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,549
choices that they're given they're going

1491
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:08,279
to definitely true

1492
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:09,810
choose you know the earth and they're

1493
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,830
gonna choose something healthy and

1494
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:12,150
they're gonna choose something that

1495
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:13,500
makes them feel good and they're gonna

1496
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:15,389
choose something that is socially

1497
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,699
responsible because I think innately

1498
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:20,429
people really want to make the right

1499
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:23,189
decisions but unfortunately it's such a

1500
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:26,069
vast amount of bad information and

1501
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:28,440
marketing and look over here and shiny

1502
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:31,080
flossy you know that is just really

1503
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,030
leading you know more money and greed

1504
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:35,429
and I think that we have a social

1505
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:37,260
responsibility as cannabis farmers right

1506
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:40,169
now because we are here having this

1507
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:41,970
conversation that we need to educate our

1508
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:44,369
patients we need to educate our

1509
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:46,559
consumers and give them the choice on

1510
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:48,929
you know what it is that they can have

1511
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,239
and I feel like that's really important

1512
01:06:48,929 --> 01:06:53,699
in moving in the future yeah creating a

1513
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:56,789
new system a different system one you

1514
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:57,329
know like the the Swedish schoolgirl

1515
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:59,250
there

1516
01:06:57,329 --> 01:07:00,599
Greta thunderbird and I'm sure you guys

1517
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,760
have seen her speak she's really

1518
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:04,710
inspirational she's like when in front

1519
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,180
of the UN and was talking about climate

1520
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,949
change and telling the adults they

1521
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:09,569
weren't responsible enough and that you

1522
01:07:07,949 --> 01:07:11,489
know that they were just they were like

1523
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:12,840
we're gonna take this over now and she

1524
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:15,389
basically said when there are no

1525
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:18,120
solutions to find for your in your

1526
01:07:15,389 --> 01:07:20,579
system then it's time for a new system

1527
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:22,710
you know like you don't like Kat she's

1528
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:25,110
15 years old like if you haven't seen

1529
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:28,289
her before Greta Thunderbird Google her

1530
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:32,130
up and check out her her whippin that

1531
01:07:28,289 --> 01:07:34,139
she gave to to the UN address there I it

1532
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:36,090
kind of reminded me of David Suzuki's

1533
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:37,980
daughter who also did a pretty good one

1534
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:41,550
back in the 80s if you haven't seen that

1535
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:43,920
one where she also just like lays into

1536
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:45,990
the United Nations it's pretty pretty

1537
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,309
inspirational but yeah Greta thunbergii

1538
01:07:45,989 --> 01:07:50,609
never heard of her

1539
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:52,739
Albert Einstein Stein also says that

1540
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:56,309
when you've run out of solution

1541
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:58,949
you've lost your creativity hmm there

1542
01:07:56,309 --> 01:08:00,539
you go interesting we still can't hear

1543
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:13,769
the Turner's is this like gonna be the

1544
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:17,819
torture of my day sorry I don't know

1545
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:18,569
what was going on normally well you guys

1546
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:20,159

1547
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:22,020
lot and we do appreciate you spending

1548
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:26,548
time with us on this Sunday of

1549
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:34,049
afternoons how is everything going crazy

1550
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:38,278
I bet yeah yeah foundation called the

1551
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:41,789
Turner foundation nice we are going to

1552
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:44,819
be raising funds to fund research into

1553
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:47,250
the medical benefits of cannabis dude

1554
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:49,109
that is so amazing that is perfect for

1555
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:50,849
you guys to be doing you're the perfect

1556
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:52,619
face for such a foundation and I'm

1557
01:08:50,849 --> 01:08:55,230
definitely gonna go out of my way and

1558
01:08:52,618 --> 01:09:02,969
bend over backwards to help raise funds

1559
01:08:55,229 --> 01:09:06,178
for your foundation we found that every

1560
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:07,859
time we go to a doctor with Colton that

1561
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:12,298
they say oh there's no evidence that

1562
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:14,520
cannabis works right here here's your

1563
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:16,828
evidence right here you know I I don't

1564
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:20,339
know how much more blatant you can get

1565
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:23,189
then Colton Turner's : and and even more

1566
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:25,920
so than that the words of a mother who

1567
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:27,388
was going through losing a son and then

1568
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,980
have it turned around and like how do

1569
01:09:27,389 --> 01:09:30,719
you not just put like we all have

1570
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:32,129
mothers we all have nothing but respect

1571
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:38,698
for our mothers it's like if the mom

1572
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:42,239
says so then it shall be so how is that

1573
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:46,019
not proof enough exactly I don't know I

1574
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:47,789
mean these these doctors we this is the

1575
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:50,339
challenge that we have is that these

1576
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:52,229
doctors don't listen they don't care

1577
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:54,960
they have their own mindset they have

1578
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:56,968
their own agendas and you know Colton

1579
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,210
sat in the hospital for 31 days just

1580
01:09:56,969 --> 01:10:04,980
recently because had an ulcer in his

1581
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:06,658
stomach or in his duodenum and they kept

1582
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:07,769
saying oh no it's his Crohn's this is

1583
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:11,339
Crohn's disease Crohn's and we're like

1584
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:13,110
no it's not as Crohn's and and they were

1585
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,940
like yet but it is but it is but it is

1586
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,679
and I'm like but it isn't I'm like why

1587
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:19,859
are you why are you not listening to us

1588
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:21,359
um so one of the things that one of the

1589
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:23,009
reasons why they don't want to listen is

1590
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,819
because we were cannabis patients and

1591
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:29,460
are they Keith and and that we don't

1592
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:31,960
have the evidence the clinical proof

1593
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,510
that cannabis actually works

1594
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:38,770
in the United States now there is tons

1595
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:41,409
of studies across the world Israel Spain

1596
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:45,370
Canada that are coming out with some

1597
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:47,199
major major awesome evidence that that

1598
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:50,260
cannabis works for a multitude of

1599
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:53,139
situations but here in the US the

1600
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,190
doctors are still you know it's not FDA

1601
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,829
approved

1602
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:58,988
it's federally illegal still it's a

1603
01:10:56,829 --> 01:11:03,069
Schedule one blah blah blah we've all

1604
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:06,488
heard the [ __ ] and we're tired of it

1605
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:11,429
so we we want to create a foundation for

1606
01:11:06,488 --> 01:11:15,669
by the time it becomes available to test

1607
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:18,039
to have these FDA approvals to make sure

1608
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:21,640
that like when when you guys are talking

1609
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:25,659
about genetics the it's so important

1610
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:28,300
because I don't know why it works in

1611
01:11:25,659 --> 01:11:31,349
Colton and I don't know if it's a

1612
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:35,110
specific cannabinoid if it's a specific

1613
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:36,550
genetic if it's a specific strain um but

1614
01:11:35,109 --> 01:11:41,049
we've had to go through all of this

1615
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:44,400
craziness and try to figure it out you

1616
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:46,810
know we need more evidence we need more

1617
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,729
research we need more people like you

1618
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:51,550
guys

1619
01:11:47,729 --> 01:11:53,289
doing the work and you can't really do

1620
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:55,840
the work when you're trying to run a

1621
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:59,050
business too so we're hoping that this

1622
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:04,390
foundation is going to allow people

1623
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:08,560
farmers cultivators MIPS people you know

1624
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:12,520
product and inventors to have the money

1625
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:14,890
to do extra research on patients to make

1626
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:17,770
sure that what their what their product

1627
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:20,170
is is actually working for patients it's

1628
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:22,570
so crazy that it's this once again this

1629
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:24,819
division where you have this sort of

1630
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:26,469
like oh we want to do things organically

1631
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:27,880
and regenerative lis and they're like oh

1632
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:30,010
we're gonna do it with salts and we're

1633
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,690
gonna do it monster style and then you

1634
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:33,340
have the same thing happening with you

1635
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:35,109
guys where you're like you gotta kind of

1636
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:39,190
are the representation of the organic

1637
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:41,679
farmer being listen Bobby I just put up

1638
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:43,659
the doctors and they're just like no no

1639
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,930
it's his crohn's we know we went to

1640
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:48,729
school for quite a while it's fine this

1641
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:51,310
look we'll get to you here in a second

1642
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:53,979
it's just unbelievable that there's why

1643
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:56,140
don't we have a system that engages the

1644
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:58,089
people in a different way like that uses

1645
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:01,630
both eastern and western medicine but

1646
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:03,579
also engages the patient as part of this

1647
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:05,710
experience rather than just being talked

1648
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:07,449
to like you know you're a wall but being

1649
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:09,460
like listen to what I have to say like

1650
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:12,399
it's really important what we tell you

1651
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:14,260
is going to help you diagnose what's

1652
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:17,469
going on here because you're not with us

1653
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:19,690
24/7 and and we are you know like how

1654
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:22,539
you not listen to that I don't know

1655
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:26,619
I honestly that is the question of the

1656
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:30,430
millennium I don't know why why patients

1657
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:32,619
aren't listened to I see it every single

1658
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:35,079
day on Facebook in all of these groups

1659
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:36,550
that we were involved in my doctor

1660
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:39,399
doesn't listen my doctor said it was

1661
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:41,170
this my doctor said that the Salar

1662
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:44,139
wasn't giving me those those side

1663
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:48,369
effects and we hear it every single day

1664
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:50,289
and then we're well you know they they

1665
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:52,210
don't want to listen to the cannabis

1666
01:13:50,289 --> 01:13:54,699
situation you know they don't want to

1667
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:57,130
say that cannabis actually does help

1668
01:13:54,699 --> 01:14:00,189
with inflammation they don't want to say

1669
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:02,739
that it can actually Crohn's or cancer

1670
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:04,149
or any of these diseases no they can't

1671
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:06,279
believe it they want to deny that

1672
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:08,019
reality they're like I deny that reality

1673
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:12,159
and replace it with an artificial

1674
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:15,310
version of my own exactly exactly and I

1675
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:16,720
don't know because of the big you know

1676
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:21,610
they're getting a lot of money from this

1677
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:24,190
these pharmaceutical companies kickbacks

1678
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:26,319
from the cannabis industry and so is

1679
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:28,929
that the reason why we don't know I

1680
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:31,029
think that most doctors are good though

1681
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:33,520
and want to do well in their Hippocratic

1682
01:14:31,029 --> 01:14:35,710
oath is that they shall do no harm like

1683
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,870
how you they must be so cognitively

1684
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:39,819
dissonant to what is going on and have

1685
01:14:37,869 --> 01:14:42,579
convinced themselves no no this is fine

1686
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:44,439
I've met great doctors I know there are

1687
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:46,539
great healer they're healers they're

1688
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:47,979
people that want to help heal people but

1689
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:50,529
there's something how gone down this

1690
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:52,359
road where you know I think it's part of

1691
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:55,000
the schooling and the teaching you know

1692
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:56,679
it's very much like it's not it once

1693
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,960
again to use the metaphor it's not very

1694
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,760
regenerative the way they learn

1695
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,730
medicine and the way they go about

1696
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,039
healing in in wet in Western medicine

1697
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:07,299
and at least that it's not accepting of

1698
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:08,920
cannabis I mean they've never been

1699
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:11,710
taught about the endocannabinoid system

1700
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:13,420
can you imagine being a doctor and not

1701
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:15,189
having been taught about an entire

1702
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:16,960
system like imagine them not being

1703
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:21,639
taught about the central nervous system

1704
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:24,010
or the immune system i know i i've

1705
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:26,260
worked with so many doctors over in

1706
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:28,600
third world countries and i've helped

1707
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,430
set up clinics and we have to recruit

1708
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,950
doctors from all different parts of the

1709
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:34,989
world for them to come over and work in

1710
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:37,300
our little small clinics that don't have

1711
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:40,509
a lot of machines that go being and

1712
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:43,810
don't have you know you know a lot of

1713
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:46,000
that stuff so they have to be required

1714
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:49,690
to use their hands and to use their

1715
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,329
intuition and in working in a clinic you

1716
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:53,738
know there's obstetricians that come

1717
01:15:52,329 --> 01:15:55,869
from all over the world and they're the

1718
01:15:53,738 --> 01:15:57,909
best in their field but when they don't

1719
01:15:55,869 --> 01:16:00,460
have their Doppler their machines they

1720
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:03,969
don't actually know how to work with

1721
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:07,239
patients and they actually feel ripped

1722
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:09,399
off they feel as if they you know went

1723
01:16:07,238 --> 01:16:11,589
into a system where they wanted to

1724
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:14,349
become a healer and they didn't really

1725
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:15,969
get that information so unfortunately

1726
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:17,590
here we go back to what you all were

1727
01:16:15,969 --> 01:16:20,380
talking about earlier x' we're set up

1728
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:22,900
within a system that's totally broken

1729
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:25,090
and there's something about humanity

1730
01:16:22,899 --> 01:16:27,429
that continues to set up systems that we

1731
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:29,469
can't actually work within and I don't

1732
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:31,690
know what you know that issue is that's

1733
01:16:29,469 --> 01:16:33,579
something really large and existential

1734
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:36,789
and like you go on for hours and hours

1735
01:16:33,579 --> 01:16:39,090
but going back to doctors you know they

1736
01:16:36,789 --> 01:16:41,260
are not getting the proper education

1737
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:44,680
education is through pharmaceuticals

1738
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:46,420
they can't tell you about curative they

1739
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,180
can just tell you what pharmaceutical

1740
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:51,340
works and I think that that's incredibly

1741
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:54,010
unfortunate and I blame that on the

1742
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:56,110
system yet again and I think that a lot

1743
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:57,820
of it is because we live in such a

1744
01:16:56,109 --> 01:17:02,259
society that is instant gratification

1745
01:16:57,819 --> 01:17:04,899
and they they just don't want to take

1746
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:09,070
the time anymore and you know Colton sat

1747
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:12,279
in the hospital for 31 days and 31 days

1748
01:17:09,069 --> 01:17:12,609
they did nothing but he was he was

1749
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:15,819
getting

1750
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:17,589
sicker and sicker and sicker and I was

1751
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:19,329
like what what are you gonna do you're

1752
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:23,230
telling me the same thing over and over

1753
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:26,139
and over again but you're wrong and you

1754
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:28,269
you're not listening to us and I don't I

1755
01:17:26,139 --> 01:17:31,539
didn't understand why that kept going

1756
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:33,310
you know at other than you know finally

1757
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:34,929
one of the doctors come in and said well

1758
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:37,270
why aren't you giving him his cannabis

1759
01:17:34,929 --> 01:17:39,310
and I'm like I can't he doesn't have a

1760
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:41,889
card in the state of Illinois anymore

1761
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:45,190
and they and she was like I try to find

1762
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:47,260
some anyway you know if that was that's

1763
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:49,509
what works for them then we can do it

1764
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:51,190
and then finally we were just like then

1765
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:53,829
give us a medicine so we can get out of

1766
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:57,250
this place and we take we get him out of

1767
01:17:53,829 --> 01:17:59,760
the hospital and here here it goes you

1768
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:02,529
know we give him extra cannabis you know

1769
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,020
double his dose and he's flying again

1770
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:07,868
you know and all of a sudden all

1771
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:09,489
everything is gone and and he's back to

1772
01:18:07,868 --> 01:18:12,368
normal and he's gaining weight he's

1773
01:18:09,488 --> 01:18:13,539
gained like 30 pounds and the doctors

1774
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:16,658
just wanted that instant gratification

1775
01:18:13,539 --> 01:18:21,310
or they wanted to do the surgery so they

1776
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:23,229
could have that $50,000 and for whatever

1777
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:25,360
reason I know that there are patients

1778
01:18:23,229 --> 01:18:26,709
out there that have great doctors and I

1779
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:29,259
know that there are great doctors out

1780
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:31,750
there but I just don't think that they

1781
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:34,630
understand the plant as much as what we

1782
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:36,789
do and what you guys do and I think that

1783
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:40,029
that's where the disconnect is I think

1784
01:18:36,789 --> 01:18:42,929
that me as as cannabis the compan abyss

1785
01:18:40,029 --> 01:18:46,988
community really need to get into

1786
01:18:42,929 --> 01:18:49,420
educating about genetics and about about

1787
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:51,309
how things work in our bodies with the

1788
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:53,829
cannabis plants I think that's the

1789
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:57,489
biggest disconnect yeah and you're gonna

1790
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:59,439
start to see you know doing FDA trials

1791
01:18:57,488 --> 01:19:02,079
in order to create cannabinoid

1792
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:06,039
pharmaceuticals is fairly expensive and

1793
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:09,158
in a black market or unregulated market

1794
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:12,429
the it's difficult to raise money to

1795
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:15,368
fund that sort of research maybe what I

1796
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:17,289
what I liken it to is you know we have a

1797
01:19:15,368 --> 01:19:20,139
couple of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals

1798
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:22,840
that have been fda-approved and you know

1799
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:26,139
when you I have a couple family members

1800
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,389
that are doctors and while they see the

1801
01:19:26,139 --> 01:19:31,659
potential medical benefit in cannabis

1802
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:34,510
their Hippocratic oath do no harm

1803
01:19:31,658 --> 01:19:36,339
you know prevents them from suggesting

1804
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:38,079
or recommending herbal supplement

1805
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:41,010
cannabis or nutraceutical cannabis

1806
01:19:38,078 --> 01:19:43,808
they're obliged to only provide

1807
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:45,369
pharmaceutically approved drugs because

1808
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:46,809
they're concerned those pharmaceutical

1809
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:50,438
approved drugs have gone through

1810
01:19:46,809 --> 01:19:52,479
multiple tiers of FDA review in order to

1811
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:54,189
assure that there is no potential

1812
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:57,429
side-effects or minimize the potential

1813
01:19:54,189 --> 01:20:01,030
side-effects now as the industry starts

1814
01:19:57,429 --> 01:20:02,828
rolling you see wider acceptance you're

1815
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:05,319
gonna start to see more of those

1816
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:07,328
cannabinoid pharmaceuticals but what

1817
01:20:05,319 --> 01:20:10,958
we're really seeing in the in the CBD

1818
01:20:07,328 --> 01:20:13,478
realm is broad acceptance as well as

1819
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:16,208
broad deployment of cannabinoid herbal

1820
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:18,189
supplements and nutriceuticals now a

1821
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:19,479
herbal supplement is going to be

1822
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:21,880
regulated differently than a

1823
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:24,639
nutraceutical or a pharmaceutical but

1824
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:27,189
they in we as patients need all three

1825
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:29,859
you know the pharmaceuticals are

1826
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:33,369
necessary in order to get them listed on

1827
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:36,488
insurance prescribed by doctors under

1828
01:20:33,368 --> 01:20:39,908
doctor's supervision but you taking

1829
01:20:36,488 --> 01:20:43,268
drugs through FDA trials in order to

1830
01:20:39,908 --> 01:20:45,308
make a pharmaceutical grading takes

1831
01:20:43,269 --> 01:20:48,639
millions of dollars takes years of

1832
01:20:45,309 --> 01:20:51,639
trials that have to be supervised and in

1833
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:54,668
the US it's incredibly difficult my my

1834
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:57,880
lab in Illinois applied for to supply

1835
01:20:54,668 --> 01:21:01,148
night of four years and three or four

1836
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:03,819
years ago now NIDA has yet to review any

1837
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:07,149
of the applications there's currently

1838
01:21:03,819 --> 01:21:09,130
one supplier for the company and we're

1839
01:21:07,149 --> 01:21:11,349
talking about a company a company in

1840
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:13,418
Illinois that has billions of dollars of

1841
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:15,578
resources already affiliated with

1842
01:21:13,418 --> 01:21:19,208
multiple universities and willing and

1843
01:21:15,578 --> 01:21:20,889
capable of doing that research but until

1844
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:23,618
we actually had the federal law change

1845
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:27,309
we can't we have to do that research

1846
01:21:23,618 --> 01:21:29,168
abroad so I've done some work trying to

1847
01:21:27,309 --> 01:21:32,739
create some of that research in foreign

1848
01:21:29,168 --> 01:21:34,498
countries but until the US federal law

1849
01:21:32,738 --> 01:21:37,958
gets off their high horse and

1850
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:39,849
reschedules D schedules or creates a

1851
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:42,639
exemption for medical can

1852
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:45,370
this research a lot of the doctors are

1853
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:47,619
kind of stuck in that mindset where they

1854
01:21:45,369 --> 01:21:50,590
want to see a cannabinoid pharmaceutical

1855
01:21:47,619 --> 01:21:52,119
pill that and when we have those pills

1856
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:55,119
they can be covered by insurance that's

1857
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:57,369
great but what they cannot talk about

1858
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,899
just due to the lack of research they

1859
01:21:57,369 --> 01:22:01,479
are the nutriceuticals and herbal

1860
01:21:58,899 --> 01:22:03,969
supplements and we have a wonderful

1861
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:05,559
opportunity to be able to create

1862
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:07,810
companies with good corporate social

1863
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:10,690
responsibility to create herbal

1864
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:12,960
supplements to minimize the deleterious

1865
01:22:10,689 --> 01:22:15,659
effects of many medical conditions and

1866
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,399
you know we can't make medical claims on

1867
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:20,349
nutriceuticals or herbal supplements but

1868
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:21,849
we can formulate them in ways that we

1869
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:25,270
know that they're going to be beneficial

1870
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:27,460
to our microbiome and that and I think

1871
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:30,760
that's really the key is being able to

1872
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:33,279
you know everybody says he did it an

1873
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:35,920
apple a day keeps the doctor away eat

1874
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,380
your greens cannabis should be treated

1875
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,630
as a essential amino acid it should be

1876
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:42,579
treated as a essential fatty acid it

1877
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:46,539
should be treated as a quintessential

1878
01:22:42,579 --> 01:22:50,140
part of the dietary intake of all humans

1879
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:52,359
and the difficult part is you know when

1880
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:55,630
many doctors have gone to school over

1881
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:57,429
there you know the past 50 years but the

1882
01:22:55,630 --> 01:23:00,699
endocannabinoids system has not been

1883
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:03,070
really researched and it wasn't

1884
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:05,019
discovered until those 80s it's not

1885
01:23:03,069 --> 01:23:07,599
really research or even taught in

1886
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:09,520
universities and we're seeing the same

1887
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,950
thing the endocrine system wasn't really

1888
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,870
discovered until the 50s you could not

1889
01:23:11,949 --> 01:23:17,109
learn about the endocrine system in the

1890
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:19,659
human in any med school until the 80s

1891
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:22,089
and 90s and all of a sudden we're

1892
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:24,489
starting to see lots of you know doctors

1893
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:27,730
specifically studying and Akron biology

1894
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:29,349
to help treat the hormone issues and a

1895
01:23:27,729 --> 01:23:32,739
lot of those hormone issues are created

1896
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:35,050
by bad diet we're bad by bad microbiota

1897
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:37,599
in your system that's you know not

1898
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:41,230
creating the right ecosystem within our

1899
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:44,590
microbiome so I think that as you know

1900
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:46,809
as sites like granny crows list becomes

1901
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:51,850
more widely dispersed no granny crows

1902
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:53,970
lit list has 700 reviewed research

1903
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:59,010
papers on cannabis but

1904
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:59,460
Stormcrow thank you thank you thank you

1905
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,170
late

1906
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:03,930
yeah it's so being able to provide that

1907
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:06,210
education to the doctors knew they

1908
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:09,150
cannot prescribe the nutraceutical

1909
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:12,600
herbal supplements just due to due to

1910
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:15,449
the regulations but they can kind of you

1911
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:17,400
we can as a community create good

1912
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:20,069
corporate social responsibility educate

1913
01:24:17,399 --> 01:24:21,569
those doctors as well as you know kind

1914
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:26,699
of promote that research through the

1915
01:24:21,569 --> 01:24:28,439
companies that were developing how to do

1916
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:30,300
the same thing is I had to force my

1917
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:32,579
doctors to understand that cannabis was

1918
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,650
helping with my conditions and just like

1919
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:36,029
Michelle Rainey back in the late

1920
01:24:34,649 --> 01:24:38,579
eighties during the 90s we put together

1921
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:40,500
doctors educational packages enough

1922
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:42,239
education of some of them are 36 pages

1923
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,279
long just for the applications in order

1924
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:46,289
to apply for medical marijuana in Canada

1925
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,449
but we put together little doctor

1926
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:50,399
packages I focused on injured workers

1927
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:52,380
spinal cord injury Michelle's focus on

1928
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:54,479
cancer stuff like that like yourself we

1929
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,460
can focus on getting those paths just

1930
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,559
put together that has all of that data

1931
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:00,960
that we've actually you can look to

1932
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,310
PubMed case journal stuff like that and

1933
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,140
and just put together a nice little

1934
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,580
doctor's package one above your Aussie

1935
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:07,170
bus you can present it but here's the

1936
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:08,010
data that we have here's the stuff that

1937
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:10,079
I'm working on it

1938
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:11,699
there's a foundation and and get more

1939
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,319
people on board I think it's kind of

1940
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:15,000
like more back to the grassroots of

1941
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:16,319
being able to like they're not going to

1942
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,520
click on the link but if you give them

1943
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:20,009
something that they can sit back at a

1944
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,600
coffee and read then they might draw

1945
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:23,039
some interest and they see how what's

1946
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,390
working for you and they can see the

1947
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:26,550
benefits and I think it's really

1948
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:28,740
important that we still offer that

1949
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:30,300
little little packages to the doctors

1950
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:32,819
and stuff like that in order to get the

1951
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:34,260
education out there in the draws more

1952
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:35,960
interest I mean there's so many

1953
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:38,220
different ways of being able to get

1954
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,800
doctors to understand how it's working

1955
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:42,350
for one another and your prime example

1956
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,520
of what you're doing like just getting

1957
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:46,500
getting that information out there I

1958
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,180
think it's a good idea too and I

1959
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,890
remember when you were doing that John

1960
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:52,140
because even when you took me to go see

1961
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:55,140
my doctor you brought a like a big it

1962
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:57,829
way more than 36 pages in 500 hundred

1963
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:00,300
pages or something but you know

1964
01:25:57,829 --> 01:26:02,369
basically if we can get these type of

1965
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,949
really good packages for specific things

1966
01:26:02,369 --> 01:26:06,689
you know to these doctors and you get it

1967
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:06,988
out to enough doctors eventually what

1968
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:10,049
we're going

1969
01:26:06,988 --> 01:26:12,448
we're gonna find the cool doctor the one

1970
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:14,760
who's really willing to hear and listen

1971
01:26:12,448 --> 01:26:17,328
and that doctor will be so important

1972
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:20,010
those doctors because they are the ones

1973
01:26:17,328 --> 01:26:22,828
that will go on to teach the other

1974
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:25,199
doctors that we'll never hear this from

1975
01:26:22,828 --> 01:26:27,448
from from a certain type of person

1976
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:30,238
basically a non doctor no you're not

1977
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:32,129
going to teach a doctor about medicine

1978
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:35,069
it's just like it's uh it's part of

1979
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:38,130
their ego like 99.9% of them cannot be

1980
01:26:35,069 --> 01:26:40,529
taught and there's this one and I seen

1981
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:42,748
John get through to them the little 1%

1982
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:43,738
where it's just like this is great stuff

1983
01:26:42,748 --> 01:26:45,300
do you have any more and they're

1984
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:46,709
devouring it and reading it and they're

1985
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,329
interested in it now they're going and

1986
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:50,550
doing in their own deep dives and those

1987
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:53,509
I think those doctors will be very

1988
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:56,489
important in the sort of education of

1989
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:58,920
you know this the line of doctors that

1990
01:26:56,488 --> 01:27:00,928
are that are up now but more so the new

1991
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,519
line the the the new group that will be

1992
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:04,710
coming and going through medical schools

1993
01:27:02,519 --> 01:27:08,460
clearly the endocannabinoid system has

1994
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:09,840
to be taught in medicine they have to be

1995
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:13,679
doing it now I think it's going to be

1996
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:17,038
mandatory in yeah we have over a hundred

1997
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:19,498
years of bad PR to get around and

1998
01:27:17,038 --> 01:27:21,929
there's only one there's only one

1999
01:27:19,498 --> 01:27:23,819
university teaching cannabinoid classes

2000
01:27:21,929 --> 01:27:26,149
that I've heard about there's a couple

2001
01:27:23,819 --> 01:27:28,679
of cannabis trade schools but I believe

2002
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:32,038
there's a University Michigan that you

2003
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:34,170
can take a certificate for cannabinoids

2004
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:36,149
well if you're a doctor in Canada or

2005
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:39,649
know she look up the synergies three was

2006
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:42,629
presented in 2012-2013 in the educated

2007
01:27:39,649 --> 01:27:44,939
1200 to 1600 doctors across Canada on

2008
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:47,069
opioid system the endocannabinoid system

2009
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:50,158
and how it was very similar and how it

2010
01:27:47,069 --> 01:27:52,498
worked with in the CNS it was actually a

2011
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,569
really good little thing and it's great

2012
01:27:52,498 --> 01:27:55,800
for a good start for doctors in Canada

2013
01:27:54,569 --> 01:28:01,529
to look at because it's our to be

2014
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:05,909
presented I think one of the things

2015
01:28:01,529 --> 01:28:08,819
that's going to come is as people become

2016
01:28:05,908 --> 01:28:12,238
more aware of the fact that cannabis

2017
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:15,689
itself can't do any harm as doctors

2018
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:17,428
start understanding how true that is in

2019
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:19,649
association with the benefits that

2020
01:28:17,429 --> 01:28:20,980
cannabis can do when they start looking

2021
01:28:19,649 --> 01:28:22,839
at the pharmacopoeia

2022
01:28:20,979 --> 01:28:25,869
all the pharmaceutical drugs that they

2023
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:29,860
have every one of them has a lethal dose

2024
01:28:25,869 --> 01:28:31,988
every one of them can kill you and often

2025
01:28:29,859 --> 01:28:35,019
create all kinds of other problems many

2026
01:28:31,988 --> 01:28:37,449
of the old people that I speak with are

2027
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:39,790
taking multiple pharmaceutical drugs and

2028
01:28:37,449 --> 01:28:41,409
when you start digging into that whole

2029
01:28:39,789 --> 01:28:42,880
list of things and start looking at

2030
01:28:41,409 --> 01:28:46,029
side-effects some of the drugs are

2031
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,859
prescribed to offset side-effects of

2032
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,539
other drugs that they're taking and you

2033
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:51,729
end up with this mad salad of

2034
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:53,590
pharmaceuticals in their bodies and it

2035
01:28:51,729 --> 01:28:56,289
creates all kinds of health problems and

2036
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:58,630
what's true is when you start

2037
01:28:56,289 --> 01:29:00,670
eliminating those and you start working

2038
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:02,710
with whole plant cannabis medicine

2039
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:05,130
that's the thing it's like when you look

2040
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:07,800
at specific isolated compounds like

2041
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:12,220
Marinol is supposed to be a

2042
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:14,619
pharmaceutical replica of THC and yet

2043
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:16,630
they you see widely different results

2044
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:20,349
from marinol it just doesn't work as

2045
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:23,230
well as straight-up cannabis and again

2046
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:27,160
no lethal dose with cannabis there's all

2047
01:29:23,229 --> 01:29:29,379
these potential benefits from its use I

2048
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:34,319
think it was Russo that should be

2049
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:37,210
credited with the concept of the

2050
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:40,000
endocannabinoid deficiency syndromes and

2051
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:41,289
it's and it's basically a list of all

2052
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:47,020
kinds of conditions everything from

2053
01:29:41,289 --> 01:29:51,970
autism to cancer to epilepsy to EMS to

2054
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:54,880
Hodgkin's lymphoma on and on that all of

2055
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:57,610
these conditions respond some better

2056
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,800
than others to cannabis preparations and

2057
01:29:57,609 --> 01:30:02,349
the suggestion there is that all of

2058
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:04,659
these are conditions that arise from

2059
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:08,020
imbalance in the endocannabinoid system

2060
01:30:04,659 --> 01:30:10,988
and it's not any one cannabinoid it's

2061
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:13,300
not CBD it's not THC it's not CVC it's

2062
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:15,099
the whole symphony of this beautiful

2063
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:18,100
chemistry that this plant that we love

2064
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:22,600
so much makes that's where the magic is

2065
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:24,730
and what doctors and patients all across

2066
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,130
the world are starting to understand is

2067
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:29,769
that it's the plant itself and the

2068
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:33,219
chemistry she produces that's going to

2069
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:36,370
do this healing work for us when when

2070
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:38,800
Kelly was referencing working with

2071
01:30:36,369 --> 01:30:41,529
clinics where doctors from Western

2072
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:44,440
medicine don't have their machines that

2073
01:30:41,529 --> 01:30:47,170
but they still see a healing and that's

2074
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:49,029
the thing healing happens in hospitals

2075
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:51,520
but it also happens in homes and

2076
01:30:49,029 --> 01:30:54,189
increasingly at home people are making

2077
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:57,130
preparations from the cannabis plant and

2078
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:59,439
seeing benefit from it for people that

2079
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:02,829
they love and that's because it actually

2080
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:05,049
works it addresses the endocannabinoid

2081
01:31:02,829 --> 01:31:08,670
deficiencies that we're all experiencing

2082
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:13,029
because of the toxic effects of stress

2083
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:15,819
insufficient biome in our diet on and on

2084
01:31:13,029 --> 01:31:18,840
and on the list goes but many of us are

2085
01:31:15,819 --> 01:31:22,059
experiencing these health issues and

2086
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:24,760
what's true is cannabis has the

2087
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:27,370
potential to be a benefit to all of

2088
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:30,429
those conditions and the trick is

2089
01:31:27,369 --> 01:31:35,139
finding the preparations that will

2090
01:31:30,429 --> 01:31:37,750
benefit that person but and Turner's

2091
01:31:35,139 --> 01:31:40,300
family you're a perfect example of it

2092
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:41,979
you've got the you found the preparation

2093
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:43,989
that was going to help Colin you

2094
01:31:41,979 --> 01:31:46,479
increase the dose to the point of

2095
01:31:43,988 --> 01:31:49,149
benefit and he was able to leave the

2096
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:52,269
hospital and I'm blown away to hear that

2097
01:31:49,149 --> 01:31:55,539
you say I think you said he gained 30

2098
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:57,940
pounds where did where did you put that

2099
01:31:55,539 --> 01:32:03,880
on your body as you're sitting there I

2100
01:31:57,939 --> 01:32:07,899
don't see it that's all I'm gonna sign

2101
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:10,600
up and listen yeah I don't know where he

2102
01:32:07,899 --> 01:32:14,589
put it either he eats like crazy and

2103
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:17,560
he's just so he's just a bin kid but

2104
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:19,840
when it comes to when you were talking

2105
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:23,170
about genetics earlier and talking about

2106
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:26,230
whole plant and in making sure that this

2107
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:29,050
the spectrum is there and one of the

2108
01:32:26,229 --> 01:32:31,269
things that we we were kind of back and

2109
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:33,820
forth on that and that's what scares us

2110
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:38,110
is that the medicine that he takes is

2111
01:32:33,819 --> 01:32:40,960
actually an isolate and and only because

2112
01:32:38,109 --> 01:32:45,158
there was an issue with th TV with him

2113
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:46,719
so with a Crohn's patient you know he he

2114
01:32:45,158 --> 01:32:47,109
has a hard time gaining weight so when

2115
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:48,609
he gay

2116
01:32:47,109 --> 01:32:51,239
thirty pounds within this last six

2117
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:55,539
months we've been really really happy

2118
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:57,519
but th TV is an appetite suppressant so

2119
01:32:55,539 --> 01:33:02,170
making sure that people who don't have

2120
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:05,080
wasting syndromes like Colton not get th

2121
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:09,190
TV is very very important so when it

2122
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:11,559
comes to isolate versus versus full

2123
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:14,500
spectrum this is a really really hard

2124
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:17,200
situation for us because th TV you know

2125
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:19,600
is you know bad for Pete it's not

2126
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:22,420
necessarily bad because it helps people

2127
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:25,660
who just want to lose lay or have

2128
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:27,819
diabetes and I've also heard that people

2129
01:33:25,659 --> 01:33:30,909
with PTSD have been benefiting from th

2130
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:35,979
TV but for someone with a wasting

2131
01:33:30,909 --> 01:33:39,309
syndrome its deadly so we need to care

2132
01:33:35,979 --> 01:33:41,409
that we are taking the cannabinoids we

2133
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:44,620
need we need to be able to identify the

2134
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:47,619
adverse effects you know I I have been

2135
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:51,849
greatly benefited by CBD and CBD V but

2136
01:33:47,619 --> 01:33:53,949
th TV in particular in stressful

2137
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:58,060
situations can trigger my Atlantic

2138
01:33:53,949 --> 01:34:00,729
seizures and so in general I avoid

2139
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:04,060
strains with th TV but I also know

2140
01:34:00,729 --> 01:34:10,959
people who I've treated depression

2141
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:12,820
fitted by CBD and CBD but these

2142
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,189
cannabinoids make sure that we

2143
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:18,250
understand the genetics of these plants

2144
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:21,669
and and I think genetics is just exactly

2145
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:27,670
where we need to be studying is is very

2146
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:30,970
crucial to the the history and into the

2147
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:33,430
future of this plant making sure to have

2148
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:37,360
specific medicine for specific diseases

2149
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:40,710
um and and we can grow those on the

2150
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:43,599
plants and in coordinates with what

2151
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:46,989
Colton needs for Crohn's disease or what

2152
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:50,440
you know Sally needs for her seizures or

2153
01:34:46,989 --> 01:34:53,739
whatever you know and and those you know

2154
01:34:50,439 --> 01:34:56,019
hopefully and can help determine that

2155
01:34:53,739 --> 01:34:58,889
this this strain is better for Crohn's

2156
01:34:56,020 --> 01:35:02,190
or that strain is better for cancer and

2157
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:05,400
because even the terpenes matter and and

2158
01:35:02,189 --> 01:35:07,829
it's it's just it's a wild ride and and

2159
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:10,589
we have so far to go and I think that

2160
01:35:07,829 --> 01:35:14,029
creating this foundation and making sure

2161
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:18,090
that we are supporting people that are

2162
01:35:14,029 --> 01:35:22,469
that are researching every single aspect

2163
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:24,659
of this plant is it's so so so important

2164
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:26,670
I think it goes back to the quiver once

2165
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:28,489
again because if once again the division

2166
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:31,230
of humanity you just you see people like

2167
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:34,649
you know they'll make these super strong

2168
01:35:31,229 --> 01:35:36,599
posts about how why isolate is wrong and

2169
01:35:34,649 --> 01:35:38,429
it's all about full spectrum and I get

2170
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:41,700
it it's like yeah skunk man Sam showed

2171
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:44,369
us all about Turkey in modulation in the

2172
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:46,109
early 2000s and years later some of

2173
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:48,029
those people like Ed Rosenthal wrote

2174
01:35:46,109 --> 01:35:49,559
articles about Mersin and mangos and

2175
01:35:48,029 --> 01:35:52,019
Ethan Rousseau came out with the

2176
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:53,880
entourage effect and you know 20 years

2177
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:55,290
later this conversations escalated to

2178
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,880
the point where everyone's really hip

2179
01:35:55,289 --> 01:35:58,859
and they're on it and they it's like

2180
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,690
yeah yeah some people need terpenes some

2181
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:02,549
people would like isolate some people

2182
01:36:00,689 --> 01:36:04,379
don't want this cannabinoid some people

2183
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:06,420
want these two cannabinoid it's like we

2184
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:08,369
need to have access to all of it we need

2185
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:10,470
to be able to take it apart and study in

2186
01:36:08,369 --> 01:36:11,970
and figure out mechanisms and then we

2187
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:13,860
need to have access to full plant

2188
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:16,710
regenerative lis organically grown like

2189
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:19,349
beautiful cannabis but once again I just

2190
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:21,869
fall on both sides in the sense of like

2191
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:23,490
both are as important and obviously as

2192
01:36:21,869 --> 01:36:26,609
Colton sits there telling us that he's

2193
01:36:23,489 --> 01:36:28,769
taking isolate right now obviously it

2194
01:36:26,609 --> 01:36:30,659
has it's a very dangerous statement to

2195
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:31,740
go out and say you know ISIL it's not

2196
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:33,989
going to do it for you

2197
01:36:31,739 --> 01:36:35,880
you need full-spectrum and then what are

2198
01:36:33,989 --> 01:36:37,920
people's versions of full-spectrum you

2199
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:40,319
know like are they collecting the entire

2200
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:42,449
cannabinoid and terpene profile and all

2201
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:44,250
the different types of trichomes that

2202
01:36:42,449 --> 01:36:45,630
are present on their plant probably not

2203
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:47,489
if they're doing traditional hash

2204
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:49,050
methods they're probably leaving most of

2205
01:36:47,489 --> 01:36:51,359
the bulbous heads behind so that won't

2206
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:53,010
be full-spectrum there's just so many

2207
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:56,039
different ways of looking at it I think

2208
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:57,780
personally let's make sure everything is

2209
01:36:56,039 --> 01:37:00,619
available for those that want to have

2210
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:00,619
access to it

2211
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:08,700
absolutely and so we we obviously want

2212
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:10,289
to be able to leave yeah I'd love to

2213
01:37:08,699 --> 01:37:12,149
here stands take on all this I know

2214
01:37:10,289 --> 01:37:14,609
you've been working with Marinol for

2215
01:37:12,149 --> 01:37:17,009
extremely long time and it would be

2216
01:37:14,609 --> 01:37:23,039
really helpful and really great insight

2217
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:25,980
to hear your insight on that well IIIi

2218
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:30,000
can talk about that but what I actually

2219
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:33,809
wanted to talk about was genetic IDs for

2220
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:37,350
just a moment I don't know if everybody

2221
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:40,440
heard that in Colorado they are now

2222
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:45,810
allowing a plant registration of

2223
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:50,669
cannabis varieties under you pop as

2224
01:37:45,810 --> 01:38:00,810
anybody heard that yes I have

2225
01:37:50,670 --> 01:38:05,899
SAMHSA's cone as four patents I've heard

2226
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:05,900
several people say that you know patents

2227
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:25,510
the plant that hasn't existed in nature

2228
01:38:21,069 --> 01:38:30,159
and the only way they can prove about is

2229
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:32,560
is has it been tested and is it in the

2230
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:35,139
literature then you can patent it and

2231
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:39,420
you could challenge it all you want but

2232
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:44,020
unless you can prove that was already he

2233
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:46,960
in public domain before the patent then

2234
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:48,550
you can't fight it is that right can

2235
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,230
everyone hear him clearly because it

2236
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:55,810
sounds like he's coming in and out to me

2237
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:59,289
I lost a big chunk of that but I got the

2238
01:38:55,810 --> 01:39:08,200
very end of it I got most of it yeah I

2239
01:38:59,289 --> 01:39:11,670
have a real problem site i I don't know

2240
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:11,670
what to do to make it any better

2241
01:39:13,979 --> 01:39:18,000
smoke some hash that always makes

2242
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:21,600
everything better

2243
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,600
smoke some hash

2244
01:39:21,869 --> 01:39:26,409
except when you've dropped your dabber

2245
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:29,739
and it literally fell through a port all

2246
01:39:26,409 --> 01:39:39,069
that is gone my dad was gone my debtor a

2247
01:39:29,739 --> 01:39:40,929
diver has fallen I didn't totally hear

2248
01:39:39,069 --> 01:39:44,199
everything what was he saying that it

2249
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:46,119
was really hard to patent no he was

2250
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:49,119
saying that listen if it's if you can

2251
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:51,340
prove that it's never a part of the open

2252
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:54,279
source market you've got something

2253
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:58,449
unique you can you can pay patented he's

2254
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:59,679
basically saying I mean there's I don't

2255
01:39:58,449 --> 01:40:02,199
know if you guys want to get into like

2256
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:03,789
technical patent land but I'm I'm here

2257
01:40:02,199 --> 01:40:05,590
to provide that information if you would

2258
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:06,430
like it there's also Sunday morning I

2259
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:09,850
don't know if it's too early for

2260
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:12,850
technical patent land doesn't land give

2261
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:17,650
you give you Pat land prior art in a

2262
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:22,480
cannabis genetic realm sure no all right

2263
01:40:17,649 --> 01:40:26,829
so within so prior art in the genetic

2264
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:28,209
realm so all tools prior arts sorry

2265
01:40:26,829 --> 01:40:28,519
there's people talking in my house I was

2266
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:30,710
making

2267
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:32,750
hard to talk to you guys I'm gonna go

2268
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:35,050
tonight which is actually better anyway

2269
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:39,039
because it's like beautiful out there

2270
01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:45,140
and then we can spend time on the garden

2271
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:48,409
okay sorry about that though prior art

2272
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:50,119
in the genetics realm so prior art in

2273
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:53,960
general is any sort of like

2274
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:56,989
documentation about a like any kind of

2275
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:58,939
invention that exists and when you know

2276
01:40:56,989 --> 01:41:01,819
just to give people an idea of the

2277
01:40:58,939 --> 01:41:04,549
process when an application goes to

2278
01:41:01,819 --> 01:41:07,460
Patent Office the patent examiner has

2279
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:09,320
the obligation to look for all kinds of

2280
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:11,090
things that might be similar to it you

2281
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:12,949
know so like it's like something comes

2282
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:14,510
in someone says they invented something

2283
01:41:12,949 --> 01:41:16,819
there's a bunch of claims and then

2284
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:18,920
patent examiner's go and look for things

2285
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:22,460
that match the claims in the document

2286
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:24,680
and that the evidence and the documents

2287
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:27,350
that they look to is known as prior art

2288
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:28,820
so within the realm of prior art there

2289
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:30,350
are some specific rules about what is

2290
01:41:28,819 --> 01:41:33,019
and is not prior art at least within the

2291
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:34,610
u.s. also I'm not I should also always

2292
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:36,770
just say I'm not a lawyer and this is

2293
01:41:34,609 --> 01:41:38,029
not legal advice but there's the stuff

2294
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:40,340
that I've learned from talking to lots

2295
01:41:38,029 --> 01:41:42,710
of lawyers and if there's any lawyers

2296
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:44,119
out there I always ask them to if I if

2297
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:46,159
I'm technically incorrect about anything

2298
01:41:44,119 --> 01:41:49,460
please openly correct me I am playing

2299
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:50,539
with that but in any case but my

2300
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:52,489
undertaking is the way it works is so

2301
01:41:50,539 --> 01:41:55,880
you know anything that the Patent Office

2302
01:41:52,489 --> 01:41:58,130
looks to is known as prior art and there

2303
01:41:55,880 --> 01:42:00,560
definitely there's a whole section in

2304
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:02,989
the patent code that is about what is

2305
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:06,260
prior art they definitely look at things

2306
01:42:02,989 --> 01:42:08,439
like old patent applications and they

2307
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:10,520
also definitely look to things like

2308
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:12,259
academic journals and printed

2309
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:15,140
publications and another sort of set

2310
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:17,739
list of things one of those set lists of

2311
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:20,720
things is the National Center for

2312
01:42:17,739 --> 01:42:23,719
Biotechnology information the NCBI and

2313
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:25,940
for genetic information and for genetic

2314
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:28,520
data and for genetic data that has been

2315
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:30,979
referenced on Open cannabis project it

2316
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:33,110
is all actually hosted on the National

2317
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:34,669
Center for Biotechnology information so

2318
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:36,649
from a genetics and prior art

2319
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:38,210
perspective that's really the place

2320
01:42:36,649 --> 01:42:39,889
where it goes

2321
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:44,630
and where it's the most important place

2322
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:47,239
to look to I've spoken with a last year

2323
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:49,130
I got on the phone with the with a

2324
01:42:47,238 --> 01:42:51,289
supervisor at the Patent Office in the

2325
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:53,690
plant department and let him know about

2326
01:42:51,289 --> 01:42:56,479
data open cannabis project org he also

2327
01:42:53,689 --> 01:42:59,569
knew about the FiOS galaxy so those two

2328
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:02,750
things at least and through that kind of

2329
01:42:59,569 --> 01:43:05,539
realm are considered by at least by some

2330
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:07,399
as prior art so and it's the prep the

2331
01:43:05,539 --> 01:43:08,359
plant officer told me that it was

2332
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:12,289
something that he wanted to make sure

2333
01:43:08,359 --> 01:43:13,639
that his department knew about so in any

2334
01:43:12,289 --> 01:43:15,590
case so that's sort of how genetics

2335
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:17,000
plays into prior art but within the

2336
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:18,770
realm of the actual patents that are

2337
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,719
coming in part of the reason why Open

2338
01:43:18,770 --> 01:43:22,790
cannabis projects which to collecting

2339
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:25,010
chemical data last year was because a

2340
01:43:22,789 --> 01:43:27,079
lot of the patent applications coming in

2341
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:29,420
actually reference chemical compounds

2342
01:43:27,079 --> 01:43:31,729
and chemical formulations and so that

2343
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:34,190
actually also becomes in some ways at

2344
01:43:31,729 --> 01:43:36,889
least right now more important with

2345
01:43:34,189 --> 01:43:38,750
regards to prior art however many people

2346
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:40,520
have argued that even though genetic

2347
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:42,560
information isn't as useful right now

2348
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:45,770
for prior art it can be useful in the

2349
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:47,390
future and when it comes to doing the

2350
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:49,040
most robust kind of prior art

2351
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:51,560
documentation which is something that

2352
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:53,779
open cannabis project was not ever able

2353
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,660
to do but maybe is something that can

2354
01:43:53,779 --> 01:43:58,159
come from future efforts and like you

2355
01:43:56,659 --> 01:44:00,079
know new partnerships and all that kind

2356
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:03,289
of stuff is the idea of actually doing

2357
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:05,269
whole plant documentation and similar if

2358
01:44:03,289 --> 01:44:07,579
anyone's listening to dr. Eleanor Koontz

2359
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:08,930
who is kind of my hero in this and her

2360
01:44:07,579 --> 01:44:10,789
work at the candor herbarium

2361
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:13,390
which she's talking about is actually

2362
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:15,949
doing really sip like thorough

2363
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:19,640
documentation of the cannabis plant

2364
01:44:15,949 --> 01:44:21,590
itself which provides more information

2365
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,960
that would be useful to the Patent

2366
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:25,579
Office such as you know what strains

2367
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:28,489
it's been and to breeder is actually

2368
01:44:25,579 --> 01:44:31,250
honestly depending on how you share and

2369
01:44:28,488 --> 01:44:33,468
sort the information you know what you

2370
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:36,439
know what strains have been bred with

2371
01:44:33,469 --> 01:44:38,300
the strain what environment was it grown

2372
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:40,309
in like what other special information

2373
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:42,020
can you share about the lineage of this

2374
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:44,120
plant and what's on into it like that

2375
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,640
when you're talking about like what is a

2376
01:44:44,119 --> 01:44:48,680
plant I mean I think that most people

2377
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:50,989
agree that it's like genetics plus

2378
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:52,039
environment plus cultivation equals

2379
01:44:50,988 --> 01:44:54,429
phenotype

2380
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:56,449
so like all of that really needs to be

2381
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:59,060
documented if we're gonna do really

2382
01:44:56,449 --> 01:45:01,309
thorough prior art documentation and

2383
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:02,840
then that that information can be as

2384
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:06,440
long as that information is searchable

2385
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:08,300
and organized enough and submit you can

2386
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:09,769
submit it to the Patent Office in

2387
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:12,560
booklet form which is something that I

2388
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:14,060
think that as we look to solutions for

2389
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:18,050
getting prior art in front of the Patent

2390
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:19,640
Office it's either creating which we to

2391
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:22,489
do with open cannabis project MIT

2392
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:24,140
actually has a prior art database it

2393
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:27,829
would be great to get all of these

2394
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:29,750
cannabis strains into that I haven't

2395
01:45:27,829 --> 01:45:31,250
gotten a an answer on whether they'll do

2396
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:33,590
that and of course universities are in

2397
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:35,449
this really tough position when it comes

2398
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:36,860
to information about cannabis because

2399
01:45:35,449 --> 01:45:39,679
it's still federally illegal and they

2400
01:45:36,859 --> 01:45:41,479
get a lot of federal funding so but in

2401
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:43,360
any case that's the least hopefully

2402
01:45:41,479 --> 01:45:45,829
beginning to help answer the question

2403
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,929
and I'm happy to answer any more but

2404
01:45:45,829 --> 01:45:50,840
speaking to the idea that like people

2405
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:51,440
can just patent things already in the

2406
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:54,260
public domain

2407
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:56,839
I would I would actually say that you

2408
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:59,930
know whether people realize that or not

2409
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:02,630
like people have like open cannabis

2410
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:04,100
project medicinal genomics pylos the

2411
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:07,430
cannabis community people have made a

2412
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:08,990
lot of noise about saying hey don't

2413
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:12,500
issue patents on things that already

2414
01:46:08,989 --> 01:46:14,359
exist and I would you know I haven't

2415
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:16,850
actually seen any more over-broad

2416
01:46:14,359 --> 01:46:18,739
patents issued since the Pharrell

2417
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:21,260
potentially over-broad patents issued

2418
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:23,479
since the first ones that has been

2419
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:26,030
issued to the biotech Institute right so

2420
01:46:23,479 --> 01:46:28,069
I don't act and like I know that patent

2421
01:46:26,029 --> 01:46:30,979
applications like that are coming in but

2422
01:46:28,069 --> 01:46:34,670
how many do you see so far zero so to

2423
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:36,169
some degree I don't see as much like of

2424
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:37,850
an actual risk from the Patent Office

2425
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:39,649
patenting things that are already in the

2426
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:41,810
public domain because there is more

2427
01:46:39,649 --> 01:46:44,119
information available now and people

2428
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:46,370
have made us think about it and they

2429
01:46:44,119 --> 01:46:49,670
know about all of these references and

2430
01:46:46,369 --> 01:46:52,039
since so it's yeah so I don't I think

2431
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:54,680
that there is reason to fear it but I

2432
01:46:52,039 --> 01:46:56,840
also think that as where I think a lot

2433
01:46:54,680 --> 01:47:00,440
of the litigation that's gonna happen

2434
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:01,789
with regards to over broad patents and

2435
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:03,409
taking things out of the public domain

2436
01:47:01,789 --> 01:47:05,099
and actually has a lot more to do with

2437
01:47:03,409 --> 01:47:07,319
like herbal formulations

2438
01:47:05,099 --> 01:47:09,659
and like formulation and processing

2439
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:12,840
methods than it does on the plant

2440
01:47:09,658 --> 01:47:17,279
Sunstone so anyway that's my long-winded

2441
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:19,199
nerdy rant feel free to so normally when

2442
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:22,819
you're developing a patent application

2443
01:47:19,198 --> 01:47:27,569
for genetic cultivar for a species of

2444
01:47:22,819 --> 01:47:31,259
plant in other other realms be it hops

2445
01:47:27,569 --> 01:47:32,759
or in the agricultural industry they're

2446
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:35,399
looking for a couple different factors

2447
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,199
that I've mentioned you know phenotypic

2448
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:39,209
what's it what's it grow what's it

2449
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:41,009
produce when you start looking at

2450
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:43,319
genetically engineered you have to be

2451
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:45,179
able to show that you the gene sequence

2452
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:47,578
that you're selecting for is that it

2453
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:51,538
exhibited in over eighty percent of the

2454
01:47:47,578 --> 01:47:55,608
populations and oftentimes the in order

2455
01:47:51,538 --> 01:47:57,868
to create that speciation or novel to

2456
01:47:55,609 --> 01:47:59,760
the Patent Office especially when

2457
01:47:57,868 --> 01:48:02,358
they're patenting germ lines or genetic

2458
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:05,550
lines they want to be able to see that a

2459
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:07,499
significant majority of the seeds that

2460
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:12,510
are planted are gonna exhibit that trait

2461
01:48:07,498 --> 01:48:14,368
so a f-1 multi poly hybrid has not been

2462
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:17,280
stabilized enough to be able to show

2463
01:48:14,368 --> 01:48:20,308
those you know standardized traits

2464
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:21,658
within its cultivar so many i'm same

2465
01:48:20,309 --> 01:48:24,510
kind of several things happen where

2466
01:48:21,658 --> 01:48:26,339
people are finding rare rare mutations

2467
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:29,128
in some of their CBD things and

2468
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:31,139
considering it novel and that rare

2469
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:33,019
mutation has to then be inbred

2470
01:48:31,139 --> 01:48:37,489
stabilized

2471
01:48:33,019 --> 01:48:40,590
essentially worked until it becomes a

2472
01:48:37,488 --> 01:48:42,779
significant majority of genetic

2473
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:45,689
expression and essentially selecting for

2474
01:48:42,779 --> 01:48:50,158
the recessive traits in order to to lock

2475
01:48:45,689 --> 01:48:52,168
those recessive traits in with so i

2476
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:53,969
think a lot of there's a lot of concern

2477
01:48:52,168 --> 01:48:57,029
that you know breeders are going to do

2478
01:48:53,969 --> 01:48:59,819
f1 hybrids and then try and patent them

2479
01:48:57,029 --> 01:49:01,738
the reality is that breeding is going to

2480
01:48:59,819 --> 01:49:03,509
involve multiple generations of

2481
01:49:01,738 --> 01:49:06,898
stabilization in order to start

2482
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:10,399
protecting those patents or absolutely

2483
01:49:06,899 --> 01:49:12,719
correct you're dead on and that's the

2484
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:15,919
most difficult part about everything

2485
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:18,449
right now is that you know there's such

2486
01:49:15,918 --> 01:49:20,630
misinformation out there that everyone

2487
01:49:18,449 --> 01:49:23,159
feelers and everyone's feelers are up

2488
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:24,449
and we just need to dispel a lot of this

2489
01:49:23,159 --> 01:49:26,819
stuff so everyone really truly

2490
01:49:24,449 --> 01:49:29,039
understands that it's a lot more

2491
01:49:26,819 --> 01:49:32,759
difficult than just like fixing things

2492
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:35,460
and and trying to you know do a do a

2493
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:38,070
basic flip you know you can't do that

2494
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:42,600
yeah and ultimately you know that's

2495
01:49:38,069 --> 01:49:44,609
where I that's where genetic companies

2496
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:47,460
that are testing the genetics being a

2497
01:49:44,609 --> 01:49:50,429
producing those tests for their

2498
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:52,500
customers is really useful because you

2499
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:55,020
know breeders if they can you know and

2500
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:57,810
I've done this on multi acreage scale

2501
01:49:55,020 --> 01:50:01,680
will where we'll send in large numbers

2502
01:49:57,810 --> 01:50:03,630
of CBD seedlings to get tested identify

2503
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:05,520
the ones that are female that also

2504
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:08,190
exhibit the double recessive CBD a

2505
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,290
alleles and then be able to mass

2506
01:50:08,189 --> 01:50:13,259
propagate those so that you end up

2507
01:50:10,289 --> 01:50:14,850
having if instead of one standardized

2508
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:17,010
seed you have a couple different

2509
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:20,910
cultivars that you're then propagating

2510
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:23,579
into into a field regenerative system

2511
01:50:20,909 --> 01:50:26,899
that way you can then you not have to

2512
01:50:23,579 --> 01:50:29,460
worry about new coding all of the the

2513
01:50:26,899 --> 01:50:32,519
hermaphroditic traits orthene on teeth

2514
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:35,730
the hot traits but on the same hand we

2515
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:37,280
obviously it would be great if companies

2516
01:50:35,729 --> 01:50:39,149
that are doing that genetic tested

2517
01:50:37,279 --> 01:50:41,399
facilitated distribution of those

2518
01:50:39,149 --> 01:50:43,769
genetics through some sort of open

2519
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:47,039
licensing even if those eye open

2520
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:50,820
licensing includes kickbacks to the the

2521
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:53,390
breeders or the genetic developers but

2522
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:57,239
they can i think the concern is is a

2523
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:58,950
perceived conflict of interest and i did

2524
01:50:57,239 --> 01:51:00,420
they admit there may be separate

2525
01:50:58,949 --> 01:51:03,750
companies but there is somewhat a a

2526
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:05,789
perceived conflict of interest and when

2527
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:09,449
a genetic testing company is then

2528
01:51:05,789 --> 01:51:13,380
creating a genetic nursery company now

2529
01:51:09,449 --> 01:51:16,769
the likelihood that a leaf tissue sample

2530
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:18,659
could get turned back into stem cells

2531
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:21,360
and then reap Rafah gated is very low

2532
01:51:18,659 --> 01:51:24,750
but there is a risk for anyone who has

2533
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:29,399
submitted seeds especially seeds in mass

2534
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:31,859
to a genetic company because you know if

2535
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:32,309
I'm running a testing laboratory for

2536
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:34,679
tests

2537
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:38,310
Akim atrophic samples of cannabis I'm

2538
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:40,619
going to save part of my sample in case

2539
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:43,080
if the test comes back weird so I can

2540
01:51:40,619 --> 01:51:44,789
retest it just to standardize that test

2541
01:51:43,079 --> 01:51:48,149
now I don't think that any genetic

2542
01:51:44,789 --> 01:51:49,769
companies are repopulating genetics but

2543
01:51:48,149 --> 01:51:52,529
I do believe that they are you know

2544
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:56,130
correlating their data and you can use

2545
01:51:52,529 --> 01:51:57,869
once you start identifying hey this one

2546
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:59,279
allele trait that showed up on our

2547
01:51:57,869 --> 01:52:02,789
genetic sequence that we weren't looking

2548
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:05,849
for your years later could potentially

2549
01:52:02,789 --> 01:52:08,329
be used for creating this precursor to a

2550
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:11,190
novel cannabinoid because there are

2551
01:52:08,329 --> 01:52:13,829
numerous cannabinoids that aren't in

2552
01:52:11,189 --> 01:52:16,169
wide distribution and if we can find

2553
01:52:13,829 --> 01:52:19,529
those risk significantly recessive

2554
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:22,050
allele genetic snips then we could

2555
01:52:19,529 --> 01:52:23,699
potentially you know say okay this this

2556
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:25,619
strain from this breeder this strain

2557
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:27,659
from this reader these four strains from

2558
01:52:25,619 --> 01:52:30,180
these four breeders now we can start

2559
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:31,619
developing a breeding platform to be

2560
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:34,940
able to select for those rare genetic

2561
01:52:31,619 --> 01:52:39,300
alleles to create rare genetic

2562
01:52:34,939 --> 01:52:41,489
cannabinoids reinforce those over eight

2563
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:44,970
to ten generations until it becomes a

2564
01:52:41,489 --> 01:52:46,949
predominant profile and that that's

2565
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:49,230
gonna require a lot of testing that's

2566
01:52:46,949 --> 01:52:51,449
gonna require a lot of work a lot of

2567
01:52:49,229 --> 01:52:54,209
space and we want that the people doing

2568
01:52:51,449 --> 01:52:58,319
that genetic work to be able to see some

2569
01:52:54,210 --> 01:53:02,369
some success from that but at the same

2570
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:05,159
at the same time so I we in some realm I

2571
01:53:02,369 --> 01:53:07,859
think that you know I think patents are

2572
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:10,229
going to be a necessity but what we do

2573
01:53:07,859 --> 01:53:13,139
with those patents we don't want to be

2574
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:15,839
able to take the rare genetic alleles

2575
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:18,869
off the market and only make them

2576
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:21,210
available in pharmaceutical drugs we did

2577
01:53:18,869 --> 01:53:33,659
it far better to be able to have that

2578
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:47,310
here a multiple Sam sounds like

2579
01:53:33,659 --> 01:53:48,989
the teacher on Charlie Brown you lost

2580
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:50,880
you Sam we lost yeah

2581
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:53,550
this is crucial Sam I wish you were in

2582
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:55,079
this one I know it's like there's quite

2583
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:59,210
a few things I want to hear from him

2584
01:53:55,079 --> 01:53:59,210
right now it's hard I do there's so much

2585
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:09,200
well can you hear me that's the that's

2586
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:09,199
the the truth of it all I hear you now

2587
01:54:12,439 --> 01:54:20,219
but now I don't is my voice normal or is

2588
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:27,780
it all screwed up it's kind of screwed

2589
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:35,000
up but that's normal I need you to

2590
01:54:27,779 --> 01:54:40,170
appreciate that well I just in color

2591
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:44,369
proud of this month the first you pop

2592
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:47,149
plant registration breeders rights has

2593
01:54:44,369 --> 01:54:47,149
been applied

2594
01:54:56,809 --> 01:55:05,360
oh I am wondering if this comment can be

2595
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:08,030
submitted in the chat because I really

2596
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:09,558
want to hear it and I think that all of

2597
01:55:08,029 --> 01:55:11,569
us are struggling because we want to

2598
01:55:09,559 --> 01:55:14,840
hear it but the audio connection does

2599
01:55:11,569 --> 01:55:17,359
not yeah you should type it Sam and then

2600
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:19,489
I can we can all read it or send it to

2601
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:21,319
me in Skype or whatever whatever it

2602
01:55:19,488 --> 01:55:23,569
works because I really do want to hear

2603
01:55:21,319 --> 01:55:25,460
from you right now yeah I think what he

2604
01:55:23,569 --> 01:55:27,859
only heard parts of that but I think

2605
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:29,710
what he mentioned was the so recently

2606
01:55:27,859 --> 01:55:31,819
the US Department of Agriculture has

2607
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:34,880
started saying that they're allowing

2608
01:55:31,819 --> 01:55:36,828
plant registration on cannabis cultivars

2609
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:39,288
now they're primarily phrasing that in

2610
01:55:36,828 --> 01:55:41,359
the realm of hemp cultivars but there

2611
01:55:39,288 --> 01:55:45,279
have in the last month there have been a

2612
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:48,589
few Colorado hemp cultivars that were

2613
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:51,288
developed from cultivars not from not

2614
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:54,679
indigenous to Colorado but they've been

2615
01:55:51,288 --> 01:55:58,759
worked by companies in Colorado and they

2616
01:55:54,679 --> 01:56:02,929
have been applied for on on that plant

2617
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:06,050
registration so we are gonna start to

2618
01:56:02,929 --> 01:56:10,099
see that starting to happen and I've

2619
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:13,820
even seen a couple of these CBD seed

2620
01:56:10,099 --> 01:56:16,369
breeders are requiring their customers

2621
01:56:13,819 --> 01:56:21,198
to sign material transfer agreements

2622
01:56:16,368 --> 01:56:22,908
that requires non non replication which

2623
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:24,319
I kind of understand I see breeder

2624
01:56:22,908 --> 01:56:26,899
doesn't want to have the seeds knocked

2625
01:56:24,319 --> 01:56:29,840
off but they also include things like no

2626
01:56:26,899 --> 01:56:32,899
cloning and no breeding with those

2627
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:36,409
strains and it's the reason why that

2628
01:56:32,899 --> 01:56:38,058
company is doing that is because it they

2629
01:56:36,408 --> 01:56:40,339
want to be able to start protecting

2630
01:56:38,059 --> 01:56:44,000
those lines and they don't want to have

2631
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:46,788
their their work knocked off but I think

2632
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,578
it's it's a little bit over intrusive to

2633
01:56:46,788 --> 01:56:52,759
try and require people to develop your

2634
01:56:49,578 --> 01:56:54,679
work and to be honest I think it's bad

2635
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:57,650
marketing you know if you're developing

2636
01:56:54,679 --> 01:57:00,760
a line that ends up becoming for example

2637
01:56:57,649 --> 01:57:03,589
the next Harlequin or Charlotte's Web

2638
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:05,420
tons of potential there and that's you

2639
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:10,159
people working with your line or only

2640
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:14,538
it's only going to benefit them so

2641
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:16,248
you there he's there but I bet that's

2642
01:57:14,538 --> 01:57:19,609
not gonna sound any better than it happy

2643
01:57:16,248 --> 01:57:21,679
nuts that's kind of how we feel is I

2644
01:57:19,609 --> 01:57:25,188
mean we every every event that we've

2645
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:27,618
gone to we have seed swaps you know and

2646
01:57:25,189 --> 01:57:29,780
it's always like the funnest thing about

2647
01:57:27,618 --> 01:57:31,880
the event you know just sharing genetics

2648
01:57:29,779 --> 01:57:33,408
and doing all this stuff but then it's

2649
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:35,958
like we're we come around the corner

2650
01:57:33,408 --> 01:57:38,509
after a seed swap and then slam on

2651
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:41,630
brakes or oh my god why we have to start

2652
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:43,458
I'm gonna stop going to seat swaps now

2653
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:45,319
I'm gonna start saving all my seeds

2654
01:57:43,458 --> 01:57:47,868
because I'm just nervous someone else is

2655
01:57:45,319 --> 01:57:49,188
gonna maybe do it better than me or

2656
01:57:47,868 --> 01:57:51,198
they're gonna mass-produce it and

2657
01:57:49,189 --> 01:57:53,809
they're gonna to take me out of it and I

2658
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:56,478
really just believe that the art is in

2659
01:57:53,809 --> 01:57:59,119
creating the genetic it's not just the

2660
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:01,550
genetic I think that we're all lucky to

2661
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:03,589
even be talking about this if we're

2662
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:05,269
honest with each other because this

2663
01:58:03,590 --> 01:58:07,610
plant came from wherever it came from

2664
01:58:05,269 --> 01:58:10,340
buddy did it before us and we're putting

2665
01:58:07,609 --> 01:58:14,988
intellectual property into it I mean you

2666
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:17,479
know the the Bubba cush hemp do you know

2667
01:58:14,988 --> 01:58:19,938
I mean that's a that's an amazing you

2668
01:58:17,479 --> 01:58:21,800
know intellectual thing that was traded

2669
01:58:19,939 --> 01:58:23,418
there and and and you know there's maybe

2670
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:27,380
there's there's a lot of value to that

2671
01:58:23,418 --> 01:58:30,260
but in general I think like with with IP

2672
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:32,118
and recipes we've always given out

2673
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:34,519
everything for free and we even have a

2674
01:58:32,118 --> 01:58:37,158
company that's potentially threatened by

2675
01:58:34,519 --> 01:58:39,769
giving out that information but we just

2676
01:58:37,158 --> 01:58:41,388
feel like if someone takes that and

2677
01:58:39,769 --> 01:58:43,280
makes the world a better place then

2678
01:58:41,389 --> 01:58:46,248
who's really losing so we're just

2679
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:49,668
challenged to become better and more I'm

2680
01:58:46,248 --> 01:58:52,188
how how can you own a part of a plants

2681
01:58:49,668 --> 01:58:54,380
evolution we're all evolving I don't

2682
01:58:52,189 --> 01:58:56,630
understand like this ownership of

2683
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:58,969
evolution it just doesn't make sense to

2684
01:58:56,630 --> 01:59:00,618
me we're always evolving the plant is

2685
01:58:58,969 --> 01:59:03,769
always evolving so you're patenting

2686
01:59:00,618 --> 01:59:06,348
something that's like way back in 2018

2687
01:59:03,769 --> 01:59:09,679
and then it's gonna evolve so many times

2688
01:59:06,349 --> 01:59:11,538
past that it's it's um it's just a

2689
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:15,019
really interesting conversation and I

2690
01:59:11,538 --> 01:59:17,988
and I think that we have some kind of a

2691
01:59:15,019 --> 01:59:21,439
disease or a virus inside of our DNA

2692
01:59:17,988 --> 01:59:23,928
that we thrive off of competition and I

2693
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:25,909
think that we have this ability

2694
01:59:23,929 --> 01:59:27,739
for the plant and what she's taught us

2695
01:59:25,908 --> 01:59:30,229
in the way that we commune with in the

2696
01:59:27,738 --> 01:59:33,379
cannabis culture to really drop that

2697
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:35,750
idea of competition and be able to share

2698
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:38,090
and open source it and make it already

2699
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:41,060
art that has happened before so that

2700
01:59:38,090 --> 01:59:42,679
other people can't have it and I think

2701
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:45,650
that a lot of people in the cannabis

2702
01:59:42,679 --> 01:59:48,350
culture are not really wanting

2703
01:59:45,649 --> 01:59:50,389
necessarily to own something they just

2704
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:53,150
don't want somebody else to own it so

2705
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:55,010
that we can't work with it and I think

2706
01:59:53,149 --> 01:59:56,569
that that's really more of the focus I

2707
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:58,760
mean we want people to have good

2708
01:59:56,569 --> 02:00:00,408
business we want people to protect you

2709
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:04,909
know something that they've created all

2710
02:00:00,408 --> 02:00:07,460
that is a real thing but I think that we

2711
02:00:04,908 --> 02:00:10,339
shouldn't be threatened by something

2712
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:13,579
else bigger and better that's the way we

2713
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:15,679
feel I mean and you guys can say well

2714
02:00:13,579 --> 02:00:17,840
imagine if the guy who created a guitar

2715
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:22,579
said you could no one else could make

2716
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:27,170
guitars I mean dude I use that is it's

2717
02:00:22,579 --> 02:00:29,179
super extract yeah at the same time come

2718
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:32,869
on you know it's there would be no

2719
02:00:29,179 --> 02:00:36,319
diversity in music in culture and that

2720
02:00:32,869 --> 02:00:38,809
too transcends culture and humanity in

2721
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:41,960
so many ways just yet at the same time

2722
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:43,580
when Quincy Jones takes like particular

2723
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:47,198
notes and puts them in an order

2724
02:00:43,579 --> 02:00:50,899
absolutely he can own those now no doubt

2725
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:57,738
yep sampled and turned into something

2726
02:00:50,899 --> 02:00:59,988
else I think that because y'all are

2727
02:00:57,738 --> 02:01:01,789
talking about like like it's interesting

2728
02:00:59,988 --> 02:01:03,319
in this conversation because it brings

2729
02:01:01,789 --> 02:01:06,979
up a really important point and actually

2730
02:01:03,319 --> 02:01:08,479
I was it brings a really important point

2731
02:01:06,979 --> 02:01:11,178
about intellectual property in the word

2732
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:12,408
intellectual property and and I think

2733
02:01:11,179 --> 02:01:15,590
it's a word that I don't want to use

2734
02:01:12,408 --> 02:01:19,549
anymore because it's actually really

2735
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:21,460
confusing and it's confusing because it

2736
02:01:19,550 --> 02:01:23,449
is one word and this is actually like

2737
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:24,770
after all of this crazy with open

2738
02:01:23,448 --> 02:01:26,658
cannabis project and reading more

2739
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:27,860
Richard Stallman and all that kind of

2740
02:01:26,658 --> 02:01:29,420
stuff he's actually one who comes up

2741
02:01:27,859 --> 02:01:32,779
with this idea that like intellectual

2742
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:34,579
property actually is a term that is

2743
02:01:32,779 --> 02:01:37,229
meant to reference depending on here

2744
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:38,609
talking to between you know three and

2745
02:01:37,229 --> 02:01:41,099
nine different sets of laws that

2746
02:01:38,609 --> 02:01:43,319
actually all work differently so like

2747
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:44,850
Quincy Jones's notes that he puts

2748
02:01:43,319 --> 02:01:47,149
together it's covered under copyright

2749
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:50,789
that is one set of laws that is applied

2750
02:01:47,149 --> 02:01:53,460
plants are covered under not only patent

2751
02:01:50,789 --> 02:01:55,229
law but they're also covered under USDA

2752
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:56,699
protections which is actually the plant

2753
02:01:55,229 --> 02:01:59,849
variety protection thing that I think

2754
02:01:56,699 --> 02:02:01,439
that Sam was talking about that opened

2755
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:05,030
up in Colorado but I need to look that

2756
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:07,049
up the plant variety protection is for

2757
02:02:05,029 --> 02:02:09,269
stable seed lines right and that's

2758
02:02:07,050 --> 02:02:12,090
actually run by the USDA and then there

2759
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:14,489
is ownership law at play even in so

2760
02:02:12,090 --> 02:02:16,170
there is ownership law at play for

2761
02:02:14,488 --> 02:02:17,488
example like when we talk about plants

2762
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:19,829
or seeds that are in the public domain

2763
02:02:17,488 --> 02:02:22,019
right plants and seeds that might be in

2764
02:02:19,829 --> 02:02:24,649
the public domain from a patenting

2765
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:27,300
standpoint and from a USDA standpoint

2766
02:02:24,649 --> 02:02:30,599
still might be owned by somebody right

2767
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:32,070
like they might be owned by right there

2768
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,950
might be on my bubble man for example

2769
02:02:32,069 --> 02:02:37,619
and so you know if they are actually

2770
02:02:34,949 --> 02:02:39,359
owned by somebody then they are affected

2771
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:41,880
by the law that like the rules of

2772
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:43,349
contract law and so on for and like and

2773
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:45,539
it's interesting because all of these

2774
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:47,460
laws are kind of at odds with what we

2775
02:02:45,539 --> 02:02:48,659
think and how we feel but understanding

2776
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:50,310
them and this is where I feel like

2777
02:02:48,659 --> 02:02:52,470
education is really important for this

2778
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:54,030
community in particular I want for us to

2779
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:56,250
be able to understand how these laws

2780
02:02:54,029 --> 02:02:58,439
work so that we can effectively use

2781
02:02:56,250 --> 02:03:00,149
these tools and I'm not saying that

2782
02:02:58,439 --> 02:03:01,409
patents are it I'm not actually really

2783
02:03:00,149 --> 02:03:03,659
don't like patents on fans especially

2784
02:03:01,409 --> 02:03:05,010
cannabis plants you know but like we

2785
02:03:03,659 --> 02:03:07,500
need to be able to understand how these

2786
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:09,390
laws work so that we can effectively

2787
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:11,189
navigate it and not be caught in a

2788
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:14,010
situation where we actually hurt

2789
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:16,469
ourselves because just we misunderstood

2790
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:18,180
something or conflated concepts

2791
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:19,590
yeah and careful when you're talking

2792
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:21,930
about it and you don't make your

2793
02:03:19,590 --> 02:03:24,150
statement that you're not really Pro

2794
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:28,409
plant patents because man can you

2795
02:03:24,149 --> 02:03:31,769
trigger some people who plant patents in

2796
02:03:28,409 --> 02:03:33,779
the cannabis world triggers it total

2797
02:03:31,770 --> 02:03:35,730
triggers and also like plant but this is

2798
02:03:33,779 --> 02:03:38,399
where it's I also like you know I kind

2799
02:03:35,729 --> 02:03:39,929
of have a like a challenge or like a

2800
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:41,369
challenging question that I would be

2801
02:03:39,930 --> 02:03:43,950
interested to hear from folks on this

2802
02:03:41,369 --> 02:03:46,559
group about which is that like okay so a

2803
02:03:43,949 --> 02:03:49,260
plant patent really covers a single

2804
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:51,169
plant and it's clones and that's it

2805
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:54,579
USDA protection

2806
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:57,618
a stable seed line and that's it

2807
02:03:54,578 --> 02:04:00,049
utility patents can cover like you know

2808
02:03:57,618 --> 02:04:02,598
within one document like a plant plus

2809
02:04:00,050 --> 02:04:04,309
its clones plus its seeds plus all the

2810
02:04:02,599 --> 02:04:06,649
products made with it plus anything made

2811
02:04:04,309 --> 02:04:09,639
with it and so you know my question is

2812
02:04:06,649 --> 02:04:13,389
like from an ethical standpoint what is

2813
02:04:09,639 --> 02:04:16,340
wrong with a plant patent or a USDA

2814
02:04:13,389 --> 02:04:18,889
stable seed line protection if all that

2815
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:21,288
it really says is yes I invented this

2816
02:04:18,889 --> 02:04:22,788
but sure people can still breed with it

2817
02:04:21,288 --> 02:04:24,018
I'm not I actually don't necessarily

2818
02:04:22,788 --> 02:04:26,929
think it's a good use of money or time

2819
02:04:24,019 --> 02:04:28,099
but I'm interested to hear from the

2820
02:04:26,929 --> 02:04:31,248
group like what your thoughts are on

2821
02:04:28,099 --> 02:04:33,819
these like different types of like

2822
02:04:31,248 --> 02:04:36,288
protection options and where the ethics

2823
02:04:33,819 --> 02:04:39,288
ethical lines are drawn within the

2824
02:04:36,288 --> 02:04:41,179
beliefs of the community I think the

2825
02:04:39,288 --> 02:04:45,228
problem with the ethical lines is that

2826
02:04:41,179 --> 02:04:48,199
they are they are warped and manipulated

2827
02:04:45,229 --> 02:04:51,199
by the lawyers who write up these these

2828
02:04:48,198 --> 02:04:53,089
laws and these these these you know

2829
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:55,488
documents in the first place so that's

2830
02:04:53,090 --> 02:04:58,099
that's that's kind of probably the main

2831
02:04:55,488 --> 02:05:00,888
problem that it's becomes corrupted from

2832
02:04:58,099 --> 02:05:02,958
the start literally the foundation of it

2833
02:05:00,889 --> 02:05:05,809
is like I mean a lawyer a good lawyers

2834
02:05:02,958 --> 02:05:08,538
job is to stretch and define that that

2835
02:05:05,809 --> 02:05:10,939
the the envelope and to kind of get it

2836
02:05:08,538 --> 02:05:12,738
you know let's push it even further in

2837
02:05:10,939 --> 02:05:15,168
our favor because you know that's that's

2838
02:05:12,738 --> 02:05:18,138
I work for my client and I'm looking to

2839
02:05:15,168 --> 02:05:20,300
you know you know best that interested I

2840
02:05:18,139 --> 02:05:24,349
mean there's lots of good jokes about

2841
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:25,909
lawyers as we all know so the question

2842
02:05:24,349 --> 02:05:27,860
of the ethics behind the people that are

2843
02:05:25,908 --> 02:05:29,898
submitting that said patent and the

2844
02:05:27,859 --> 02:05:32,768
years you know the intention behind it

2845
02:05:29,899 --> 02:05:36,130
and there's so much that goes on and on

2846
02:05:32,769 --> 02:05:38,590
that you know is clearly undefinable

2847
02:05:36,130 --> 02:05:41,958
until it's too late

2848
02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:43,909
yeah and then let's let's start with a

2849
02:05:41,958 --> 02:05:46,429
clone because I think that's the that's

2850
02:05:43,908 --> 02:05:49,759
one of the more narrow ones you know

2851
02:05:46,429 --> 02:05:55,849
I've I've heard of several different you

2852
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:58,309
know companies in multiple states that

2853
02:05:55,849 --> 02:06:02,340
we're looking for genetics to bring to

2854
02:05:58,309 --> 02:06:05,460
bring into their production facilities

2855
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:08,940
now it's difficult to have interstate

2856
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:10,829
commerce but there are ways that you can

2857
02:06:08,939 --> 02:06:12,719
you know immaculately conceived those

2858
02:06:10,829 --> 02:06:16,559
genetics into those things and then

2859
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:17,960
create a licensing on copyright

2860
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:21,000
I think it's copyrighted or trademarked

2861
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:22,980
names and I've actually seen some

2862
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:26,989
European seed companies that are

2863
02:06:22,979 --> 02:06:29,789
trademarking names and then if you're a

2864
02:06:26,989 --> 02:06:33,689
licensed producer you can license that

2865
02:06:29,789 --> 02:06:36,149
trademarked name in order to sell those

2866
02:06:33,689 --> 02:06:38,250
seed likes now I get approached all the

2867
02:06:36,149 --> 02:06:39,569
time like that to be honest there's

2868
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:41,609
there's a ton of people that out there

2869
02:06:39,569 --> 02:06:44,519
absolutely going out there reaching out

2870
02:06:41,609 --> 02:06:46,439
to people yeah and if a breeder has to

2871
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:48,810
spend the money and is you know we're

2872
02:06:46,439 --> 02:06:51,359
doing breeding properly I'm not talking

2873
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:54,120
about pollen shucking I'm talking about

2874
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:56,699
you know developing facilities that are

2875
02:06:54,119 --> 02:06:58,880
that are nude specifically designed to

2876
02:06:56,699 --> 02:07:01,500
prevent pollen from spreading around

2877
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:03,449
cross-pollination you have to build you

2878
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:05,909
know pollination chambers for your

2879
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:08,189
breeding programs if you're doing those

2880
02:07:05,909 --> 02:07:11,789
Fino hunting - the actions to develop

2881
02:07:08,189 --> 02:07:14,489
those lines then as interstate and

2882
02:07:11,789 --> 02:07:16,560
international commerce begins it's going

2883
02:07:14,489 --> 02:07:20,519
to be very beneficial to the the

2884
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:22,650
breeders to develop those lines and

2885
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:25,980
potentially license them out just so

2886
02:07:22,649 --> 02:07:29,879
that you know now that said the minute

2887
02:07:25,979 --> 02:07:32,729
you start selling seeds for example it's

2888
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:36,119
difficult to license a strain to a

2889
02:07:32,729 --> 02:07:39,479
grower they say to a farm if you are

2890
02:07:36,119 --> 02:07:42,539
also selling seeds because that farms

2891
02:07:39,479 --> 02:07:44,399
part of the the license e legally

2892
02:07:42,539 --> 02:07:45,659
speaking wants to know that they're

2893
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:50,219
gonna be if they're gonna pay that

2894
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:52,199
premium to have that specific clone then

2895
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:55,500
you know they want to know that you're

2896
02:07:52,199 --> 02:07:59,189
not openly distributing that clone now

2897
02:07:55,500 --> 02:08:01,470
I've seen licenses where that you you

2898
02:07:59,189 --> 02:08:05,009
have that proprietary clone but you

2899
02:08:01,470 --> 02:08:07,500
still can have genetic hybrids available

2900
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:09,480
and I think some breeders in Europe are

2901
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:11,659
doing that where they're still sowing

2902
02:08:09,479 --> 02:08:16,259
seeds but if you want a exclusive

2903
02:08:11,659 --> 02:08:16,500
license on my this this chemo trophic

2904
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:18,989
Pro

2905
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:23,670
file of this phenotype of this gene

2906
02:08:18,989 --> 02:08:26,039
sequence cut of this clone then I think

2907
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:28,699
that's a good way for you know grower

2908
02:08:26,039 --> 02:08:31,710
growers and specifically breeders to

2909
02:08:28,699 --> 02:08:34,139
generate revenue when you can't have

2910
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:38,789
those genetics legally transferring

2911
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:41,760
across jurisdictional boundaries now in

2912
02:08:38,789 --> 02:08:43,350
Canada has a pedigreed seed program a

2913
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:48,000
couple European countries also have

2914
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:50,160
pedigreed seed programs and part of that

2915
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,079
pedigree see that I think Josh and Kelly

2916
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:56,399
mentioned earlier developing feminized

2917
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:58,409
line you know you have to if you're

2918
02:08:56,399 --> 02:08:59,609
gonna do a pedigreed seed program not

2919
02:08:58,409 --> 02:09:03,210
only do you have to create that

2920
02:08:59,609 --> 02:09:05,519
standardized seed but you also have to

2921
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:08,579
be able to produce it where you you and

2922
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:12,000
your farm minimizes risk of pollination

2923
02:09:08,579 --> 02:09:14,189
and there are parts of Oregon that that

2924
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,880
had really big problems with cross

2925
02:09:14,189 --> 02:09:19,289
pollination from hemp farms that hemp

2926
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:21,359
farms that were doing breeding we're

2927
02:09:19,289 --> 02:09:23,369
getting pollinated by hemp farms that

2928
02:09:21,359 --> 02:09:27,630
were just open pollinating hybrids to

2929
02:09:23,369 --> 02:09:29,550
harvest seeds and so Canada actually has

2930
02:09:27,630 --> 02:09:34,800
rules and regulations around pedigreed

2931
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:36,720
seed varieties and while I personally

2932
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,510
may not be really interested in a

2933
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:42,630
feminized autoflowering line there are

2934
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:45,150
lots of corn farmers and soybean farmers

2935
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:47,730
and wheat farmers that need those

2936
02:09:45,149 --> 02:09:52,649
genetics need those pedigreed seeds in

2937
02:09:47,729 --> 02:09:55,549
masse by the ton to be able to plant

2938
02:09:52,649 --> 02:10:00,569
those crops and stop growing

2939
02:09:55,550 --> 02:10:02,850
unsustainable crops in monoculture a lot

2940
02:10:00,569 --> 02:10:07,139
of those farming realms have seed maps

2941
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:09,510
you know different food food farmers

2942
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:11,340
have seed maps of what's grown where

2943
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:13,820
because if you're say a cabbage farmer

2944
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:16,650
you don't want to be downwind from

2945
02:10:13,819 --> 02:10:18,869
Canada our kale farmer or broccoli or

2946
02:10:16,649 --> 02:10:20,489
something like that so you don't get

2947
02:10:18,869 --> 02:10:21,899
cross-pollination so I think that it

2948
02:10:20,489 --> 02:10:25,260
would be important for us to develop

2949
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:28,529
seed maps within for sure the hemp room

2950
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:29,489
because hemp is easily thrown around up

2951
02:10:28,529 --> 02:10:31,380
here

2952
02:10:29,489 --> 02:10:33,569
Canada or in different realms as is it

2953
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:36,359
seed and fiber hemp which you would grow

2954
02:10:33,569 --> 02:10:38,609
male and female or is it medicinal hemp

2955
02:10:36,359 --> 02:10:40,949
which you would grow you know all female

2956
02:10:38,609 --> 02:10:42,839
for medicinal and there really should be

2957
02:10:40,949 --> 02:10:44,670
a different classification of that hemp

2958
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:46,020
and I think there you know there's talk

2959
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:48,869
about that but there really should be

2960
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:50,880
seed maps because there's a huge level

2961
02:10:48,869 --> 02:10:53,250
of responsibility that comes from

2962
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:55,199
growing cannabis because of its pollen

2963
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:56,729
and obviously it was a problem with

2964
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:59,880
soybeans because of what happened with

2965
02:10:56,729 --> 02:11:04,379
per she's Percy Schmeiser and and all

2966
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:06,510
that with you know genetic pollen drift

2967
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:08,420
and all that but you know it's it's

2968
02:11:06,510 --> 02:11:10,710
something that does require

2969
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:12,539
responsibility and I think that you know

2970
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:14,250
and and getting to know our genetics

2971
02:11:12,539 --> 02:11:16,890
better so we don't have hermaphrodites

2972
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:18,359
because you could grow us you know forty

2973
02:11:16,890 --> 02:11:21,630
acres of feminized seed and they're

2974
02:11:18,359 --> 02:11:24,389
there there is still pollen that can get

2975
02:11:21,630 --> 02:11:27,210
created in that field you can't just

2976
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:29,070
walk away and plant you know forty acres

2977
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:30,539
of feminized seed and just guarantee

2978
02:11:29,069 --> 02:11:32,429
that there's not going to be some pollen

2979
02:11:30,539 --> 02:11:34,739
in there so I think there's some

2980
02:11:32,430 --> 02:11:37,800
responsibility say okay you know you can

2981
02:11:34,739 --> 02:11:39,420
grow 40 acres ahem you know it doesn't

2982
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:41,579
mean it because you're you're a 40 acre

2983
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:43,350
hemp farm and you have machinery that

2984
02:11:41,579 --> 02:11:45,180
you're not supposed to walk the field

2985
02:11:43,350 --> 02:11:47,579
still and to throw a little bit of a

2986
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:50,630
loop in it you know there's everybody

2987
02:11:47,579 --> 02:11:53,670
who's the home grower and everybody in

2988
02:11:50,630 --> 02:11:55,500
every circuit has their four plants and

2989
02:11:53,670 --> 02:11:58,409
guaranteed there's going to be pollen

2990
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:59,970
all over the place pollen happens yeah

2991
02:11:58,409 --> 02:12:02,609
we need to make a shirt it would piss a

2992
02:11:59,970 --> 02:12:04,980
lot of people off we got to get together

2993
02:12:02,609 --> 02:12:06,750
with the four plant fam that's what I'm

2994
02:12:04,979 --> 02:12:09,449
gonna make sure I write there everyone's

2995
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:11,489
on board with with Canada and the four

2996
02:12:09,449 --> 02:12:13,529
plants and and with all the new growers

2997
02:12:11,489 --> 02:12:14,880
out there even I was at the hydroponic

2998
02:12:13,529 --> 02:12:16,829
store spent half the day there yesterday

2999
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,210
with all these new growers coming in and

3000
02:12:16,829 --> 02:12:21,210
one of the way they can get seeds with

3001
02:12:18,210 --> 02:12:24,060
and get clones what's the best way of

3002
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:25,199
growing and and right now for for us

3003
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:27,090
we're just kind of putting people more

3004
02:12:25,199 --> 02:12:28,500
towards like an autopilot system for so

3005
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:30,510
don't really go four feet or whatever

3006
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:32,579
like that you want to go indoors but I

3007
02:12:30,510 --> 02:12:34,710
mean it comes down to a big thing right

3008
02:12:32,579 --> 02:12:36,390
now is about seeds what you can actually

3009
02:12:34,710 --> 02:12:38,520
get through the government right now

3010
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:39,960
which is throughout birdie to buy some

3011
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:41,730
seeds and stuff like that but there's

3012
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:42,720
lots of online seed companies and people

3013
02:12:41,729 --> 02:12:43,829
are

3014
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:45,510
buying seeds want to know about

3015
02:12:43,829 --> 02:12:47,100
feminized see the lines wanna know what

3016
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:49,170
seeds to buy what's gonna be better for

3017
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:51,510
the condition and where did they go to

3018
02:12:49,170 --> 02:12:54,899
get this information so there's this

3019
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:57,180
whole new other industry that people

3020
02:12:54,899 --> 02:13:00,659
earning and looking at right now and and

3021
02:12:57,180 --> 02:13:03,119
I see it explosion in a local

3022
02:13:00,659 --> 02:13:04,649
hydroponics doors of all the new novice

3023
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:06,659
quarries you want to grow for the ground

3024
02:13:04,649 --> 02:13:08,609
mower because they have this pain or

3025
02:13:06,659 --> 02:13:11,430
they want to try this for that and I

3026
02:13:08,609 --> 02:13:13,589
think it's just another real real way of

3027
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:15,240
now educating people on how to grow

3028
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:17,789
their own for plants in Canada and

3029
02:13:15,239 --> 02:13:24,899
really get into to know how they can get

3030
02:13:17,789 --> 02:13:27,090
up and weed and help them nice to be and

3031
02:13:24,899 --> 02:13:28,799
for plants in the world I mean countries

3032
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:31,350
all over the world are starting to allow

3033
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,869
for plants and people are really coming

3034
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:36,300
on and learning about the medicine we've

3035
02:13:33,869 --> 02:13:38,130
made our hemp oil with medicinal

3036
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:40,500
mushrooms for you know a lot of years

3037
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:44,190
now and we've worked with families that

3038
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:47,369
have had to continue buying medicine

3039
02:13:44,189 --> 02:13:49,649
from from the hospital in order to not

3040
02:13:47,369 --> 02:13:52,050
be red-flagged by the medical industry

3041
02:13:49,649 --> 02:13:53,579
and then just stop using that medicine

3042
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:54,720
but they just kept buying it because

3043
02:13:53,579 --> 02:13:57,119
they just didn't want to be a red flag

3044
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:59,039
and they were able to cure them

3045
02:13:57,119 --> 02:14:00,840
you know themselves through through this

3046
02:13:59,039 --> 02:14:03,510
medicine and everything so it is a

3047
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:06,420
really powerful medicine I do feel like

3048
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:08,810
we have this knowledge you know a

3049
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:11,520
hundred years ago in the 1800's you know

3050
02:14:08,810 --> 02:14:14,160
cannabis was part of a lot of the

3051
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:17,400
medicines and hemp was used in

3052
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:20,399
agriculture and as fodder for animals

3053
02:14:17,399 --> 02:14:22,739
and that was at a time when THC hadn't

3054
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:24,539
been read into the plant so there was a

3055
02:14:22,739 --> 02:14:27,750
wider spectrum I think there was a

3056
02:14:24,539 --> 02:14:30,539
general more health and I think that and

3057
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:33,149
I really do wonder if as they were

3058
02:14:30,539 --> 02:14:36,500
starting to control plants and create

3059
02:14:33,149 --> 02:14:39,509
industrial farming with synthetic

3060
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:42,260
fertilizers and I why I think the plant

3061
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:44,880
being such a fractal medicine such a

3062
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:46,619
changeable medicine is I think that's

3063
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:48,210
what's good for our body I think that

3064
02:14:46,619 --> 02:14:49,979
when you when you're a patient you want

3065
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:52,230
to have the same strain because you want

3066
02:14:49,979 --> 02:14:56,039
to have the same effects but I think

3067
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:56,639
that that you can it's sometimes a

3068
02:14:56,039 --> 02:14:58,800
little bit of

3069
02:14:56,640 --> 02:15:00,600
variation with that with with similar

3070
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:02,610
strains can be really positive to your

3071
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:04,230
body and sometimes having the same thing

3072
02:15:02,609 --> 02:15:06,630
over and over isn't necessarily

3073
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:08,729
something that's good for longevity so

3074
02:15:06,630 --> 02:15:10,289
the plant has shown us that a bit

3075
02:15:08,729 --> 02:15:11,879
changes a little bit and I think that

3076
02:15:10,289 --> 02:15:14,279
there's probably a point of health to

3077
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:16,289
that that we might want to embrace and

3078
02:15:14,279 --> 02:15:18,090
and not need to like control certain

3079
02:15:16,289 --> 02:15:19,289
aspects or certain meanings but I mean

3080
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:21,119
we're you know we're interested in

3081
02:15:19,289 --> 02:15:23,090
learning and basically just flooding the

3082
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:25,019
cannabinoid system you know our

3083
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:26,819
endocannabinoid system with all

3084
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:29,250
different cannabinoids and that is

3085
02:15:26,819 --> 02:15:30,989
important and I do understand isolating

3086
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:33,060
and I do understand you know the

3087
02:15:30,989 --> 02:15:35,099
distillate I get that in patients being

3088
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:37,620
able to use that but also being able to

3089
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:39,960
flood the endocannabinoid system with

3090
02:15:37,619 --> 02:15:41,880
with all different forms of medicine

3091
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:44,340
whether you're smoking it you're vaping

3092
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:46,170
it you're eating it you're using it

3093
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:48,060
rectally you're using it on your skin

3094
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:50,520
these are all really important things

3095
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:52,770
that I think that we need to do to

3096
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:54,420
better our health and and what Josh was

3097
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:56,190
saying is that the plant is always

3098
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:57,750
mutating it's always changing not

3099
02:15:56,189 --> 02:15:59,849
mutating but it's always transitioning

3100
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:02,909
it's always in a form of evolution and

3101
02:15:59,850 --> 02:16:05,160
evolving so it changes a lot of its

3102
02:16:02,909 --> 02:16:07,349
cannabinoid ratios and terpene ratios

3103
02:16:05,159 --> 02:16:09,389
the different areas that it's growing in

3104
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:12,930
and that's really cool we can follow

3105
02:16:09,390 --> 02:16:15,360
that lead the plant and and she can

3106
02:16:12,930 --> 02:16:17,039
teach us so much and that yeah nature's

3107
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:19,739
chemist right I mean it's such a

3108
02:16:17,039 --> 02:16:22,409
beautiful thing but we also need to make

3109
02:16:19,739 --> 02:16:24,750
sure that you know we we have consistent

3110
02:16:22,409 --> 02:16:26,909
that medicine and one of the one of the

3111
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:28,739
situations that we always run into just

3112
02:16:26,909 --> 02:16:31,079
being patients going into a dispensary

3113
02:16:28,739 --> 02:16:34,289
is that you can't always find heart of

3114
02:16:31,079 --> 02:16:37,049
one and you can't always find a Kim dog

3115
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:40,050
you can't always find the specific and

3116
02:16:37,049 --> 02:16:41,968
strains that you you're wanting to that

3117
02:16:40,049 --> 02:16:46,109
you know make your headache go away or

3118
02:16:41,968 --> 02:16:48,629
make your hit like his Crohn's help you

3119
02:16:46,110 --> 02:16:53,540
know we we also need consistency in

3120
02:16:48,629 --> 02:16:57,089
genetics we need to keep continuing to

3121
02:16:53,540 --> 02:17:00,030
make new cultivars and and and and have

3122
02:16:57,090 --> 02:17:03,149
new products but we also need to have

3123
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:07,409
consistency too and you know if somebody

3124
02:17:03,149 --> 02:17:09,879
would just keep keep growing at

3125
02:17:07,409 --> 02:17:12,388
harlequin or or

3126
02:17:09,879 --> 02:17:15,968
sorry tsunami then we would be so happy

3127
02:17:12,388 --> 02:17:18,039
because it's a consistent medicine its

3128
02:17:15,968 --> 02:17:20,109
interests totally agree with that and

3129
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:21,880
not part of the evolution and fighting

3130
02:17:20,110 --> 02:17:23,979
new strains you know where we know is

3131
02:17:21,879 --> 02:17:25,598
the evolution of different medicine but

3132
02:17:23,978 --> 02:17:29,228
then when you find it it is really

3133
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:31,599
important you know to continue that and

3134
02:17:29,228 --> 02:17:33,519
there's incredible power and for plants

3135
02:17:31,599 --> 02:17:36,040
and and learning from somebody who's

3136
02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:38,380
cultivated for a long time you can get a

3137
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:40,410
tremendous amount of weight off of four

3138
02:17:38,379 --> 02:17:42,789
plants and I think that we're really

3139
02:17:40,409 --> 02:17:44,289
encouraging home growers to find the

3140
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:46,479
medicine that's good for them get the

3141
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:48,610
strains that works for them and make

3142
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:50,109
their own medicine because then that's

3143
02:17:48,610 --> 02:17:53,229
going to be able to give us a greater

3144
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:55,540
education and being able to commune with

3145
02:17:53,228 --> 02:17:57,579
the plant and and understand what it

3146
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:59,740
gives us and what it means to be able to

3147
02:17:57,579 --> 02:18:01,090
make medicine so I think that that you

3148
02:17:59,739 --> 02:18:04,989
know I agree with you that we absolutely

3149
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:06,549
need to find you know solid lines for

3150
02:18:04,989 --> 02:18:08,829
what works with us but that's gonna

3151
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:10,688
happen through through people growing

3152
02:18:08,829 --> 02:18:12,670
therefore and you'd almost have to say

3153
02:18:10,689 --> 02:18:15,099
oh then you have to clone them and so

3154
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:16,898
sometimes keeping clones alive is a hard

3155
02:18:15,099 --> 02:18:18,489
thing to do as a farmer so then we're

3156
02:18:16,898 --> 02:18:19,829
going to seeds and when we have seeds

3157
02:18:18,489 --> 02:18:22,090
then there's a little bit of variation

3158
02:18:19,829 --> 02:18:23,590
so what you know from a farming

3159
02:18:22,090 --> 02:18:25,510
perspective we have to kind of weigh

3160
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:28,750
that out you know do we want to have a

3161
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:30,280
clone farm for consistent medicine cuz

3162
02:18:28,750 --> 02:18:32,260
it makes so much sense and you're

3163
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:34,450
getting what you want or even but

3164
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:36,340
there's you know different yeah there

3165
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:38,260
can be pathogens or different things

3166
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:40,360
that come with clone farms so if we if

3167
02:18:38,260 --> 02:18:43,659
if I think if we can find a really

3168
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:45,429
stable feed line that gives us keep of

3169
02:18:43,659 --> 02:18:48,010
ours that are really close to what you

3170
02:18:45,429 --> 02:18:49,719
want I think as a farmer and something

3171
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:51,819
that's better for the you know for our

3172
02:18:49,718 --> 02:18:59,589
evolution I think that would be an ideal

3173
02:18:51,819 --> 02:19:04,269
situation but I armors and patients need

3174
02:18:59,590 --> 02:19:09,819
access and in states like Illinois they

3175
02:19:04,269 --> 02:19:14,559
can't home grow is difficult so it's not

3176
02:19:09,819 --> 02:19:17,529
allowed right not just difficult as a

3177
02:19:14,558 --> 02:19:19,148
state regulated process because home

3178
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:22,050
grow in the state of Illinois is is

3179
02:19:19,148 --> 02:19:24,179
going to come but it is going to be

3180
02:19:22,049 --> 02:19:26,049
ridiculous

3181
02:19:24,179 --> 02:19:28,599
over-regulated and we're gonna have

3182
02:19:26,049 --> 02:19:30,308
somebody come into our home and check

3183
02:19:28,599 --> 02:19:32,710
our plans and check where it's supposed

3184
02:19:30,308 --> 02:19:35,438
where where we're growing it so now we

3185
02:19:32,709 --> 02:19:38,638
have a police officer in our house which

3186
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:41,679
is total you know that's a another

3187
02:19:38,638 --> 02:19:45,938
conversation all together but I have

3188
02:19:41,679 --> 02:19:48,939
four children and I have AI and he's

3189
02:19:45,939 --> 02:19:52,059
extremely busy all the time and we own a

3190
02:19:48,939 --> 02:19:53,770
business and we have other children that

3191
02:19:52,059 --> 02:19:56,769
are off doing everything you know things

3192
02:19:53,770 --> 02:19:58,870
so so having a home grow is very very

3193
02:19:56,770 --> 02:20:01,000
difficult especially in the state of

3194
02:19:58,870 --> 02:20:02,290
Illinois if home don't grow passes

3195
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,488
because you can't have your neighbor

3196
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:07,899
come over and water your plants and so

3197
02:20:05,488 --> 02:20:09,728
home grow even though I completely

3198
02:20:07,898 --> 02:20:12,250
support it and I wouldn't and I would

3199
02:20:09,728 --> 02:20:13,478
love to home grow because I like well I

3200
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:16,870
can't I suck at it

3201
02:20:13,478 --> 02:20:19,478
um but I would like to do it and at

3202
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:21,130
least have that opportunity home grow

3203
02:20:19,478 --> 02:20:23,318
can be very difficult for a lot of

3204
02:20:21,129 --> 02:20:25,568
people and home grows very difficult for

3205
02:20:23,318 --> 02:20:30,549
a pace for a mom who is a single mom who

3206
02:20:25,568 --> 02:20:34,689
has a disabled child there they're doing

3207
02:20:30,549 --> 02:20:38,228
enough as it is so we really have to you

3208
02:20:34,689 --> 02:20:41,109
know depend on the growers in the in the

3209
02:20:38,228 --> 02:20:43,179
cultivation system you know the

3210
02:20:41,109 --> 02:20:45,370
commercial cultivation system because we

3211
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:47,529
we don't have the time and effort and

3212
02:20:45,370 --> 02:20:50,290
and energies to be able to do that kind

3213
02:20:47,529 --> 02:20:52,420
of thing and you know there's a really

3214
02:20:50,290 --> 02:20:53,830
interesting frame here when it comes to

3215
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:56,889
both trying to create really well

3216
02:20:53,829 --> 02:20:59,620
regulated consistent medicine you know

3217
02:20:56,889 --> 02:21:01,539
and then plants as well as well we've

3218
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:04,149
got when we're trying to get that kind

3219
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:06,840
of real variance and and like you were

3220
02:21:04,148 --> 02:21:08,889
talking about that the variety of

3221
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:10,478
cannabinoid entering profiles that

3222
02:21:08,889 --> 02:21:11,920
naturally evolves and gives us that

3223
02:21:10,478 --> 02:21:14,318
diversity so it's not like we're eating

3224
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:15,879
you know that nutritional analogy

3225
02:21:14,318 --> 02:21:17,439
something we're eating the same foods

3226
02:21:15,879 --> 02:21:19,358
every day we've got diversity in the

3227
02:21:17,439 --> 02:21:20,889
diet having diversity and you know what

3228
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:23,500
we're taking in cannabinoid wise and

3229
02:21:20,889 --> 02:21:25,478
terpene wise in both of these cases a

3230
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:27,609
huge piece of this comes down to the

3231
02:21:25,478 --> 02:21:29,318
epigenetics right that we've been

3232
02:21:27,609 --> 02:21:31,390
talking so much about the genotype and

3233
02:21:29,318 --> 02:21:33,609
and that and we've talked about near

3234
02:21:31,389 --> 02:21:34,449
that environment plus growing combining

3235
02:21:33,609 --> 02:21:36,130
with you know type getting that

3236
02:21:34,450 --> 02:21:39,100
phenotype expression

3237
02:21:36,129 --> 02:21:41,188
and really so much variance on that

3238
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:43,750
epigenetic expression based on

3239
02:21:41,189 --> 02:21:45,819
everything from the microbiome in the

3240
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:48,489
rhizosphere right to the soil to the

3241
02:21:45,819 --> 02:21:50,500
nutrients to the environment

3242
02:21:48,489 --> 02:21:52,898
environmental conditions you could take

3243
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:54,909
you know one genotype and seed source or

3244
02:21:52,898 --> 02:21:56,619
even clones hold them in completely

3245
02:21:54,909 --> 02:21:58,209
different environments they get totally

3246
02:21:56,620 --> 02:22:00,850
different could be different cannabinoid

3247
02:21:58,209 --> 02:22:03,549
interview profiles and so I think in

3248
02:22:00,850 --> 02:22:05,649
addition to really emphasizing the

3249
02:22:03,549 --> 02:22:07,359
cultivating the the genotypes and those

3250
02:22:05,648 --> 02:22:09,969
really good genetics which i think is so

3251
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:12,250
crucial I agree completely really

3252
02:22:09,969 --> 02:22:14,590
developing and refining how we're

3253
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:17,770
supporting regulating that epigenetic

3254
02:22:14,590 --> 02:22:20,889
side of it both for you know we're

3255
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:23,710
trying to grow specifically for really

3256
02:22:20,889 --> 02:22:25,180
consistent you know profiles I think

3257
02:22:23,709 --> 02:22:27,159
that's really important for that as well

3258
02:22:25,180 --> 02:22:28,898
as when we're trying to get that real

3259
02:22:27,159 --> 02:22:30,819
diversity that's gonna allow us to get

3260
02:22:28,898 --> 02:22:32,439
those different essentially cannabis

3261
02:22:30,819 --> 02:22:36,750
nutrients different cannabinoids and

3262
02:22:32,439 --> 02:22:46,479
terpenoids just such a crucial piece to

3263
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:48,309
really have in play and and and I I'm at

3264
02:22:46,478 --> 02:23:00,219
a loss for words are you aren't you

3265
02:22:48,309 --> 02:23:07,629
Peters friend I am yeah okay what do you

3266
02:23:00,219 --> 02:23:09,819
think of them apples I preached everyone

3267
02:23:07,629 --> 02:23:11,289
on the panel today for coming in and

3268
02:23:09,819 --> 02:23:14,949
sharing your time and having these

3269
02:23:11,290 --> 02:23:18,280
conversations it's it's I miss it on

3270
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:20,350
Sundays I'm busy as Wendy said I have to

3271
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:22,720
sort of back Wendy up to on the like you

3272
02:23:20,350 --> 02:23:24,370
know the that utopian like everyone

3273
02:23:22,719 --> 02:23:27,279
should grow their own medicine I think

3274
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:29,500
it's an amazing idea I gotta put you on

3275
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:33,430
mic mute mic you're banging around their

3276
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:35,709
room it's an amazing idea and I've seen

3277
02:23:33,430 --> 02:23:37,389
you know guys like Johnny be able to do

3278
02:23:35,709 --> 02:23:39,938
it there's there's there's people they

3279
02:23:37,389 --> 02:23:42,039
can do it I myself I have a 98 Plant

3280
02:23:39,939 --> 02:23:44,079
license I haven't grown a plant in

3281
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:47,050
probably over two years I'm just too

3282
02:23:44,079 --> 02:23:49,000
busy I can't lay it on my wife who is

3283
02:23:47,049 --> 02:23:49,810
caring for three children at any given

3284
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,181
time it's not

3285
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:55,181
fair to her it's not that easy for

3286
02:23:52,181 --> 02:23:56,681
everyone to grow their own herbs just

3287
02:23:55,181 --> 02:23:58,271
like it's not easy for everyone to have

3288
02:23:56,681 --> 02:24:00,399
their own gardens and grow their own

3289
02:23:58,271 --> 02:24:01,931
veggies and make their own clothes

3290
02:24:00,399 --> 02:24:08,079
you're growing up soon you know they

3291
02:24:01,931 --> 02:24:10,211
might be able to help in the future in

3292
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:12,610
my life had I if I had a greenhouse

3293
02:24:10,210 --> 02:24:15,100
behind my house with cannabis and food

3294
02:24:12,610 --> 02:24:17,591
growing in it I'd have to have someone

3295
02:24:15,101 --> 02:24:19,569
to help do that work because I'm just I

3296
02:24:17,591 --> 02:24:21,659
travel too much I go these things

3297
02:24:19,569 --> 02:24:24,159
require attention and they require love

3298
02:24:21,659 --> 02:24:26,890
they what they don't require is like

3299
02:24:24,159 --> 02:24:29,380
five and seven and ten day trips in like

3300
02:24:26,890 --> 02:24:32,140
during the most important like you know

3301
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:33,850
like okay I've avenged them out they're

3302
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:36,040
just starting to flower they're three

3303
02:24:33,851 --> 02:24:41,860
weeks in a flower I gotta go it's like

3304
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:43,329
ooh like week four five six I've played

3305
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:45,700
it out too many times and it's not that

3306
02:24:43,329 --> 02:24:47,771
easy for everyone and it's it's one more

3307
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:49,391
reason why of course we need home grows

3308
02:24:47,771 --> 02:24:51,881
we need everyone to be able to grow

3309
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:53,319
their own cannabis if they so choose but

3310
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:54,520
on the flip side of things we have to

3311
02:24:53,319 --> 02:24:56,140
understand there's a whole group of

3312
02:24:54,521 --> 02:24:58,211
people who are unable to grow their own

3313
02:24:56,140 --> 02:25:00,761
cannabis for a variety of reasons and

3314
02:24:58,210 --> 02:25:03,310
they need to have access to both the

3315
02:25:00,761 --> 02:25:05,711
full spectrums the plants the extracts

3316
02:25:03,310 --> 02:25:07,540
the isolates everything like don't

3317
02:25:05,710 --> 02:25:10,210
anyone think that their opinion is

3318
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:13,479
better and bigger than having access to

3319
02:25:10,210 --> 02:25:16,840
everything for everyone that's the

3320
02:25:13,479 --> 02:25:19,449
answer to me access for all totally

3321
02:25:16,841 --> 02:25:22,030
agreed I I love that thank you Marcus

3322
02:25:19,450 --> 02:25:25,421
it's so important and in all of those

3323
02:25:22,030 --> 02:25:28,631
different ways of extraction and of

3324
02:25:25,421 --> 02:25:31,541
caring and of cultivation just do it

3325
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:34,510
socially and and ecologically

3326
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:37,590
responsibly and and I think that that

3327
02:25:34,511 --> 02:25:41,591
then we've got it all the way around

3328
02:25:37,591 --> 02:25:45,521
totally totally and on that note I've

3329
02:25:41,591 --> 02:25:47,979
got this really nice Burmese hash out

3330
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:49,961
from Whistler that our friends brought

3331
02:25:47,979 --> 02:25:52,810
out and I just got to give like some

3332
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:54,460
love to the the old school hash bacon

3333
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:56,649
Whistler family there that this is like

3334
02:25:54,460 --> 02:26:00,251
super dank it and really good and this

3335
02:25:56,649 --> 02:26:03,329
Burmese strain is like it's really sweet

3336
02:26:00,251 --> 02:26:03,329
yeah oh yeah

3337
02:26:03,459 --> 02:26:10,209

3339
02:26:10,209 --> 02:26:17,438
and also this this ice wook big up to

3340
02:26:14,079 --> 02:26:19,389
the ice wook ganja Gil cuz this this

3341
02:26:17,439 --> 02:26:22,960
skittles gelato right now are you

3342

kidding me really I mean like it's time

3343
02:26:22,959 --> 02:26:29,079
to take some tropical cookies you go

3344
02:26:28,209 --> 02:26:32,488
yeah

3345
02:26:29,079 --> 02:26:36,159
tropical cookies hash frozen from

3346
02:26:32,488 --> 02:26:39,939
heavenly days and then he also gave me a

3347
02:26:36,159 --> 02:26:42,369
tiny little bit of I'm gonna find it

3348
02:26:39,939 --> 02:26:50,199
show and tell what's the other what's

3349
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:53,290
the other yeah yes part brat no that's

3350
02:26:50,199 --> 02:26:55,899
not skin on stron under bro that's not

3351
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:58,270
skittles Johnny be on the bottom of this

3352
02:26:55,898 --> 02:26:58,629
no no cuz I talked to RO you're making a

3353
02:26:58,270 --> 02:27:00,970
mistake

3354
02:26:58,629 --> 02:27:05,289
you have the same thing I have tropical

3355
02:27:00,969 --> 02:27:07,478
cookies okay and men don't breath I know

3356
02:27:05,290 --> 02:27:08,890
I meant to tell you that earlier that's

3357
02:27:07,478 --> 02:27:10,420
right because I was like dude you gave

3358
02:27:08,889 --> 02:27:12,010
Johnny B the skittles he's like I don't

3359
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:16,659
have any skittles I gave Johnny B the

3360
02:27:12,010 --> 02:27:18,430
tropical cookies special ok that was the

3361
02:27:16,659 --> 02:27:20,469
stuff after the accident that kept me on

3362
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:22,229
the coach oh yeah that would be very

3363
02:27:20,469 --> 02:27:24,670
much right up your alley

3364
02:27:22,228 --> 02:27:26,139
naki whoa and it's really and that's the

3365
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:27,969
big thing about extractions and stuff

3366
02:27:26,139 --> 02:27:30,398
like that really looking at that was I

3367
02:27:27,969 --> 02:27:32,728
was really grateful to actually come

3368
02:27:30,398 --> 02:27:36,698
across and getting some really sedating

3369
02:27:32,728 --> 02:27:38,469
really good in the hardcore concentrates

3370
02:27:36,699 --> 02:27:47,109
I got that accident which a few people

3371
02:27:38,469 --> 02:27:49,599
know a couple weeks ago and I was 17 but

3372
02:27:47,109 --> 02:27:51,909
I mean is it's right away I needed that

3373
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:56,100
harsh sedation I needed that that really

3374
02:27:51,909 --> 02:27:58,420
good effect and it came to me just like

3375
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:59,979
perfect timing and then the uplift thing

3376
02:27:58,420 --> 02:28:01,809
is I'm kind of getting out of bed now

3377
02:27:59,978 --> 02:28:03,340
feeling a bit better to kind of get you

3378
02:28:01,809 --> 02:28:06,639
going and understanding your medicine

3379
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:08,949
and how it works is is is another great

3380
02:28:06,639 --> 02:28:10,420
experience and an education for yourself

3381
02:28:08,949 --> 02:28:12,279
and really paying attention to what you

3382
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:15,159
use everyday and how it works within you

3383
02:28:12,279 --> 02:28:16,619
and this is just you know as that people

3384
02:28:15,159 --> 02:28:22,068
know it kind of gets me going

3385
02:28:16,619 --> 02:28:24,989
while talking about that side handed

3386
02:28:22,068 --> 02:28:31,978
cannabis Manta says never drive with

3387
02:28:24,988 --> 02:28:34,168
John I was rear-ended okay by something

3388
02:28:31,978 --> 02:28:35,759
is texting and driving now the c-4

3389
02:28:34,168 --> 02:28:37,918
reminds describe that was that major

3390
02:28:35,759 --> 02:28:39,779
surgery I was in rear-ended again by

3391
02:28:37,918 --> 02:28:41,179
some idiot we made a left-hand turn when

3392
02:28:39,779 --> 02:28:43,799
they said no left-hand turn and

3393
02:28:41,179 --> 02:28:45,449
rear-ended me and then once again I'm

3394
02:28:43,799 --> 02:28:47,520
driving through an intersection where

3395
02:28:45,449 --> 02:28:49,109
it's a flashing pedestrian crosswalk in

3396
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:51,418
this a thing and as the light turns red

3397
02:28:49,109 --> 02:28:54,328
something I haven't vehicle speed doing

3398
02:28:51,418 --> 02:28:56,100
the Hyneman t-bone oh three activists

3399
02:28:54,328 --> 02:29:05,488
were never my fault but I'd be driving

3400
02:28:56,100 --> 02:29:07,619
so repeating never once again I mean I'm

3401
02:29:05,488 --> 02:29:10,109
only a really good driver and then I

3402
02:29:07,619 --> 02:29:11,459
didn't for my before my injuries when I

3403
02:29:10,109 --> 02:29:13,109
came out of my surgery

3404
02:29:11,459 --> 02:29:15,449
Marc showed up with 50 different

3405
02:29:13,109 --> 02:29:17,039
terpenes but at that point I really

3406
02:29:15,449 --> 02:29:18,779
realized helpless but really took my

3407
02:29:17,039 --> 02:29:20,729
pain away and that was really important

3408
02:29:18,779 --> 02:29:22,949
fact that Louie took me to that

3409
02:29:20,728 --> 02:29:24,748
different really educational for me to

3410
02:29:22,949 --> 02:29:27,060
take a look at how teens and then take a

3411
02:29:24,748 --> 02:29:28,798
look at a moisture content and keeping

3412
02:29:27,059 --> 02:29:30,838
that aw which we're going to talk more

3413
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:32,549
about I know in in the future here

3414
02:29:30,838 --> 02:29:35,009
because I'm talking to Marc a little act

3415
02:29:32,549 --> 02:29:37,020
of water and both standardization and

3416
02:29:35,009 --> 02:29:39,299
keeping cannabis fresh for pain control

3417
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:42,060
for other things were you looking at

3418
02:29:39,299 --> 02:29:43,319
that same terpene same freshness so well

3419
02:29:42,059 --> 02:29:45,148
something dries out you don't get that

3420
02:29:43,318 --> 02:29:47,548
same effect but when it's not a friend

3421
02:29:45,148 --> 02:29:49,168
you get that really nice effective well

3422
02:29:47,549 --> 02:29:51,060
here in Canada is the producer to

3423
02:29:49,168 --> 02:29:54,289
something really dry unstandardized

3424
02:29:51,059 --> 02:29:56,728
cannabis and I think it's a really big

3425
02:29:54,289 --> 02:29:58,319
to crisis in my opinion because I'm

3426
02:29:56,728 --> 02:30:01,468
getting nothing that's gonna be

3427
02:29:58,318 --> 02:30:03,538
effective for me on the legal market yet

3428
02:30:01,468 --> 02:30:05,608
and I'm hoping to see we I think you'll

3429
02:30:03,539 --> 02:30:07,770
be an extract guy once that comes out in

3430
02:30:05,609 --> 02:30:09,658
October I can't imagine you doing too

3431
02:30:07,770 --> 02:30:12,389
much flour anymore when you can just buy

3432
02:30:09,658 --> 02:30:15,600
the extract and the that same active

3433
02:30:12,388 --> 02:30:17,429
water won't affect the extracts nearly

3434
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:19,889
as much as it extracts the plant matter

3435
02:30:17,429 --> 02:30:22,138
Johnny's been going deep down the rabbit

3436
02:30:19,888 --> 02:30:24,388
hole of active water I almost always

3437
02:30:22,138 --> 02:30:26,548
want to call it active water content but

3438
02:30:24,388 --> 02:30:28,349
I have been schooled and educated that

3439
02:30:26,549 --> 02:30:29,909
that's wrong Johnny's been talking to

3440
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:32,729
one of the main

3441
02:30:29,908 --> 02:30:34,708
scientists at Boveda who was the guy who

3442
02:30:32,728 --> 02:30:37,168
designed and developed a lot of the

3443
02:30:34,709 --> 02:30:39,390
Boveda packs for different moisture

3444
02:30:37,168 --> 02:30:41,189
contents and whatnot so he he taught

3445
02:30:39,389 --> 02:30:43,228
John about active water and then John

3446
02:30:41,189 --> 02:30:45,568
got a machine and he's been doing these

3447
02:30:43,228 --> 02:30:47,309
tests and it it's a pretty important

3448
02:30:45,568 --> 02:30:49,828
work you know once again you can go

3449
02:30:47,309 --> 02:30:51,838
write a bloody PhD on any aspect of

3450
02:30:49,828 --> 02:30:54,059
cannabis but you know now you've got

3451
02:30:51,838 --> 02:30:56,218
companies that are unable to secure the

3452
02:30:54,059 --> 02:30:58,019
cannabis and seal it properly in a

3453
02:30:56,218 --> 02:30:58,708
container and if they are sealing it

3454
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:00,988
properly

3455
02:30:58,709 --> 02:31:03,270
what are they sealing it with is it a

3456
02:31:00,988 --> 02:31:05,609
glue and is that glue affected by the

3457
02:31:03,270 --> 02:31:08,850
gassing off of the terpenes within the

3458
02:31:05,609 --> 02:31:11,129
package that now eats that glue pops the

3459
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:13,408
package allows oxygen to come in and

3460
02:31:11,129 --> 02:31:15,209
have it all mixed up together so this is

3461
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:16,770
quite a rabbit hole Johnny's going deep

3462
02:31:15,209 --> 02:31:18,299
down will probably end up having a hash

3463
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:20,729
Church about it one of these days but

3464
02:31:18,299 --> 02:31:23,279
he's got a bunch of videos little

3465
02:31:20,728 --> 02:31:25,198
snippets on his channel at John HBO

3466
02:31:23,279 --> 02:31:27,119
fellow and we're gonna do a video on

3467
02:31:25,199 --> 02:31:28,859
bubble man's world in the next couple of

3468
02:31:27,119 --> 02:31:31,828
weeks hopefully where we go and get a

3469
02:31:28,859 --> 02:31:34,439
really good overall view of this what it

3470
02:31:31,828 --> 02:31:36,208
is this active water you know which is

3471
02:31:34,439 --> 02:31:38,219
basically the moisture content within

3472
02:31:36,209 --> 02:31:40,560
the flower but also the moisture content

3473
02:31:38,218 --> 02:31:43,528
in and around the flower within the

3474
02:31:40,559 --> 02:31:46,288
package that it's within so it's pretty

3475
02:31:43,529 --> 02:31:47,789
important as John has been learning you

3476
02:31:46,289 --> 02:31:50,189
know to give you an idea what is it like

3477
02:31:47,789 --> 02:31:54,029
in the in the high 20s and that [ __ ]

3478
02:31:50,189 --> 02:31:57,679
turns to dust John yeah 28:29 bread

3479
02:31:54,029 --> 02:32:00,209
crumbs aw is set at 30 pasta is 50

3480
02:31:57,679 --> 02:32:03,929
mostly account of us I'm testing it

3481
02:32:00,209 --> 02:32:08,100
between 29 and 46 and what do you think

3482
02:32:03,929 --> 02:32:10,799
it should be 55 to 60 Oh 55 to 58 I

3483
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:12,418
think seems to be what the US government

3484
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:13,949
I've heard some little things that are

3485
02:32:12,418 --> 02:32:16,738
key coming from government system a at

3486
02:32:13,949 --> 02:32:19,020
the 58 seems to be that aw reading

3487
02:32:16,738 --> 02:32:22,139
that's easy be at a safe zone or

3488
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:25,560
anything at 64 and 65 we know 65 calls

3489
02:32:22,139 --> 02:32:27,179
us more these molds stuff like that 62

3490
02:32:25,559 --> 02:32:29,548
is kind of people a little scared a ton

3491
02:32:27,179 --> 02:32:31,259
so I think the 58 and I'm seeing that

3492
02:32:29,549 --> 02:32:33,119
more with the people that I'm kind of

3493
02:32:31,259 --> 02:32:34,350
more or less consulting with and talking

3494
02:32:33,119 --> 02:32:38,069
with they're trying to get people on

3495
02:32:34,350 --> 02:32:39,899
that 58 percent and there's relative

3496
02:32:38,068 --> 02:32:41,398
humidity there's there's gonna be things

3497
02:32:39,898 --> 02:32:43,228
I really want to talk about where I'm

3498
02:32:41,398 --> 02:32:43,619
going to talk about it on just you me

3499
02:32:43,228 --> 02:32:45,239
mark

3500
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:47,610
do a whole section on it then probably

3501
02:32:45,239 --> 02:32:49,680
come back with Church after and get more

3502
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:52,170
really deep into it and talk more about

3503
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:53,729
it because something has to be done and

3504
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:55,590
once we get that I think it's gonna set

3505
02:32:53,729 --> 02:32:57,090
a real standardization for just not just

3506
02:32:55,590 --> 02:32:59,190
here in Canada before around the world

3507
02:32:57,090 --> 02:33:00,810
of being able to standardize different

3508
02:32:59,190 --> 02:33:02,579
strange different products and I'm

3509
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:04,260
seeing it huge for me because I mean

3510
02:33:02,579 --> 02:33:07,260
fighting that standardization by

3511
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:08,700
decarboxylation with dr. Horne BT trying

3512
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:11,101
to standardize my girl what's using a

3513
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:13,351
one-part Kornblum and when it come down

3514
02:33:11,101 --> 02:33:15,021
all at the end it really came down to aw

3515
02:33:13,351 --> 02:33:18,900
I really started feeling that that

3516
02:33:15,021 --> 02:33:20,790
keeping this fresh all the time at a

3517
02:33:18,899 --> 02:33:23,459
certain moisture level really plays a

3518
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:27,540
key role and being able to get that same

3519
02:33:23,459 --> 02:33:30,750
feeling all the time so it's a huge our

3520
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:33,120
own ups yeah yeah I just wanted missus

3521
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:37,379
yeah this is this is just I mean it's

3522
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:44,760
nice it's fresh it's it's it's yeah it's

3523
02:33:37,379 --> 02:33:48,869
like guys yeah one day do you find that

3524
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:51,960
flowers dry out faster or or differently

3525
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:57,150
based off different growing styles

3526
02:33:51,959 --> 02:34:01,199
Johnny stay like soilless medium or an a

3527
02:33:57,149 --> 02:34:05,010
rockwool aeroponic or a super deep

3528
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:07,920
living soil what's your opinion on on

3529
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:09,420
how those flowers cure all right I've

3530
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:11,969
seen them because I did some soil

3531
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:14,010
testing years and years ago and I found

3532
02:34:11,969 --> 02:34:15,389
the more airier stuff kind of dried up

3533
02:34:14,010 --> 02:34:17,280
quicker and that was when I was just

3534
02:34:15,389 --> 02:34:18,510
using a pure cocoa to be honest and but

3535
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:20,550
I was swinging this difference with heat

3536
02:34:18,510 --> 02:34:23,010
and then it does different soil mixtures

3537
02:34:20,549 --> 02:34:26,209
with just pro mix and then like an

3538
02:34:23,010 --> 02:34:30,239
amendment of cocoa and something else

3539
02:34:26,209 --> 02:34:32,310
III really comes down to is is is the

3540
02:34:30,239 --> 02:34:33,869
but if it's it's a team that's more area

3541
02:34:32,310 --> 02:34:35,129
it's gonna cure differently if it's more

3542
02:34:33,870 --> 02:34:38,070
into kind of harder it's cured

3543
02:34:35,129 --> 02:34:41,609
differently I'm seeing a different just

3544
02:34:38,069 --> 02:34:43,289
in and packaging and just saying if say

3545
02:34:41,610 --> 02:34:45,090
I normally used to package my cannabis

3546
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:47,610
to say 62 to 60 percent

3547
02:34:45,090 --> 02:34:50,130
well that aw is actually 50 to 52 inside

3548
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:53,280
a container so right there I can tell

3549
02:34:50,129 --> 02:34:54,569
you what provinces are packaging without

3550
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:56,851
using control brooms

3551
02:34:54,569 --> 02:34:57,529
across Canada by testing all the LP weed

3552
02:34:56,851 --> 02:34:59,569
right now

3553
02:34:57,530 --> 02:35:02,000
just by testing and I already know what

3554
02:34:59,569 --> 02:35:03,649
province is coming from which is funny

3555
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,200
so there's all these olds they're

3556
02:35:03,649 --> 02:35:08,359
interesting I I just you know gut

3557
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:10,490
feeling is you know that the more

3558
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:12,920
microorganisms you have in your iso

3559
02:35:10,489 --> 02:35:15,020
sphere and the more fight you know

3560
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:17,389
fungal filaments and fine filaments that

3561
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:18,829
are activated with minerals inside your

3562
02:35:17,389 --> 02:35:23,119
accounts that it's gonna it's gonna

3563
02:35:18,829 --> 02:35:26,209
create better waxes and better try comb

3564
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:28,490
you know cellular walls and that's gonna

3565
02:35:26,209 --> 02:35:31,009
affect the gases and the off gassing and

3566
02:35:28,489 --> 02:35:33,260
because i know a lot of farmers that you

3567
02:35:31,010 --> 02:35:35,420
know and hash makers that you know will

3568
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:37,940
hang their plants up in a controlled

3569
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:41,299
environment you know for three three

3570
02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:43,640
weeks you know four weeks and and some

3571
02:35:41,299 --> 02:35:45,259
weed that would dry out too fast you

3572
02:35:43,639 --> 02:35:47,420
know and it would just get crumbly and

3573
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:49,420
stuff so i i'm just i would that's

3574
02:35:47,420 --> 02:35:51,950
something that we like to see more

3575
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:57,739
information on it's just you know the

3576
02:35:51,950 --> 02:36:00,800
difference on yeah we're we're testing

3577
02:35:57,739 --> 02:36:03,199
on a couple points here there is a lot

3578
02:36:00,799 --> 02:36:05,859
of evidence looking at the symbiotic

3579
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:11,329
relationship between the soil microbiota

3580
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:14,000
because of the soil microbe I will

3581
02:36:11,329 --> 02:36:16,399
actually provide nutrients my nutrients

3582
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:20,690
out of the the minerals as well as

3583
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:23,739
create turkey and precursors and excrete

3584
02:36:20,690 --> 02:36:28,370
through a symbiotic exchange for glucose

3585
02:36:23,739 --> 02:36:32,090
provide minerals as well as terpenes and

3586
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:35,150
and other nutrients to the plants so yes

3587
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:39,079
having a more diverse soil microbiota is

3588
02:36:35,149 --> 02:36:42,469
going to produce more greater chirping

3589
02:36:39,079 --> 02:36:45,950
contents in canvas varieties I would I

3590
02:36:42,469 --> 02:36:48,739
would hypothesize that different

3591
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:50,570
microbial bacteria are going to be

3592
02:36:48,739 --> 02:36:55,399
providing different nutrients based on

3593
02:36:50,569 --> 02:36:57,409
their role in a soil ecology but on top

3594
02:36:55,399 --> 02:36:58,909
of that you know there's there is some

3595
02:36:57,409 --> 02:37:02,809
quite a bit of published research

3596
02:36:58,909 --> 02:37:05,030
looking at silica content so content is

3597
02:37:02,809 --> 02:37:07,549
going is oftentimes absorbed by the

3598
02:37:05,030 --> 02:37:08,829
plants and then used in building cell

3599
02:37:07,549 --> 02:37:11,129
walls

3600
02:37:08,829 --> 02:37:13,299
and same with calcium magnesium

3601
02:37:11,129 --> 02:37:16,089
magnesium more for chlorophyll

3602
02:37:13,299 --> 02:37:18,489
production solo of magnesium soils are

3603
02:37:16,090 --> 02:37:21,310
gonna have less chlorophyll less that

3604
02:37:18,489 --> 02:37:23,260
you have to cure out high silica soils

3605
02:37:21,310 --> 02:37:27,760
are gonna create more woody stocks but

3606
02:37:23,260 --> 02:37:29,530
also have thicker cell walls and then so

3607
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:31,450
there is going to be that we see that

3608
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:34,271
the same thing with grapes growing

3609
02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:36,280
grapes and different appellations or

3610
02:37:34,271 --> 02:37:38,771
terroirs are going to produce slightly

3611
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:41,230
different notes based on mineral content

3612
02:37:38,771 --> 02:37:44,079
of the soil bacteria in the soil and

3613
02:37:41,229 --> 02:37:46,389
even growing conditions and even when

3614
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:48,521
the plant has its own microbiome which

3615
02:37:46,389 --> 02:37:51,699
is called the end acidic reaction within

3616
02:37:48,521 --> 02:37:55,510
the plant and we know that when we look

3617
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:57,370
at say the yew tree we there was tax all

3618
02:37:55,510 --> 02:38:00,579
that was coming from the yew tree and

3619
02:37:57,370 --> 02:38:03,370
what they realized was that the cambium

3620
02:38:00,579 --> 02:38:05,110
layer within the yew tree it was

3621
02:38:03,370 --> 02:38:07,900
actually the end of fights that were

3622
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:10,659
creating that tax all so what we're

3623
02:38:07,899 --> 02:38:12,760
really interested in is that is the

3624
02:38:10,659 --> 02:38:15,521
interior yeah that they were interacting

3625
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:17,110
to make it medicinal and we know that

3626
02:38:15,521 --> 02:38:19,061
this is a medicinal plant with just

3627
02:38:17,110 --> 02:38:21,760
seven several different opportunities

3628
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:24,369
within its cannabinoid ratios so I'm

3629
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:26,170
really interested in endo FIDIC reaction

3630
02:38:24,370 --> 02:38:28,390
within the plant that is actually

3631
02:38:26,170 --> 02:38:31,090
creating the medicinal compounds and

3632
02:38:28,389 --> 02:38:32,619
that's something that you know is is

3633
02:38:31,090 --> 02:38:33,909
really interesting and that's something

3634
02:38:32,620 --> 02:38:36,040
that you're gonna get through soil

3635
02:38:33,909 --> 02:38:39,010
diversity and through microbe a healthy

3636
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:41,340
microbiome so we talk a lot about you

3637
02:38:39,010 --> 02:38:43,960
know the the microbiome within the soil

3638
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:45,549
it's really interesting to talk about

3639
02:38:43,959 --> 02:38:48,369
how that relates to the microbiome

3640
02:38:45,549 --> 02:38:50,049
actually within the plant and yeah and

3641
02:38:48,370 --> 02:38:52,390
this is this is so huge because what

3642
02:38:50,049 --> 02:38:53,590
we've seen and we're you know our sort

3643
02:38:52,389 --> 02:38:55,629
of group and company is very much

3644
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:57,659
involved in him specific and cannabis

3645
02:38:55,629 --> 02:38:59,859
specific it's all cannabis but

3646
02:38:57,659 --> 02:39:02,049
microbiology that really benefits and

3647
02:38:59,860 --> 02:39:03,970
supports oil production as well as

3648
02:39:02,049 --> 02:39:06,310
overall meal plan now that's really our

3649
02:39:03,969 --> 02:39:09,760
area where we live to geek out on and

3650
02:39:06,310 --> 02:39:11,440
you know we've seen both when when

3651
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:13,930
you've got really that kind of a

3652
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:16,390
specific biology in the soil how it

3653
02:39:13,930 --> 02:39:18,579
interacts with the biology of the plant

3654
02:39:16,389 --> 02:39:20,590
it's with its internal microbiome and

3655
02:39:18,579 --> 02:39:22,659
what that does to oil production and

3656
02:39:20,590 --> 02:39:26,140
terpene production in general we've seen

3657
02:39:22,659 --> 02:39:28,810
trichome actual formation structurally

3658
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:30,670
with lower rates of decarboxylation when

3659
02:39:28,810 --> 02:39:32,799
you've got sir on when it's still on the

3660
02:39:30,670 --> 02:39:35,469
flower you know when we've when we've

3661
02:39:32,799 --> 02:39:37,420
got the right biology in the soil and in

3662
02:39:35,469 --> 02:39:39,219
the rise of sphere and how its how its

3663
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:41,440
interacting so both how that relates to

3664
02:39:39,219 --> 02:39:43,600
the drying out of effect you know and

3665
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:45,069
those increase resident oil levels like

3666
02:39:43,601 --> 02:39:46,329
you were saying the waxes and lipids as

3667
02:39:45,069 --> 02:39:48,610
well as all those different components

3668
02:39:46,329 --> 02:39:52,060
we found that to be really significant

3669
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:54,069
for sure and also speaking to this

3670
02:39:52,060 --> 02:39:56,829
silica we've actually found there to be

3671
02:39:54,069 --> 02:39:59,229
about four key pillars is sort of our

3672
02:39:56,829 --> 02:40:03,280
feeling in the soil to really get those

3673
02:39:59,229 --> 02:40:06,299
highest oil contents which I think have

3674
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:08,771
a big factor also on that drying out

3675
02:40:06,299 --> 02:40:09,969
approach but also just quality and

3676
02:40:08,771 --> 02:40:11,530
everything we've been talking about in

3677
02:40:09,969 --> 02:40:18,159
terms of that there's different major

3678
02:40:11,530 --> 02:40:20,320
quality pieces and and how things drying

3679
02:40:18,159 --> 02:40:22,450
and result as well and you know one of

3680
02:40:20,319 --> 02:40:23,890
those the first that we really found is

3681
02:40:22,450 --> 02:40:26,460
that first pillar it's definitely that

3682
02:40:23,890 --> 02:40:28,959
hemp specific or cannabis specific

3683
02:40:26,459 --> 02:40:30,939
microbiology in the soil with good

3684
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:32,439
diversity at high populations is just

3685
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:34,480
crucial both because of everything from

3686
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:36,550
the nutrient you know availability and

3687
02:40:34,479 --> 02:40:38,379
an absorption soluble disease and

3688
02:40:36,549 --> 02:40:41,259
soluble icing mobilizing chelating it

3689
02:40:38,379 --> 02:40:44,170
and as well as really that comprehensive

3690
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:45,819
root health but also like you're saying

3691
02:40:44,170 --> 02:40:48,190
they're stimulating with their secondary

3692
02:40:45,819 --> 02:40:50,351
metabolites a lot of those biosynthetic

3693
02:40:48,190 --> 02:40:51,819
pathways that are actually gonna be

3694
02:40:50,351 --> 02:40:53,950
stimulating those synthase enzyme

3695
02:40:51,819 --> 02:40:56,319
production for cannabinoids and turkeys

3696
02:40:53,950 --> 02:40:58,630
and providing those precursors so that

3697
02:40:56,319 --> 02:41:01,930
that's we found that to be really

3698
02:40:58,629 --> 02:41:04,060
crucial for increased oil production and

3699
02:41:01,930 --> 02:41:06,880
comeback I knew with that having you

3700
02:41:04,060 --> 02:41:09,369
know the right carbon levels in the soil

3701
02:41:06,879 --> 02:41:11,289
in the right forms sort of in that

3702
02:41:09,370 --> 02:41:13,630
second color because we need to be able

3703
02:41:11,290 --> 02:41:15,760
to feed the biology not just in the you

3704
02:41:13,629 --> 02:41:17,500
know the root exudates the glucose that

3705
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:19,120
they're naturally producing out but also

3706
02:41:17,500 --> 02:41:22,090
having immediately available food

3707
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:24,670
sources and slower release kind of

3708
02:41:22,090 --> 02:41:27,069
habitats for the carbon in the soil and

3709
02:41:24,670 --> 02:41:28,540
when you've got that the microbiology of

3710
02:41:27,069 --> 02:41:30,101
just seeing whole other levels of

3711
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:31,660
biological activity which then are

3712
02:41:30,101 --> 02:41:32,650
stimulating the plants in all these

3713
02:41:31,659 --> 02:41:34,989
different ways

3714
02:41:32,649 --> 02:41:37,359
and you combine that with you know those

3715
02:41:34,989 --> 02:41:40,869
right macro micronutrients at each

3716
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:42,190
developmental stage of the plant combine

3717
02:41:40,870 --> 02:41:43,960
that with having all those broad

3718
02:41:42,190 --> 02:41:45,310
spectrum trace minerals like you're

3719
02:41:43,959 --> 02:41:46,779
saying with silica and a lot of these

3720
02:41:45,310 --> 02:41:49,149
other ones that we won't even normally

3721
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:51,551
talk about as micronutrients we've got

3722
02:41:49,149 --> 02:41:53,819
all four of those pillars really dialed

3723
02:41:51,550 --> 02:41:56,409
in that's what we've just been seeing

3724
02:41:53,819 --> 02:41:59,470
really incredible oil production and

3725
02:41:56,409 --> 02:42:01,720
just incredible terpene and cannabinoid

3726
02:41:59,470 --> 02:42:04,989
profile really sort of developed our

3727
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:06,640
whole system around optimizing that yeah

3728
02:42:04,989 --> 02:42:08,409
I think the root root mass is your

3729
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:10,000
stomach the stomach of the plant so the

3730
02:42:08,409 --> 02:42:11,130
bit the better the better the roots the

3731
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:13,479
better the fruits

3732
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:16,779
not the baby that reads the biggest

3733
02:42:13,479 --> 02:42:18,459
roots yeah and are you sequestering you

3734
02:42:16,780 --> 02:42:20,940
were working on sequestering some of

3735
02:42:18,459 --> 02:42:23,939
this carbon in carbon capturing that

3736
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:27,131
yeah something I've been extremely

3737
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:30,101
studying for quite some time and I'm

3738
02:42:27,130 --> 02:42:31,689
very interested in in that realm yeah

3739
02:42:30,101 --> 02:42:33,101
and and one of the things I mean when

3740
02:42:31,690 --> 02:42:34,810
you've got high levels of beneficial

3741
02:42:33,101 --> 02:42:36,730
biology there were Sapir fights that are

3742
02:42:34,810 --> 02:42:40,029
you know carbon eaters in their soil as

3743
02:42:36,729 --> 02:42:46,841
they eat that you know those exudates

3744
02:42:40,030 --> 02:42:47,200
another thing oh no he's muted there we

3745
02:42:46,841 --> 02:42:49,720
go

3746
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:51,940
yeah and they're they're necro mass

3747
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:54,130
really helps to sort of bind and hold a

3748
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:55,810
lot of that carbon in the soil so we've

3749
02:42:54,130 --> 02:42:59,170
found that to be yeah really supportive

3750
02:42:55,810 --> 02:43:00,819
on that front as well for sure yeah I

3751
02:42:59,170 --> 02:43:02,409
like what you guys are doing over there

3752
02:43:00,819 --> 02:43:04,931
at soil balance I've always enjoyed

3753
02:43:02,409 --> 02:43:07,149
having Peter on it's been it's great to

3754
02:43:04,931 --> 02:43:08,829
have you on it and discussing and and

3755
02:43:07,149 --> 02:43:10,149
peace you know just doing the work once

3756
02:43:08,829 --> 02:43:12,789
again it's not always something that's

3757
02:43:10,149 --> 02:43:15,220
so easy to do without you know the

3758
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:17,351
structure of a company you know that's

3759
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:19,180
what that's generally what we work under

3760
02:43:17,351 --> 02:43:35,110
like unless you're like independently

3761
02:43:19,181 --> 02:43:37,440
wealthy yeah yeah yeah it's breaking up

3762
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:37,440
on us

3763
02:43:40,279 --> 02:43:47,209
seems to be the thing too that I'm

3764
02:43:44,568 --> 02:43:50,028
actually um I've used the soil balance

3765
02:43:47,209 --> 02:43:53,720
Pro I mean there's your stuff there yeah

3766
02:43:50,029 --> 02:43:56,600
I'm also trying this one that uh dr.

3767
02:43:53,719 --> 02:43:57,908
Mary Jane's plant probiotics just give

3768
02:43:56,600 --> 02:44:00,828
it a shot so I'm just kind of curious

3769
02:43:57,908 --> 02:44:02,600
and I saw so much action in my soils

3770
02:44:00,828 --> 02:44:04,458
that I've actually had it like feed so

3771
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:06,380
much more and a lot of people don't see

3772
02:44:04,459 --> 02:44:07,520
that and I've tried both and like I've

3773
02:44:06,379 --> 02:44:09,108
just because I'm always just kind of

3774
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:10,399
curious on what's working and stuff like

3775
02:44:09,109 --> 02:44:12,828
that but that's the one thing a lot of

3776
02:44:10,398 --> 02:44:15,019
people and I'm seeing is I'm be trying

3777
02:44:12,828 --> 02:44:16,699
getting more into using these plants

3778
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:19,130
soil bases and getting more into looking

3779
02:44:16,699 --> 02:44:21,859
at the root zones more and more and as

3780
02:44:19,129 --> 02:44:24,318
I'm actually increasing all my more

3781
02:44:21,859 --> 02:44:26,568
activity in my soils I am seeing

3782
02:44:24,318 --> 02:44:28,038
different plants and stuff like that and

3783
02:44:26,568 --> 02:44:29,600
half the changement nutrients right away

3784
02:44:28,039 --> 02:44:31,670
I'm like whoa guys slow down and stuff

3785
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:33,229
like that so yeah a lot of people have

3786
02:44:31,670 --> 02:44:35,510
to really take a look at that - for

3787
02:44:33,228 --> 02:44:37,248
beginner growers and like team people in

3788
02:44:35,510 --> 02:44:40,279
myself before for a long time and I

3789
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:41,748
start using some of these new soils and

3790
02:44:40,279 --> 02:44:43,908
then beginning I didn't realize it now

3791
02:44:41,748 --> 02:44:45,799
that I'm seeing that oh yeah I got a

3792
02:44:43,908 --> 02:44:47,208
feed more um you said seven I'm pumping

3793
02:44:45,799 --> 02:44:50,538
it up because there's just so much more

3794
02:44:47,209 --> 02:44:52,609
activity going on and realizing that's a

3795
02:44:50,539 --> 02:44:53,959
key and we and we actually develop

3796
02:44:52,609 --> 02:44:56,238
because we saw the same thing you know

3797
02:44:53,959 --> 02:44:58,159
you got such heterogeneous soils and

3798
02:44:56,238 --> 02:44:59,689
having the beneficial biology is huge

3799
02:44:58,158 --> 02:45:01,219
but there's these other pillars right

3800
02:44:59,689 --> 02:45:02,568
having the right carbon levels having

3801
02:45:01,219 --> 02:45:05,420
the right Mac of micros and the trace

3802
02:45:02,568 --> 02:45:07,549
and so we actually did was because you

3803
02:45:05,420 --> 02:45:08,898
know it can be so challenging like you

3804
02:45:07,549 --> 02:45:10,639
know mark like you were saying to get

3805
02:45:08,898 --> 02:45:12,469
all that stuff tiled and if you don't

3806
02:45:10,639 --> 02:45:14,958
have that budget we actually developed a

3807
02:45:12,469 --> 02:45:16,969
whole system where you know we've got

3808
02:45:14,959 --> 02:45:19,010
those mill you know cannabis and have

3809
02:45:16,969 --> 02:45:21,170
specific some beneficial microbes that

3810
02:45:19,010 --> 02:45:22,369
are stimulating oil production in

3811
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:24,469
getting that boost and turkeying

3812
02:45:22,369 --> 02:45:27,619
profiles but then we combined it with

3813
02:45:24,469 --> 02:45:30,049
specific soil testing and bi-weekly leak

3814
02:45:27,619 --> 02:45:31,640
tissue and sap analysis so that we're

3815
02:45:30,049 --> 02:45:33,679
actually able to check you know you're

3816
02:45:31,639 --> 02:45:36,139
doing like a co2 and an h2o soil

3817
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:37,880
analysis right off the bat to check what

3818
02:45:36,139 --> 02:45:40,099
nutrients are currently plant available

3819
02:45:37,879 --> 02:45:41,929
and which ones are still locked up in

3820
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:45,649
reserve so that we can actually start

3821
02:45:41,930 --> 02:45:48,109
really getting precise and tracking what

3822
02:45:45,648 --> 02:45:49,849
that nutrient cycling is gonna be like

3823
02:45:48,109 --> 02:45:52,789
in a really highly biologically active

3824
02:45:49,850 --> 02:45:54,029
soil and then once you get the yeah and

3825
02:45:52,789 --> 02:45:56,129
then once you get the bi-weekly

3826
02:45:54,029 --> 02:45:57,449
tissue and sap analysis yeah then you

3827
02:45:56,129 --> 02:45:59,369
can actually track

3828
02:45:57,449 --> 02:46:01,619
what's an accessor deficiently not

3829
02:45:59,369 --> 02:46:03,838
deficiency not just a current time of

3830
02:46:01,619 --> 02:46:05,459
each stage but what will be that's

3831
02:46:03,838 --> 02:46:07,199
what's so cool about the sap analysis

3832
02:46:05,459 --> 02:46:09,510
you're gonna catch deficiencies and

3833
02:46:07,199 --> 02:46:11,520
excesses you know two to three weeks out

3834
02:46:09,510 --> 02:46:15,328
before they show up as symptoms before

3835
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:17,549
they reduce yield profiles potency and

3836
02:46:15,328 --> 02:46:21,238
get rid all of those things optimized

3837
02:46:17,549 --> 02:46:23,339
yeah I mean you and it's it's so crucial

3838
02:46:21,238 --> 02:46:25,529
for by a highly biological active soil

3839
02:46:23,338 --> 02:46:27,539
if you're saying Johnny because it's

3840
02:46:25,529 --> 02:46:30,049
when you get that increased nutrient

3841
02:46:27,539 --> 02:46:32,760
cycling you need to be able to adjust

3842
02:46:30,049 --> 02:46:34,199
both the macro micronutrients make sure

3843
02:46:32,760 --> 02:46:36,148
you've got the carbon in the right forms

3844
02:46:34,199 --> 02:46:37,588
and when you combine all these testing

3845
02:46:36,148 --> 02:46:39,328
that we've got in the system you can

3846
02:46:37,588 --> 02:46:41,338
make the fertility recommendations to go

3847
02:46:39,328 --> 02:46:43,408
with that really high levels of

3848
02:46:41,338 --> 02:46:45,389
beneficial biology that's what we've

3849
02:46:43,408 --> 02:46:47,038
seen just that that mind blowing like a

3850
02:46:45,389 --> 02:46:48,958
genetic expression it's like taking

3851
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:51,869
whatever that genotype is capable of and

3852
02:46:48,959 --> 02:46:53,129
really optimizing and amplifying it so

3853
02:46:51,869 --> 02:46:56,279
that's that's what we've been putting

3854
02:46:53,129 --> 02:46:58,560
together to support course yeah have you

3855
02:46:56,279 --> 02:47:00,359
have you been working on different types

3856
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:02,939
of medians we could you know for

3857
02:47:00,359 --> 02:47:06,510
instance cocoa versus judicious soil

3858
02:47:02,939 --> 02:47:08,818
versus you know rock wall you know every

3859
02:47:06,510 --> 02:47:11,338
every medium holds nutrients in a

3860
02:47:08,818 --> 02:47:14,488
different way cocoa holds certain things

3861
02:47:11,338 --> 02:47:17,309
back and soil that's certain things

3862
02:47:14,488 --> 02:47:20,398
through and you know there's so have you

3863
02:47:17,309 --> 02:47:23,248
worked on the dynamics of that alone

3864
02:47:20,398 --> 02:47:24,510
have you guys been focusing on that yeah

3865
02:47:23,248 --> 02:47:25,828
I mean we've we've been growing with

3866
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:28,109
growers using a whole bunch of different

3867
02:47:25,828 --> 02:47:30,029
mediums both living soils Coco's

3868
02:47:28,109 --> 02:47:32,668
different things aeroponics Antep onyx

3869
02:47:30,029 --> 02:47:34,859
and so it's something we've been looking

3870
02:47:32,668 --> 02:47:36,418
at and how one of the reasons again for

3871
02:47:34,859 --> 02:47:38,488
all this precision testing that we've

3872
02:47:36,418 --> 02:47:40,498
sort of built into our system it's

3873
02:47:38,488 --> 02:47:43,680
because like you just there is no

3874
02:47:40,498 --> 02:47:45,208
one-size-fits-all right there's no

3875
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:47,180
silver bullet everything is going to be

3876
02:47:45,209 --> 02:47:50,310
different and the more we can really get

3877
02:47:47,180 --> 02:47:53,039
precise and helping each core a farmer

3878
02:47:50,309 --> 02:47:56,068
on a larger small scale really dial in

3879
02:47:53,039 --> 02:47:57,869
all of those different pillars that's

3880
02:47:56,068 --> 02:47:59,788
all we've just seen seem just the

3881
02:47:57,869 --> 02:48:02,549
amazing results and both on being able

3882
02:47:59,789 --> 02:48:04,020
to grow you know the the flour and oil

3883
02:48:02,549 --> 02:48:05,720
and the extracts that are gonna be most

3884
02:48:04,020 --> 02:48:07,500
medicinal for the people who need it and

3885
02:48:05,719 --> 02:48:13,609
yeah that's good

3886
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:13,610
exciting for us that are incredible man

3887
02:48:17,809 --> 02:48:22,289
well what a great episode of hashed

3888
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:25,280
Church today that was a solid three

3889
02:48:22,290 --> 02:48:27,330
hours like almost without a break in

3890
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:29,610
conversation I know I have to read what

3891
02:48:27,329 --> 02:48:31,319
Sam said because he definitely wanted me

3892
02:48:29,610 --> 02:48:34,590
to read this so that was what he said

3893
02:48:31,319 --> 02:48:36,449
was this week in Colorado the USA's

3894
02:48:34,590 --> 02:48:38,520
first plant breeder rights for cannabis

3895
02:48:36,450 --> 02:48:40,950
under you POV were applied for this is

3896
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:43,020
the alternative to plant patents and is

3897
02:48:40,950 --> 02:48:46,230
what fruit and veggie and flower plant

3898
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:48,540
breeders use so there that's what he had

3899
02:48:46,229 --> 02:48:50,039
said III had heard to most of what he

3900
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:51,900
had said when he had mentioned that

3901
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:54,240
earlier I'm not sure if you guys did but

3902
02:48:51,899 --> 02:48:57,389
there you go Sam I know you're not in

3903
02:48:54,239 --> 02:48:59,190
the room anymore but I did say what you

3904
02:48:57,389 --> 02:49:03,389
wrote me maybe an hour and a half after

3905
02:48:59,190 --> 02:49:07,170
you wrote it but nonetheless so yeah I

3906
02:49:03,389 --> 02:49:09,510
think I think things look good - maybe

3907
02:49:07,170 --> 02:49:11,069
continue the conversation next week and

3908
02:49:09,510 --> 02:49:12,780
get a little more deep into some of

3909
02:49:11,069 --> 02:49:15,869

3925
02:49:51,479 --> 02:49:57,840
thank you so much for dropping serious

3926
02:49:55,319 --> 02:49:59,819
knowledge bombs today and just dropping

3927
02:49:57,840 --> 02:50:01,620
in depth knowledge about everything

3928
02:49:59,819 --> 02:50:05,670
you're just the [ __ ] encyclopedia

3929
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:07,950
dude it's well it's something that I I'm

3930
02:50:05,670 --> 02:50:09,809
certainly passionate about because we

3931
02:50:07,950 --> 02:50:12,829
want we want to be able to have create

3932
02:50:09,809 --> 02:50:14,850
you know create good corporate and

3933
02:50:12,829 --> 02:50:17,190
ecologically social responsible

3934
02:50:14,850 --> 02:50:20,699
companies but at the same time we want

3935
02:50:17,190 --> 02:50:23,039
to be able to assure that you know the

3936
02:50:20,699 --> 02:50:26,699
the community at large the patients at

3937
02:50:23,039 --> 02:50:29,219
large still maintain axis so I think you

3938
02:50:26,699 --> 02:50:31,859
know I think there is a need for for

3939
02:50:29,218 --> 02:50:34,528
testing companies to develop help

3940
02:50:31,859 --> 02:50:36,658
breeders develop these lines there is a

3941
02:50:34,529 --> 02:50:39,509
need for nurseries to help distribute

3942
02:50:36,658 --> 02:50:42,328
these lines and in some regards there's

3943
02:50:39,509 --> 02:50:45,988
a need to be able to develop rights or

3944
02:50:42,328 --> 02:50:48,449
whatever you know do some commerce in

3945
02:50:45,988 --> 02:50:50,398
those genetics but we want to do it in a

3946
02:50:48,449 --> 02:50:54,359
way that it doesn't take away from the

3947
02:50:50,398 --> 02:50:56,009
industry so you know the all the people

3948
02:50:54,359 --> 02:50:58,078
on the call the people watching it need

3949
02:50:56,009 --> 02:51:01,139
to be able to you know understand and

3950
02:50:58,078 --> 02:51:03,078
differentiate and really support and the

3951
02:51:01,139 --> 02:51:06,118
the growers and breeders that aren't

3952
02:51:03,078 --> 02:51:08,309
they are trying to promote safe access

3953
02:51:06,119 --> 02:51:14,369
not not trying to capitalize off of

3954
02:51:08,309 --> 02:51:15,538
limited access yeah that's it right

3955
02:51:14,369 --> 02:51:18,600
there that's it in a nutshell right

3956
02:51:15,539 --> 02:51:20,219
there that's it just make it fair and

3957
02:51:18,600 --> 02:51:22,259
don't try to limit access and control

3958
02:51:20,218 --> 02:51:24,059
off limit access I'm also here the words

3959
02:51:22,259 --> 02:51:26,158
of Sam you know if someone spends

3960
02:51:24,059 --> 02:51:27,718
millions of dollars and there's PhDs are

3961
02:51:26,158 --> 02:51:29,998
hired that had to go to school for years

3962
02:51:27,718 --> 02:51:31,948
to get their PhD and the cost of the

3963
02:51:29,998 --> 02:51:34,199
infrastructure the greenhouses and the

3964
02:51:31,949 --> 02:51:36,569
breeding and the if incredible work is

3965
02:51:34,199 --> 02:51:38,520
done and novel cannabinoid profiles are

3966
02:51:36,568 --> 02:51:40,288
produced with unique novel terpene

3967
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:42,479
expressions that we've never seen in the

3968
02:51:40,289 --> 02:51:45,270
black market like is it gonna chat my

3969
02:51:42,478 --> 02:51:48,088
ass if someone somehow puts a plant

3970
02:51:45,270 --> 02:51:50,158
breeder rights on that probably not I'd

3971
02:51:48,088 --> 02:51:52,259
probably be more like the glass half

3972
02:51:50,158 --> 02:51:54,088
full guy kind of like wow like they did

3973
02:51:52,259 --> 02:51:55,770
a lot of work to create something that

3974
02:51:54,088 --> 02:51:57,359
wasn't really readily available and now

3975
02:51:55,770 --> 02:51:58,890
it's going to be available like you

3976
02:51:57,359 --> 02:52:00,988
might be able to buy it and lease their

3977
02:51:58,889 --> 02:52:02,548
pad there there there cultivar or you'll

3978
02:52:00,988 --> 02:52:03,689
be able to purchase the end product of

3979
02:52:02,549 --> 02:52:05,819
it that's sold through whatever

3980
02:52:03,689 --> 02:52:07,918
companies that make the deal but people

3981
02:52:05,818 --> 02:52:09,930
are always just like you know it's the

3982
02:52:07,918 --> 02:52:11,759
internet nowadays it's like the wild

3983
02:52:09,930 --> 02:52:13,918
wild west with the keyboards people just

3984
02:52:11,759 --> 02:52:17,189
have strong personal opinions they want

3985
02:52:13,918 --> 02:52:19,498
to share about everything and it's crazy

3986
02:52:17,189 --> 02:52:22,259
how fast you just make a wrong statement

3987
02:52:19,498 --> 02:52:30,898
in social media and it's like everyone

3988
02:52:22,259 --> 02:52:33,918
