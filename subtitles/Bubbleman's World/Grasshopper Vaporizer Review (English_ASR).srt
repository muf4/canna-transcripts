today we're going to be doing a little

4
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,559
review on a quite a wonderful little

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,959
unit that I've been excited to get for

6
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,960
quite some time now it's called the

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,239
Grasshopper Vaporizer now they make them

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,480
both in stainless steel as well as

9
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:44,280
titanium this unit is 100% titanium uh

10
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:47,558
the titanium unit as it will and it was

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,039
um passed along to me this year in Spain

12
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:52,599
in Barcelona at the spannabis and I

13

Vaporizer decom uh and go right to the

25
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,839
source got a cool little grasshopper

26
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,519
sticker here and the thing comes basic

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,759
um I'm not sure if it actually comes

28
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,399
with this or if he kicked me down a

29
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,840
little extra he gave me two extra

30
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:41,879
batteries rechargeable uh uh lee ion 3.7

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,280
volt 750 Mah this is the model GHB 1 and

32
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,560
it's also says Hopper labs and has the

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,960
little grasshopper logo on there so I

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,320
got one with the unit itself as well as

35
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,399
the two extras so that's very nice to

36
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,239
have and one of the really cool things

37
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,000
about this unit that I thought was was

38
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,839
pretty interesting was how it charged

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,159
it's got the classic USB charger uh but

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,840
but it's got this little guy here and I

41
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,600
wanted to kind of show you up close how

42
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,960
kind of cool this is you got this little

43
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,318
guy and

44
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,719
basically it's that simple you just

45
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:15,000
attach it it's magnetic and that's how

46
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,759
you charge the unit so I really thought

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that was cool kind of futuristic much

48
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,399
like these new Apple iPhones and such

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,719
with their um easy to charge just place

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,519
it down and it's

51
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,598
magnetic um the unit itself is is very

52
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,959
very simple uh the top goes

53
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,679
uh switches here you can you can twist

54
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,479
the entire top to open up the unit and

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,840
uh remove the battery so there's one of

56
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,759
the batteries right there and it's just

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,080
a real simple unit titanium pop that

58
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,079
battery in there turn this little guy to

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,080
spin

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,519
it the threads grab real nice and easy

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,800
on all of it that's one of the things I

62
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,959
like about it and then there's five

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,560
settings so at the top here you have a

64
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,280
little pen clicker you've got your basic

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,799
setting and then you go to two to three

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,840
to four and to five and of course each

67
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,080
person is going to enjoy their vapor at

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,360
a different level it's also got this

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,959
cool little uh silicon piece that I

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,599
guess originally I thought was for a

71
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,598
mouthpiece but then I realized if I just

72
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,479
gently put it into my down stem uh or

73
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,479
sorry my drop down I could actually take

74
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,959
rips through my pipe as well so we'll be

75
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,560
doing that here in a little bit now this

76
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,280
is a vaporizer for flowers for herbs I

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,000
do not believe it's a very uh

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,878
a unit that you would use concentrates

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,080
for I've been told just to use flowers

80
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,919
and it's real simple you unscrew the top

81
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,640
it's got a very small three little

82
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,399
threaded piece inside this stain uh

83
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,438
sorry inside this titanium piece you've

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,080
got a little screen inside so that when

85
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:50,400
you're inhaling you're not uh inhaling

86
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,840
the dust or the small particulate of the

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
of the Cannabis and then inside here

88
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,560
it's got as well another perforated

89
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,798
laser screen with three tiny holes in

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,759
the side and uh why don't we just just

91
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,599
get going right here I've grown a little

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,399
bit of my own little

93
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:11,438
Jamaican pop that in there you guys a

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,400
little give you guys a little see here

95
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,719
there's a little bud there it's kind of

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,879
going out of the out of the Sun so I

97
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,519
don't want to take it too close to the

98
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,918
camera but that's some of my Jamaican

99
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,040
from 1995 and I guess simply enough

100
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,599
we'll just crush a little nugget of it

101
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,000
into this

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,160
unit it's uh I've only used the unit

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,959
once myself so far and it was quite nice

104
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,880
I did a little review on Periscope

105
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,719
yesterday unfortunately Periscope was a

106
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,120
little bit glitchy so I thought you know

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,360
I think this vaporizer deserves a full

108
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,879
review on my YouTube channel and I

109
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,120
wanted to give that shout out to vape

110
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,279
fiend for hooking it up and vaporizer

111
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,000
wizard in Canada they've sent some units

112
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,918
in the past so I thought I'd pass their

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
address on as well and of course

114
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,439
Grasshopper Vaporizer who is the one

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,079
that put this unit together so there we

116
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,319
go we got it nice and stuffed we'll take

117
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:09,519
a few different varieties of hits

118
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,399
here this is one of my favorite Parts

119
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:15,879
about the pen now I'm going to set it on

120
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:19,079
four you click it down you get these

121
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:22,038
little red lights that come on one two

122
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,359
that's it it was about 4 seconds blue

123
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,918
it's up to temperature and you can

124
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,919
already start

125
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,478
vaping

126
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,918
nice light Vapor coming out right at the

127
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:51,079
start real nice tasty tasty flavors on

128
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:53,680
those first few rips coming through

129
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:56,000
exactly like the flavor of the herb this

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,800
was an outdoor grown herb that I growed

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,478
on my deck so I can taste that outdoor

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,478
Sun grown quality to it

133
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,960
very nice indeed why don't we try a few

134
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,280
rips through the mother ship and see how

135
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,519
that

136
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:16,598
goes twists in real nice doesn't feel

137
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,598
janky or loose at

138
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,639
all wow that was a surprising huge rip

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,759
that I got off there completely

140
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,000
different from hitting it on the unit by

141
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,000
itself the water created this incredible

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,680
suction not bad at

143
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
all give that a little click

144
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,038
off a little empty

145
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,599
empty sometimes when it doesn't empty

146
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,279
right away that means that you've got a

147
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,719
little bit of resin still left in there

148
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:07,359
and you could probably take a few more

149
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,039
hits um very small amount sure if you

150
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,639
guys can see this but uh I got a little

151
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:14,839
picture to show you I'd say it's less

152
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,759
than a quarter of a

153
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,119
gram the unit cleans really nice and

154
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,800
easy though I'm quite impressed with

155
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,199
that so let's try a little bit of the

156
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,319
Astro Boy that I've had curing for well

157
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,960
over a year now this stuff hits just

158
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,240
beautifully great turpine profile on the

159
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,038
Astro Boy uh you can just smell and

160
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,960
taste that unique flavor not saying that

161
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,279
the Jamaican didn't have a very nice

162
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,959
unique flavor as well the Astro Boy is

163
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,439
just much more fruity and really gives

164
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,598
that sort of fruity

165
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,399
rip so I'm just kind of holding my

166
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:51,399
finger over the top and blowing out the

167
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,959
um where the thread is that way you

168
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,560
don't get a buildup of resin in those

169
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,439
threads I'm sure that it could happen

170
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,639
clean that out a little bit as well give

171
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:08,158
it a quick click and we'll count this

172
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:11,199
time one 2 3 4 and it's done I think

173
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:14,360
we're going to go for first a clean rip

174
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,360
right out of the right out of the

175
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,439
unit oh God is that tasty we got to go

176
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,439
right into the bong

177
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
now

178
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,000
that is a pretty incredible little unit

179
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:44,559
for the size and for the efficiency and

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,639
for how um fast it heats up how easy it

181
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,159
is to clean how easy it is to roll with

182
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,159
it in the

183
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,360
pocket

184
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,239
really nice indeed tasty treats I don't

185
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,519
get to enjoy flowers very

186
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,519
often as I'm mainly a hash smoker and

187
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,000
even though now people could argue that

188
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,278
I'm hitting flowers really what I'm

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,759
doing is I'm hot air extracting the hash

190
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,039
off of the flowers and of course the

191
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:26,120
flowers are being left over uh nicely uh

192
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,719
dric combed completely removed and uh

193
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,000
yeah I'm impressed with this little unit

194
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:35,000
I got to say

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
one two three

196
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,680
done can't believe the taste right down

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,759
to the end as well really just

198
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,159
continually hitting a nice flavorful rip

199
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,480
now I'd love to tell you how long the

200
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,399
battery lasts that's something I'm going

201
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,079
to have to get back to you on I haven't

202
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,720
killed one yet I was using it yesterday

203
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,719
and I used it

204
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,000
today now I'm by no means hitting it

205
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,839
like a fiend I hit maybe four or five

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,399
bowls and ideally it'd be nice to know

207
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,920
exactly how many full Chambers you can

208
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,919
hit with a single

209
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,480
battery but I guess that's why they give

210
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,639
you a second battery

211
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,680
too uh for that very reason and it's

212
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,319
easy to just click on and off and get it

213
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,719
back up to temperature if it's cooling

214
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,720
down on

215
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,120
you excellent excellent little unit so

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,760
this will maybe be a two-parter I want

217
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,120
to get back to you guys and let you know

218
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,720
how durable it is you know how I'm very

219
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,759
hard on these units uh I travel with

220
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,278
them and I Ru with them in a way that I

221
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,600
I definitely don't treat them like

222
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,919
they're eggs um I treat them like

223
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
they're a unit and that they're going to

224
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,759
last I treat them very much like the way

225
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,320
I would treat my bubble bags keep them

226
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,240
clean uh and put them away all the time

227
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,040
but at the same time by no means do I

228
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,799
baby them when it's work time it's work

229
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,120
time and uh this unit right here being

230
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,559
100% titanium really gives me the feel

231
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,839
that uh that it's to last even the

232
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:26,479
Silicon uh mouthpiece which I regularly

233
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,440
really don't like these very much it's

234
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959
not your average one it's a much it's

235
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,839
like a silicon wrapped around a silicon

236
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,559
tip so it's very thick up here and very

237
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,240
thin down here much like those cheap

238
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,239
ones that you get with all the pens that

239
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,560
you can just put on top of there this is

240
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,720
more like a two-part unit so uh I like

241
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,919
that as

242
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,480
well give it another

243
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:52,000
click for it to be able to turn on that

244
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:55,240
fast is incredible one two

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,240
3 3

246
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,958
seconds

247
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,320
good old Vapor cough happening there

248
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,799
coming out of the end of the cold and

249
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,920
that little bit of uh that real nice

250
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,919
little hit that it gives you just

251
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,000
uh grabs you by the throat anyway I want

252
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,120
to give a shout out to the Grasshopper

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,278
Vaporizer crew I want to give a shout

254
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,720
out to vape fiend for hooking me up with

255
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,838
this in Barcelona I do apologize that it

256
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,278
took so long I was sick for almost three

257
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,160
weeks there but here I am reviewing the

258
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:58,000
unit and I got to say it's a great

259
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,240
little unit I love the way it looks like

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,639
a pen super nondescript does not look

261
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,240
like your regular vapor pens in any way

262
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,320
shape or form it actually looks like a

263
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,720
pen so shout out to those guys for doing

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,040
such a great job uh having such a

265
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,120
successful

266
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,439
Kickstarter and uh yeah I think I'm

267
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,000
going to be a fan I like the idea of

268
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,839
bringing around a little bit of crushed

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
up herb and this is something that might

270
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,120
be important to you if you want to use

271
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,440
vaporizers like this and the reason I'm

272
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,159
getting the rips that I'm getting uh is

273
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
because I've dried the herb this herb

274
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,719
has actually been dried for months

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,839
and it was really going to be used for

276
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,920
dry sifting so it's probably even just a

277
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,639
little

278
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:41,278
bit just past dry uh but the rips that

279
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,919
you get out of it because of it are

280
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,480
these really responsive it's the

281
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,198
difference between hitting a fresh plant

282
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,159
and hitting properly dried material and

283
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:49,919
this is a good lesson for you

284
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,159
bubbleheads and dry sifters out there as

285
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,078
well um fresh frozen is going to be

286
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,360
twice as hard to dry properly than cured

287
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,599
properly cured Bud that is then washed

288
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,039
and with dry sifting you are not dry

289
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,920
sifting if you haven't dried the

290
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,599
material properly and so this is

291
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,240
properly dried material it hits perfect

292
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,120
in a vaporizer it's completely

293
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,120
responsive to um vaporizing the second

294
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,879
the heat gets there and the heat doesn't

295
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,679
have to work its way through a uh you

296
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,838
know moist wax membrane to get to the

297
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:23,479
medicine so I guess uh nothing left to

298
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,399
do but thank you guys for watching and

299
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,039
