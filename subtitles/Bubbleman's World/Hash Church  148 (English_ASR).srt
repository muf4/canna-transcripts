just with the cannabis plant but with

31
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,219
other herbs and nutrients so she was has

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:27,629

37
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,370
contribute to the conversation she had

38
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,270
some interesting stories to share about

39
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:54,360
her mother who had lung cancer and a

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:58,110
nice conversation came up about using

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,430
cannabis not only for medical purposes

42
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:05,010
but also for end-of-life purposes and to

43
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,159
help people die with dignity and so

44
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:11,909
that's what inspired Nisha to write her

45
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,370
book which is the full title is chronic

46
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,789
relief a guide to cannabis for the

47
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,610
terminally and chronically ill and check

48
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:22,859
out her book I haven't personally read

49
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,240
the whole book but I've looked through

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,740
the whole syllabus and overview of the

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,200
book and she does a really nice job of

52
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,590
giving an overview of the medical

53
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,750
applications of cannabis breaks it down

54
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,390
and a really easy to use and really to

55
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,699
understand why it's a book I suggested

56
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:45,149
my parents check out who are new to

57
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:47,489
cannabis I also recently suggested it to

58
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,849
someone who contacted me about more

59
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,700
information about cannabis for cancer

60
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,079
because she includes a lot of recipes

61
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,769
simple ways to prepare cannabis

62
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,100
different ways to apply it including

63
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:04,050
edible topical suppositories and yeah

64
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,799
it's just a really nice overview dr.

65
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,270
Ethan Russo wrote the intro and he's the

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,260
person who actually introduced me to

67
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:16,199
Nisha so she is she's really awesome

68
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:19,889
check out her book we also had natasha

69
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,500

70
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,459

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,370
have similar names

72
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,169
Natasha residues hash array so what's

73
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,949

74
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:33,199
that we also had Amanda Siebert the

75

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,310
what to say I'm just completely

109
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,839
blissed-out have you been following this

110
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,949
no tell me tell me more so you're there

111
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:29,029
with your family yeah so usually yes I'm

112
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:34,189
here with my wife my daughter and we're

113
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:36,729
just up for this weekend and so fish the

114
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:39,350
band fish with the pH yes that band

115
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,069
usually plays like a summer tour but

116
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,280
this

117
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:46,819
some are out east here they decided to

118
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:52,938
do a 13 show residency at Madison Square

119
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:59,090
Garden right probably most haloed rock

120
00:06:52,939 --> 00:07:00,770
venue in New York City so it's 13 shows

121
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:05,138
so they're calling it the baker's dozen

122
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:08,389
which is kind of cool because I guess

123
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:11,090
Baker's would always throw in the 13th

124
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,360
doughnut to make the so called baker's

125
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:15,560
dozen so yeah to cover their ass right

126
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,419
to make sure that they were getting

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,009
getting good products out to their

128
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:20,810
customers so I guess even back to

129
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,759
medieval times they talked about the

130
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:28,158
baker's dozen being a very very

131
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:31,098
important thing that enabled loyalty to

132
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:34,188
the throne somehow so yeah crazy stuff

133
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:36,468
so each night they have a different

134
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:38,449
flavored doughnut and so the first night

135
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:41,658
opening night that the flavored doughnut

136
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:44,900
was coconut so they they covered the

137
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:47,750
Schmilsson tomb put the lime in the

138
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:50,168
coconut and drink it all out and so

139
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,300
every coconut theme song they try to

140
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:56,000
fill their whole set with coconut theme

141
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,098
songs last night it was strawberries so

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,649
strawberry doughnuts was the theme last

143
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:03,908
night and so we got what was that name

144
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:08,269
of that tune again strawberry letter 23

145
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:10,418
strawberry letter 23 and Strawberry

146
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:13,250
Fields they opened up with the Beatles

147
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:15,740
Strawberry Fields playing at acapella it

148
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,918
was just so cool sorry about the no hash

149
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,418
content here but just tell them you like

150
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,908
what we're doing here in New York and

151
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:25,218
it's a lot of fun and so each night

152
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:27,649
there's a new doughnut and what they do

153
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:29,689
the band just does a creative vortex has

154
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:33,019
been taken the theme of that doughnut

155
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:35,870
and putting it back into the set so for

156
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:39,320
tight the doughnut is a red velvet

157
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,418
doughnut with cream cheese and so

158
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,669
there's a lot of speculation that there

159
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:45,528
will be some Velvet Underground covers

160
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:47,689
because of the velvet fish has got a

161
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:50,028
song called waiting in the Velvet C so

162
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,160
we'll certainly hear a Velvet see but

163
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,799
each night is a different doughnut and

164
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,179
so

165
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,389
we're thinking like the Boston cream

166
00:08:54,179 --> 00:09:00,269
doughnut they'll play some Boston covers

167
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:03,000
you know or maybe for the powdered you

168
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:05,129
know doughnut they would do God knows

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,889
you know Neil Young powder fingers up

170
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:09,750
you know so each theme each night is a

171
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:12,870
different theme so it's kind of cool is

172
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:17,190
this something look forward to and they

173
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:21,110
give doughnut somebody to and doughnuts

174
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,339
are notably the most wonderful food that

175
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:28,278
Canada has brought to the world right

176
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:35,160

177
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:41,088

pretty good you're on your end

179
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,059
there's a little bit of an echo but

180
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,089
that's just because Sam I think is not

181

182

up to and I'll I'll work on that

192
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:25,379
well we are here in Montego Bay Jamaica

193
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:26,729
we had our products registered with the

194
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,338
Minister of Health recently here in

195
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,920
Jamaica the prana CBD products and so

196
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,020
today we are training the doctors and

197
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,000
the pharmacists who will be prescribing

198
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,490
this medicine in the upcoming months

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,059
here in the Caribbean and Jamaica and so

200
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,769
it's pretty exciting these are a lot of

201
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:45,299
there obviously educated doctors that

202
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,799
they don't have a lot of education in

203
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,179
the end of a cannabinoid system they

204
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,429
don't have a lot of education when it

205
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,838
comes to cannabis when you talk to the

206
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:54,269
majority of them they seem to be a lot

207
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,589
from the sort of knidos standpoint you

208
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,209
know the majority of things I think

209
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,100
they've seen over the years for the

210
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:01,019
negative you know a lot of them believe

211
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,250
that cannabis is addictive but if you

212
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,838
smoke cannabis in the morning you're

213
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,399
addicted to it and sort of there's

214
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,420
there's a little bit of that sort of

215
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,399
NIDA mental

216
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,399
the but at the same time when you talk

217
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,370
to them they're very receptive and open

218
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,870
to education to proper information and

219
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,370
they're they're intelligent people so I

220
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,339
think it's gonna be a pretty exciting

221
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,889
day tony has built an absolutely

222

what when I'm in Jamaica it's always

241
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,000
technical information I think I'm

242
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,409
literally sitting above four blenders

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,639
right now like look at these guys are

244
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:19,649

245
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,419
party over there I need to set up the

246
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:23,190

noise isn't too loud let me know I'll

248
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,000

249
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:28,708
possible yeah same here

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,240
I changed headphones so hopefully these

251
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:36,319

252
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,120
time no you sound good I can't but that

253
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,190
[Music]

254
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,049
so it wasn't my I'm when I was speaking

255
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,670
when Natasha opened up the first church

256
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:47,969
so I want to start over again by

257
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:50,568
absolutely thanking all the women who

258
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,910
came into hash Church last week and just

259
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:55,349
crushed it it was very impressive I

260
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,850
learned a lot from watching the ladies

261
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,670
interact with one another

262
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,889
I've always felt like any type of pause

263
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:03,599
is like not good and we shouldn't have

264
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,278
them but after watching the ladies and

265
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,589
having they will talk and then they

266
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,939
would all stop and there'd be like cuz I

267
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,870
just thought it was really nice and

268
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,640
there was something that we could learn

269
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,470
from that particular experience I love

270
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,110
the information that the women shared I

271
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,460
loved how they consistently kept the

272
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,039
panel full for the entire

273
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,830
oh that was really impressive and just

274
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:29,129
great job organizing and moderating

275
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,650
Natasha as well as Hillary black you

276
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:33,720
guys both did a stand-up bang-up job and

277
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,029
everyone I don't I can't even name them

278
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,040
all but it really was an impressive

279
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:40,769
church and we're definitely gonna get

280
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,809
more of those women back and we'll try

281
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:45,269
to do some more all-women panels because

282
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,279
I think it's just good I think it's

283
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:49,199
unique I'm not into segregating I'm not

284
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,659
into you know keeping certain people out

285
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,980
but I think that the woman panel the all

286
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:58,309
woman panel really it impressed me I was

287
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,310
very impressed

288
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:07,139

00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,309

299
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,800
could take part and yeah it's it's not

300

impressed which Hillary opened up with

311
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,610

immature it's a conversation we've never

314

even breached because you can only

315
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,850
imagine I mean even when we talk about

316

318

00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:51,000
probably only for another half an hour

330
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:54,000
to an hour I've got to go do this

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,559
triplets uh yeah maybe we could get to

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,450
get a little bit more information from

333
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,189
Brian I know people have been really

334
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:04,540
enjoying the greenhouse talks the

335
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,750
growing talks and what's going on all

336
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,730
right

337
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,679
garden supplies you're in California

338
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,360
you're in the epicenter of cannabis

339
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,929
growing in the entire world I doubt that

340
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,480
there's a larger cannabis community

341
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:18,549
larger cannabis industry anywhere than

342
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,810
in California maybe Sam knows somewhere

343
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:25,419
that I don't know but wouldn't you say

344
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:29,859
California is the market Sam Oh what

345
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:33,789
about Morocco Lebanon Afghanistan yep

346
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,220
yep just seems like California just has

347
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:37,929
that purchasing power of buying a lot I

348
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:49,240
wonder how much of that hash ends up

awesome Kelly and we're from dragonfly

420
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:03,149
earth medicine and we own a inoculant

421
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,650
company in both Canada and the US and

422
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:09,480
also Europe but primarily were 27 years

423
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,240
cannabis farmers

424
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:16,778
appear in BC and we've just done a lot

425
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,240
of Education with organics and living

426
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:21,690
off the land closed-loop systems really

427
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,980
learning how to grow cannabis without

428
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,558
anything without any help other than

429
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,808
another nature and how that raises

430
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:36,069
cannabinoid levels and terpene levels so

431
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:38,798
often so often nice so in Canada do you

432
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:41,859
grow outdoors under lights in a

433
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:46,710
greenhouse what's our set up primarily

434
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:50,439
in interesting greenhouses and outdoors

435
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:54,009
greenhouses for 25 years no we were we

436
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,019
used to do gorilla grows way out in the

437
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:57,759
bush and we started growing in

438
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,319
greenhouses once I got our medical

439
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,750
license about seven years ago

440
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,908
I mean we've grown every way in the last

441
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:10,450
27 years kind of thing you know well for

442
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:12,039
27 years like the first garden yes over

443
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,808
the course of time we've lived on this

444
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:18,398
land for 11 years and made it an amazing

445
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:22,000
thing so well tell us more about the

446
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:25,089
inoculant ok the inoculants are

447
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,759
basically made out of different herbs so

448
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:30,609
I am a health care provider I work with

449
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,769
women and children in the third world as

450
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:34,628
well as on the cannabis farmer so I'm

451
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:37,558
the Midwife as well as I have it back

452
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:41,378
what background in naturopathic medicine

453
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,898
and I have always gone to disaster

454
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:46,500
relief zones to help women and children

455
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:51,579
out like after Haiti after the tsunami

456
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,500
and we utilize what's around the area to

457
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:56,798
help bring nutrition to the women and

458
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,500
children so a lot of times when there's

459
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,179
a cut-off or you can't get supplies that

460
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,569
you need in zones and areas which is a

461
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:07,419
lot like what we're in NBC we utilize

462
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:10,599
the natural herbs to get vitamins

463
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,720
minerals or trace minerals and then we

464
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:16,480
lose the immune system so our entire

465
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,929
herbal inoculant is based off of health

466
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,860
and well-being for women primarily so

467
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:24,019
it's a pregnancy tea blend

468
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:27,229
Julie and then you add different fungi

469
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:29,298
and bacteria to it make a brew voila it

470
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,429
just happens to be amazing for cannabis

471
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:33,679
plants as well and over the course of

472
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:35,720
the years by working with women and

473
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,290
pregnant women along with plants and

474
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,200
herbalist herbalism and mycology you can

475
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:43,928
see the placenta change you can see the

476
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,730
women change you can see the healthy

477
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:49,880
baby change you're working with

478
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,370
malnutrition human beings that live a

479
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,850
third world life and you're giving them

480
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:57,889
simple vitamins or even just telling

481
00:23:55,849 --> 00:24:00,469
them to drink the Moringa tree more or

482
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:04,130
eat the tapioca greens more and you can

483
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,900
see how the placenta changes and and all

484
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,070
of the vital signs change and

485
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,730
everything's great and then we're

486
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:12,558
growing herbs and plants the whole time

487
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,000
to create the medicine for the women and

488
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,129
then we're starting to treat the plants

489
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,589
like the like the women and then we

490
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:23,299
started realizing you know the beauty of

491
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:24,649
of using plant medicine on plants so and

492
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:26,869
then watching the health of the plants

493
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,400
changed due to it and then we lived far

494
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,509
away in the mountains up here so it was

495
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,759
a bit of a necessity and so we just

496
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:37,369
dropped out of society essentially for a

497
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,890
really long time and just did our work

498
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:42,019
and did that work across the world in

499
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,120
here and then we started our dragonfly

500
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:47,480
earth medicine ten years ago now so it's

501
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:49,479
ten years ago we made our first product

502
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,579
which was lush roots our mycorrhizal

503
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,640
inoculum based off Southern Oregon and

504
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:58,308
the monumental growing that happens down

505
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,650
there and the mythical amazing families

506
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:03,319
that have been doing it forever along

507
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,660
with Northern California you know the

508
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:08,298
the Maiko teas back in the day where it

509
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,820
were a big kind of like thing that that

510
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:13,548
jumped planted health a lot so we

511
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:15,289
started on that level and they started

512
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:17,119
working with herbs and bacteria so it's

513
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:19,250
been a long process lots of different

514
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,798
steps into trying to find Health for

515
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,779
soil primarily and it just so happened

516
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:27,079
that it mimicked health for women and

517
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:29,418
children as well that's really

518
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:31,549
interesting can you tell us a little bit

519
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,530
more you mentioned you also put some

520
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:34,109
other herbs that were good for the

521
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:35,849
immune

522
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:38,669
system I'm interested in the immune

523
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:40,678
system so yeah you tell me a little bit

524
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,259
more about that yeah well for our

525
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:47,070
vegetating plants that didn't work sorry

526
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:51,140
for vegetating plants we do Nettles

527
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:53,808
horse tail alfalfa we utilized wild yam

528
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:59,580
because it's also a natural stimulant

529
00:25:53,808 --> 00:26:02,009
for hormones as well let's see we've got

530
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:07,379
burdock root in there we work with a

531
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:13,369
wild turkey rhubarb root what else do we

532
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:15,690
need a comfrey spirulina raw cacao I

533
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:17,428
think that's about it and they're all

534
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,160
sort of inner blended in there you add

535
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:23,280
the bacteria then you add it into a brew

536
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,320
or as a top dress into a soil and then

537
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,899
immediately the microbiology starts to

538
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:29,399
break down that those herbs herbal

539
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,820
compounds so it makes it readily

540
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,940
available to the plants how did you

541
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:38,039
choose your microbes did you choose like

542
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,048
microbes to be broad-spectrum or did you

543
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,539
choose some specifics for specific

544
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:45,839
purposes we primarily chose them because

545
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:48,119
they're organic so you know the basis of

546
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,129
our product is all definitely organic we

547
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,739
go all the way down the lines to try to

548
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,780
find out exactly you know where our

549
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,029
herbs come from whether it's wild

550
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,879
crafted or we go to the farm itself and

551
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:01,859
it's human grade organic not for use in

552
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,160
agriculture organic which we'll get into

553
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:09,389
later being a big difference so we use

554
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:12,509
that five different bacterial blend that

555
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,460
is grown off of non GMO substrate and

556
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:16,980
that's really the only organic one that

557
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,230
we can find in the industry that's

558
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,919
readily available and that we know where

559
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:25,558
it comes from yes here's the opportunity

560
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:29,040
for a great educational moment which is

561
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:32,339
that you know bacteria again often get

562
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,730
you know bacteria the bad guy actually

563
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:37,769
you know the plant relies on a healthy

564
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,529
microbial population to help fix

565
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:42,629
nitrogen because nitrogen fixation is a

566
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:45,089
very high-energy process and bacteria

567
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,940
have this ship figured out man prions

568
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:49,129
and you can't read

569
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,650
and so everything that kind of came

570
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,930
after on the food chain came based on

571
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,360
the bacteria's ability to fix nitrogen

572
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:59,019
and what we're talking about is atomic

573
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:03,109
nitrogen which is inert an inert gas

574
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:05,299
that's 79% of the atmosphere but when it

575
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:08,990
gets fixed it gets put into soluble form

576
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:11,029
and and it's a nitrogen molecule gets

577
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,440
turned into an amine and the amine are

578
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:16,009
like the amino acids which are

579
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,590
absolutely essential building blocks for

580
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:21,470
proteins for all living organisms and so

581
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:23,599
again if you try to fight bacteria I

582
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,299
mean I'm not saying that you know again

583
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,549
the guy who doesn't wash his hands after

584
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:30,379
using the lavatory or you know it

585
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:33,950
doesn't have good sanitary hygiene

586
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:36,920
practices bacteria there's a whole host

587
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,330
of good ones and bad ones and I think we

588
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,920
have to you know use this as an

589
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:43,069
educational moment to let people know

590
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,320
that not all bacteria is bad some

591
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:49,750
bacteria is bad and certainly you can't

592
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:52,369
just use broad-spectrum any microbial

593
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,039
biocides because it wipes out some of

594
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:57,529
these lower rungs in the food chain

595
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,220
ladder that the rest of the the latter

596
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:03,769
relies on and so when you knock out the

597
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,289
ability for microbes to nitrogen

598
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:08,569
fixation you have to rely on nitrogen

599
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:10,970
input and now you're talking about

600
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:12,559
fertilizer so again I think what you're

601
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,970
what you're doing is really great and I

602
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,559
think we have to figure out a way that

603
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,960
we can use

604
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,419
mother nature's chemistry set which has

605
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,240
had the time course of evolution to sort

606
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:27,410
of unfold and reveal itself to us yeah

607
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:32,059
that's actually what we're big on it

608
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:34,460
vital is combining microbes and NPK

609
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,929
obviously only organic forms of NPK

610
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:41,000
we're big on using compost teas and

611
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:43,640
microbial inoculants to break down and

612
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,640
okay it's balanced it's they have it

613
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,400
figured out it's a it's a game of pH but

614
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,620
it's also a game of you know there's a

615
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,019
whole host of things going on in there

616
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:55,989
some of it I'm probably sure we still

617
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:59,619
don't quite understand but

618
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,630
I think we take lessons from mother

619
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:04,719
nature because she's had her chemistry

620
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:07,210
set a lot longer than we got yeah no no

621
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,460
no I'm no scientist but I have a lot of

622
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,019
experience growing and farming yes you

623
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:15,160
are you're scientists you just don't

624
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:18,549
know it well I'm not accredited let's

625
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:21,340
put it that way and definitely the

626
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:23,710
microbes make the NPK available to the

627
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:25,480
plants so it can actually grow all these

628
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,329
people found in their plants with salts

629
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,069
and feeding feeding feeding the plant

630
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,539
can only take so much especially if

631
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:34,750
there's not a microbe to break it down

632
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:37,178
and in salt form well and again this is

633
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,308
like we were talking about this a couple

634
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:41,910
weeks ago about having roots in the

635
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:44,859
ground you know as opposed to roots in a

636
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:47,410
kiddie pool or a tires of you know

637
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:49,539
flower pots I think when roots are in

638
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:52,450
the ground you're now tapping into

639
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:58,058
mother earth herself which has a whole

640
00:30:52,450 --> 00:31:00,160
different biome than recreated soil or

641
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:03,149
hydroponics or Rock well it's just it's

642
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,650
it's it's it's a whole different game

643
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,740
there's a whole bunch of actors that are

644
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,750
involved and because of that it right

645
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,558
need to like chain themselves to I'm

646
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:16,390
actually seeing people like go from

647
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:18,730
container growing into ground their bed

648
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:22,150
growing and then they realize they don't

649
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:25,089
have to water as much and like the foods

650
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:32,380
in the soil and the and then my carbons

651
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:37,558
and the carbon plant has evolved

652
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:41,350
underneath this light spectrum for eons

653
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,730
disrespectful to our own evolution we're

654
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:47,319
just trying to be better than mother

655
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:49,630
nature at that point scientists right we

656
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:51,369
could take from Mother Nature what we

657
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,130
can learn and share it in venues like

658
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:57,189
this so we can get people thinking at a

659
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:58,990
higher level of you know knowledge which

660
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,179
is great yeah and you know you talk

661
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,190
about putting plants in pots or you know

662
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:04,540
in kiddie pools and stuff and now we're

663
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,509
really starting to realize through

664
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:09,548
observation is that cannabis is a social

665
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:12,158
plant they like to be

666
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:14,499
next to each other they like to speak to

667
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,080
one another they like to share what's

668
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:19,538
going on with one another not only in

669
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:22,239
their upper leaf and canopy section but

670
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:24,819
also in their roots so this idea of

671
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:26,528
separating root zones just isn't really

672
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,418
good for the health not only is it not

673
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:30,638
good for the soil their microbial

674
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:32,619
breakdown but it's not it's not good for

675
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:34,148
the plants as well as their uptake we've

676
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:36,908
been doing a tremendous amount of

677
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:38,709
research on CBG because it's the one

678
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:41,649
thing that we're really looking for you

679
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:44,590
know CPG is that amazing catalyst so a

680
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:47,768
lot in our and our genetics here we find

681
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:50,138
that CBG is going up higher with the

682
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:51,970
same genetics the same soil everything

683
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:54,008
is the same but if we're planting the

684
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,960
two plants next to each other we're

685
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,579
realizing you know where the roots can

686
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,548
intermingle and the roots can have

687
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:02,048
communication that the CBG levels along

688
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:06,308
with all the other cannabinoids are

689
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:09,460
going up and also we do know for a fact

690
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:12,038
that trees communicate within different

691
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:15,639
species like out of their own species

692
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:18,368
they can get a pine tree can get sugars

693
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:20,738
from a birch tree or you know I can come

694
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:23,709
up with much different trees so why

695
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:25,869
wouldn't a cannabis farm continue

696
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,358
communicating with all of the flowers

697
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:30,428
trees around it and around it yeah I

698
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:32,288
mean it's it's just it's a it's a

699
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:34,809
beautiful thing about let's call it it's

700
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:38,460
called quorum sensing quorum sensing and

701
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:41,288
chemical ecology is the way by which

702
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,269
bacteria sort of communicate with 20

703
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:44,980
another and it's it's a language of

704
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:48,849
chemistry which makes me really

705
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:53,288
appreciate it again what I think mike

706
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:56,199
rizzo also is a plants to communicate

707
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:58,210
through one another I want to go back to

708
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,558
a point you you brought up about high

709
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:05,798
CBD high CBG strains or you're seeing

710
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:08,378
prevalence and high CBD CBG so let's

711
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:11,798
let's dial Sam into this discussion so

712
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:15,940
Sam that basically means that they have

713
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:19,769
a down regulated synthase that's not

714
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:22,240
able to process the CBG into its

715
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:23,059
productive and use product well maybe

716
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,659
more

717
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:31,279
productive any news products THC and CBD

718
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:35,049
so I wonder if there's a a mutant or a

719
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:41,030
variety somewhere that we could identify

720
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:43,100
based on a loss of synthase expression

721
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,530
genetically and so what that says is

722
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:49,960
that you're backing up the cannabinoid

723
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:52,460
pathway after that first crucial

724
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,730
carbon-carbon bond formation between all

725
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,889
talvik acid and and and when it first

726
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,920
gets preen elated and so that's the

727
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:02,509
formation of CB GA which happens and so

728
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,340
it's a sort of the stem what they call

729
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:09,140
the stem cell cannabinoid which I think

730
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:12,440
is funny but why wouldn't those so are

731
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:14,779
there mutations in those in those

732
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,630
varieties where we can actually examine

733
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:23,090
why the synthase is not sort of keeping

734
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:25,280
up to produce CBD and and THC from that

735
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:28,640
because they've now there's technology

736
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,470
where they can actually do the CBG in

737
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,750
yeast which is you know scientifically

738
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:35,869
an extraordinary achievement I don't

739
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:38,690
know why you'd want to make CBD or CPG

740
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:41,769
and yeast but maybe again when

741
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:46,280
cannabinoids get more accepted as just

742
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:50,509
mainstay vitamins and nutrients for the

743
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,370
human diet they'll be making CBG in

744
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:56,270
yeast which can then go into a variety

745
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:57,829
of food and perhaps other products for

746
00:35:56,269 --> 00:36:01,159
human consumption just to start to get

747
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:03,650
CVG in the diet but yeah I just want to

748
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:06,259
get Sam Sam's input on the synthase so

749
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:09,470
why would those synthesis sort of not I

750
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,380
mean could we look for like the same

751
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:19,719
type of mutant that you see in Skunk one

752
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:22,369
which has a dysfunctional CBD synthase I

753
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:25,009
missed the other part of it because I

754
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:27,679
was in the other room looking up a

755
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:30,290
bacteria which is prohibited from

756
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:33,169
Australia I was just curious what it was

757
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:34,940
and so I didn't hear the beginning part

758
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,780
of your question well we were just

759
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,639
talking about high CBG

760
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,480
riot ease and and does that basically

761
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:45,869
mean does not make any economic sense

762
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,710
when you can grow develop varieties with

763
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:52,589
yield 10% by dry weight and yeast yields

764
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,980
less than that and they are not really

765
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:57,470
doing it yet right the whole point of

766
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,719
cannabinoids that they work together

767
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:02,250
what's the purpose of isolating one of

768
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,339
the cannabinoids without its whole

769
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:09,599
family near it okay that's one really

770
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:11,460
positive thing when you smoke THC with

771
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,039
the right terpenes what other

772
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,710
cannabinoids do you actually need you

773
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:21,150
don't if you want to get recreationally

774
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:24,420
high from from cannabis you want THC you

775
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:29,539
don't want any other to navigate sand

776
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,539
escapes cv actually I'm more interested

777
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:38,519
if you smoke CBD with THC it delays

778
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:41,009
onset reduces peak experience makes it

779
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:43,739
last longer but who wants some people

780
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,570
are last longer that's not as good hey

781
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,279
who says it's not as good what does it

782
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:51,289
have to be potent to be good that's not

783
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,290
wrong I'm pretty good at judging this

784
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,230
[Laughter]

785
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,930
not for recreational use maybe for some

786
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:11,839
medical use but for recreational use

787
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:14,549
that's not true recreational is medical

788
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,890
that's what you think but it's certainly

789
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,990
not what I think well the whole entire

790
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:20,879
reason that we're sitting here right now

791
00:38:18,989 --> 00:38:23,159
with the ability to talk out in the open

792
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,380
is because of medical and the beauty of

793
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,639
the cannabinoids in the plants so why

794
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,460
does it change when it's recreational

795
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,589
it's the same if it's make feel good why

796
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,269
isn't that medical if all of a sudden

797
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:37,800
I'm having a really shitty day I'm

798
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:39,509
smoking a doobie it makes me feel better

799
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,220
I'm gonna think better thoughts why

800
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,740
isn't that medicine you're agonizing

801
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:45,449
you're cb1 receptors which is the most

802
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:47,429
prevalent receptor in the human brain

803
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:49,558
and so that's not a happy accident

804
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:51,659
the reason why we feel so good when we

805
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:54,300
enjoy a cannabis so it's the lock

806
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:59,129
fitting in the key and we just dumped a

807
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:01,950
lot of keys and we have a lot of lots by

808
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,030
any chance of you guys for recreational

809
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:06,379
purposes only

810
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:10,170
forget medical just for the moment and

811
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:13,588
for recreational purposes only have you

812
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:15,690
ever smoked a pure THC and then added

813
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:30,599
one by one the other cannabinoids and

814
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:35,010
seen what the difference is I have your

815
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,809
muted we didn't hear that I didn't hear

816
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:41,520
the last part of it we didn't know we

817
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:43,859
don't we've never done this broad

818
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:47,159
statements as though you really

819
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:49,259
understand I'm not really sure if we're

820
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,328
necessarily making broad statements as

821
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,520
much as we're just really trying to say

822
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:55,318
that we feel that recreational is

823
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,030
medical and think I'm gonna stick with

824
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:58,710
that I feel like if it makes you feel

825
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,780
good and you're gonna go about your day

826
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,760
and it's gonna make you a better person

827
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,230
because you feel good did I consider

828
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:10,740
that you're saying that there's no one

829
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:13,769
recreational user out there that derives

830
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:16,709
no medical benefit from it or is seeking

831
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:19,530
any medical benefit not one in the in

832
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,630
the whole world I don't know where we're

833
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,440
going yeah I guess I'm a little confused

834
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:26,880
where we're headed

835
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:29,130
I think he's just trying to say for

836
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,059
recreational purposes what you need is

837
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:35,640
THC and the correct terpenes you don't

838
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:39,150
require the other cannabinoids for

839
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:41,279
recreational and use okay that's your

840
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:44,608
perspective I get it that makes a lot of

841
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,048
sense perspective let's agree to

842
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,848
disagree on that point because I think

843
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:49,409
you guys are coming up coming at at the

844
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:51,720
same point and I agree with what Sam

845
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:54,690
saying there's some people who are

846
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:58,379
consuming cannabis purely for as he's

847
00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:00,048
referring to rec purposes ie to get high

848
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,539
but I also agree

849
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:07,518
that feeling good having that mood

850
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:09,979
elevation even that escapee one deserves

851
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:12,919
give you one agonism you can't stop yeah

852
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:16,428
and and I mean that to me I agree I feel

853
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,959
that that is medical and I guess I I

854
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:19,880
don't think we need to separate the two

855
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:22,998
but I get what you're saying that there

856
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,249
are purely you could say it's

857
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:27,379
recreational if someone's just taking it

858
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:32,208
with that intention in mind but why it

859
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:34,640
doesn't that also help drink alcohol it

860
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:43,188
makes them feel good is that medical use

861
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:45,528
of alcohol medical absolutely I don't

862
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:49,129
ever drink alcohol because I consider it

863
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:51,528
yeah it's just not for me

864
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:56,660
it makes me stupid that's the beautiful

865
00:41:51,528 --> 00:41:58,699
thing but low amounts of alcohol are

866
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:01,308
very potent anxiety can help produce

867
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:03,499
anxiety very very effectively and so if

868
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:06,079
you don't consume alcohol that often and

869
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:08,088
you use a small amount it can be very

870
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,859
effective for reducing anxiety so it

871
00:42:08,088 --> 00:42:11,838
definitely can have medical applications

872
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:14,920
but what you're talking about is when

873
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:18,759
people are consuming alcohol everyday

874
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,759
they often of course

875
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:26,929
cannabis consumed daily for stress

876
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:31,068
relaxation to help with anxiety isn't

877
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:33,099
gonna have the same additive problems as

878
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:36,469
something like alcohol can have Kara's

879
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:37,459
once in a while can be okay but I

880
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:40,249
absolutely agree with you

881
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:43,308
cannabis is not a toxic poison alcohol

882
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:46,698
absolutely but we can't deny that low

883
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:49,459
doses of alcohol do you have medical

884
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:52,099
applications and I mean even alcohol

885
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:55,038
topically alcohol for other things it is

886
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:56,869
a medicine also but it is a poison it's

887
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:01,130
all in the dose right it's the feeling

888
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:05,028
of the nation in cannabis but I mean I'm

889
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:07,579
I'm I'm always gonna say people should

890
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:11,650
choose cannabis to relax over alcohol

891
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:13,430
because it's safer over the long term I

892
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:16,430
agree

893
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:18,769
absolutely I don't use cannibal can't I

894
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:20,239
mean I don't use alcohol either but you

895
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:22,610
know it takes all colors of the rainbow

896
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,349
and there's a lot of different choices

897
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,849
out there so people are making all

898
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:27,799
different kinds of choices when they go

899
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,809
to light up that joint s the reason why

900
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,820
they're lighting up that joint you know

901
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:33,710
it may be that they've had a hard day it

902
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,600
may also be just because they want to

903
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,429
get high but I think that it's really

904
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,529
hard to separate it across the board

905
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:43,359
which each individual is utilizing it

906
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,410
for well mass-produce swill from

907
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,070
multi-billion dollar corporations

908
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:51,649
looking to hold cannabis prohibited art

909
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,539
the type of alkali mean I like my micro

910
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,510
brew or I like a single malt scotch a

911
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:58,340
glass of wine it's totally within reason

912
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,400
to think that again humans could have

913
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,620
both and you know Sam we love your

914
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,619
perspective but I think again we all

915
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:08,420
know that the reason why we feel so good

916
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:10,849
is because there is a biological action

917
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,639
in the brain call it you know whatever

918
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:16,190
you want but it's also adding to the

919
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:19,489
fact that we're putting a lot of fat

920
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:22,550
soluble antioxidants into our oedipus

921
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:24,500
tissue and that's slowly released over

922
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:27,140
time which gives a very prophylactic

923
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,300
effect over reactive oxygen species

924
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:32,029
which often form free radicals that can

925
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,860
start causing mutations like cancer and

926
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:37,160
whatnot so the fact that you're

927
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:39,530
basically ingesting cannabinoids which

928
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:41,839
have an endogenous system within our

929
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:45,140
body to regulate I mean think about it

930
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,490
this way the body's pharmaceutical

931
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:49,339
company is the end of cannabinoid system

932
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:50,989
right and so part of it is our art

933
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,750
through health we've talked about this

934
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:58,399
on church health and and also use of

935
00:44:53,750 --> 00:45:00,829
cannabis we're fortifying those you know

936
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,840
immune systems that again have evolved

937
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:05,299
over the time course of evolution in

938
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:08,170
humans you know who are we to

939
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,910
second-guess it pharmaceuticals want to

940
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:13,250
you know give you a pill and yet again

941
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:15,559
the mentality is oh if I'm if I'm sick

942
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,480
there's a pill I could just take a pill

943
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:20,960
and it's you know I think cannabis

944
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,329
provides a different option to provide

945
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,800
wellness to yourself and whether you

946
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:26,869
think you're doing it recreationally

947
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,640
well yeah I'm doing it recreation

948
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,440
right now because I'm in New York I'm

949
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,750
hanging with my Bros and we're all

950
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,820
recreational doubt we're at the fish

951
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:38,449
we're gonna throw down and we're just

952
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,460
we're all recreational but the beautiful

953
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:43,219
thing is while we're being recreational

954
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,070
the molecules going into our bodies are

955
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:48,859
protecting us from cancer are helping

956
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,960
our bodies regulate the immune system in

957
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:54,099
the way our humans that were designed

958
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,599
and all of this all has to do with again

959
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:58,699
your own perspective so from Sam's

960
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:00,889
perspective hey humans are doing this

961
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:02,569
recreationally because I want to get

962
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:05,179
high I want to achieve something but

963
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:07,670
whether you're achieving that for that

964
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,949
reason or not like it or not your body

965
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:12,200
is being flooded with molecules that are

966
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:15,259
probably going to save you from things

967
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:17,480
like glioblastoma tumors I've had a

968
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,200
friend pass away from glioblastoma

969
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:25,070
that's the aggressive form of brain

970
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:27,379
cancer that they just announced I think

971
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,390
who's that John McCain one of the US

972
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,970
senators any in a way came down with but

973
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:36,289
the point is is that our prolonged

974
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:40,189
cannabis use has basically put CBD and

975
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:42,590
other antioxidants which are very very

976
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:45,079
important molecules to regulate reactive

977
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:47,960
oxygen species and so I do believe that

978
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:51,319
a prolonged cannabis use basically helps

979
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,480
protect the brain over your lifetime and

980
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,940
your brain is an extremely important

981
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,920
thing it's kind of like your harddrive

982
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,380
you know having brain your [ __ ] so

983
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,550
you're basically putting medicine in and

984
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,530
even if you're doing it right for

985
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,110
recreational purposes like I am in New

986
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,240
York City I would agree that uh okay I'm

987
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,309
all recreational too now but I'm

988
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,250
basically feeding my endocannabinoids

989
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:14,210
system with these very beneficial

990
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:18,260
molecules that will help me stay alive

991
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:21,409
and and longer and be a little happier I

992
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:24,740
think most of us found cannabis in the

993
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:26,679
recreational form originally because

994
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:29,809
most of us have been around it so long

995
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:31,730
it was prior to any sort of medical

996
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:33,739
research or any of that so it's sort of

997
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:37,670
a blessing that we like fell into the

998
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:39,868
whole cannabis world and you know is it

999
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:44,519
cool to know

1000
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:48,119
you know we were totally with it's

1001
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:50,248
amazing like back in you know pre any of

1002
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,200
these discussions before when everyone

1003
00:47:50,248 --> 00:47:54,748
was still hiding behind closed doors you

1004
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:57,659
know we were experimenting with it and

1005
00:47:54,748 --> 00:48:02,159
now we have this like platform to like

1006
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:04,348
really expand and help people and or or

1007
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,298
or is it that we're just rediscovering

1008
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:08,369
what we already knew you know which is

1009
00:48:06,298 --> 00:48:10,349
really interesting because I'm really

1010
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:11,818
interested in autoimmune disorders it's

1011
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:13,588
something that I've been interested in

1012
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:16,980
for a really long time and I'm starting

1013
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:18,778
to do a lot of research on MTHFR and

1014
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,389
realizing that you know over half the

1015
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:23,639
population of Euro descent have this

1016
00:48:21,389 --> 00:48:26,308
issue and along with this particular

1017
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:29,699
type of mutation which a lot of us have

1018
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:31,920
and don't even realize that we have if

1019
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:34,710
if we're producing things in our body

1020
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,539
that produce stress so there's all kinds

1021
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,849
of toxins that come along with stress

1022
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:41,009
that actually can turn that particular

1023
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:43,289
mutation that a tremendous amount of

1024
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:44,940
people on the planet have right now can

1025
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:47,309
turn it right immediately into an

1026
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,889
autoimmune disorder so the idea of

1027
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:52,499
smoking cannabis are utilizing cannabis

1028
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:54,509
can actually bring all of our levels

1029
00:48:52,498 --> 00:48:57,238
down it brings our cortisol levels down

1030
00:48:54,509 --> 00:49:00,028
it brings down all of the hormones in

1031
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:03,599
our body which actually help us have a

1032
00:49:00,028 --> 00:49:05,099
stronger auto immune system absolutely

1033
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:15,690
without it I don't think I'd be able to

1034
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:18,989
do what I do trying to do is point out

1035
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:21,690
that if your main goal is getting high

1036
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:24,380
then what you want is THC in the right

1037
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:28,200
terpenes none of the other terpenes

1038
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:31,588
contribute to making you higher CBD can

1039
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:34,558
delay onset reduce peak experience make

1040
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:40,768
it last longer if that's what you want

1041
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:43,559
but it's certainly not what I want but

1042
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:48,179
even going back to the feeling high and

1043
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:49,920
even like when you're with your friends

1044
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:51,929
when you're having fun when you're

1045
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,789
feeling connected when you're

1046
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:57,839
of your ego mind when you're in the

1047
00:49:53,789 --> 00:50:01,789
moment when you're calm all those things

1048
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:03,809
help relieve stress anxiety and even I

1049
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:05,789
mean even if you're going on a

1050
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:09,139
psychedelic charity that is still in my

1051
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:11,489
mind medicinal because it's bringing you

1052
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:13,730
just different knowledge different

1053
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:17,009
things that's separating you from your

1054
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:19,139
daily just [ __ ] and it's keeping

1055
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:21,480
giving you something different to think

1056
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:26,219
about it's giving you a change in

1057
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:31,139
perspective which don't you think more

1058
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:32,879
people smoke CBD with THC they say a lot

1059
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:37,619
of them say it's for medical reasons but

1060
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:40,140
a lot of them say that pure THC by

1061
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:43,529
itself when they smoke it get some high

1062
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:47,190
paranoid and they don't like it when

1063
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:50,240
it's mixed with the CBD by reducing the

1064
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:53,490
peak experience by delaying the onset

1065
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:59,009
yeah they're able to handle it enjoyably

1066
00:50:53,489 --> 00:51:02,009
but if you if you wanted recreational

1067
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:03,930
purposes the majority of the people I

1068
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:08,460
know that are really into it they don't

1069
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:11,399
want no CBD with it yeah and I I mean I

1070
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:13,650
I'm a big fan of THC I think THC has

1071
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,260
huge medical applications also so I

1072
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:24,420
don't think THC is just for wreck either

1073
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:28,770
so again other people are gay exactly

1074
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:31,139
that's right I understand that some

1075
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:32,809
people feel it's a bonus but you need to

1076
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:36,989
understand that some people that's

1077
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:43,559
absolutely negative to the hi actually

1078
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:45,179
yeah and I I think I was just saying all

1079
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,799
colors of the rainbow because the truth

1080
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:48,569
of the matter is is that we're growing a

1081
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,620
one to one here and it's about a 12

1082
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:54,630
percent 12% CBD to THC and honestly I

1083
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:57,539
can't smoke it unless it's time for bed

1084
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:00,180
because the CBD mixed with the THC in my

1085
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:03,179
particular body chemistry makes me way

1086
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:04,669
more high than if I'm smoking a 27% C

1087
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:07,190
THC

1088
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,809
so you know it's really individual and

1089
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:11,088
how it is that you're feeling and we

1090
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:13,010
need to be respectful to the concoction

1091
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:15,259
of a hundred other cannabinoids that are

1092
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:19,540
available in there and how it's there's

1093
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:24,290
not a hundred other cannabinoids I mean

1094
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:27,019
how many there might be close to a

1095
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:29,480
hundred that they've discovered in the

1096
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:31,338
last I mean though there was 70 or 80

1097
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,289
for the longest time but they keep

1098
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:35,358
finding ones but you can't help but

1099
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:38,048
wonder are they truly produced by the

1100
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:41,380
plant or as or the results of an hour

1101
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:45,440
yeah I have a really good question is it

1102
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:47,900
medicine when we don't know about it you

1103
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,608
know what I mean does it diancie to like

1104
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,349
bring light to us so that we can

1105
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:54,558
actually understand it I think that in

1106
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:56,930
our bodies were like we were feeling all

1107
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,790
these different cannabinoids so to say

1108
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:01,789
that you're smoking like just THC or

1109
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:05,179
just CBD is rarely ever the case unless

1110
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:09,108
it's an isolate so it's always gonna be

1111
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:12,858
different well after looking at reports

1112
00:53:09,108 --> 00:53:14,568
and THC and CBD levels of cannabis that

1113
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:16,818
I've been smoking for many years that

1114
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:19,099
I'm like sometimes surprised to find

1115
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:22,219
that there's more CBD in it than I

1116
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:24,920
expected and also I think some of that

1117
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:27,980
goes back to how it's grown and many

1118
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,079
other different things as well so sure

1119
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:32,170
this conversation is kind of getting

1120
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:38,240
crazy

1121
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:40,400
anyway disease when you're saying that

1122
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,318
you know these other cannabinoids are

1123
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,470
good for the immune system or whatever

1124
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:49,009
Hey most of these autoimmune diseases

1125
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:53,719
are caused by an overactive autoimmune

1126
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:56,089
system so that's the last thing you want

1127
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:58,578
to do is stimulate your immune system

1128
00:53:56,088 --> 00:54:00,920
no but there's a lot of the cannabinoids

1129
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:02,568
and even terpenes that don't stimulate

1130
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,858
the immune response but they suppress

1131
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:09,170
the immune response so for instance CBD

1132
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:11,659
suppresses immune cells in a good way

1133
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:13,430
and I mean they did early studies trying

1134
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:15,048
to show that this immune suppression was

1135
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:17,819
dangerous and they tried to spin it that

1136
00:54:15,048 --> 00:54:20,550
way but for autoimmune diseases

1137
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,740
that it can modify the immune responses

1138
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:26,610
protective I'm pretty sure the other

1139
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:29,669
lady the excuse me I don't you know your

1140
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:34,079
name but she says that CBD strengthens

1141
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:36,450
your immune system system yeah but I

1142
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,659
mean strengthens can mean a variety of

1143
00:54:36,449 --> 00:54:43,079
things and so it I would say it balances

1144
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:44,730
it keeps it it keeps it under control it

1145
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,269
helps suppress overactive immune

1146
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:51,599
responses and I mean this has a lot of

1147
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:59,489
evidence just and people who are using

1148
00:54:51,599 --> 00:55:01,110
it i lady no no she's saying exactly the

1149
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:03,389
same thing that was what I was saying I

1150
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:05,039
wasn't actually isolating CBD saying

1151
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:07,259
that that's the only thing that we're

1152
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,019
looking for as far as an immune response

1153
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,960
what I was saying is that feeling good

1154
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:14,909
helps stimulate or suppress the immune

1155
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,909
system because feeling good and our

1156
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:19,589
emotions is an adaptogenic emotion at

1157
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:21,779
whether you're feeling good or whether

1158
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,430
you're calm these are things that can

1159
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,700
both help your immune system whether

1160
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:28,710
it's suppressing it or stimulating it

1161
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:30,329
that's what I am immune system the

1162
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:33,090
immune system is very complex so we

1163
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:35,819
can't just say suppressing or increase

1164
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:38,039
is a good thing I mean yeah so like if

1165
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:40,140
we could be both stimulating and

1166
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,840
suppressing the immune system it depends

1167
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:45,029
which branch or which cell we're talking

1168
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,579
about because there are certain early

1169
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:50,060
immune cells that are very critical if

1170
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:52,710
you had something like an invading

1171
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:54,900
pathogen or a microbe or something like

1172
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,659
a bad bacteria you want those early

1173
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:01,650
immune responses to be there and active

1174
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:03,690
so cannabinoids sometimes can help clear

1175
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,119
an infection by simulating some of those

1176
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,159
early immune responses whereas we want

1177
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:11,009
our later immune responses like our T

1178
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:13,379
helper cells our T cells we want those

1179
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:16,800
more suppressed because when those cells

1180
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,630
come in over time and don't don't get

1181
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,450
turned off appropriately they can start

1182
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:23,519
leading to chronic inflammation and can

1183
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:25,349
start leading to autoimmune diseases so

1184
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:26,820
we have to we also have to consider what

1185
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:28,380
part of the immune response were

1186
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:30,240
increasing or decreasing and then we

1187
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,530
also have to consider that there's some

1188
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:34,289
immune cells that

1189
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:36,780
I mean when we think of a neutrophil out

1190
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:38,489
of control it's basically like you can

1191
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,370
think of it's like a soldier with a

1192
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:43,529
machine gun it's just killing everything

1193
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:45,359
that great if you have a serious

1194
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:47,400
infection but if that goes unchecked

1195
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,860
it's causing a lot of damage to

1196
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,480
surrounding tissues so that type of

1197
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,519
immune response you might want it

1198
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,710
increased early on but then you want it

1199
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:59,789
quickly and then we have other immune

1200
00:56:55,710 --> 00:57:01,530
cells like T cells that secrete il-10

1201
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:03,630
and those are immunosuppressive

1202
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:05,310
cytokines and so when those types of

1203
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:07,380
immune responses are increased

1204
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:10,619
they actually suppress the immune system

1205
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,970
so it it gets very complicated so again

1206
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,170
we have to be a little bit careful with

1207
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:14,730
what we mean when we're talking about

1208
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,680
how cannabinoids and these other

1209
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:22,679
compounds can interact with their immune

1210
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:27,269
system living I'm living with the wife

1211
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:32,849
who suffers from autoimmune disease PBC

1212
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:35,400
and yeah the end effect of it is that

1213
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,619
you have to be very careful for example

1214
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:41,099
for a while with her medication she was

1215
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:44,309
drinking a grapefruit juice and then it

1216
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:47,579
turns out great producer was making her

1217
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:49,769
medicines act wrongly so you have to be

1218
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:52,380
really really careful and just broadly

1219
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:58,320
saying that the other cannabinoids are

1220
00:57:52,380 --> 00:58:01,950
beneficial I don't believe it Wow what

1221
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:04,680
sorry what's PVC primary biliary

1222
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:06,269
cirrhosis Oh interesting

1223
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:13,889
yeah and that's interesting you bring up

1224
00:58:06,269 --> 00:58:15,809
the point yeah and it's a good point you

1225
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:18,500
burn the fruit juice and even some other

1226
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:21,750
citrus juices so that's affecting your

1227
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:24,869
cytochrome p450 enzymes in the liver

1228
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:26,940
that break down drugs yeah and so some

1229
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:29,309
of those compounds can affect drug

1230
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,320
metabolism and so yeah you have to be

1231
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:33,389
careful whenever you're taking a new

1232
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,280
compound during a drug you can't just

1233
00:58:33,389 --> 00:58:36,359
assume that everything you eat and the

1234
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,010
plants and the herbs that you're

1235
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,660
consuming don't have interactions with

1236
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:42,120
your medication so yeah it's important

1237
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:43,679
to look into supplements and how they

1238
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,109
can interact with drugs especially if

1239
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:47,839
you're taking high amounts

1240
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:50,570
because what's also interesting I

1241
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:54,769
recently did a 23andme where you get

1242
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:55,970
your genetic analysis done and one part

1243
00:58:54,769 --> 00:59:00,530
that was really interesting with this

1244
00:58:55,969 --> 00:59:04,069
test is they show depending on different

1245
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:05,630
genetic mutations that you have so

1246
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,580
they're called snips single single

1247
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:09,860
nucleotide polymorphisms so it doesn't

1248
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:12,139
necessarily mean that your expression of

1249
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:14,240
that gene will be wrong but it might be

1250
00:59:12,139 --> 00:59:15,949
altered in a way and so what they do is

1251
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:18,019
they show you some of these potential

1252
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:19,189
gene alterations you might have and you

1253
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:21,710
can actually go into the system if you

1254
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:23,360
know what you're doing and see you can

1255
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:26,349
actually look up you might metabolize

1256
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:29,510
cannabis differently or you might be

1257
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:31,460
breaking down your basic

1258
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,690
endocannabinoids like a nanda my

1259
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,730
differently so you can check out those

1260
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:37,700
kinds of things but what I found cool is

1261
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:40,309
they show you what kind of drugs you

1262
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:42,799
might get risk of not metabolizing

1263
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:44,329
appropriately so I found out that if I

1264
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,640
ever have to go on proton pump

1265
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:48,739
inhibitors due to my genetic makeup

1266
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:50,539
there's a certain drug that if I took it

1267
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:52,489
actually wouldn't work for me so then I

1268
00:59:50,539 --> 00:59:54,230
can show my doctor or like hey if I had

1269
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:56,269
to go on these types of drugs this is

1270
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:57,650
the kind I should go on so I thought

1271
00:59:56,269 --> 00:59:59,239
that was pretty interesting and I mean

1272
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,160
that's only gonna evolve as we get more

1273
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:04,099
information more data so we can get a

1274
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:07,699
little more personalized with how we're

1275
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:10,369
taking our medications and increasing

1276
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:11,869
safety to reduce harmful side effects

1277
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:13,609
from a lot of these medications and

1278
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:16,639
harmful interactions especially with

1279
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:20,900
other compounds like you said sound like

1280
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:25,489
grapefruit juice snps are exactly what

1281
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:28,869
the all of these DNA cannabis companies

1282
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:31,519
are identified they're not actually

1283
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:34,279
examining the entire cannabis genome

1284
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:39,650
what they're doing is looking at 20,000

1285
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:43,220
30,000 40,000 snps I was talking about

1286
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:45,530
them in reference to human genes but you

1287
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:51,230
understand yeah baby

1288
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:54,230
gal no thank you yeah yeah yeah I wanted

1289
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:56,630
to ask Joshua and Kelly you to go a

1290
01:00:54,230 --> 01:01:00,710
little bit more you brought up some

1291
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:01,940
a comment about organic farming and how

1292
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:05,659
it can be done

1293
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:07,130
legitimately versus I guess when you

1294
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:08,569
know you're just slapping on the organic

1295
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,550
label but it doesn't necessarily mean

1296
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:12,289
you're doing true organic practices and

1297
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:19,610
I was wondering if you could speak a

1298
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:21,829
little bit to that yes yeah I mean what

1299
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:23,329
we believe is that you know just because

1300
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:25,759
it has an armory label on it or just

1301
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:27,829
because it has a USDA Organic

1302
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,500
certification it doesn't mean that it's

1303
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:32,569
truly organic unfortunately you know

1304
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,969
there's a big misnomer in this industry

1305
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:37,550
as a whole especially about what armoury

1306
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:39,980
is Omri is a review board it's a

1307
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:42,380
materials review board which means that

1308
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,300
they can take a bag of alfalfa and they

1309
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:46,369
can say yeah we're going to put an

1310
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,490
armoury stamp on this because this bag

1311
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:53,239
of alfalfa can be used in the production

1312
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:55,849
for organic use or it can be used for

1313
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:57,919
organic use production it doesn't mean

1314
01:01:55,849 --> 01:02:00,079
that Army's gone all the way down the

1315
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,030
list to find out exactly what farm that

1316
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,279
that particular bag of alfalfa came from

1317
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:06,440
to find out that it's organic and even

1318
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,320
actually find out if it's even non-gmo

1319
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,900
so it's really important for people to

1320
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,910
you know if they're going to be know

1321
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:16,490
your farmers you know if you're going to

1322
01:02:13,909 --> 01:02:18,379
vital garden supply then ask the guys

1323
01:02:16,489 --> 01:02:20,179
there they've probably gone all the way

1324
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:23,890
down the list you know exactly where a

1325
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:25,639
lot of those nutrients or additions or

1326
01:02:23,889 --> 01:02:28,489
microbiology that you're putting in your

1327
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:30,109
soils or your teas or your brews you

1328
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:32,119
know you've really got to find out where

1329
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:34,760
it's coming from because a certification

1330
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:39,170
isn't going to give you that full proof

1331
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:41,510
and like Alex said from SC labs Alec

1332
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:43,970
Alec the more that we get into testing

1333
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:46,100
the more we're gonna find things like

1334
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:49,519
glyphosate and different things that

1335
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:52,759
come through to contaminate our flowers

1336
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,619
so it becomes increasingly important to

1337
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:58,070
know exactly what you're putting into

1338
01:02:54,619 --> 01:03:00,710
your your farms into your teas and into

1339
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:03,860
your soils because we know that our

1340
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:06,050
plants are intelligent thinking feeling

1341
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:08,360
beings with roots that go in and

1342
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:10,370
intelligently find nutrients and

1343
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,680
transform it into medicine

1344
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:14,839
and when it's doing that it needs to be

1345
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:17,419
from a pure standpoint that's why we've

1346
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:20,440
chosen to do a pure certification type

1347
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:23,930
thing which is you know utilizing

1348
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:26,119
testing and toxicity levels with what

1349
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:27,739
you're inputting into your Gardens to

1350
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:29,659
know that you're getting things as pure

1351
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:31,279
as possible in a contaminated world I

1352
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:33,319
mean we realize nothing's perfect but

1353
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,330
you know that's we're trying to go the

1354
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,930
extra mile to not just take an army

1355
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:42,259
certification as the be-all end-all of

1356
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:45,859
of purity and and encouraging people to

1357
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:47,450
really you know grow their own nutrients

1358
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,519
the idea if you really want to know

1359
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:51,739
exactly where your nutrients are coming

1360
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:53,420
from and you really want to know you

1361
01:03:51,739 --> 01:03:55,669
know what it is then if you're keeping

1362
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:57,680
your farm as much closed-loop as you

1363
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,269
possibly can then you know exactly where

1364
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:01,219
they're coming from and you know exactly

1365
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:03,170
what your inputs are and exactly what's

1366
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:05,119
going into your soil you recognize how

1367
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:07,460
easy it is to get contaminated by your

1368
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,500
neighbour which other large farms often

1369
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,090
get contaminated by their neighbors and

1370
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,039
that's an overspray issue or a

1371
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:15,500
groundwater issue and there's a lot to

1372
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,739
that but did you solicit break1 yeah I

1373
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:21,380
was just reiterating what you guys said

1374
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:23,089
about you know you got there's more than

1375
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:25,160
what's just in the label but there's

1376
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:26,600
also where the sources come from and

1377
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:28,519
that is something that we really take

1378
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:31,309
into consideration and make sure that

1379
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:33,050
you know we have accountability with all

1380
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:36,139
the raw materials that go into all of

1381
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:39,260
our products and it's true like the word

1382
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:41,179
compost alone like give on the word

1383
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,680
compost most people think it's organic

1384
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:44,599
but there's so much compost out that

1385
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:46,669
it's full of glyphosate and other

1386
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:48,849
terrible things that are definitely not

1387
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:51,280
going to help your plants or anything

1388
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:53,469
help the environment or any of that so

1389
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,940
accountability is really important and

1390
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:58,789
this closed loop system that you guys

1391
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,829
are always like huge on you know

1392
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:03,920
developing and introducing people to is

1393
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:05,409
also a great thing and I always like

1394
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,000
applaud people who go in that direction

1395
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:10,909
but what we do is we source products

1396
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,389
based on cleanliness to help introduce

1397
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:16,489
them to organics and or provide them

1398
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:19,159
when it's on a scale that they can't

1399
01:05:16,489 --> 01:05:22,219
necessarily produce in their backyard so

1400
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:24,058
the combination or they only the

1401
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:26,399
combination of what you guys do and

1402
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:30,359
we do I think is really helping propel

1403
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,789
people make that switch because as you

1404
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:35,578
know a lot of our customers both ours

1405
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:37,469
and dragonflies have come from a

1406
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:40,579
background of learning about three part

1407
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:43,679
systems and synthetic nutrients and

1408
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:46,528
sprays that take killing everything and

1409
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,288
so on and so forth and now they are

1410
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:52,170
changing in mindset and it's it's really

1411
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:54,869
good to see like a lot a lot of even I'm

1412
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:57,509
seeing huge commercial farms looking

1413
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:59,338
looking for organic certification and I

1414
01:05:57,509 --> 01:06:01,409
know the word certification scares some

1415
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:03,509
people but it is a step in the right

1416
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:07,618
direction and you're just showing a sign

1417
01:06:03,509 --> 01:06:09,630
of like consciousness and to me that's a

1418
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:12,539
step in the right direction because know

1419
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:14,670
it's not a perfect world and if I see

1420
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:17,130
some large cannabis farm like going the

1421
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:20,579
extra mile and trying to get enviro cans

1422
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:23,028
certified or clean green or even CDFA

1423
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:25,528
that's California Department of Ag

1424
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:27,838
certification that to me just shows

1425
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:30,239
they're at least make an effort and in

1426
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:35,130
this imperfect world effort goes a long

1427
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:37,139
way with me for sure intention goes a

1428
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,059
long way and we're finding a lot of

1429
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:42,239
people are moving back to the land you

1430
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:44,130
know in this time of expansion of

1431
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:47,400
cannabis gardens and a lot of people

1432
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:49,920
come to us that really want to create

1433
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:54,139
systems that are more like an ecosystem

1434
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,729
garden rather than just a monoculture

1435
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:58,528
crop Carden you know there's gonna be

1436
01:06:56,728 --> 01:07:00,568
all things happening we know that

1437
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:04,079
there's gonna be Central Valley

1438
01:07:00,568 --> 01:07:07,798
California crazy blowout farms to a real

1439
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,509
so really it's no different than really

1440
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:11,099
food I mean you can just look at food

1441
01:07:09,509 --> 01:07:13,489
and take that as an example or anything

1442
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:16,469
else you know it's gonna be about being

1443
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:19,438
having a story being different telling

1444
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:21,150
people how you're affecting the world

1445
01:07:19,438 --> 01:07:25,018
and the earth and there's a huge

1446
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:26,939
response from consumers to find farms

1447
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:29,098
that are growing ecologic Lee sound

1448
01:07:26,938 --> 01:07:30,868
absolutely and then it's a huge

1449
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:32,699
revelation to find out that a lot of

1450
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:35,039
times those cannabinoid ratings are

1451
01:07:32,699 --> 01:07:35,990
higher and we know farms that have been

1452
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,530
on

1453
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:41,118
ethic regimens or even organic one

1454
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:44,000
traditional organic even traditional

1455
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,610
organic farms and then started using

1456
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,800
more ferments and started using more

1457
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:51,019
plant compost teas medicines more

1458
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:54,080
compost teas I started realizing wow and

1459
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:54,860
I built up my my microbiology and my

1460
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,809
soil

1461
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,730
I got higher cannabinoid ratings on

1462
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:00,980
clones that I've been growing for 15

1463
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:03,860
years why do I have we're talking three

1464
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:06,139
percent higher four percent higher up to

1465
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,599
seven you know it's it's it's it's a

1466
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:10,879
it's higher standing and it's because of

1467
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:12,650
the plant vitality and its ability to

1468
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,079
produce more so we're trying to move

1469
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:17,659
more and more away from you know the

1470
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:20,930
term NPK and moving more and to just

1471
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:22,519
broad spectrum you know it you can't

1472
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,880
even put it there's not enough room on

1473
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:28,250
the page for for that for those minerals

1474
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,710
and nutrients over the molar we put more

1475
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:32,600
of that in there the more at the plants

1476
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:35,149
responding by providing better medicine

1477
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:39,980
more cannabinoids higher than a bronze I

1478
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:44,420
do firmly believe in biodynamic organic

1479
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:47,479
gardening I was first exposed and

1480
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:52,180
trained by the Alan Chadwick farm at

1481
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:56,449
UCSC back in 1973 and I've grown

1482
01:08:52,180 --> 01:09:01,579
organically biodynamically since that

1483
01:08:56,449 --> 01:09:04,699
time for more than 40 years now and I

1484
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:07,609
also know that it's not just believe

1485
01:09:04,699 --> 01:09:11,000
that I know that more and better and

1486
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:13,069
finer roots make healthier plants with

1487
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,390
more terpenes with higher percentages

1488
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:23,029
and also it can increase cannabinoids a

1489
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:27,829
bit I've only used IPM with predators

1490
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:29,710
for more than 40 years I mean III agree

1491
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:35,318
with really a lot of what you're saying

1492
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:35,319
so at least we can agree on something

1493
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:46,338
well it's just that the other

1494
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:49,220
cannabinoids if you have a medical

1495
01:09:46,338 --> 01:09:52,430
reason for them pay more power to you

1496
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:56,030
I mean I was the one who created the

1497
01:09:52,430 --> 01:10:00,470
program to create varieties in extremely

1498
01:09:56,029 --> 01:10:02,630
like CBG and that has 10% in a plant

1499
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,570
with hardly any other collaborate and

1500
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:08,569
these were research tools I'm not saying

1501
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:11,359
that's the plant that somebody wants but

1502
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:13,789
you got to remember that when I started

1503
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:16,429
in this game 30 years ago with medical

1504
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:19,699
cannabis there was no source of these

1505
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:23,539
compounds you could not buy CBG you

1506
01:10:19,699 --> 01:10:26,630
could not buy THC B so I created plants

1507
01:10:23,539 --> 01:10:30,250
the natural way with classical breeding

1508
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:33,500
that had them at very very large amounts

1509
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:35,539
which is phenomenal Fino nominal

1510
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:37,189
phenomenal we love that about you

1511
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:39,019
yeah which is which is what we're really

1512
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:40,849
interested in as well you know a lot of

1513
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,920
people talk about isolates and isolates

1514
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:45,410
then goes into the pharmaceutical and

1515
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,720
scientific world but our roots are in

1516
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:49,729
herbalism our roots are in the soil our

1517
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:52,159
roots are in the dirt we're really much

1518
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:54,889
more interested in the plant as a whole

1519
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:57,380
plant medicine all of the different

1520
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:59,000
concentrates that we make were utilizing

1521
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,460
the entire plant we're utilizing the

1522
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,100
roots the leaves the stalks the flowers

1523
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:06,829
all of it to come up with the whole

1524
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:09,140
medicine because I believe that you know

1525
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:11,809
as an herbalist that the whole plant is

1526
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:14,630
offering everything and we believe in

1527
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:16,340
using polymers and mushrooms along with

1528
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:18,529
our cannabis here which is you know just

1529
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:20,930
adding to the adaptogenic you know

1530
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:22,759
abilities to go into our body so our

1531
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:25,550
body can make the right decision I mean

1532
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,260
you know when you can't your body heals

1533
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,850
you the best you know chemotherapy

1534
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,800
doesn't necessarily kill cancer it's

1535
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:33,440
your body that you know really kills it

1536
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,779
it chemo kills everything but uh when it

1537
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,849
comes to you know just having the

1538
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:39,979
ability to have more compounds more

1539
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:42,289
abilities to flush you know that's

1540
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:44,599
that's what we're we're doing and in

1541
01:11:42,289 --> 01:11:48,199
British Columbia it's frustrating as a

1542
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:50,960
farmer to not have laboratories to work

1543
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:53,899
with it's not like in California or

1544
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:56,600
Oregon or Colorado or Washington where

1545
01:11:53,899 --> 01:11:59,479
you can take a leaf and send it to a lab

1546
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:02,060
and and get the cannabinoid count out of

1547
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:02,779
you know a plant within four to six

1548
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,670
weeks

1549
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:07,189
or something you know in the early

1550
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:09,500
stages I there there there maybe around

1551
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:12,169
it's not common people don't use them

1552
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:15,109
you know as much here I'm British so so

1553
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:17,180
as farmers and as you know observational

1554
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:18,710
estas 27 years working with this

1555
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:22,460
cannabis plant we've had to use our

1556
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:24,109
intuition and then you know study those

1557
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:25,760
plants that we've been keeping around in

1558
01:12:24,109 --> 01:12:27,229
our genetics for that long and just

1559
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,489
being able to say hey I think that this

1560
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:30,739
is what's been going on and this is

1561
01:12:28,489 --> 01:12:33,079
what's been going and oddly enough we

1562
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:34,760
were right so there is something to

1563
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:36,350
intuition there is something to

1564
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:39,050
observation there is something to

1565
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:41,690
farming and then also you know adding

1566
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:44,119
science as one of the spectrums when you

1567
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:47,419
have a full spectrum science is just one

1568
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:50,359
of the spectrums so you guys can get do

1569
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:52,819
analysis know if you have an MMA R or a

1570
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:55,069
CMP are licensing a Canada my husband

1571
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:58,699
has well he had a former MMA are now he

1572
01:12:55,069 --> 01:13:00,829
has this ACN PR and you can send I think

1573
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:04,789
it changed in the last year patients can

1574
01:13:00,829 --> 01:13:07,970
legally send their materials to have

1575
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:12,109
them tested and I know a nambia John

1576
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:14,119
pages group at ABC they do still Vietnam

1577
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:17,289
you know it they'll do terpene analysis

1578
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:20,300
I mean it does get pricey but especially

1579
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:22,729
yeah yeah we've totally new it awesome

1580
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:24,289
and yeah and we have used them we have

1581
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:26,479
used them but it's really different than

1582
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:30,409
getting the analysis from say steep hill

1583
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:33,139
or SC labs you know we we've been able

1584
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:35,300
to just get more information from them

1585
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:36,800
but UBC has been helpful to us and they

1586
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:40,010
have been really great yeah we have a

1587
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,930
19% CBD plan out of our greenhouse two

1588
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:43,190
years ago and we and we had it tested

1589
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:47,329
and we thought that it would probably

1590
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:49,219
was yeah I would like to say something

1591
01:13:47,329 --> 01:13:52,399
about the conversation welcome everybody

1592
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:54,530
bubbleman here for another few minutes I

1593
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:57,649
also have had these conversations with

1594
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:59,779
steep hill with SC labs with chimera I

1595
01:13:57,649 --> 01:14:01,429
feel that we really I'm not trying to

1596
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:03,079
[ __ ] on the labs that we do have but we

1597
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:05,600
really need this sort of cannabis

1598
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:08,630
focused lab here in British Columbia an

1599
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,880
SC type experience I've talked to those

1600
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:12,380
guys it's definitely been a conversation

1601
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,090
of trying to sort of like it would be a

1602
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,739
chimera obviously would be an amazing

1603
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:16,190
person to be involved he's got a lot of

1604
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:18,469
an all

1605
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:20,569
and he knows a lot of the right people

1606
01:14:18,469 --> 01:14:22,069
hopefully it'll be a dialogue that

1607
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:23,630
continues and we can get that because I

1608
01:14:22,069 --> 01:14:26,000
feel your guys is pain and I forgot

1609
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:29,739
completely that you guys are in British

1610
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,738
Columbia you guys are in the coots right

1611
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:38,779
is it the Kootenai so I can't hear you

1612
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:41,960
guys you're muted you won yeah we're

1613
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:43,369
from the coders from the Kootenays

1614
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,770
awesome while I love to see the

1615
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:47,329
Kootenays representing all my brothers

1616
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:51,770
and sisters from the Kootenays from

1617
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:53,000
caslo to Nelson and we miss miss I miss

1618
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,860
the coots when I'm not there and I'll

1619
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,869
definitely make a point the next time I

1620
01:14:54,859 --> 01:14:59,210
come to the coots to look you guys up

it's a little quiet though you can still

1629
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:27,260
up it a little but yeah we can hear you

1630
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,960
better as soon as I put these earbuds on

1631
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:32,320
that have a mic in it it my computer

1632
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,090
then once I disconnect the earbuds I

1633
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:37,488
can't you know can't figure it out so

1634
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:41,029
that it basically meets me so yeah I'll

1635
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:42,979
keep them on yeah I loved what you guys

1636
01:15:41,029 --> 01:15:44,899
were saying about the whole plant

1637
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:46,819
medicine and using you know the the

1638
01:15:44,899 --> 01:15:48,079
roots and the whole plants I'm sure the

1639
01:15:46,819 --> 01:15:49,279
try terpenoids that are in the roots

1640
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,819
you're accessing and all these different

1641
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:51,889
things

1642
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:53,689
cannabis is an amazing plant and the

1643
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:55,969
beautiful thing of Genesis that I've

1644
01:15:53,689 --> 01:15:58,969
really finally learned at 44 years of

1645
01:15:55,969 --> 01:16:00,649
age is that you know when I first got

1646
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:02,659
into it and I got into water hash I was

1647
01:16:00,649 --> 01:16:04,519
water pass water crashes it's gotta be

1648
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:06,590
it's gotta be this it's gotta be and as

1649
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,870
I slowly learned certain things of

1650
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:11,480
cannabis and I think it was herb when

1651
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:13,309
herb came on and talked about his shitty

1652
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:18,319
Mississippi bunk weed that we were all

1653
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:21,230
like oh look felt like we knew and he

1654
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:23,149
just said guys it works for me so

1655
01:16:21,229 --> 01:16:27,059
whatever the medicine that we prefer

1656
01:16:23,149 --> 01:16:30,329
remember to never fight against

1657
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:32,130
other options human medicine or whatever

1658
01:16:30,329 --> 01:16:34,319
it is because there's so many people in

1659
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:36,960
this industry in this community that can

1660
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:38,579
use all of these different sort of one

1661
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,159
of the new things I say is I don't ever

1662
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:43,229
fight against anything we already have

1663
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:44,849
I just want on a fight for more I don't

1664
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:46,589
fight against access I don't fight

1665
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,539
against LPS or I don't fight against

1666
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:49,980
dispensaries because they exist then we

1667
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:51,479
already have access points there why

1668
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:53,489
would I fight against those things if I

1669
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:55,409
want something more I can go out and

1670
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:57,630
focus on that and create that and I

1671
01:16:55,409 --> 01:17:01,260
think a lot of people get that lost then

1672
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:03,690
sort of well I want dispensaries so I'll

1673
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:05,760
do that as fight lp's with every inch of

1674
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:13,919
my that's not really cool my mom gets

1675
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:15,750
herb orders it Freder or something it's

1676
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,850
like people like oh no not tweet I'm

1677
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:20,399
like listen just because you don't like

1678
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:23,460
it it it's still an access point and at

1679
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:27,799
this one thing we can all agree on is

1680
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:27,800
that we need more access points not less

1681
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:33,000
that's my two cents I love that and I

1682
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:36,599
want to just give you a lot of respect

1683
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,310
for upholding ice water and full plant

1684
01:17:36,599 --> 01:17:41,369
medicine over all the years you've been

1685
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:44,090
a big huge proponent of that and that's

1686
01:17:41,368 --> 01:17:46,948
a really big deal as you know as the

1687
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:49,110
industry wants to jump into BHO and all

1688
01:17:46,948 --> 01:17:51,598
these crazy oil extractions and nice

1689
01:17:49,109 --> 01:17:54,328
little farms going into it and stuff and

1690
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:56,369
here's BC bubbleman you know doing all

1691
01:17:54,328 --> 01:17:58,889
the the plant medicine you know whole

1692
01:17:56,368 --> 01:18:00,779
plant extracts so big love to that we

1693
01:17:58,889 --> 01:18:01,199
appreciate got a nice you know what our

1694
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:03,359
nice

1695
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:05,460
people would always be like my kind of

1696
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,319
like my one big thing that I would say

1697
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,939
they'd be like well I like this and I'm

1698
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:11,969
like well it's cool that I'm like but

1699
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:15,059
would you drink it exactly

1700
01:18:11,969 --> 01:18:17,429
Oh life on Earth sure water does last

1701
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,869
time I checked and that's kind of a new

1702
01:18:17,429 --> 01:18:20,670
thing that's one it was one of my

1703
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:23,158
focuses of course water hash is

1704
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:25,349
wonderful but at this point in time you

1705
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:27,149
know it was a car conversation that I

1706
01:18:25,349 --> 01:18:28,560
had with Addison de Moura from steep

1707
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:30,118
hill a while ago and he just you know

1708
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,380
it's Izzie I know you don't like the dho

1709
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:32,969
and I know it's a chemical and it's this

1710
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,730
that and the other thing to use like man

1711
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:37,948
I've seen getting this help hey dude

1712
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:39,479
it's why I've sort of stopped my energy

1713
01:18:37,948 --> 01:18:41,638
if I'm not trying to fight against

1714
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:44,519
anything that already exists I would

1715
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:46,500
love for it to be cleaner and safer and

1716
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,630
better but I'll - I'll focus on my

1717
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,670
solvent less quiver my dry sip my wet

1718
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:53,550
wash and the rosin and that along with

1719
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:54,929
terpene extract since that's that'll be

1720
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,550
our little piece of pie that we can

1721
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:58,260
contribute and there's all these

1722
01:18:56,550 --> 01:19:00,300
wonderful other pieces of the pie when

1723
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,860
it comes to cannabis hemp is not just a

1724
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,199
plant that produces 50 thousand

1725
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:06,809
commercial products cannabis is a plant

1726
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:08,939
that produces you know an infinite

1727
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:11,400
amount of medicines and with 180

1728
01:19:08,939 --> 01:19:15,269
terpenes or 140 that have been

1729
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:17,519
categorized and 40 that have not plus 85

1730
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:23,010
plus cannabinoids I think we can all

1731
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:24,570
agree that we have a long way to go okay

1732
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:27,000
I wanted to mention something mark

1733
01:19:24,569 --> 01:19:29,130
you know it's interesting you think you

1734
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,560
don't really need a lab what you need is

1735
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:33,569
an HPLC you know and I guess you don't

1736
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,940
need these days are really a degree in

1737
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:38,880
chemistry to understand how to use these

1738
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:42,939
they're pretty hands-on and pretty easy

1739
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:45,219
to use and once you have an HPLC

1740
01:19:42,939 --> 01:19:49,479
and I don't know how many samples you

1741
01:19:45,219 --> 01:19:51,640
have to send to lab before you realize

1742
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:55,599
that hey I could have spent all this

1743
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:58,329
money rather than a testing lab with my

1744
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:01,930
own brand new equipment to measure these

1745
01:19:58,329 --> 01:20:04,809
numbers myself and know what the plant

1746
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:08,920
looks like myself and yeah yeah HPLC is

1747
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:12,100
probably cost anywhere between 35,000

1748
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:14,770
used to maybe 40,000 but you know if

1749
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:18,130
you're testing costs are in the same

1750
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:21,400
regime you may want to consider rather

1751
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:23,890
than oh you could still submit two to

1752
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:27,639
third party outside labs but it's really

1753
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:30,280
great to have the instrumentation

1754
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:34,300
in-house so you can get your own numbers

1755
01:20:30,279 --> 01:20:36,519
I love the idea of actually you know

1756
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:38,110
starting a lab like investing in a lab

1757
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:40,239
getting together with chimera and some

1758
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:41,619
other people and maybe I invited SC labs

1759
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:43,209
I was like you guys have all this

1760
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:45,699
knowledge why don't you guys come up to

1761
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:48,430
Canada we'll get an SC labs going in

1762
01:20:45,699 --> 01:20:49,899
Vancouver he'll be up here we can get

1763
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:52,480
the investment we can buy the machines

1764
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:53,738
we can get some people some jobs and I

1765
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,629
just thought it was a good idea I

1766
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:59,919
started the conversation with steep hill

1767
01:20:55,630 --> 01:21:01,270
originally and then labs and have had

1768
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,840
the conversation a few times with

1769
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:06,700
chimera just it's something Vancouver

1770
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:08,529
desperately needs we have a big cannabis

1771
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:13,029
community and it's just for missing some

1772
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:14,859
really key components totally agree we

1773
01:21:13,029 --> 01:21:17,139
had the same conversations not with

1774
01:21:14,859 --> 01:21:20,170
crime era but with steep hill and Alec

1775
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:22,539
and and SC Lausanne we were just talking

1776
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:25,180
about how British Columbia over the

1777
01:21:22,539 --> 01:21:27,519
years has done so much genetic breeding

1778
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:30,070
and so many good things it would just be

1779
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,870
really nice to have that backing to just

1780
01:21:30,069 --> 01:21:32,289
even with tissue culture you know what I

1781
01:21:31,869 --> 01:21:34,630
mean

1782
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:37,238
not not of tissue culture of cloning but

1783
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:39,789
of being able to test leaf at a young

1784
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:42,549
plant life age so that you can start 500

1785
01:21:39,789 --> 01:21:44,920
seeds and know within six weeks you know

1786
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:47,050
which ones to go forward with that's an

1787
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:50,460
amazing thing you know to prove to

1788
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:50,460
progress our movement forward

1789
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:57,399
so it's essential recipe we have this we

1790
01:21:55,539 --> 01:22:00,010
need this science background we wanted

1791
01:21:57,399 --> 01:22:01,629
it's um you know cultivars it just

1792
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:03,610
doesn't cut it anymore oh I got the Jack

1793
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:04,929
Frost I got the Jack Herer I got the

1794
01:22:03,609 --> 01:22:06,339
dista that it's like what are the

1795
01:22:04,929 --> 01:22:08,109
cannabinoid profiles and wonder the

1796
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:09,719
terpene profile it's like tell me what

1797
01:22:08,109 --> 01:22:12,399
the constituents are that make up that

1798
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:14,020
name because people throw in throw

1799
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:15,279
around names like it's going out and I

1800
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:17,110
can't tell you how many times in this

1801
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:18,750
business I've seen this one crack some

1802
01:22:17,109 --> 01:22:21,219
seeds what is that it smells like

1803
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:23,408
gorilla glue it's like I'm gonna call it

1804
01:22:21,219 --> 01:22:25,779
you know such and such it's just like

1805
01:22:23,408 --> 01:22:27,369
name a name this weird connection to

1806
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:29,759
like ego or they're like they want to

1807
01:22:27,369 --> 01:22:32,529
feel like they were a bleeder it's like

1808
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,570
you know just just let's let's go

1809
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:37,179
straightforward with me when I first met

1810
01:22:34,569 --> 01:22:39,908
skunk man Sam when I first met him god

1811
01:22:37,179 --> 01:22:42,819
it's been 20 plus years now he said to

1812
01:22:39,908 --> 01:22:44,888
me said you know when I see when I see

1813
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:46,840
herb get tested I think it was the GLC

1814
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:48,670
you can confirm or not Sam I can't

1815
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:51,310
remember if it was HPLC or what it was

1816
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:55,899
but he said he reckoned a particular

1817
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:57,489
spike when when skunk was in the hybrid

1818
01:22:55,899 --> 01:22:59,138
he would just be like yeah there's skunk

1819
01:22:57,488 --> 01:23:01,029
number ones in there there's that spike

1820
01:22:59,139 --> 01:23:06,550
I thought that was really cool you know

1821
01:23:01,029 --> 01:23:09,789
that was back in 97 or 99 or you know 17

1822
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:14,969
plus years ago so but that was using a

1823
01:23:09,789 --> 01:23:18,929
GC f ID for turkeys it works better than

1824
01:23:14,969 --> 01:23:23,350
HPLC for cannabinoids especially the

1825
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:27,219
acid forms you-you-you need HPLC but

1826
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:31,539
maybe a mess and what was fi D again I

1827
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:38,560
it's at the tip of my tongue detector

1828
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:40,300
well thank you what it does is as the

1829
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,610
stream of gas comes off the

1830
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:45,039
chromatographic column so think of a

1831
01:23:42,609 --> 01:23:47,589
column that's just like a distillation

1832
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,960
column and things are separated based on

1833
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:55,060
their differences in boiling points and

1834
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:57,130
so as those partition gases come through

1835
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:59,020
at that point they're sent through the

1836
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:02,170
flame ionization detector which

1837
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:03,429
basically just looks for any organic

1838
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,708
matter that's being

1839
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:07,658
earn and when organic matter is being

1840
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:09,639
burned in that stream the flame

1841
01:24:07,658 --> 01:24:11,799
ionization starts to receive a signal

1842
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:14,109
and so you just get an increase in the

1843
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:17,139
peak so it's just a way of detecting

1844
01:24:14,109 --> 01:24:20,109
some people use GCF ID that's that's

1845
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:23,739
pretty pretty common but other people

1846
01:24:20,109 --> 01:24:27,488
and I prefer something called GC mass

1847
01:24:23,738 --> 01:24:29,438
spec where your that effluent as it

1848
01:24:27,488 --> 01:24:32,228
comes off of the chromatographic column

1849
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:33,610
goes right into an electron impact mass

1850
01:24:32,229 --> 01:24:36,280
spectrometer which measures the

1851
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:37,929
molecular weight of the material that's

1852
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:41,408
coming off as its looting from the

1853
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:46,748
column mark what's the price difference

1854
01:24:41,408 --> 01:24:50,228
between GCMs and GCE hep ID yeah I can

1855
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:52,319
give you so that I'm not endorsing this

1856
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:54,969
system but I just recently for a client

1857
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:59,558
made a recommendation on purchasing the

1858
01:24:54,969 --> 01:25:04,599
shimasu system this was a the GC f ID

1859
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:06,159
and gc/ms with a headspace measurement

1860
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,349
so the headspace is an important

1861
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,839
measurement to be able to measure the

1862
01:25:08,349 --> 01:25:15,159
volatiles

1863
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:17,050
so that's good for terpene and also just

1864
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:19,958
to confirm that there's no residual

1865
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:23,679
solvents there so that that instrument

1866
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:26,859
itself costs a little over $100,000 I

1867
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:29,920
believe brand-new from shimasu that's

1868
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:32,469
their gc-ms with the headspace

1869
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,590
measurement the Cannabis analyzer which

1870
01:25:32,469 --> 01:25:38,078
is their HPLC instrument runs about

1871
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:41,349
sixty to sixty-five thousand dollars

1872
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:44,248
brand new but you can get a HPLC you

1873
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:47,920
know for probably neighborhood of 20 to

1874
01:25:44,248 --> 01:25:49,929
25,000 dollars used there's lots of

1875
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,719
pharmaceutical companies who redeploy

1876
01:25:49,929 --> 01:25:54,279
those things all the time so there's a

1877
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:57,578
considerable after market for slightly

1878
01:25:54,279 --> 01:26:00,188
used HPLC s that would be perfectly fine

1879
01:25:57,578 --> 01:26:02,828
but again just a plug out to you know

1880
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:05,199
the farmers who want to know that

1881
01:26:02,828 --> 01:26:07,748
information on their own even if they

1882
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:10,208
are mandated by regulations to

1883
01:26:07,748 --> 01:26:12,038
third-party testing it's always great to

1884
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:14,920
have third-party testing when you have

1885
01:26:12,038 --> 01:26:17,069
your own results to compare your

1886
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,949
third-party results to and so if you

1887
01:26:17,069 --> 01:26:21,868
some anomalous data point you at least

1888
01:26:19,948 --> 01:26:23,969
have a point of reference to go back to

1889
01:26:21,868 --> 01:26:25,948
the testing company and say hey you know

1890
01:26:23,969 --> 01:26:28,590
your results say this but our results

1891
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:30,658
done in this in such way calibrated on

1892
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:33,690
this instrument run by this trained

1893
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:36,479
person gives us these results and so I

1894
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:38,129
think it's just more enabling to the

1895
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:44,069
producer especially if you're making

1896
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:46,859
concentrates to have HPLC in-house to be

1897
01:26:44,069 --> 01:26:52,380
able to measure the cannabinoid potency

1898
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:55,368
at each step along the way of from

1899
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:57,900
extraction to the refinement of isolates

1900
01:26:55,368 --> 01:27:00,828
the crystallization there's no better

1901
01:26:57,899 --> 01:27:03,960
way to determine how pure your

1902
01:27:00,828 --> 01:27:08,549
cannabinoid acids are then to have an

1903
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:14,670
HPLC make that determination and I also

1904
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:18,029
say that or terpenes DCF ID or GCMs but

1905
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:19,980
that is the gold standard yeah

1906
01:27:18,029 --> 01:27:21,840
absolutely just because of the amounts

1907
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:23,309
of material there which is a lot less

1908
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,810
and what you're doing in the headspace

1909
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:26,940
measurement or what you're doing in the

1910
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:29,130
GC measurement is you are measuring the

1911
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:31,888
volatile that's coming off of the sample

1912
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:34,859
so yes you're measuring basically the

1913
01:27:31,889 --> 01:27:37,078
the vapor effluent that's coming off

1914
01:27:34,859 --> 01:27:39,179
with a sample that's just been you got

1915
01:27:37,078 --> 01:27:41,969
to remember that the GC injection port

1916
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:45,380
for a lot of these protocols are

1917
01:27:41,969 --> 01:27:48,270
anywhere between 200 to 250 degrees

1918
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:52,529
centigrade so it's certainly not nail

1919
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:56,909
temperature but injecting a cannabis

1920
01:27:52,529 --> 01:27:59,479
extract that's was perhaps extracted

1921
01:27:56,908 --> 01:28:03,149
under low temperature conditions and

1922
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:05,368
that one that's gonna change its terpene

1923
01:28:03,149 --> 01:28:08,488
content on heating up that's always been

1924
01:28:05,368 --> 01:28:10,289
my thing is that when you put a sample

1925
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:12,209
into the ejection port of your GC

1926
01:28:10,289 --> 01:28:13,618
there's invariably some chemistry that's

1927
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:15,689
going to happen with the most sensitive

1928
01:28:13,618 --> 01:28:17,670
terpenes that are in there at that

1929
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:19,169
temperature you can't avoid that from

1930
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:21,810
happening the other thing that that

1931
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:24,270
creates at the injection port is sort of

1932
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:26,369
like again like a nail surface if there

1933
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:29,460
are any heavies or residuals and your

1934
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:30,719
extracts it'll start to build up in your

1935
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,470
injection port so

1936
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:36,329
it's absolutely maintained one of the

1937
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:40,470
things that you must do to maintain your

1938
01:28:36,329 --> 01:28:42,210
GC is cleaning out that ejection port to

1939
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:44,880
make sure that there's no crap and you

1940
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:46,319
run blanks in between your replicates to

1941
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,449
make sure that you're not seeing any

1942
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:54,000
residual from the from the previous

1943
01:28:48,449 --> 01:28:56,159
injection when you shoot a blank you

1944
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,170
should get a blank response

1945
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:59,880
yeah and typically what we do like that

1946
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:02,970
a lot of these things Sam is will like

1947
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:05,489
to add an internal standard which we

1948
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:08,760
weigh out on an analytical very very

1949
01:29:05,489 --> 01:29:11,309
sensitive balance and when we add the

1950
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:15,210
analytical internal standard to the

1951
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:17,580
sample we know to the enth degree how

1952
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:20,159
much material is in there so we could

1953
01:29:17,579 --> 01:29:22,319
sort of correlate the amount of material

1954
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:25,979
to the peak height and so that gives us

1955
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:27,479
a way of measuring taking the internal

1956
01:29:25,979 --> 01:29:28,919
peak heights from your chromatogram

1957
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:30,779
which kind of looks like a heartbeat

1958
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:32,730
kind of thing there's peaks and valleys

1959
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:34,500
and [ __ ] like that and all those peaks

1960
01:29:32,729 --> 01:29:36,839
represent all different compounds and

1961
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,699
the issue again with chromatography is

1962
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,890
you have to assume that each peak is a

1963
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:43,500
single compound and there's not multiple

1964
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:44,730
peaks but sometimes there's shoulders

1965
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,380
and these Peaks aren't always

1966
01:29:44,729 --> 01:29:49,259
symmetrical so there's multiple things

1967
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:51,239
that can be in there and as with some of

1968
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:53,760
these terpenes when you heat them up

1969
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:56,599
they form multiple isomeric products

1970
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:59,960
which can resolve on the GC as

1971
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:03,260
individual Peaks so it's not

1972
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:07,649
extraordinary to see you know multiple

1973
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:10,260
more terpenes on heating them up than

1974
01:30:07,649 --> 01:30:13,649
were they would be at room temperature

1975
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:16,230
so I'm working with the group in Fort

1976
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:17,879
Collins Colorado called Discoverer 64

1977
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:20,639
associated with Colorado State

1978
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:23,940
University and we're using some very

1979
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:27,480
highly sensitive multi-dimensional NMR

1980
01:30:23,939 --> 01:30:30,509
techniques where we look at both proton

1981
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:34,169
and carbon signatures and what we can do

1982
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:37,050
is I used to say this was undressing the

1983
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:39,359
Mona Lisa so if the painting of the Mona

1984
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:40,590
Lisa is across the street from you you

1985
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:42,329
can look out your window and you could

1986
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:44,539
say ah yes it's painting of the Mona

1987
01:30:42,329 --> 01:30:47,809
Lisa right and so when we look

1988
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:49,970
at the at the NMR spectrum of a lot of

1989
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:52,310
cannabis extracts what we see mostly is

1990
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:56,180
THC a as we should I mean these are

1991
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:58,670
highly bred for for THC production and

1992
01:30:56,180 --> 01:31:00,920
like Sam we're growing these things get

1993
01:30:58,670 --> 01:31:03,470
high and when we've looked at things

1994
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:05,210
that are like the age a cut of the Sour

1995
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:08,390
Diesel and we've actually looked at also

1996
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:11,930
some of JJ's Nigerian haze it's a

1997
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:13,430
textbook spectrum for THC a but what we

1998
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:15,980
can do in NMR is we can basically

1999
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:19,220
undress the Mona Lisa take the Mona Lisa

2000
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:21,439
out of the painting so we could actually

2001
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:23,060
see the outfit she's wearing and

2002
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,859
everything else that's in the painting

2003
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:26,180
that you sort of take for granted when

2004
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:28,670
you look across the street and there's

2005
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:31,430
the Mona Lisa we know that these things

2006
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:34,550
produce THC a there's no question about

2007
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:36,710
it the factories producing THC a

2008
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:39,050
according to Sam and everything else is

2009
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:40,579
the star of the show there's a lot of

2010
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:44,090
other supporting actors in this movie

2011
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:47,479
you think it's like THC a is like if for

2012
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:49,550
the winning the Oscar for the best actor

2013
01:31:47,479 --> 01:31:51,169
that would be THC a right would be up

2014
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:53,390
for that role right and then there's a

2015
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:55,970
supporting actor which probably CBD we

2016
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:58,970
could say and you know other various you

2017
01:31:55,970 --> 01:32:02,329
know I forget that analogy but I mean so

2018
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:04,850
the point is again I think I wanted to

2019
01:32:02,329 --> 01:32:07,869
bring this back home to HPLC testing and

2020
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:10,579
the need to actually both look at the

2021
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:12,920
cannabinoid acid profile at room

2022
01:32:10,579 --> 01:32:15,039
temperature which you can't do by HPLC

2023
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:18,440
but we think we can do by

2024
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:21,519
multi-dimensional NMR and so we're sort

2025
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:24,919
of looking at this very sort of

2026
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:28,310
systematically to try to identify all

2027
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:30,829
the other components when we take th CA

2028
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:33,289
out of the picture right so now that we

2029
01:32:30,829 --> 01:32:35,539
no longer see th CA we see everything

2030
01:32:33,289 --> 01:32:37,970
else and the cool thing about the NMR is

2031
01:32:35,539 --> 01:32:39,949
you don't have to heat it up which is

2032
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:42,970
unlike the GCF ID which is as you heat

2033
01:32:39,949 --> 01:32:45,859
it up you have chemistry tomorrow and

2034
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:47,600
interrupts we only have 1% left we just

2035
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:48,949
wanted to say hi everyone I'm with Tony

2036
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,170
we're hiding in the bathroom because

2037
01:32:48,949 --> 01:32:51,800
it's air-conditioned only 40 degrees

2038
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:53,989
outside

2039
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,489
Celsius right now we just wanted to say

2040
01:32:53,989 --> 01:32:58,309
goodbye to everyone we're gonna go do

2041
01:32:55,489 --> 01:33:03,250
this doctor training and hopefully we'll

2042
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:03,250
see you guys in the near future pastures

2043
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:13,270
good luck with this Tony thanks for

2044
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:13,269
doing that work down there guys Thanks

2045
01:33:15,399 --> 01:33:21,939
yah mahn so anyway we're gonna try to

2046
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:24,050
hopefully develop a room temperature

2047
01:33:21,939 --> 01:33:26,599
technique where we can look at terpene

2048
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:29,659
profiles that don't have to go through

2049
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:31,550
an injection port at 200 and 250 degrees

2050
01:33:29,659 --> 01:33:32,720
so stay tuned for that I don't think

2051
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:34,880
that this is gonna be something that's

2052
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:37,100
going to be coming to a testing lab near

2053
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,440
you but I think what we can probably do

2054
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:42,350
is characterize this on a number of

2055
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:44,149
different examples and publish this and

2056
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:47,240
make sure that this is widely accessible

2057
01:33:44,149 --> 01:33:49,099
to everybody so you can see and if you

2058
01:33:47,239 --> 01:33:50,809
have an interest in doing this work you

2059
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:53,240
can go to your local University that's

2060
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:56,440
got one of these machines and and and

2061
01:33:53,239 --> 01:33:59,389
perhaps you know recreate this so anyway

2062
01:33:56,439 --> 01:34:01,339
whatever NMR the problem with an mr

2063
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:03,289
though is the sample cost prep is too

2064
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:06,739
expensive great it's a lot more

2065
01:34:03,289 --> 01:34:09,109
expensive than ung cuf well it's more

2066
01:34:06,739 --> 01:34:11,029
than just you know taking a sample that

2067
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:13,939
you get submitted and putting it into

2068
01:34:11,029 --> 01:34:16,009
your you know robotic arm which just

2069
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:17,629
basically takes a little you know squirt

2070
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:19,400
and shoots it into the injection port

2071
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:22,279
and that's it this is you have to

2072
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:24,889
basically sit down with a group of very

2073
01:34:22,279 --> 01:34:26,420
highly trained sophisticated people to

2074
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:28,789
understand that we're gonna run this

2075
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,930
process what are we gonna what are we

2076
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:32,689
looking for and what are we gonna get

2077
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:34,820
out of it because you can get the the

2078
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:38,059
NMR spectrum and it looks just like a a

2079
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:42,500
mess to a lot of people but I've been

2080
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:44,720
looking at these for Oh God how long has

2081
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:46,909
it been like 1982 I think when I first

2082
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:50,470
started looking at Amara so it's just

2083
01:34:46,909 --> 01:34:53,479
it's I've learned to basically see the

2084
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:55,280
the forest through the trees and not

2085
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:57,199
necessarily scared by looking at

2086
01:34:55,279 --> 01:35:01,939
mixtures of compounds and be able to

2087
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:03,590
deconvolution to their individual

2088
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:05,698
components because we know what the

2089
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:07,260
individual components look like

2090
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:09,569
with this type of with this type of

2091
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:10,619
measurement so yeah stay tuned Ryan I

2092
01:35:09,569 --> 01:35:14,269
mean it's not going to be something

2093
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:16,890
again it's coming that's going to be a

2094
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:20,400
standard routine test although I I do

2095
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:22,260
know of a couple labs now that service

2096
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:25,139
the California market that will run in

2097
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:27,570
an NMR for you and again why someone

2098
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:29,940
would would submit a sample for NMR

2099
01:35:27,569 --> 01:35:31,920
analysis is probably unknown but if

2100
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:35,069
you're making something like crystalline

2101
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,289
THC a it'd be really really good to make

2102
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:39,479
sure that the purity is what the purity

2103
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:44,760
is and when you when you do run it by

2104
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:46,979
proton NMR it's strikingly pure it's

2105
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:50,369
it's it's beautiful to look at it looks

2106
01:35:46,979 --> 01:35:52,169
like to me at least the Mona Lisa yeah

2107
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:53,640
well that's cool I mean I understand

2108
01:35:52,170 --> 01:35:56,369
where you're coming from the point but

2109
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:57,989
again I go back to the same thing for a

2110
01:35:56,369 --> 01:36:00,329
high-throughput lab where you're not

2111
01:35:57,988 --> 01:36:01,559
screening one sample you're screening

2112
01:36:00,329 --> 01:36:04,469
three like for me I'm screening

2113
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:06,390
populations right so I need to get the

2114
01:36:04,469 --> 01:36:09,329
cannabinoid data and the terpene data on

2115
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:10,860
like a thousand plants so it just it

2116
01:36:09,329 --> 01:36:15,630
doesn't make sense it's not economically

2117
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:18,259
viable to do that by NMR I yeah we

2118
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:23,520
should we should talk offline buddy

2119
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:25,020
go on you know how to find me the other

2120
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,210
thing I wanted to point out to you is I

2121
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:29,179
kind of I was try to log in so I kind of

2122
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:30,960
got a little bit of the conversation but

2123
01:36:29,179 --> 01:36:33,210
you know everybody's talking about

2124
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,948
there's no labs in in Vancouver well

2125
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:37,500
there are labs in Vancouver John page

2126
01:36:34,948 --> 01:36:39,599
has an and yet right they they've got a

2127
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:42,109
full full set up for all sorts of

2128
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:45,420
screening they do screening for the LPS

2129
01:36:42,109 --> 01:36:47,519
and they can now legally you know accept

2130
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:49,710
cannabis from patients which was the

2131
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:53,130
case about six months ago I was one of

2132
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:54,840
the things that was updated wagon-wheel

2133
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:56,640
was a company that tried to set up and

2134
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,010
do dispensary testing or testing through

2135
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:01,110
dispensaries and Health Canada lost

2136
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:02,460
their [ __ ] mind right they went they

2137
01:37:01,109 --> 01:37:05,219
tried to go after them they tried to

2138
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:08,939
really make their life hell so it's not

2139
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:10,859
it's not California it's not it's not

2140
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:13,229
Washington it's not Oregon like we don't

2141
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:15,479
have that written into the regulation

2142
01:37:13,229 --> 01:37:18,599
was the way that they are permitted down

2143
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:19,589
and dunk in California so it's it would

2144
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,810
be really tough for us

2145
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:24,659
labs just roll in the Canada and set up

2146
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:27,000
because I have been operating outside of

2147
01:37:24,658 --> 01:37:30,179
the set of regulations that exist I have

2148
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:33,868
a question if somebody buys their own GC

2149
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:36,380
or HPLC and does their own in-house

2150
01:37:33,868 --> 01:37:39,149
analysis is that legal

2151
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:40,889
kind of license you'd have to get again

2152
01:37:39,149 --> 01:37:44,009
you have to go and get standards and

2153
01:37:40,889 --> 01:37:45,929
it's not this is like pretty fancy

2154
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:50,969
equipment for home growers to be playing

2155
01:37:45,929 --> 01:37:52,529
with I agree yeah so and most people

2156
01:37:50,969 --> 01:37:54,118
don't have the skills I mean to be to

2157
01:37:52,529 --> 01:37:57,059
really have the skills to be able wait

2158
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:59,789
wait John Johnny B who's one of our

2159
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:02,550
regular panelist has got a GC over in

2160
01:37:59,789 --> 01:38:04,469
his thing mark get away hey listen no

2161
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:06,960
offense to Johnny B but his results are

2162
01:38:04,469 --> 01:38:09,929
like all but useless okay they're not

2163
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,730
that's not it's not science it's like

2164
01:38:09,929 --> 01:38:15,389
yes he gets Peaks coming off his

2165
01:38:11,729 --> 01:38:18,149
chromatograph but great that's my it's

2166
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:22,109
he's not doing terms he's not accurately

2167
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:24,929
quantifying anything so it's yeah

2168
01:38:22,109 --> 01:38:26,759
anybody could do that but again what's

2169
01:38:24,929 --> 01:38:28,800
the point of just having numbers on your

2170
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,289
own it's not about just having numbers

2171
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,849
it's about having accurate numbers right

2172
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:34,920
like that's the whole point of the lab

2173
01:38:32,849 --> 01:38:36,449
is to have an accurate medicine

2174
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,179
measurement of what's in the medicine

2175
01:38:36,448 --> 01:38:41,519
right and that's why I like we've seen a

2176
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:43,139
lot of press lately about these handheld

2177
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,730
scanners and we've talked about it on

2178
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:48,000
church before we don't need to go there

2179
01:38:44,729 --> 01:38:50,279
but certainly a order of magnitude less

2180
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,929
expensive than an HPLC would be like one

2181
01:38:50,279 --> 01:38:56,009
of these you know sort of near IR

2182
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:59,699
measurements that claim that they can do

2183
01:38:56,010 --> 01:39:02,789
cannabinoid and terpene profiles based

2184
01:38:59,698 --> 01:39:04,169
on just holding a sample up to one of

2185
01:39:02,789 --> 01:39:06,960
these things that you can buy in a

2186
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:09,929
Pelican case III think again yeah I mean

2187
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:13,500
if you're out in the bush and you're

2188
01:39:09,929 --> 01:39:15,179
like is this CBD is this THC again just

2189
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:17,460
to go back to I think what Joshua was

2190
01:39:15,179 --> 01:39:18,960
saying earlier which is that we go on

2191
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:21,149
our instincts because we know these

2192
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,829
plants and we have a connection with

2193
01:39:21,149 --> 01:39:26,309
them so it's like one of the things that

2194
01:39:22,829 --> 01:39:30,329
you just you you you sense but it's also

2195
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:32,660
great to have something like even as

2196
01:39:30,329 --> 01:39:34,760
crude as it is Johnny B's

2197
01:39:32,659 --> 01:39:36,139
you see he can do a quick injection and

2198
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:39,230
say hey you know what that's a THC

2199
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:40,970
variety not a CBD variety and just be

2200
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:43,250
able to make that kind of level

2201
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:45,560
determination is that quantitative no

2202
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:47,420
should a comma on a label no is that

2203
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:48,350
going to substitute for an analysis done

2204
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:52,940
it's steep hill

2205
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:54,800
no but it's giving a grower an extra set

2206
01:39:52,939 --> 01:39:56,569
of eyes to look at hey here's a tool

2207
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,730
that's maybe at second hand maybe I only

2208
01:39:56,569 --> 01:40:01,189
got it for whatever and it's pieced

2209
01:39:58,729 --> 01:40:03,439
together with a couple you know flanges

2210
01:40:01,189 --> 01:40:06,169
with duct tape or whatever and it's a

2211
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:09,079
maybe if you wanted a result but if you

2212
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:11,329
can get it you can get that same kind of

2213
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:14,659
qualitative information off of like $10

2214
01:40:11,329 --> 01:40:19,010
TLC plate right yeah no no yeah

2215
01:40:14,659 --> 01:40:19,369
absolutely yeah yep we use TLC 30 years

2216
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:22,699
ago

2217
01:40:19,369 --> 01:40:24,699
and if all you want to do is get a

2218
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:27,920
finger to breathe in the right direction

2219
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:30,949
TLC works fine but for quantitative it's

2220
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:33,430
not so fine well let's give props to

2221
01:40:30,949 --> 01:40:36,590
Kevin mckernon who's really taking this

2222
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:38,000
UPC our home thing and he's starting to

2223
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:39,829
add a whole bunch of assay as I was

2224
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,100
going back and forth with him over the

2225
01:40:39,829 --> 01:40:45,489
weekend and they were the - well test

2226
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:47,810
just a simple colored color metric test

2227
01:40:45,489 --> 01:40:51,579
they can identify it essentially they're

2228
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:51,580
doing away with TLC now right

2229
01:40:55,738 --> 01:41:01,268
hey she needed Ryan

2230
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:06,909
oh yeah accidently sorry the muting

2231
01:41:01,269 --> 01:41:10,360
please and now I can't unmute him sorry

2232
01:41:06,908 --> 01:41:18,488
Ryan I don't know what I did there sorry

2233
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:22,029
Ryan you're right so for tip for a 10

2234
01:41:18,488 --> 01:41:24,669
for a $3 prep you can get like 10 essays

2235
01:41:22,029 --> 01:41:26,800
out of that so for 3 out of 3 of the

2236
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:29,349
wells you can get the sex of the plant

2237
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:32,110
and whether what the chemo type is out

2238
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:34,210
of three wells so out of three of 10 you

2239
01:41:32,109 --> 01:41:37,049
know wells when you're prep so that's a

2240
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:40,210
lot of information to get for 3 bucks

2241
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:42,969
right and it's definitely PLC it takes

2242
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:44,980
less time and TLC yeah I mean to me it's

2243
01:41:42,969 --> 01:41:47,260
like a P a P H paper I mean you know I

2244
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:51,868
remember when we used to have have like

2245
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:56,079
red and a blue litmus paper now I have a

2246
01:41:51,868 --> 01:41:58,569
little pH strips that tell me any range

2247
01:41:56,078 --> 01:42:00,698
of pH no matter of whether I'm acidic or

2248
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:03,279
basic so yeah these are just constant

2249
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:06,158
innovations that help people figure out

2250
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:09,460
what's going on that's totally cool yet

2251
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:18,388
pops off the Kevin sure that Kevin was

2252
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:18,389
gonna join us maybe Natasha

2253
01:42:18,809 --> 01:42:23,829
yeah okay there was some issues with the

2254
01:42:21,998 --> 01:42:26,979
link some people were having problems if

2255
01:42:23,828 --> 01:42:29,049
he you see anyone here he's a family guy

2256
01:42:26,979 --> 01:42:32,288

for the invite and I have to say the

2290
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:02,408
conversation has been so fascinating so

2291
01:44:00,248 --> 01:44:05,438
far on all fronts my mind is just

2292
01:44:02,408 --> 01:44:08,469
absolutely blown so if I just go silent

2293
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:08,800
and just absorb this round please excuse

2294
01:44:08,469 --> 01:44:11,349
me

2295
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:14,439
and I also just wanted to mention Kelly

2296
01:44:11,349 --> 01:44:16,590
just kudos for you and catching babies I

2297
01:44:14,439 --> 01:44:20,320
appreciate that work that you're doing

2298
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:23,199
yes thank you and everybody else of

2299
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:25,208
course but it was just a little a little

2300
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,879
piece of the conversation that was just

2301
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:32,109
touched on and glossed over but people

2302
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:36,668
understand how I believe birthing is

2303
01:44:32,109 --> 01:44:38,198
such a huge a huge thing and the fact

2304
01:44:36,668 --> 01:44:41,408
that you're there facilitating women and

2305
01:44:38,198 --> 01:44:43,089
empowering them to reclaim their power

2306
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:44,768
and their birthing and being there to

2307
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:45,429
really mirror that strength I think is

2308
01:44:44,769 --> 01:44:47,849
really beautiful

2309
01:44:45,429 --> 01:44:50,979
and I love what you're doing both of you

2310
01:44:47,849 --> 01:44:53,529
really thank you yeah thanks so much we

2311
01:44:50,979 --> 01:44:56,739
definitely take the birthing as

2312
01:44:53,529 --> 01:44:58,658
seriously as the first seed so see it

2313
01:44:56,738 --> 01:45:00,788
the same way you know that first breath

2314
01:44:58,658 --> 01:45:03,728
is just important as that first sprout

2315
01:45:00,788 --> 01:45:06,458
in the health of a whole entire lifetime

2316
01:45:03,729 --> 01:45:08,159
so it's amazing using birth water to

2317
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:12,939
sprout your first

2318
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:12,939
[Laughter]

2319
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:18,010
that's interesting so tell us more about

2320
01:45:16,029 --> 01:45:19,689
that so what is it just because it's a

2321
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:22,300
nutrient-rich medium and so you're

2322
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:24,909
finding the seeds sprout faster or

2323
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:26,590
what's the advantage to doing that oh I

2324
01:45:24,909 --> 01:45:28,750
just think that you know if you're gonna

2325
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:30,460
empty a tub it's really nice to empty it

2326
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:32,979
in their flower garden or in their

2327
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:36,159
garden because that's just so much nicer

2328
01:45:32,979 --> 01:45:38,109
it's like sacred waters and it's looked

2329
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:40,180
at you know baby was born in that water

2330
01:45:38,109 --> 01:45:43,059
so why not put it in your flower garden

2331
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:46,360
so we actually do hose extensions to get

2332
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:48,330
it to the flower gardens even it's in

2333
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:50,739
the middle of winter

2334
01:45:48,329 --> 01:45:53,920
you guys are so dedicated that's

2335
01:45:50,739 --> 01:45:55,529
beautiful that's so beautiful people

2336
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,270
don't realize like there's a whole other

2337
01:45:55,529 --> 01:46:00,399
world to understanding birthing than you

2338
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:01,660
know the hospital and legs up in the

2339
01:46:00,399 --> 01:46:02,949
stirrups and the pushing and the

2340
01:46:01,659 --> 01:46:06,519
screaming in the pain it can be

2341
01:46:02,949 --> 01:46:08,679
something so beautiful and so sacred so

2342
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:12,340
I'm is similar to cannabis yeah same is

2343
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:16,770
room same as as well though yes I fully

2344
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:19,690
agree yeah I have magical otherworldly

2345
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:22,960
so tapped in multi-dimensional

2346
01:46:19,689 --> 01:46:26,529
experience yeah have you had any

2347
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:28,750
experiences in your just with what you

2348
01:46:26,529 --> 01:46:32,619
do with cannabis and facilitating

2349
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:35,050
birthing um well it definitely comes in

2350
01:46:32,619 --> 01:46:38,229
and out you know for me I think that the

2351
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:42,159
whole reason how we even got into where

2352
01:46:38,229 --> 01:46:44,229
I'm at now today is because of learning

2353
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:46,359
about health and human health and

2354
01:46:44,229 --> 01:46:48,069
women's health and then learning about

2355
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:49,689
small babies health because then that

2356
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,439
just has so much to do with the mother

2357
01:46:49,689 --> 01:46:52,449
as well

2358
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:56,169
you know they are one at that time and

2359
01:46:52,449 --> 01:46:59,139
then utilizing all of those herbs that

2360
01:46:56,170 --> 01:47:02,170
we used to grow an entire baby and what

2361
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:04,930
do those herbs do to grow a whole plant

2362
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:07,630
yeah so then I started to be able to see

2363
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:09,820
you know the ganja plant as a feminine

2364
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:13,359
plant because we normally choose all of

2365
01:47:09,819 --> 01:47:15,639
the females and then give those feminine

2366
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:17,049
herbs to the plant for growth and health

2367
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:20,050
and well-being there's just absolutely

2368
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:22,690
no difference to me you know even if we

2369
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:24,880
study it with science or we look at it

2370
01:47:22,689 --> 01:47:28,359
you know in all of the different realms

2371
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:30,670
of spirituality or practicality

2372
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:33,219
you know it's a very similar similar

2373
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:37,020
thing life is life and health is health

2374
01:47:33,219 --> 01:47:40,719
and you could you know need male

2375
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:43,239
hormonal herbs to your male plants which

2376
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:45,429
you know there's no we do not have a

2377
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:47,529
scientific paper to back that but it

2378
01:47:45,429 --> 01:47:52,118
makes all the sense in the world to use

2379
01:47:47,529 --> 01:47:55,259
metal roof for example tea on your mail

2380
01:47:52,118 --> 01:47:58,000
plants to just put more mail supporting

2381
01:47:55,260 --> 01:48:00,429
hormones and compounds into the soil

2382
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,689
which will feed the might accrues which

2383
01:48:00,429 --> 01:48:04,779
the microbes will feed the plant of

2384
01:48:01,689 --> 01:48:08,069
course so anyway it's full circle bed

2385
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:08,069
plus there's nettles all over the place

2386
01:48:09,329 --> 01:48:13,840
nature gives abundantly I find and and

2387
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:15,698
she knows how to compliment just so

2388
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:17,260
perfectly so we'll find these companion

2389
01:48:15,698 --> 01:48:20,589
plants just sprouting up naturally

2390
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:22,900
around I'm curious just specifically

2391
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:24,420
with the birthing process have you

2392
01:48:22,899 --> 01:48:27,519
worked with cannabis to help facilitate

2393
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:30,908
a shift in perception

2394
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:32,679
perhaps on behalf of the mother or the

2395
01:48:30,908 --> 01:48:34,750
people around has there been an

2396
01:48:32,679 --> 01:48:37,510
integrative portion of ceremony around

2397
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:40,539
that even post birth I'm just curious

2398
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:43,480
you have so much experience and wisdom

2399
01:48:40,539 --> 01:48:45,219
well it's definitely utilized just like

2400
01:48:43,479 --> 01:48:48,399
many of the other herbs you know I'd say

2401
01:48:45,219 --> 01:48:50,679
that there's like eight herbs I'm just

2402
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:52,299
making up that number that I utilize you

2403
01:48:50,679 --> 01:48:54,969
know from it during the birthing process

2404
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:58,750
and then maybe postmenopausal as well I

2405
01:48:54,969 --> 01:49:03,730
mean postpartum as well postmenopausal

2406
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:07,389
maybe that's where I'm at now no yeah I

2407
01:49:03,729 --> 01:49:10,000
close it's getting there feeling it but

2408
01:49:07,389 --> 01:49:12,909
yeah to be able to utilize the plant in

2409
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:16,179
birth itself this is fantastic you know

2410
01:49:12,908 --> 01:49:19,029
also women in breastfeeding and helping

2411
01:49:16,179 --> 01:49:21,750
them relax I feel like hops is utilized

2412
01:49:19,029 --> 01:49:23,920
you know and if hops isn't working

2413
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:26,469
immediately then we might go to a nice

2414
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:28,510
cannabis brewed he and it helps so much

2415
01:49:26,469 --> 01:49:31,239
for the mother's milk to come down she's

2416
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:33,940
relaxed she's maybe in a place that

2417
01:49:31,238 --> 01:49:38,289
feels good so now she's ready to nourish

2418
01:49:33,939 --> 01:49:40,419
her baby after you know an extreme you

2419
01:49:38,289 --> 01:49:42,189
know birthing process it hops is part of

2420
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:43,418
the same family as the can

2421
01:49:42,189 --> 01:49:46,179
to begin with yeah it's another

2422
01:49:43,418 --> 01:49:48,189
adaptogen working them together yeah

2423
01:49:46,179 --> 01:49:50,260
also you know during the birthing

2424
01:49:48,189 --> 01:49:54,249
process of the labor and everything is a

2425
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:56,800
lot about mine space and stuff and in

2426
01:49:54,248 --> 01:49:58,688
cannabis Hat can definitely be used to

2427
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,918
change the perspective absolutely

2428
01:49:58,689 --> 01:50:04,269
definitely happened and there's a lot of

2429
01:50:01,918 --> 01:50:05,969
different ritual that's gone into some

2430
01:50:04,269 --> 01:50:08,498
of the births that we've done it and

2431
01:50:05,969 --> 01:50:11,769
Kelly has done two for sure with other

2432
01:50:08,498 --> 01:50:14,050
plant medicine as well but yeah cannabis

2433
01:50:11,769 --> 01:50:16,570
is also part of the pregnancy tea

2434
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:18,610
because the pregnancy tea is a crucial

2435
01:50:16,569 --> 01:50:21,009
part of being pregnant is to be able to

2436
01:50:18,609 --> 01:50:22,929
drink herbs the whole entire time of

2437
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:24,820
pregnancy to build the uterus and the

2438
01:50:22,929 --> 01:50:26,800
the walls and all the muscles that

2439
01:50:24,819 --> 01:50:29,828
you're going to be utilizing to for the

2440
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:31,689
transformation so cannabis is part of

2441
01:50:29,828 --> 01:50:34,268
that along with medicinal mushrooms

2442
01:50:31,689 --> 01:50:39,099
along with fungi along with that magical

2443
01:50:34,269 --> 01:50:41,229
not magic but magical mushrooms yeah and

2444
01:50:39,099 --> 01:50:42,578
we really utilize all the adaptogenic

2445
01:50:41,229 --> 01:50:44,650
herbs and that's the reason why we even

2446
01:50:42,578 --> 01:50:46,899
got into cannabis it just makes sense

2447
01:50:44,649 --> 01:50:50,408
you know when you're somebody who has

2448
01:50:46,899 --> 01:50:52,598
deep respect for nature and the

2449
01:50:50,408 --> 01:50:54,668
medicinal and spiritual powers of these

2450
01:50:52,599 --> 01:50:56,498
amazing adaptogens that are here to

2451
01:50:54,668 --> 01:50:59,469
serve us and we're here to serve them

2452
01:50:56,498 --> 01:51:01,090
you know it's this beautiful symbiotic

2453
01:50:59,469 --> 01:51:03,698
love relationship that we have with

2454
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:05,918
these plants and when we bring them

2455
01:51:03,698 --> 01:51:08,379
together a full circle then we're able

2456
01:51:05,918 --> 01:51:10,859
to have you know a real healing process

2457
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:14,949
I have a great story just super-quick

2458
01:51:10,859 --> 01:51:16,719
that a mother you know was not releasing

2459
01:51:14,948 --> 01:51:18,188
her placenta after birth she's just

2460
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:21,069
holding on you know it was her third

2461
01:51:18,189 --> 01:51:23,619
baby she hadn't had any cannabis during

2462
01:51:21,069 --> 01:51:26,228
her whole pregnancy because of you know

2463
01:51:23,618 --> 01:51:28,328
whatever feelings that she had you know

2464
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:31,958
surrounding it this was back in the

2465
01:51:28,328 --> 01:51:33,639
early 90s and just was going on for a

2466
01:51:31,958 --> 01:51:35,288
really long time she wasn't internally

2467
01:51:33,639 --> 01:51:36,609
bleeding everything was fine but you

2468
01:51:35,288 --> 01:51:37,899
know we're starting to get a little bit

2469
01:51:36,609 --> 01:51:41,139
worried and if I I looked at her and I

2470
01:51:37,899 --> 01:51:45,098
said do you need a joint we need to just

2471
01:51:41,139 --> 01:51:47,260
have a toke here and yeah she took one

2472
01:51:45,099 --> 01:51:48,849
toke and the placenta was born and

2473
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:51,248
everybody could go on about their

2474
01:51:48,849 --> 01:51:53,708
business so what it did was it allowed

2475
01:51:51,248 --> 01:51:55,809
her to be in that place of normalcy that

2476
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:56,260
she is normally you know that she wasn't

2477
01:51:55,809 --> 01:51:59,079
during

2478
01:51:56,260 --> 01:52:01,480
the pregnancy and find that role yeah

2479
01:51:59,078 --> 01:52:03,219
acceptance and centering so that you

2480
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:06,009
know she could move on and accept this

2481
01:52:03,219 --> 01:52:08,529
birth that's interesting you're bringing

2482
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:11,619
up the concept of via cannabis being not

2483
01:52:08,529 --> 01:52:13,630
only used again we were having a

2484
01:52:11,618 --> 01:52:16,808
discussion previous about cannabis

2485
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:21,460
medical versus Rec but using it to

2486
01:52:16,809 --> 01:52:22,869
facilitate shifts in birth or and I

2487
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:27,158
wanted to bring it back to Selena

2488
01:52:22,868 --> 01:52:28,328
she's also started doing I don't know

2489
01:52:27,158 --> 01:52:30,308
what the proper word is but she

2490
01:52:28,328 --> 01:52:32,288
facilitates marriages and she's

2491
01:52:30,309 --> 01:52:35,309
incorporating cannabis in that ceremony

2492
01:52:32,288 --> 01:52:39,038
also and I thought that was a really

2493
01:52:35,309 --> 01:52:40,630
just beautiful thought of I know

2494
01:52:39,038 --> 01:52:43,090
personally my husband and I when we got

2495
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:45,969
married out in Dauphin Manitoba we even

2496
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:49,538
took pictures in the hemp fields that

2497
01:52:45,969 --> 01:52:51,639
were growing around our area and just

2498
01:52:49,538 --> 01:52:55,840
even standing there in the plants and

2499
01:52:51,639 --> 01:52:58,239
just even that was really was actually

2500
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,849
my favorite part of the way was normally

2501
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:03,339
a picture part is kind of not really our

2502
01:53:00,849 --> 01:53:05,288
thing but the way our photographer

2503
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:07,269
helped us calm and it just felt like a

2504
01:53:05,288 --> 01:53:11,139
really nice little intimate moment where

2505
01:53:07,269 --> 01:53:13,630
we could be alone and we were there kind

2506
01:53:11,139 --> 01:53:15,578
of hidden under these huge hemp plants

2507
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:19,029
and so even just the presence of the

2508
01:53:15,578 --> 01:53:20,649
plants yeah yeah Selina can you tell us

2509
01:53:19,029 --> 01:53:22,210
a little bit more about what do you what

2510
01:53:20,649 --> 01:53:23,738
are you doing these wedding ceremonies

2511
01:53:22,210 --> 01:53:25,448
and how do you incorporate cannabis or

2512
01:53:23,738 --> 01:53:27,368
how do you intend to do this oh there's

2513
01:53:25,448 --> 01:53:29,919
so many ways so okay we actually had our

2514
01:53:27,368 --> 01:53:34,529
first pilot yesterday which was really

2515
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:37,840
exciting for this wedding it was really

2516
01:53:34,529 --> 01:53:39,759
intimate small we ended up actually just

2517
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:40,900
doing the photos at the farm were just

2518
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:42,940
about to crop out which is really

2519
01:53:40,899 --> 01:53:44,710
exciting so everybody is just all the

2520
01:53:42,939 --> 01:53:47,618
girls are just totally perked and happy

2521
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:51,010
and vibrant and glowing and just like so

2522
01:53:47,618 --> 01:53:53,859
supercharged so for them they're pretty

2523
01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:58,360
spiritual and very grounded and their

2524
01:53:53,859 --> 01:54:00,839
love is I want to say pure but it's even

2525
01:53:58,359 --> 01:54:05,259
more than that it's just so sweet and

2526
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:07,328
for them it was it was a really unique

2527
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:09,270
experience we actually got to go and

2528
01:54:07,328 --> 01:54:12,000
meet the girls I walked them around

2529
01:54:09,270 --> 01:54:13,260
the greenhouse I introduced them to a

2530
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,869
few different cultivars that were

2531
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:17,699
growing there we smelled the different

2532
01:54:15,869 --> 01:54:20,880
terpenes and we had some fun just

2533
01:54:17,699 --> 01:54:23,010
talking about soil mediums and then what

2534
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,859
we did is we had a really fun photoshoot

2535
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:27,989
and for them it was really about

2536
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:30,029
connecting with the plants I think only

2537
01:54:27,989 --> 01:54:33,449
one person in the wedding party had ever

2538
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:35,550
been in a grow ever so it was a new

2539
01:54:33,449 --> 01:54:37,500
experience for everybody and we had some

2540
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:40,590
guests that were from Sweden so it was

2541
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:43,770
extra new and very taboo and very

2542
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:45,560
exciting the ways that we're hoping to

2543
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:47,490
incorporate this in the next year so

2544
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:50,430
officially we're not actually gonna be

2545
01:54:47,489 --> 01:54:51,899
launching until 2018 we are booking now

2546
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:54,090
we've already got a couple of spots that

2547
01:54:51,899 --> 01:54:56,879
are booked which is exciting and it

2548
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:58,409
really depends on it really depends on

2549
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,699
the bride and groom or the two people

2550
01:54:58,409 --> 01:55:01,500
that are getting married and their

2551
01:54:59,699 --> 01:55:03,149
comfort level some people want to

2552
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:05,670
participate with the cannabis by

2553
01:55:03,149 --> 01:55:08,009
ingesting or vaporizing or smoking which

2554
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:10,590
is great we're also mindful of people's

2555
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:13,680
tolerances and having a good time I'm

2556
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:15,690
also mindful that alcohol is usually

2557
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:17,940
President wedding so what we're planning

2558
01:55:15,689 --> 01:55:19,829
on doing is having like a precursory

2559
01:55:17,939 --> 01:55:21,419
education piece where we really get to

2560
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:24,510
know the couple and we really get to

2561
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:25,829
know what's exciting for them it could

2562
01:55:24,510 --> 01:55:27,980
be something as simple as having it

2563
01:55:25,829 --> 01:55:30,689
integrated into boutonnieres and

2564
01:55:27,979 --> 01:55:34,139
beautiful bouquets I love the idea of

2565
01:55:30,689 --> 01:55:36,929
actually having the the buds in the

2566
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:39,300
bouquet and you get to do like hang dry

2567
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:41,430
at the end and in a year instead of

2568
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:44,760
having your frozen wedding cake you get

2569
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:47,119
to partake in your beautiful bouquet

2570
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:50,730
which would be so fun I love that

2571
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:54,659
there's lots of different ways we how

2572
01:55:50,729 --> 01:55:56,279
about the obvious party favors for all

2573
01:55:54,659 --> 01:55:58,199
these people who come from all over

2574
01:55:56,279 --> 01:56:00,420
Kingdom Come just to come to your

2575
01:55:58,199 --> 01:56:03,359
wedding and especially celebrate

2576
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:05,369
European you're a total either this day

2577
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:07,019
that you've put together you want to

2578
01:56:05,369 --> 01:56:08,789
send them back with a little bit of

2579
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:11,640
nugget so it'd be great to have like you

2580
01:56:08,789 --> 01:56:13,439
know a little parting gift of something

2581
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:15,480
I guess we're thinking about taking that

2582
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:16,979
the next step further where as we

2583
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:19,409
interviewed a couple we're hoping to do

2584
01:56:16,979 --> 01:56:22,500
it a year prior so we can actually kind

2585
01:56:19,409 --> 01:56:22,769
of get a vibe on what their cultivar

2586
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,210
would

2587
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:25,740
and one of the ideas that we're playing

2588
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:27,989
around with is actually growing a crop

2589
01:56:25,739 --> 01:56:29,939
for that couple for their wedding

2590
01:56:27,989 --> 01:56:33,090
something that they could give their

2591
01:56:29,939 --> 01:56:34,889
guests that's just for them so unique

2592
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:38,159
kind of like a beautiful vintage wine

2593
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:40,050
that's one of the kinds and really Kimmy

2594
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:41,849
yeah totally there's so many different

2595
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:44,310
things you can do this you can go one

2596
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:47,220
step further and when you make little

2597
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:56,789
bouquets of cannabis flowers make them

2598
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:58,619
with seeded buds that way but you know

2599
01:56:56,789 --> 01:57:00,119
what that's like such a brilliant idea I

2600
01:56:58,619 --> 01:57:03,000
was thinking about you know seed paper

2601
01:57:00,119 --> 01:57:05,220
I've been to weddings where we had this

2602
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:07,859
one mother she was so dedicated she made

2603
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:09,659
sea paper into little hearts and they

2604
01:57:07,859 --> 01:57:11,429
scattered them all over the farm and it

2605
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:13,889
was it was the parents farm so forever

2606
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:15,770
these seeds will be growing I love that

2607
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:18,510
idea of just having it as a seeded bud

2608
01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:20,370
lives on forever and just think about

2609
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:22,140
how much that would feed that couple

2610
01:57:20,369 --> 01:57:24,059
like one of the ideas that we're pairing

2611
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:26,850
with this is this concept that we call

2612
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:29,190
farm table which is growing your own

2613
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:31,050
food having your own food pharmacy in

2614
01:57:29,189 --> 01:57:32,969
your own backyard so being able to

2615
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:34,560
provide simple Gardens for people right

2616
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:36,780
off the hop and when people know how to

2617
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:39,030
see it save seed they have a garden

2618
01:57:36,779 --> 01:57:40,800
forever so integrating cannabis into

2619
01:57:39,029 --> 01:57:43,439
that as well so part of what we're

2620
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,779
gifting to the couples is a garden so

2621
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:47,879
that could be a part of that which I

2622
01:57:45,779 --> 01:57:50,340
think could be really fun so what if

2623
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:56,010
instead of throwing rice as the couple

2624
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:58,829
exits and if you're hungry you might

2625
01:57:56,010 --> 01:58:00,600
catch and just have a little snack be so

2626
01:57:58,829 --> 01:58:02,909
good you're neutral

2627
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:04,440
it'll just basically feed all the birds

2628
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:07,139
in the area but it would be interesting

2629
01:58:04,439 --> 01:58:09,179
to come back in a few weeks and see if

2630
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:11,490
any of those seed sprouted into little

2631
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:13,079
plants I can guarantee it you know

2632
01:58:11,489 --> 01:58:15,210
imagine having the wedding down by the

2633
01:58:13,079 --> 01:58:17,579
creek side that Creek could just be so

2634
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:19,859
pungent by the fall it'd be gorgeous

2635
01:58:17,579 --> 01:58:22,409
yeah I would love that and you know what

2636
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:23,880
I've noticed more and more people are so

2637
01:58:22,409 --> 01:58:25,710
open to it and really like it doesn't

2638
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:27,180
have to be like big smoke out fast it

2639
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:28,980
doesn't have to you know and it could be

2640
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:30,450
absolutely but it doesn't have to be you

2641
01:58:28,979 --> 01:58:32,849
know sometimes grandmas are there and

2642
01:58:30,449 --> 01:58:34,159
they're not totally keen but the other

2643
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:36,800
idea too is

2644
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:39,619
like part of my other business is I

2645
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,329
produce cannabis products so just like

2646
01:58:39,619 --> 01:58:43,909
Tash and her beautiful topicals we've

2647
01:58:41,329 --> 01:58:47,989
got her online and we're thinking about

2648
01:58:43,909 --> 01:58:50,599
having just a beautiful gift to the

2649
01:58:47,989 --> 01:58:52,729
bride the wedding party and of course

2650
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:54,530
the mothers of the bride and groom so to

2651
01:58:52,729 --> 01:58:58,129
prime their skin to get them comfortable

2652
01:58:54,529 --> 01:59:00,710
we have these really beautiful ovule

2653
01:58:58,130 --> 01:59:02,270
suppositories for women's health so

2654
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:04,310
having that as something that could be

2655
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:06,680
in conjunction with you know the wedding

2656
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:09,020
night to help her get primed and

2657
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:13,159
lubricated and plumped up and ready and

2658
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:15,260
juicy and really excited to engage and

2659
01:59:13,159 --> 01:59:18,260
also for him because they smell like

2660
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:20,930
delicious chocolate so you go downtown

2661
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:23,780
and have a good time I can't believe I

2662
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:25,460
just saw that on hash church but yeah

2663
01:59:23,779 --> 01:59:28,189
you know like there's there's such a

2664
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:29,930
multi-faceted realm here that we can

2665
01:59:28,189 --> 01:59:31,729
explore with the weddings and I really

2666
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:33,619
think this is just the beginning so I

2667
01:59:31,729 --> 01:59:36,109
feel fortunate enough to live in an area

2668
01:59:33,619 --> 01:59:37,789
where we work really closely with our

2669
01:59:36,109 --> 01:59:39,349
farmers and we've got some beautiful

2670
01:59:37,789 --> 01:59:43,430
locations and I've already been offered

2671
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:46,370
up and yeah it just seems like a natural

2672
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:48,710
next step into a way to integrate steak

2673
01:59:46,369 --> 01:59:53,000
it's sacred ceremony so the other part

2674
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:56,090
of what I do is I'm actually a reverend

2675
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,489
so I do perform ceremonies maryberry and

2676
01:59:56,090 --> 02:00:00,260
baptize yeah I love your happy dance

2677
01:59:58,489 --> 02:00:03,529
because that's how I feel inside which

2678
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:05,390
is pretty rad so but what we're hoping

2679
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:06,769
to do is also you know to people that

2680
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:08,720
are open is incorporating a full

2681
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:12,230
cannabis ceremony in with their my name

2682
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:14,539
which would be really rad just to bring

2683
02:00:12,229 --> 02:00:16,759
in the elements bring in the beautiful

2684
02:00:14,539 --> 02:00:22,579
energies of lady Kenna Bay and having

2685
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:24,530
that blessing to be a part of it welcome

02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:29,809
yeah awesome so I want to bring the

2709
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:33,289
conversation back to something Joshua

2710
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:34,820
and Kelly mentioned before about some of

2711
02:01:33,289 --> 02:01:37,670
the how you guys were using the whole

2712
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:40,639
plants and I'm really interested in the

2713
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:42,440
cannabis roots I have a review paper

2714
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:44,420
that was just accepted for publication

2715
02:01:42,439 --> 02:01:47,089
so it should be out in the next few

2716
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:49,520
months and we wrote it together there

2717
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:52,250
with dr. Ethan Russo and we put together

2718
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,690
a summary of the historical use of the

2719
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:57,710
cannabis roots and the medical

2720
02:01:53,689 --> 02:02:02,178
applications and a lot of it is topicals

2721
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:06,739
for arthritis inflammation a lot of

2722
02:02:02,179 --> 02:02:08,390
mentions of gout so yeah I was curious

2723
02:02:06,738 --> 02:02:10,069
what are you guys doing with the root

2724
02:02:08,390 --> 02:02:14,300
how are you incorporating that into your

2725
02:02:10,069 --> 02:02:16,189
medicine we do it almost all different

2726
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:18,350
kinds yeah well we utilize it in almost

2727
02:02:16,189 --> 02:02:21,408
every application as much as we possibly

2728
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:24,199
can only because whenever you're

2729
02:02:21,408 --> 02:02:27,469
utilizing herbs the idea of utilizing

2730
02:02:24,198 --> 02:02:29,839
the whole herb you know the roots and

2731
02:02:27,469 --> 02:02:31,789
also getting it in different cycles of

2732
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:34,100
its life you know if you want to create

2733
02:02:31,789 --> 02:02:36,350
a full spectrum medicine of any type of

2734
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:38,750
the plant then you want to maybe create

2735
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:40,850
a tincture that has the spring shoots

2736
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:43,039
that has the spring roots that has the

2737
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:45,860
fall shoots that has the flowers that

2738
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:47,960
has the seeds that has you know the full

2739
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:51,019
spectrum of the plant and it's not that

2740
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:53,600
there's any science there's a lot of you

2741
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:55,580
know traditional medicinal value you

2742
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:58,460
know that you can yeah wise women as

2743
02:02:55,579 --> 02:02:59,569
well as Chinese medicine as well as our

2744
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:01,399
Yvetta that goes

2745
02:02:59,569 --> 02:03:03,559
you know well beyond anything that

2746
02:03:01,399 --> 02:03:06,019
Western medicine or science you know

2747
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:08,750
today has to offer the some type of a

2748
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:10,850
value in that but I believe that that's

2749
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:14,119
probably a real observational you know

2750
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:17,180
things so we do that in cannabis we do a

2751
02:03:14,119 --> 02:03:19,789
slow cook oil that we actually put in a

2752
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:24,610
crock pot so it's on the lowest of the

2753
02:03:19,789 --> 02:03:27,409
low heat simmer simmer down yeah and we

2754
02:03:24,609 --> 02:03:30,469
utilize the roots in there the flowers

2755
02:03:27,409 --> 02:03:32,389
the leaves the stalks we put maybe 11

2756
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:34,190
different types of mushrooms in there

2757
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:37,970
well cut poly pours like foam miss

2758
02:03:34,189 --> 02:03:41,119
moment arias The Iceman Amadou fungus

2759
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:44,600
the artist conk which is the Ganoderma

2760
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:48,909
have planets him and then the red belt

2761
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:51,410
the foam is foam mitosis pinna cola

2762
02:03:48,909 --> 02:03:53,779
vomit arias yeah the phloem esquema

2763
02:03:51,409 --> 02:03:58,099
terrace is the almond yeah i'm chaga

2764
02:03:53,779 --> 02:04:00,889
which we can find in our forest here we

2765
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:03,890
see the ones that are really like crazy

2766
02:04:00,890 --> 02:04:06,560
and so we get it fresh slice it up and

2767
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:08,960
put the slices in the Sun and dry it in

2768
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:12,020
the Sun to accumulate the vitamin D and

2769
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:15,500
then we take those slices and utilize

2770
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:17,000
them in the in the slow cook we can do

2771
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:21,289
different kinds of oils but maybe a

2772
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:23,600
coconut oil olive oil combination works

2773
02:04:21,289 --> 02:04:25,310
good too because of the consistency that

2774
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,840
it comes out with in the end and then

2775
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:29,210
add a bunch of other herbs in there

2776
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:31,220
having to do with other adaptogens you

2777
02:04:29,210 --> 02:04:33,800
know we'd utilize a struggle acetyl ice

2778
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:35,690
voti you know sort of bringing in all of

2779
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,340
the different realms and every time we

2780
02:04:35,689 --> 02:04:39,799
utilize those licorice

2781
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:41,659
yeah those plants we make sure that

2782
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:42,170
we're getting the full spectrum of the

2783
02:04:41,659 --> 02:04:45,229
plant

2784
02:04:42,170 --> 02:04:48,079
we're also utilizing the herbs and the

2785
02:04:45,229 --> 02:04:50,899
leaves in those plants as well and then

2786
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:54,140
you can use that oil and put it in gel

2787
02:04:50,899 --> 02:04:56,899
caps and get a really easy to use oil or

2788
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:58,039
use it topically or use it as you know

2789
02:04:56,899 --> 02:05:01,849
there's a lot of course you can use it

2790
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:03,920
in different ways yeah with the tincture

2791
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:05,900
is used similarly I mean we put a

2792
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,949
similar blend into the into the tincture

2793
02:05:05,899 --> 02:05:12,019
and now use will use a homemade organic

2794
02:05:08,949 --> 02:05:13,429
alcohol that's you know that we know

2795
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:15,830
exactly what's going on

2796
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:18,770
- a type thing to break it down and then

2797
02:05:15,829 --> 02:05:20,600
do us but your type tincture with it

2798
02:05:18,770 --> 02:05:23,000
where we burn the material afterwards

2799
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:25,039
and utilize the ash and then you're

2800
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,890
bringing the whole cycle of life and

2801
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:30,500
death of the entire plant into the

2802
02:05:27,890 --> 02:05:35,900
medicine which is what we consider full

2803
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:38,750
spectrum with our Wow incredible helium

2804
02:05:35,899 --> 02:05:41,119
incredible stories yeah and also just to

2805
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:43,189
add exactly what we're talking about in

2806
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:46,309
our medicine is the same way that we

2807
02:05:43,189 --> 02:05:49,369
make our tea brews for our plants so we

2808
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:50,960
utilize all of these different herbs and

2809
02:05:49,369 --> 02:05:53,180
the whole entire life cycle of the plant

2810
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:55,819
to put back into the soil as well so

2811
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:57,560
there's really no separation in the

2812
02:05:55,819 --> 02:05:59,239
medicines and the teas that we give

2813
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:02,120
ourselves and the medicine and the teas

2814
02:05:59,239 --> 02:06:04,369
that we give our plants that's really

2815
02:06:02,119 --> 02:06:07,099
interesting you guys are serious I love

2816
02:06:04,369 --> 02:06:09,649
how complex your formulas are and that

2817
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:11,900
you're considering not only what part of

2818
02:06:09,649 --> 02:06:13,519
the plant but the season the growth the

2819
02:06:11,899 --> 02:06:15,559
even like you said the life and the

2820
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:17,510
death of the plant and how yeah the

2821
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:21,560
whole profile of nutrients and

2822
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:24,590
functional properties shift as the plant

2823
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:25,850
matures and changes when you guys were

2824
02:06:24,590 --> 02:06:27,980
talking about what you were doing with

2825
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:29,720
the roots one of the interesting things

2826
02:06:27,979 --> 02:06:31,729
that came up when we were looking at the

2827
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:33,530
historical use and as you were saying I

2828
02:06:31,729 --> 02:06:36,069
totally agree there's value in these

2829
02:06:33,529 --> 02:06:38,719
traditional ways of preparing herbs and

2830
02:06:36,069 --> 02:06:41,119
science hasn't caught up to a lot of

2831
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:44,600
these ways I mean like even with a lot

2832
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:46,519
of the plants and herbs that I look at

2833
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:48,620
there might be basic test tube

2834
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:50,900
experiments or some animal experiments

2835
02:06:48,619 --> 02:06:54,170
kind of confirming some basic mechanisms

2836
02:06:50,899 --> 02:06:55,729
but we're not there yet with what we

2837
02:06:54,170 --> 02:06:57,380
know through first-hand experience

2838
02:06:55,729 --> 02:06:59,419
versus having double-blind

2839
02:06:57,380 --> 02:07:00,859
placebo-controlled trials to confirm

2840
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:02,359
these things and I don't know if we'll

2841
02:07:00,859 --> 02:07:04,039
ever get them because some of these

2842
02:07:02,359 --> 02:07:06,259
plants are so complicated and they work

2843
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:08,329
so broad-spectrum they don't just target

2844
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:10,280
one specific things like a lot of

2845
02:07:08,329 --> 02:07:12,380
traditional or not even traditional but

2846
02:07:10,279 --> 02:07:14,829
pharmaceutical medications do but anyway

2847
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:17,029
what I wanted to bring up with the roots

2848
02:07:14,829 --> 02:07:20,619
one thing that kept coming up through

2849
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:22,759
history is they used water to help

2850
02:07:20,619 --> 02:07:23,170
extract a lot of the compounds in the

2851
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,510
root

2852
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:27,310
and as we know a lot of the most I mean

2853
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:29,679
all the cannabinoids and the terpenes

2854
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:31,840
are fat soluble compounds and so usually

2855
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:35,289
we're using like coconut oils or other

2856
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,300
fats to extract things whereas with the

2857
02:07:35,289 --> 02:07:38,859
roots it just kept coming up through a

2858
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:40,690
history that they were using water

2859
02:07:38,859 --> 02:07:42,309
extractions and so when we looked a

2860
02:07:40,689 --> 02:07:43,889
little deeper into some of the compounds

2861
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:46,810
that had been isolated from the roots

2862
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:49,239
there were some unique alkaloids such as

2863
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:51,310
a kind of a SATA bean that was found in

2864
02:07:49,238 --> 02:07:53,559
the roots and so I'm wondering if maybe

2865
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:55,239
with water extractions and when you're

2866
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:56,830
also doing the alcohol extractions you'd

2867
02:07:55,238 --> 02:07:59,259
be able to pull out some of those more

2868
02:07:56,829 --> 02:08:02,350
water soluble type compounds and maybe

2869
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:05,289
even improving the effectiveness of your

2870
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:07,600
root compounds with what you're doing

2871
02:08:05,289 --> 02:08:09,130
because one of the blends we tried you

2872
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:13,420
know one of the ones we tried was we

2873
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:14,890
used and my husband has his MMAR license

2874
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:17,980
and is a CMP our license as I said

2875
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:20,199
before so he's been a grower and I've

2876
02:08:17,979 --> 02:08:23,589
had access to plants to try out some of

2877
02:08:20,198 --> 02:08:25,599
these basic recipes and so my husband

2878
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:28,239
Dave was the one who first clued me into

2879
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:31,530
trying to work with the roots and the

2880
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:35,049
recipe we found was basically a blend of

2881
02:08:31,529 --> 02:08:37,029
fat and water and in a crock pot and use

2882
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:38,920
that to extract and then basically put

2883
02:08:37,029 --> 02:08:40,630
it in the freezer to separate pour off

2884
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:42,670
the water but you can even keep that

2885
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:45,069
water extract for something else I mean

2886
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:47,739
you're more at risk for microbial growth

2887
02:08:45,069 --> 02:08:50,019
and other issues so it wouldn't have as

2888
02:08:47,738 --> 02:08:52,359
long as a shelf life as the fat soluble

2889
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:54,160
blends but it'd be interesting to start

2890
02:08:52,359 --> 02:08:55,839
working with those different extracts

2891
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:58,029
and again you're getting additional

2892
02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:00,429
compounds and that still need a lot of

2893
02:08:58,029 --> 02:09:02,979
work to be studied and clarified what

2894
02:09:00,429 --> 02:09:04,480
exactly these compounds are yeah and

2895
02:09:02,979 --> 02:09:08,189
it's really interesting what you bring

2896
02:09:04,479 --> 02:09:11,409
up too because it really differentiates

2897
02:09:08,189 --> 02:09:13,960
the difference between the fresh herbs

2898
02:09:11,409 --> 02:09:15,969
because anything that's water-soluble or

2899
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:18,279
you know aqueous and a non you know in a

2900
02:09:15,969 --> 02:09:20,679
water solution you want to be able to

2901
02:09:18,279 --> 02:09:22,448
utilize that fresh you know you could

2902
02:09:20,679 --> 02:09:24,760
utilize it in juicing you know the

2903
02:09:22,448 --> 02:09:26,948
leaves are not gonna be as good in

2904
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:29,260
anything when as soon as they're dried

2905
02:09:26,948 --> 02:09:31,869
or they're utilized in a in a water

2906
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:34,119
extraction or oil extraction in the same

2907
02:09:31,869 --> 02:09:36,318
way even a tincture extraction it really

2908
02:09:34,119 --> 02:09:38,929
does it changes

2909
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:42,048
the the properties of making like a

2910
02:09:38,929 --> 02:09:45,199
beautiful steeped tea or something that

2911
02:09:42,048 --> 02:09:47,418
you press fresh and raw and that just

2912
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:49,338
goes into access the ability for people

2913
02:09:47,418 --> 02:09:52,158
to be able to grow their own cannabis

2914
02:09:49,338 --> 02:09:54,828
plants you know really easily so that

2915
02:09:52,158 --> 02:09:56,568
they can press them and they can drink

2916
02:09:54,828 --> 02:09:58,338
the fresh juice because there's nothing

2917
02:09:56,569 --> 02:10:01,219
better than drinking the fresh juice

2918
02:09:58,338 --> 02:10:04,248
from those roots you can't even you know

2919
02:10:01,219 --> 02:10:06,498
no water extraction no tea solution and

2920
02:10:04,248 --> 02:10:09,078
nothing can be quite the same the same

2921
02:10:06,498 --> 02:10:11,298
way with fresh pressing any of your

2922
02:10:09,078 --> 02:10:13,578
leaves you know getting that juice

2923
02:10:11,298 --> 02:10:16,639
that's sort of a one-of-a-kind medicine

2924
02:10:13,578 --> 02:10:18,768
and that's utilizing fresh as opposed to

2925
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:21,559
something that you keep long-term like

2926
02:10:18,769 --> 02:10:22,849
say the oil and and and I really I'm

2927
02:10:21,559 --> 02:10:25,538
agreeing with you know it's interesting

2928
02:10:22,849 --> 02:10:28,878
that science is now pairing up with

2929
02:10:25,538 --> 02:10:32,898
traditions because we're finding and

2930
02:10:28,878 --> 02:10:35,269
realizing that you know these herbal

2931
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:38,479
remedies that you know that they've

2932
02:10:35,269 --> 02:10:41,809
given us recipes for for a long time now

2933
02:10:38,479 --> 02:10:43,369
science is really proving and so it's

2934
02:10:41,809 --> 02:10:46,069
great well you know you're talking about

2935
02:10:43,368 --> 02:10:48,288
herbs and reading these papers and it's

2936
02:10:46,069 --> 02:10:49,909
just really wonderful it's like it's

2937
02:10:48,288 --> 02:10:51,798
finally validating what we've known all

2938
02:10:49,908 --> 02:10:54,259
along that we've seen throughout human

2939
02:10:51,798 --> 02:10:56,599
history you know these these ways have

2940
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:58,128
worked for eons and our family is

2941
02:10:56,599 --> 02:11:02,119
starting to catch up with the knowledge

2942
02:10:58,128 --> 02:11:03,708
scientifically which is so even having

2943
02:11:02,118 --> 02:11:05,838
the ability to catch up with the

2944
02:11:03,708 --> 02:11:10,760
knowledge it feels like with education

2945
02:11:05,838 --> 02:11:14,088
there's like a separation of what's in a

2946
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:16,579
like story knowledge becomes not valued

2947
02:11:14,088 --> 02:11:18,738
in the same way in this modern time of

2948
02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:21,048
Education when we can just say there's

2949
02:11:18,738 --> 02:11:23,078
work there's places for education and

2950
02:11:21,048 --> 02:11:25,548
there's places for science at this

2951
02:11:23,078 --> 02:11:29,148
extremely important and I would love to

2952
02:11:25,548 --> 02:11:32,389
see that both were valued equally we can

2953
02:11:29,149 --> 02:11:33,349
be like here's the observation estat

2954
02:11:32,389 --> 02:11:34,849
have been doing it for a really long

2955
02:11:33,349 --> 02:11:37,760
time this is what they're bringing to

2956
02:11:34,849 --> 02:11:39,019
the table here's the scientific aspect

2957
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:41,030
here's our they're bringing them

2958
02:11:39,019 --> 02:11:43,699
together is the real strength you know

2959
02:11:41,029 --> 02:11:45,078
and not having full-spectrum judgment on

2960
02:11:43,698 --> 02:11:47,598
one or the other just bringing them

2961
02:11:45,078 --> 02:11:49,368
together and just and and and seeing you

2962
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:50,029
know what makes sense because every

2963
02:11:49,368 --> 02:11:51,229
situation

2964
02:11:50,029 --> 02:11:54,050
different every person's different

2965
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:57,500
having the ability to have different

2966
02:11:54,050 --> 02:12:00,909
options I think is our greatest our

2967
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:03,380
greatest gift right now is options I

2968
02:12:00,908 --> 02:12:05,359
would say options and as you're

2969
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:07,250
describing this I imagine hopefully

2970
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:10,219
maybe even within 10 years having

2971
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:12,380
schools where kids are in these learning

2972
02:12:10,219 --> 02:12:14,630
gardens and these educational gardens

2973
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:16,118
and they're understanding how these

2974
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:18,650
beautiful plants are working

2975
02:12:16,118 --> 02:12:20,538
biodynamically symbiotically and then

2976
02:12:18,649 --> 02:12:22,609
also being able to pair it up with the

2977
02:12:20,538 --> 02:12:25,130
quantifiable research just to drive that

2978
02:12:22,609 --> 02:12:27,769
message home I do see it coming and it

2979
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:28,940
is it is full spectrum which is really

2980
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:30,860
beautiful I think it's more of an

2981
02:12:28,939 --> 02:12:35,238
integrative process than them segregated

2982
02:12:30,859 --> 02:12:38,868
for sure yeah thank you guys for doing

2983
02:12:35,238 --> 02:12:42,078
the good work so I wanted to bring the

2984
02:12:38,868 --> 02:12:43,238
conversation back to Sam Sam are you are

2985
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:51,078
you there

2986
02:12:43,238 --> 02:12:56,109
are you with us still maybe but what I

2987
02:12:51,078 --> 02:12:59,569
wanted to ask Sam when we live up here

2988
02:12:56,109 --> 02:13:02,988
microphone keeps going off so I keep

2989
02:12:59,569 --> 02:13:04,759
turning it back on oh that's me I keep

2990
02:13:02,988 --> 02:13:08,899
meeting you because we're getting echo

2991
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:11,690
sorry I'm not for me because I I have my

2992
02:13:08,899 --> 02:13:14,538
own mic with an on/off switch that I

2993
02:13:11,689 --> 02:13:16,549
used constantly okay so I don't need to

2994
02:13:14,538 --> 02:13:20,179
mute use what you're saying we won't get

2995
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:21,260
feedback - if you're so motivated well I

2996
02:13:20,179 --> 02:13:23,029
don't want to keep you out of the

2997
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:25,190
conversation I'm more just trying to

2998
02:13:23,029 --> 02:13:27,529
keep echo feedback but alright but

2999
02:13:25,189 --> 02:13:30,888
anyway what I want to ask you is let's

3000
02:13:27,529 --> 02:13:34,609
go back to the discussion on cannabis or

3001
02:13:30,889 --> 02:13:38,210
THC as a Rick and you were bringing up

3002
02:13:34,609 --> 02:13:41,750
the interesting story of trying pure THC

3003
02:13:38,210 --> 02:13:44,118
with different terpenes and I'm curious

3004
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:46,760
what your experience was like so

3005
02:13:44,118 --> 02:13:49,339
obviously you try THC in limonene and

3006
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:51,829
THC in little oil and THC and all these

3007
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:55,130
other different terpenes so from your

3008
02:13:51,828 --> 02:13:58,969
perspective and how it made you feel do

3009
02:13:55,130 --> 02:14:01,969
you think with th see what terpenes do

3010
02:13:58,969 --> 02:14:03,609
you think had the best recreational feel

3011
02:14:01,969 --> 02:14:07,670
like what the

3012
02:14:03,609 --> 02:14:10,519
there is no best recreational terpene

3013
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:13,940
and THC everybody has a different

3014
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:17,180
preference but everybody that we tested

3015
02:14:13,939 --> 02:14:20,629
we blind tested we we had a hundred

3016
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:23,989
question organoleptic survey before and

3017
02:14:20,630 --> 02:14:26,510
after and everybody agreed that the

3018
02:14:23,988 --> 02:14:28,609
terpenes have these effects which ones

3019
02:14:26,510 --> 02:14:32,860
they preferred was really up to the

3020
02:14:28,609 --> 02:14:35,869
individual so what did you prefer I

3021
02:14:32,859 --> 02:14:39,948
liked labelling mayor seeing the small

3022
02:14:35,869 --> 02:14:44,659
amount small amounts of pining seemed to

3023
02:14:39,948 --> 02:14:46,969
be okay but I like both said modulate

3024
02:14:44,659 --> 02:14:50,119
and potentiate and there's only a

3025
02:14:46,969 --> 02:14:57,020
handful but potentiate THC there's many

3026
02:14:50,119 --> 02:15:02,809
that modulate it Sam say yes I want you

3027
02:14:57,020 --> 02:15:04,730
to say limonene not Lima there's a

3028
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:08,060
better how many times I say it I'm just

3029
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:09,769
like sick Mother's Day Moline because

3030
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:12,560
there's no such thing as Lyme alley and

3031
02:15:09,770 --> 02:15:15,590
sounds like a kid's nursery rhyme it's

3032
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:18,410
the limonene okay but listen to what I'm

3033
02:15:15,590 --> 02:15:21,770
telling you I'm Dyslexic I will say the

3034
02:15:18,409 --> 02:15:28,698
same word wrong time after time after

3035
02:15:21,770 --> 02:15:31,250
time we know what you mean it's okay you

3036
02:15:28,698 --> 02:15:32,479
know what I believe is the Sam limonene

3037
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:37,010
is to the rest of the world

3038
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:41,529
yeah exactly it's probably the one I

3039
02:15:37,010 --> 02:15:45,170
enjoyed the most with but I also agree

3040
02:15:41,529 --> 02:15:49,159
you don't necessarily want a variety

3041
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:51,319
with one terpene and THC that's very

3042
02:15:49,159 --> 02:15:54,769
useful for you to determine the effects

3043
02:15:51,319 --> 02:15:57,259
of it but you want the suite of terpenes

3044
02:15:54,770 --> 02:16:02,719
that you enjoy Sam if you're really

3045
02:15:57,260 --> 02:16:04,460
thirsty and you come off of a I don't

3046
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:07,369
know some adventure or maybe it's a walk

3047
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:11,420
on a hot day through New York City and

3048
02:16:07,369 --> 02:16:14,448
you come up to a smoothie vendor that

3049
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:16,789
has all different kinds of fruits and

3050
02:16:14,448 --> 02:16:18,439
flavors what kind

3051
02:16:16,789 --> 02:16:22,600
smoothie would you get when you get an

3052
02:16:18,439 --> 02:16:26,149
orange or a tangerine smoothie

3053
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:28,340
well orange smoothies have always been

3054
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:30,889
my favorite but I'd usually have it with

3055
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:33,590
orange banana and a few more things

3056
02:16:30,890 --> 02:16:37,700
thrown it well guess what orange has a

3057
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:40,159
lot of go ahead you say it I want to

3058
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:42,800
hear you say it well it's it's got

3059
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:46,968
labelling or whatever it whether I'm

3060
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:49,819
changing but it also has some of the

3061
02:16:46,968 --> 02:16:52,519
other near a doll and some of these

3062
02:16:49,819 --> 02:16:56,000
compounds yeah sure it does it

3063
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:57,409
absolutely does I'm just just pulling on

3064
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,599
your leg that's all buddy oh that's

3065
02:16:57,409 --> 02:17:06,110
perfectly all right I'm used to myself

3066
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:08,420
and so we know for a fact you said you

3067
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:11,420
liked limonene or lima lean however you

3068
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:14,299
want to say it what was your favorite

3069
02:17:11,420 --> 02:17:16,280
smell when I smelt single notes I was

3070
02:17:14,299 --> 02:17:20,449
actually the most surprised by Mersin I

3071
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:22,579
was expecting it to have more of like a

3072
02:17:20,450 --> 02:17:24,679
skanky smell but it was actually really

3073
02:17:22,579 --> 02:17:28,760
like fruity and soft I guess because

3074
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:31,129
it's high and and sorry hops hops can

3075
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:33,349
contain about 50% mercy it was expecting

3076
02:17:31,129 --> 02:17:36,079
it to have that smell some people really

3077
02:17:33,349 --> 02:17:38,950
like the smell of Mercy and they also

3078
02:17:36,079 --> 02:17:42,260
really like the effects of it with THC

3079
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:46,940
it's not my favorite cup of tea because

3080
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:50,989
in small amounts it it potentiates THC

3081
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:53,120
but in large amounts it makes you in

3082
02:17:50,989 --> 02:17:55,340
other words in small amounts it's kind

3083
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:59,329
of a stimulant in large amounts it's

3084
02:17:55,340 --> 02:18:04,790
definitely a couch lock never trust

3085
02:17:59,329 --> 02:18:10,909
anyone interesting yeah that was our our

3086
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:12,440
joke mercy lovers I was gonna say just

3087
02:18:10,909 --> 02:18:14,750
on the note of mercy and I remember

3088
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:17,360
somewhere in the ethers of my education

3089
02:18:14,750 --> 02:18:20,540
long ago something around the the idea

3090
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:23,510
that anything less than 0.5% nursing

3091
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:25,880
will give that uplifting kind of quality

3092
02:18:23,510 --> 02:18:27,710
and anything over 1% will actually bring

3093
02:18:25,879 --> 02:18:28,959
you down I don't know does anyone have

3094
02:18:27,709 --> 02:18:31,989
any science or is

3095
02:18:28,959 --> 02:18:33,968
it's that to some degree but you can't

3096
02:18:31,989 --> 02:18:36,039
just pick the number like that

3097
02:18:33,968 --> 02:18:39,699
arbitrarily say it with everybody and

3098
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:43,179
you can't say it because there is no

3099
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:45,670
variety that only has three five mersin

3100
02:18:43,179 --> 02:18:49,120
or whatever level of meshing without the

3101
02:18:45,670 --> 02:18:50,260
other collaborators of course it was

3102
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:51,940
just something that I remember learning

3103
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:55,389
through the medical cannabis Institute

3104
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:58,380
years ago just wondering if anyone had

3105
02:18:55,388 --> 02:19:01,059
any extra insight on that piece

3106
02:18:58,379 --> 02:19:03,339
well it sounds similar to what sound was

3107
02:19:01,059 --> 02:19:05,319
just saying in that low amounts have one

3108
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:09,159
effect whereas high amounts have another

3109
02:19:05,319 --> 02:19:12,340
effect so I usually cook a biphasic and

3110
02:19:09,159 --> 02:19:14,260
I think a lot of different compounds and

3111
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:16,809
cannabis have biphasic effects so it

3112
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:19,270
gets complicated China give specific

3113
02:19:16,809 --> 02:19:20,590
dosing requirements for people and that

3114
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:22,149
and of course we're all very

3115
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:24,610
individualistic and how we're going to

3116
02:19:22,149 --> 02:19:30,359
respond not even if you're a novel or an

3117
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:35,319
advanced user but if everything else

3118
02:19:30,360 --> 02:19:39,489
every time I smoked merci and THC mixed

3119
02:19:35,319 --> 02:19:42,340
and they their eyes just like melted

3120
02:19:39,489 --> 02:19:45,879
with joy but that's what they said this

3121
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:50,351
is what I love and I says I can't stand

3122
02:19:45,879 --> 02:19:53,279
it any time you any time you're looking

3123
02:19:50,351 --> 02:19:57,579
at just one terpene I mean you're again

3124
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:59,980
missing the the orchestra by just

3125
02:19:57,579 --> 02:20:02,771
hearing one of the instruments in the

3126
02:19:59,979 --> 02:20:05,889
orchestra right there's a whole number

3127
02:20:02,771 --> 02:20:07,900
of different things that are playing to

3128
02:20:05,889 --> 02:20:10,420
the human senses in cannabis that

3129
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:12,549
doesn't have to do with just the first

3130
02:20:10,420 --> 02:20:14,620
violin but has to do with the entire

3131
02:20:12,549 --> 02:20:17,770
string section combined with the brass

3132
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:21,130
section all of those background terpenes

3133
02:20:17,771 --> 02:20:23,920
and very very very you know minor forms

3134
02:20:21,129 --> 02:20:27,039
and again I look at Mayer seen as being

3135
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:28,960
somewhat of the maybe I won't call it a

3136
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:30,790
stem-cell tripping but it's some at a

3137
02:20:28,959 --> 02:20:33,609
turkey net could actually is a bridge to

3138
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:35,351
a lot of other more advanced terpenes

3139
02:20:33,610 --> 02:20:39,310
and terpenoids

3140
02:20:35,351 --> 02:20:42,310
and terpenoids and and so again that

3141
02:20:39,310 --> 02:20:44,681
paper that we keep on referencing around

3142
02:20:42,310 --> 02:20:46,601
hashey Sheen showed a plausible

3143
02:20:44,681 --> 02:20:51,310
mechanism for the photolytic degradation

3144
02:20:46,601 --> 02:20:54,159
of Mersin to make this new terpene

3145
02:20:51,310 --> 02:20:58,931
called hashish een I mean there might be

3146
02:20:54,159 --> 02:21:01,360
a whole host of every time you combine

3147
02:20:58,931 --> 02:21:04,899
mersin with another terpene you have the

3148
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:07,631
opportunity for a synergistic ensemble

3149
02:21:04,899 --> 02:21:09,909
effect and now when you put four

3150
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:11,800
terpenes together five terpenes six

3151
02:21:09,909 --> 02:21:14,739
turkey's the full spectrum of terpenes

3152
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:18,279
that are available in the plant you're

3153
02:21:14,739 --> 02:21:20,681
creating the music of an orchestra not

3154
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:26,141
of just a single instrument in the

3155
02:21:20,681 --> 02:21:28,149
orchestra so it's a symphony really and

3156
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:31,329
exactly and if you just pull out that

3157
02:21:28,149 --> 02:21:32,409
one it is the chemical symphony and i

3158
02:21:31,329 --> 02:21:36,790
think that's where you're talking about

3159
02:21:32,409 --> 02:21:38,890
that full spectrum effect it is and just

3160
02:21:36,790 --> 02:21:40,270
as like a little insight just I know

3161
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:41,800
with people that are using

3162
02:21:40,271 --> 02:21:43,091
aromatherapies anyways when they're

3163
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:45,489
doing combinations

3164
02:21:43,091 --> 02:21:47,921
it is like music it's like notes and a

3165
02:21:45,489 --> 02:21:50,199
song and there's harmonics and those

3166
02:21:47,921 --> 02:21:52,751
smells harmonize with each other or they

3167
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:55,150
clash so I like to actually pair up the

3168
02:21:52,751 --> 02:21:57,700
idea of terpenes with music in another

3169
02:21:55,149 --> 02:21:59,350
way of just seeing it that is an

3170
02:21:57,700 --> 02:22:01,811
excellent point Celina and that's how I

3171
02:21:59,351 --> 02:22:03,671
always teach people even if you're new

3172
02:22:01,810 --> 02:22:05,829
to essential oils and you want to make

3173
02:22:03,671 --> 02:22:07,511
even just a basic perfume you need to

3174
02:22:05,829 --> 02:22:08,860
think of how you're building it like

3175
02:22:07,511 --> 02:22:11,229
you're making music and you're building

3176
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:13,870
a chord and similar to music you can

3177
02:22:11,229 --> 02:22:15,699
hear a chord or music and it just sounds

3178
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:17,921
right it feels right or if you feel like

3179
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:19,931
a note is off it feels kind of like and

3180
02:22:17,921 --> 02:22:22,390
it just gives you a weird feeling when

3181
02:22:19,931 --> 02:22:23,829
you smell and create blends like that

3182
02:22:22,390 --> 02:22:25,720
it's the same thing when you have it

3183
02:22:23,829 --> 02:22:27,909
properly balanced and you're hitting all

3184
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:29,380
those notes and so I like to break it

3185
02:22:27,909 --> 02:22:31,630
down into three notes you have your bass

3186
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:34,090
note your mid note and your talk note so

3187
02:22:31,630 --> 02:22:36,609
for instance in my little vaporizer guy

3188
02:22:34,091 --> 02:22:38,381
back here I can't tell you what my stash

3189
02:22:36,610 --> 02:22:41,261
is today but I can tell you what I have

3190
02:22:38,380 --> 02:22:44,770
going for a Roma therapy so I have

3191
02:22:41,261 --> 02:22:46,931
basically I created a chord we can say

3192
02:22:44,771 --> 02:22:49,450
out of three aromas so I used a base

3193
02:22:46,931 --> 02:22:51,030
blend with a little bit of patchouli and

3194
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:54,131
so that's considered a base blend

3195
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:55,479
because it's heavier it's slower to

3196
02:22:54,130 --> 02:22:57,879
evaporates and the

3197
02:22:55,478 --> 02:23:00,639
the aroma comes up later whereas the mid

3198
02:22:57,879 --> 02:23:02,498
note is gonna be more balancing and kind

3199
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:05,590
of bring it all together so I used

3200
02:23:02,498 --> 02:23:08,170
lavender as my mid note and then the top

3201
02:23:05,590 --> 02:23:10,600
note hits the fastest it's mostly

3202
02:23:08,170 --> 02:23:12,908
composed of monoterpenes such as

3203
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:15,488
limonene menthol things that hit and

3204
02:23:12,908 --> 02:23:17,529
absorb and that really potent smell that

3205
02:23:15,488 --> 02:23:19,868
comes off really fast those are the top

3206
02:23:17,529 --> 02:23:22,090
notes so today I have a little bit of

3207
02:23:19,869 --> 02:23:24,189
peppermint which is nice in the morning

3208
02:23:22,090 --> 02:23:27,010
because it wakes me up so when you

3209
02:23:24,189 --> 02:23:29,229
properly combine those three essential

3210
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:31,199
oils or plant oils these are steam

3211
02:23:29,228 --> 02:23:35,769
distill distill plants I'm using today

3212
02:23:31,199 --> 02:23:37,689
you create this cord basically that is

3213
02:23:35,770 --> 02:23:39,578
like Selena was saying like music and

3214
02:23:37,689 --> 02:23:41,408
when you smell it it smells balanced

3215
02:23:39,578 --> 02:23:43,359
versus one of those single compounds

3216
02:23:41,408 --> 02:23:45,609
alone and when you look at even just an

3217
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:47,590
essential oil that's the full plant so

3218
02:23:45,609 --> 02:23:51,488
like something like sweet orange

3219
02:23:47,590 --> 02:23:53,199
essential oil might be 97% limonene but

3220
02:23:51,488 --> 02:23:55,180
it has all these other little my new

3221
02:23:53,199 --> 02:23:57,279
compounds a little bit of myrrh seen a

3222
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:59,498
little bit of Lin Ahlul just very very

3223
02:23:57,279 --> 02:24:03,100
small amounts but together they create

3224
02:23:59,498 --> 02:24:06,248
this like unique aroma that is sweet

3225
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:08,109
orange whereas something like lemon also

3226
02:24:06,248 --> 02:24:10,148
has a really high amount of limonene but

3227
02:24:08,109 --> 02:24:12,039
because of the little minut amounts of

3228
02:24:10,148 --> 02:24:14,049
other terpenes and other compounds it

3229
02:24:12,039 --> 02:24:16,630
smells very different than orange so

3230
02:24:14,049 --> 02:24:18,429
yeah it's very relatable to music and I

3231
02:24:16,629 --> 02:24:21,759
find it it's easier for people to learn

3232
02:24:18,430 --> 02:24:22,689
and absorb that knowledge when they can

3233
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:24,309
relate it to music

3234
02:24:22,689 --> 02:24:27,970
thank you for bringing that up Selina I

3235
02:24:24,309 --> 02:24:34,228
like the smell of limes the best of the

3236
02:24:27,969 --> 02:24:37,118
citrus hmmm my personal favorite is

3237
02:24:34,228 --> 02:24:40,778
neroli blossom so that's the orange

3238
02:24:37,119 --> 02:24:43,090
blossom it's very expensive but oh my

3239
02:24:40,779 --> 02:24:44,738
goodness once you smell it it's kind of

3240
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:46,328
one of those things you're like oh I

3241
02:24:44,738 --> 02:24:49,448
must have this in my life at all times

3242
02:24:46,328 --> 02:24:51,549
because it has the little bits of like

3243
02:24:49,449 --> 02:24:53,319
sweet orange that really nice fresh

3244
02:24:51,549 --> 02:24:55,988
smell but then it also has these really

3245
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:58,269
strong floral notes that come in and if

3246
02:24:55,988 --> 02:25:00,459
you can get the right neroli blossom it

3247
02:24:58,270 --> 02:25:02,859
is heaven it's seriously one of the best

3248
02:25:00,459 --> 02:25:04,839
one that you gifted me is my favorite

3249
02:25:02,859 --> 02:25:07,059
smell at the moment honestly I've never

3250
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:07,870
smelled anything like it I thought you

3251
02:25:07,059 --> 02:25:10,510
know the

3252
02:25:07,870 --> 02:25:12,550
I'm that really orange that sweet orange

3253
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:15,010
citrus was mine but the neroli just

3254
02:25:12,549 --> 02:25:18,608
takes it to a whole other level so thank

3255
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:21,969
you for that it's not only like good

3256
02:25:18,609 --> 02:25:24,460
it's it's like seductive it is essential

3257
02:25:21,969 --> 02:25:27,429
you're like whoa you smell like this

3258
02:25:24,459 --> 02:25:29,438
beautiful like flower it looks like open

3259
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:31,170
is just like at its peak you know it's

3260
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:36,790
so gorgeous but it's not overpowering

3261
02:25:31,170 --> 02:25:40,770
its no it's subtle foam yeah yeah

3262
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:48,490
did you see the poster at the last ICRS

3263
02:25:40,770 --> 02:25:51,130
presentation by Ethan Russo and Mark

3264
02:25:48,489 --> 02:25:53,319
Lewis mark Lewis did you like that one

3265
02:25:51,129 --> 02:26:00,339
oh yeah they're doing some phenomenal

3266
02:25:53,319 --> 02:26:03,039
work and Ryan can think Peter if I'm

3267
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:05,889
correct Ethan just helped write it up

3268
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:07,930
correct yeah absolutely yep yeah Ethan

3269
02:26:05,889 --> 02:26:10,139
presented it was helping presented but

3270
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:16,210
yeah it's absolutely mark Louis's work

3271
02:26:10,139 --> 02:26:18,879
and so yeah it's nice I got the overview

3272
02:26:16,209 --> 02:26:20,139
from both of them so I know you guys

3273
02:26:18,879 --> 02:26:22,358
talked about it a little bit on a

3274
02:26:20,139 --> 02:26:25,869
previous episode but basically what they

3275
02:26:22,359 --> 02:26:28,840
do is they're making plants cultivars

3276
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:30,640
with specific terpene ratios and so the

3277
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:32,829
one that was really interesting that

3278
02:26:30,639 --> 02:26:35,769
they are most people were really

3279
02:26:32,829 --> 02:26:38,409
interested in was this particular

3280
02:26:35,770 --> 02:26:41,950
cultivar they had bred to be specific

3281
02:26:38,409 --> 02:26:44,469
for epilepsy and so it also had hi Linna

3282
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:46,329
looool in it and I can't remember what

3283
02:26:44,469 --> 02:26:49,029
other terpenes that they were bringing

3284
02:26:46,329 --> 02:26:54,370
out awfully yes beta carotene thank you

3285
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:56,350
Jim more to say about that Ryan I don't

3286
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:57,579
know what I can say about it it was the

3287
02:26:56,350 --> 02:26:59,020
whole it was the whole team at neighbor

3288
02:26:57,579 --> 02:27:00,459
that did the work and that was for one

3289
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:02,620
of their clients and actually wasn't an

3290
02:27:00,459 --> 02:27:04,659
apron that was breeding the plants but

3291
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:06,460
they guide the they guide the science

3292
02:27:04,659 --> 02:27:08,889
their guide their client through the

3293
02:27:06,459 --> 02:27:10,539
science so because neighbor o is a

3294
02:27:08,889 --> 02:27:13,898
service laboratory so they're not

3295
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:16,910
actually growing the plants and but yeah

3296
02:27:13,898 --> 02:27:18,799
it's fantastic work it's

3297
02:27:16,909 --> 02:27:20,389
there there the neighborhood folks are

3298
02:27:18,799 --> 02:27:24,199
doing some really interesting stuff

3299
02:27:20,389 --> 02:27:28,489
I like poster so much it's up in my

3300
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:32,360
living room wall one-and-a-half meters

3301
02:27:28,489 --> 02:27:36,139
by 2 meters well for I mean you know

3302
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:37,520
it's this this is the it's the same kind

3303
02:27:36,139 --> 02:27:41,510
of it's the extension of the work that

3304
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:43,189
you started so long ago really Sam that

3305
02:27:41,510 --> 02:27:45,739
maybe that's why I love it

3306
02:27:43,189 --> 02:27:48,739
yeah I think it's you know it's very

3307
02:27:45,739 --> 02:27:51,409
very simpatico and I you know we got to

3308
02:27:48,739 --> 02:27:52,760
give credit to the founding fathers I

3309
02:27:51,409 --> 02:27:53,989
think without your work and your

3310
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:55,639
teachings I don't think a lot of the

3311
02:27:53,989 --> 02:28:04,430
neighbor work even would be where it is

3312
02:27:55,639 --> 02:28:06,648
but you know well science right yes we

3313
02:28:04,430 --> 02:28:11,120
all stand on giants and I'm glad they

3314
02:28:06,648 --> 02:28:12,619
picked up the torch yeah they really

3315
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:14,960
have taken to the next level though

3316
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:16,340
there's some there's some more

3317
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:19,819
interesting things that are coming in

3318
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:25,710
the pipeline so maybe we'll see that at

3319
02:28:19,819 --> 02:28:28,469
next year's ICRS yeah we want

3320
02:28:25,709 --> 02:28:31,169
to agree with Ryan as well Sam thank you

3321
02:28:28,469 --> 02:28:34,139
so much for you know your foundation and

3322
02:28:31,170 --> 02:28:37,710
getting us to this point was probably a

3323
02:28:34,139 --> 02:28:41,010
lot of rocky roads a lot of dark closets

3324
02:28:37,709 --> 02:28:43,049
a lot of black market industries thank

3325
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:46,139
you so much for bringing it forward for

3326
02:28:43,049 --> 02:28:50,728
all of us to learn from well Sam shows

3327
02:28:46,139 --> 02:28:52,648
that you can you can breach the the the

3328
02:28:50,728 --> 02:28:55,590
legal side from the dark side you know I

3329
02:28:52,648 --> 02:28:59,760
mean well that is the future of cannabis

3330
02:28:55,590 --> 02:29:03,540
is legal and everybody's kind of change

3331
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:05,068
over you can't you can't keep doing the

3332
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:07,080
same old things that everybody's learned

3333
02:29:05,068 --> 02:29:08,818
in the in the last 20 years and we've

3334
02:29:07,079 --> 02:29:13,170
got to you know come into the light as

3335
02:29:08,818 --> 02:29:15,448
it were well thank you use them for

3336
02:29:13,170 --> 02:29:17,040
illuminating that path because I feel

3337
02:29:15,449 --> 02:29:18,479
like a lot of us wouldn't be here doing

3338
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:21,060
the work that we're doing if it wasn't

3339
02:29:18,478 --> 02:29:23,549
for you so thanks for pioneering through

3340
02:29:21,059 --> 02:29:25,738
the dark times and being the crazy one

3341
02:29:23,549 --> 02:29:28,738
I'm sure to a lot of people and finally

3342
02:29:25,738 --> 02:29:32,609
coming old 30 years ago was to bring

3343
02:29:28,738 --> 02:29:35,189
science on to cannabis and to bring

3344
02:29:32,609 --> 02:29:39,470
cannabis back into Western mainstream

3345
02:29:35,189 --> 02:29:41,520
medicine and we've done it a lot and

3346
02:29:39,469 --> 02:29:43,438
some of the companies are not

3347
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:46,890
particularly loved that are leading the

3348
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:50,010
path like GW Pharmaceuticals but they

3349
02:29:46,889 --> 02:29:57,090
allowed everybody to approach this with

3350
02:29:50,010 --> 02:29:58,170
a science proof that this is working and

3351
02:29:57,090 --> 02:29:59,520
now we actually get to have the

3352
02:29:58,170 --> 02:30:02,040
conversations around it with some

3353
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:04,470
quantifiable evidence and move forward

3354
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:06,390
which is huge so one of the things that

3355
02:30:04,469 --> 02:30:08,099
I think people need to recognize is in

3356
02:30:06,389 --> 02:30:11,039
order for that research to happen you do

3357
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:13,559
need funding so at least we've had some

3358
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:15,660
people including yourself you know be

3359
02:30:13,559 --> 02:30:18,629
there for the right reasons at doing

3360
02:30:15,659 --> 02:30:20,609
that research so we could be here so we

3361
02:30:18,629 --> 02:30:24,389
can talk to the moms so we can talk to

3362
02:30:20,609 --> 02:30:27,500
the doctors so we can continue to move

3363
02:30:24,389 --> 02:30:30,349
forward instead of be stuck in

3364
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:33,540
legislation or just you know not having

3365
02:30:30,350 --> 02:30:35,850
memories cause so much is because when

3366
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:38,980
you do research and development you

3367
02:30:35,850 --> 02:30:41,771
research all these different I

3368
02:30:38,979 --> 02:30:44,350
and issues and whether if you're lucky

3369
02:30:41,771 --> 02:30:48,641
one out of ten comes to fruit Asian and

3370
02:30:44,351 --> 02:30:52,000
leads to a pack that is economically

3371
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:55,029
viable so you have to spend so much

3372
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,521
money to get to that point that you have

3373
02:30:55,030 --> 02:31:05,891
no comprehension not spent millions and

3374
02:30:57,521 --> 02:31:07,480
millions and millions and and I I didn't

3375
02:31:05,890 --> 02:31:17,199
make that much in the end

3376
02:31:07,479 --> 02:31:19,539
I bent it and thank you also yes thank

3377
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:22,391
you Sam also for still coming out every

3378
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:24,580
Sunday and also on Todd's new show every

3379
02:31:22,390 --> 02:31:27,129
Saturday and spreading your knowledge

3380
02:31:24,579 --> 02:31:29,351
it's it's important to carry this

3381
02:31:27,129 --> 02:31:32,560
conversation on and we really appreciate

3382
02:31:29,351 --> 02:31:35,230
you spending time with us and teaching

3383
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:38,140
us and listening to us also and yeah

3384
02:31:35,229 --> 02:31:41,079
it's it's it's an honor to be on the

3385
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:45,850
panel with you well there's more and

3386
02:31:41,079 --> 02:31:51,190
more educated cannabis folks and we all

3387
02:31:45,851 --> 02:31:54,460
can learn from each other and I some

3388
02:31:51,190 --> 02:31:57,340
issues I was first but there's plenty of

3389
02:31:54,459 --> 02:32:03,850
other issues where I'm just as amazed as

3390
02:31:57,340 --> 02:32:05,560
all of you when I hear about it that's

3391
02:32:03,851 --> 02:32:08,141
the beauty of cannabis in and of itself

3392
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:09,670
is it's bridging it's it's making those

3393
02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:13,090
connections it's sharing that knowledge

3394
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:15,219
it reminds me in a way of like mycelium

3395
02:32:13,090 --> 02:32:16,601
you know it's this beautiful network and

3396
02:32:15,219 --> 02:32:20,549
we're at this time we're all

3397
02:32:16,601 --> 02:32:20,550
reconnecting it's really cool

3398
02:32:26,511 --> 02:32:39,001
where's Marcus now that we need him he's

3399
02:32:38,251 --> 02:32:41,819
on island time

3400
02:32:39,001 --> 02:32:47,671
come on rep you know we'd have a Marcus

3401
02:32:41,819 --> 02:32:49,829
but we have a mark can I ask you some

3402
02:32:47,671 --> 02:32:55,079
what was like one of the craziest things

3403
02:32:49,829 --> 02:32:57,450
that you've seen in your career on what

3404
02:32:55,079 --> 02:33:03,511
aspect I've seen too many crazy things

3405
02:32:57,450 --> 02:33:05,641
from my life how the windows when

3406
02:33:03,511 --> 02:33:09,620
somebody knocked on the door they just

3407
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:10,859
jumped right out the window oh my god

3408
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:14,870
really

3409
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:19,079
when was this and why the 60s because

3410
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:21,181
60s cannabis was fairly serious but

3411
02:33:19,079 --> 02:33:24,390
better at the police came to your

3412
02:33:21,181 --> 02:33:27,870
facility but not facility I mean your

3413
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:30,539
home where you lived and found cannabis

3414
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:34,440
they could basically trash your entire

3415
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:40,230
house all your property and your your

3416
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:43,711
persona also oh my god it just it blows

3417
02:33:40,229 --> 02:33:46,079
my mind it's just such a contrast to

3418
02:33:43,710 --> 02:33:47,550
what I feel is like right and now it's I

3419
02:33:46,079 --> 02:33:51,751
just feel those people must feel like

3420
02:33:47,550 --> 02:33:53,640
such idiots for it's just missing for me

3421
02:33:51,751 --> 02:33:58,110
[ __ ] like it just blow their mind I

3422
02:33:53,640 --> 02:34:01,140
think they were doing what was perceived

3423
02:33:58,110 --> 02:34:03,540
in their minds as their jobs which was

3424
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:07,409
you know you stopped being dangerous

3425
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:10,320
narcotics and cannabis was officially

3426
02:34:07,409 --> 02:34:13,921
one of those yeah I mean in the media

3427
02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:17,011
anyways in your experience when was that

3428
02:34:13,921 --> 02:34:19,560
turning point like what shifted what

3429
02:34:17,011 --> 02:34:24,171
started to bring that back around to

3430
02:34:19,560 --> 02:34:27,449
maybe we should read really look the

3431
02:34:24,171 --> 02:34:30,360
medicalization of cannabis to really

3432
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:33,690
change and also Industrial helped help

3433
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:37,290
to a lesser degree but once people were

3434
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:38,710
and children were sick and being helped

3435
02:34:37,290 --> 02:34:40,720
by cannabis

3436
02:34:38,709 --> 02:34:43,899
you just couldn't keep it down anymore

3437
02:34:40,719 --> 02:34:46,420
it was you know but the whole war on

3438
02:34:43,899 --> 02:34:49,959
cannabis took a whole bunch of issues to

3439
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:52,870
end I mean and things to make it

3440
02:34:49,959 --> 02:34:55,750
impossible for the authorities to win no

3441
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:59,170
number one might have been artificial

3442
02:34:55,750 --> 02:35:01,149
lights that made it impossible for the

3443
02:34:59,170 --> 02:35:03,610
authorities just stop all cannabis

3444
02:35:01,149 --> 02:35:07,239
production the other thing might have

3445
02:35:03,610 --> 02:35:10,030
been seeds and clothes once clones were

3446
02:35:07,239 --> 02:35:12,728
able to be passed around then you could

3447
02:35:10,030 --> 02:35:15,570
grow the best of the best instead of

3448
02:35:12,728 --> 02:35:19,359
just an average version of cannabis and

3449
02:35:15,569 --> 02:35:23,409
that made a big difference also so you

3450
02:35:19,360 --> 02:35:26,140
know clones seeds artificial lights made

3451
02:35:23,409 --> 02:35:29,200
it so the war on cannabis was impossible

3452
02:35:26,139 --> 02:35:35,189
to win but it still took another 30 35

3453
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:38,020
40 years for them to really admit that I

3454
02:35:35,190 --> 02:35:41,970
have a question that you know is

3455
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:45,850
something that you know I'm looking into

3456
02:35:41,969 --> 02:35:49,059
historically and also you know at at the

3457
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:50,860
crossroads that we are at cannabis and

3458
02:35:49,059 --> 02:35:54,129
we were talking about bridging earlier

3459
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:57,720
and I'm just wondering how we can now

3460
02:35:54,129 --> 02:36:01,239
that it's coming in to legalization and

3461
02:35:57,719 --> 02:36:03,069
recreational as a namesake you know

3462
02:36:01,239 --> 02:36:04,959
there is going to be more funding that's

3463
02:36:03,069 --> 02:36:07,360
put into science there is going to be

3464
02:36:04,959 --> 02:36:08,799
more isolates that are being made we're

3465
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:11,920
going to be able to look at it in a

3466
02:36:08,799 --> 02:36:15,250
really different way how can we bridge

3467
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:16,870
the knowledge of you know people that

3468
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:18,700
have been working with this plant for

3469
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:21,370
forty years and all of their

3470
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:23,860
observational techniques as well as

3471
02:36:21,370 --> 02:36:26,320
their growing practices and what they've

3472
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:29,940
learned and and then bridge it with

3473
02:36:26,319 --> 02:36:33,520
modern science seems to me that in

3474
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:38,380
history you know with health of humans

3475
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:41,100
or or and in modern medicine there just

3476
02:36:38,379 --> 02:36:43,420
seems to be more of a separation of

3477
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:45,430
these things you know there's the

3478
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:49,478
medical version and then there's oh that

3479
02:36:45,430 --> 02:36:52,158
other you know ideology of traditional

3480
02:36:49,478 --> 02:36:57,349
and I feel like we have a wonderful

3481
02:36:52,158 --> 02:37:01,218
opportunity right now with cannabis to

3482
02:36:57,350 --> 02:37:02,119
bridge those two and I'm just wondering

3483
02:37:01,218 --> 02:37:03,498
how we're going to be able to move

3484
02:37:02,119 --> 02:37:05,659
forward because this this whole

3485
02:37:03,498 --> 02:37:09,770
conversation it really is about you know

3486
02:37:05,658 --> 02:37:13,998
bridging modern science with with this

3487
02:37:09,770 --> 02:37:22,119
conversation yeah how how is that going

3488
02:37:13,998 --> 02:37:25,158
to happen I'm not really exactly sure

3489
02:37:22,119 --> 02:37:29,929
how to answer a question like that

3490
02:37:25,158 --> 02:37:34,208
because I mean cannabis has been used

3491
02:37:29,929 --> 02:37:37,279
medicinally for thousands of years and

3492
02:37:34,209 --> 02:37:40,088
I'm not exactly sure

3493
02:37:37,279 --> 02:37:43,759
I mean modern science also doesn't

3494
02:37:40,088 --> 02:37:48,109
confirm what we've been saying over and

3495
02:37:43,759 --> 02:37:51,168
over over and I believe I'm a believer

3496
02:37:48,109 --> 02:37:53,719
in modern science but it's really nice

3497
02:37:51,168 --> 02:37:59,718
when they're able to prove what we've

3498
02:37:53,718 --> 02:38:02,988
already already known for me for 50

3499
02:37:59,718 --> 02:38:06,678
years and for many others for thousands

3500
02:38:02,988 --> 02:38:08,359
of years I think it just in my opinion I

3501
02:38:06,679 --> 02:38:11,148
think it really comes down to having

3502
02:38:08,359 --> 02:38:13,578
those conversations person a person so

3503
02:38:11,148 --> 02:38:15,139
being brave enough to have that

3504
02:38:13,578 --> 02:38:17,208
discussion in the first place I think

3505
02:38:15,139 --> 02:38:20,448
that's what breaks taboo and I also

3506
02:38:17,209 --> 02:38:22,489
think it's what really just I don't like

3507
02:38:20,449 --> 02:38:26,838
the term normalizes but at least makes

3508
02:38:22,488 --> 02:38:28,520
it more acceptable so the more we hear

3509
02:38:26,838 --> 02:38:30,318
about it you know we're hearing about it

3510
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:32,838
in the media now law we're hearing about

3511
02:38:30,318 --> 02:38:34,818
it from people that are advocating we're

3512
02:38:32,838 --> 02:38:37,068
also hearing about it from people like

3513
02:38:34,818 --> 02:38:39,139
Hillary's grandma you know who's just

3514
02:38:37,068 --> 02:38:42,038
had such an incredible experience with

3515
02:38:39,139 --> 02:38:44,838
it that she can't help but share and in

3516
02:38:42,039 --> 02:38:46,520
just my humble opinion I think that's

3517
02:38:44,838 --> 02:38:48,228
really what's gonna make the difference

3518
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:50,629
and that's what's going to bridge those

3519
02:38:48,228 --> 02:38:53,538
worlds is continually talking about it

3520
02:38:50,629 --> 02:38:58,909
engaging in that discourse exposing

3521
02:38:53,539 --> 02:39:01,520
yourself in ways just to be that I know

3522
02:38:58,908 --> 02:39:03,828
I I sound so cliche at this point but

3523
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:06,020
really like be the change be the person

3524
02:39:03,828 --> 02:39:08,389
that doesn't look like

3525
02:39:06,020 --> 02:39:10,819
you're stigmatized stoner that can have

3526
02:39:08,389 --> 02:39:13,358
an intellectual conversation including

3527
02:39:10,818 --> 02:39:16,068
research alongside some beautiful

3528
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:18,399
anecdotal evidence and some stories I

3529
02:39:16,068 --> 02:39:20,568
find that that's been the best

3530
02:39:18,398 --> 02:39:23,809
game-changer for me it's it's gotten me

3531
02:39:20,568 --> 02:39:25,158
out of being arrested so just having

3532
02:39:23,809 --> 02:39:28,038
that conversation talking about my

3533
02:39:25,158 --> 02:39:30,648
grandma for example like one of the

3534
02:39:28,039 --> 02:39:32,029
local police officers were literally

3535
02:39:30,648 --> 02:39:35,328
handcuffed on the side of the road on

3536
02:39:32,029 --> 02:39:37,250
Thanksgiving three years ago and the one

3537
02:39:35,328 --> 02:39:39,709
cop was like totally not feeling it and

3538
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:41,270
the other one we started talking about

3539
02:39:39,709 --> 02:39:42,978
my grandma started talking about how I'm

3540
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:45,319
a medical patient that they can look at

3541
02:39:42,978 --> 02:39:48,559
my dispensary cards I've got my I've got

3542
02:39:45,318 --> 02:39:50,209
a digital endorsement from a doctor and

3543
02:39:48,559 --> 02:39:52,219
once we started talking about it I

3544
02:39:50,209 --> 02:39:54,559
realized that not only are you know

3545
02:39:52,219 --> 02:39:57,769
authorities misinformed but if they

3546
02:39:54,559 --> 02:40:00,350
don't necessarily seek understanding the

3547
02:39:57,770 --> 02:40:02,869
law themselves it's not laid out for

3548
02:40:00,350 --> 02:40:04,789
them in plain language so being that

3549
02:40:02,869 --> 02:40:07,159
person that doesn't you know that

3550
02:40:04,789 --> 02:40:09,050
doesn't fit that stigma being able to

3551
02:40:07,158 --> 02:40:11,600
carry through that conversation I think

3552
02:40:09,049 --> 02:40:19,809
that's what chefs cultures and that's

3553
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:23,270
what what bridges worlds the elders and

3554
02:40:19,809 --> 02:40:25,578
younger people and and are getting some

3555
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:29,300
of the most amazing results it feels

3556
02:40:25,578 --> 02:40:32,930
like sometimes I mean we've you know

3557
02:40:29,299 --> 02:40:35,118
seeing youth that have epilepsy have

3558
02:40:32,930 --> 02:40:37,670
that I've done everything that that

3559
02:40:35,119 --> 02:40:40,850
medical system has to offer for their

3560
02:40:37,670 --> 02:40:44,689
whole entire life and literally one day

3561
02:40:40,850 --> 02:40:45,949
after taking but you know some oils or

3562
02:40:44,689 --> 02:40:49,670
things that we've made they're just

3563
02:40:45,949 --> 02:40:54,739
completely gone and then stay gone for

3564
02:40:49,670 --> 02:40:56,840
so long and maybe it's I don't know they

3565
02:40:54,738 --> 02:40:58,100
maybe they're more you know open or

3566
02:40:56,840 --> 02:40:59,750
something but there's there's amazing

3567
02:40:58,100 --> 02:41:03,859
results and I think that's what propels

3568
02:40:59,750 --> 02:41:06,529
us forward more than anything as results

3569
02:41:03,859 --> 02:41:09,710
when it comes to you know health and

3570
02:41:06,529 --> 02:41:11,930
well-being yeah and it will be nice if

3571
02:41:09,709 --> 02:41:13,639
science you know is able to take those

3572
02:41:11,930 --> 02:41:15,529
results that so many people have been

3573
02:41:13,639 --> 02:41:18,590
working with cannabis you know in the

3574
02:41:15,529 --> 02:41:19,640
black market for so long you know it

3575
02:41:18,590 --> 02:41:21,590
would be nice if the

3576
02:41:19,639 --> 02:41:23,090
results were able to come forward and I

3577
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:25,908
guess you know what you were talking

3578
02:41:23,090 --> 02:41:27,049
about you know continue talking to one

3579
02:41:25,908 --> 02:41:29,779
another I just think that it's really

3580
02:41:27,049 --> 02:41:31,658
important because I have a lot of

3581
02:41:29,779 --> 02:41:33,949
friends who have been working with

3582
02:41:31,658 --> 02:41:37,369
concentrates of cannabis for a really

3583
02:41:33,949 --> 02:41:39,079
long time you know 40 years and their

3584
02:41:37,370 --> 02:41:40,819
results and what they're doing is is

3585
02:41:39,079 --> 02:41:42,109
really really amazing but maybe their

3586
02:41:40,818 --> 02:41:44,209
stories they're never going to be heard

3587
02:41:42,109 --> 02:41:46,818
because science is like oh we got it

3588
02:41:44,209 --> 02:41:48,648
from here you know we're good we got it

3589
02:41:46,818 --> 02:41:50,629
from here and that's a little bit of my

3590
02:41:48,648 --> 02:41:53,689
concern because then that isn't looking

3591
02:41:50,629 --> 02:41:54,889
at the plant as a holistic view and what

3592
02:41:53,689 --> 02:41:57,470
we're learning from it

3593
02:41:54,889 --> 02:42:00,139
that's just isolating yet another part

3594
02:41:57,469 --> 02:42:02,119
of it and and I think that you know

3595
02:42:00,139 --> 02:42:05,898
having these conversations is imperative

3596
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:09,199
to you know the the future of the plant

3597
02:42:05,898 --> 02:42:11,000
and the integrity of the plant tobacco

3598
02:42:09,199 --> 02:42:12,319
to happen with Gonzo's basically what

3599
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:15,859
we're saying I mean that's my biggest

3600
02:42:12,318 --> 02:42:19,068
fear backhoes a master plant used it by

3601
02:42:15,859 --> 02:42:22,488
shamans all over the world for spiritual

3602
02:42:19,068 --> 02:42:25,340
awakenings but most of the tobacco that

3603
02:42:22,488 --> 02:42:28,939
we've been exposed to here is just crap

3604
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:31,908
with chemicals in it so I think that's

3605
02:42:28,939 --> 02:42:35,389
the biggest part of what we've been

3606
02:42:31,908 --> 02:42:37,340
doing is not only you know looking at

3607
02:42:35,389 --> 02:42:39,260
the science of the finished product but

3608
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:43,068
also what goes into it because there's a

3609
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:44,930
huge impact that goes into the

3610
02:42:43,068 --> 02:42:47,420
production of the medicine so what we've

3611
02:42:44,930 --> 02:42:50,238
been working on in a huge way and all

3612
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:51,710
this expansion is to keep what good you

3613
02:42:50,238 --> 02:42:53,539
know if you've ever looked at the map

3614
02:42:51,709 --> 02:42:55,398
that you make like if you have a product

3615
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:57,109
here and every little piece that comes

3616
02:42:55,398 --> 02:43:00,738
off all the embedded energy that goes

3617
02:42:57,109 --> 02:43:04,040
into that we're taking on the production

3618
02:43:00,738 --> 02:43:07,158
of it and that production of it goes

3619
02:43:04,040 --> 02:43:10,120
from the farm and it starts even before

3620
02:43:07,158 --> 02:43:14,000
the farm and the inputs and we're

3621
02:43:10,120 --> 02:43:18,800
utilizing this this moment of expansion

3622
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:20,449
to you know it's clean our earth at the

3623
02:43:18,799 --> 02:43:22,340
same time as because the purpose of

3624
02:43:20,449 --> 02:43:24,050
growing the Ganj is to heal the human

3625
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:26,540
but the human can't be healthy with

3626
02:43:24,049 --> 02:43:29,539
without a healthy environment so it just

3627
02:43:26,540 --> 02:43:32,000
it's a it's a full circle Flower of Life

3628
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:33,051
spectrum like look at it so we can't we

3629
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:35,661
talk about

3630
02:43:33,050 --> 02:43:37,520
all aspects of it and we're feeling

3631
02:43:35,661 --> 02:43:40,569
pretty blessed and lucky right now that

3632
02:43:37,521 --> 02:43:44,331
a lot of farmers and production farms

3633
02:43:40,569 --> 02:43:46,640
recreational or medicinal are really

3634
02:43:44,331 --> 02:43:48,860
really interested in producing it from

3635
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:50,720
an ecological standpoint and also you

3636
02:43:48,860 --> 02:43:52,490
know it's interesting we talk a lot and

3637
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:56,300
the conversation has been a lot about

3638
02:43:52,490 --> 02:43:58,640
you know how healthy cannabis is but

3639
02:43:56,300 --> 02:44:02,149
often we're not talking about how to

3640
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:04,490
make healthy cannabis and you know

3641
02:44:02,149 --> 02:44:08,421
cannabis is only as healthy as it's

3642
02:44:04,490 --> 02:44:11,271
grown so yes I think about lots of its

3643
02:44:08,421 --> 02:44:14,271
cannabinoids and what they all do but if

3644
02:44:11,271 --> 02:44:16,311
they're not grown in a healthy manner

3645
02:44:14,271 --> 02:44:20,871
then they're just simply not healthy for

3646
02:44:16,310 --> 02:44:24,081
us the potency of it if the potency is

3647
02:44:20,870 --> 02:44:26,090
all spectrums are building in the life

3648
02:44:24,081 --> 02:44:27,649
and health of our environment and our

3649
02:44:26,091 --> 02:44:29,899
well-being then that's the that's the

3650
02:44:27,649 --> 02:44:31,880
goal so if we have to look at the goal

3651
02:44:29,899 --> 02:44:33,740
the goal isn't to flush everything out

3652
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:36,200
to make it clean enough to make it to

3653
02:44:33,740 --> 02:44:38,479
where we can ingest it I mean it's done

3654
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:40,790
and if it's done there it is it's done

3655
02:44:38,479 --> 02:44:42,950
but I don't see it as a goal I see

3656
02:44:40,790 --> 02:44:44,600
because then where is it flush to and

3657
02:44:42,950 --> 02:44:46,700
then what's the life after that you know

3658
02:44:44,601 --> 02:44:49,341
we don't know because you can say you do

3659
02:44:46,700 --> 02:44:51,670
know but anyway having a you know the

3660
02:44:49,341 --> 02:44:54,831
natural process all the way through is

3661
02:44:51,671 --> 02:44:56,300
is really really crucial and I think it

3662
02:44:54,831 --> 02:45:00,531
takes a voice to bring people's

3663
02:44:56,300 --> 02:45:03,680
awareness to it totally one note on that

3664
02:45:00,531 --> 02:45:05,841
just as a reflection also the health of

3665
02:45:03,681 --> 02:45:08,031
the person that's growing the plant you

3666
02:45:05,841 --> 02:45:10,190
know if we have someone that is Candida

3667
02:45:08,031 --> 02:45:12,711
ridden I can imagine that their plants

3668
02:45:10,190 --> 02:45:15,471
might have mold issues for example I

3669
02:45:12,710 --> 02:45:17,600
feel like there's this it's a it's a

3670
02:45:15,470 --> 02:45:19,479
resonant vibration and it's also you

3671
02:45:17,601 --> 02:45:23,121
know it's a it's an environmental

3672
02:45:19,479 --> 02:45:24,591
mirroring so I feel like also you want

3673
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:27,109
to make sure that if you're growing

3674
02:45:24,591 --> 02:45:28,701
you're healthy from the inside out part

3675
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:30,501
of the problem of the chronic disease

3676
02:45:28,700 --> 02:45:33,109
that we're in at this moment is the

3677
02:45:30,501 --> 02:45:34,940
transformation of our food and the

3678
02:45:33,110 --> 02:45:37,940
transformation of our seat away from

3679
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:42,501
it's a race well yeah a way from its

3680
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:45,471
original setting wheat that was eaten in

3681
02:45:42,501 --> 02:45:46,250
Sumeria or the the Fertile Crescent is

3682
02:45:45,470 --> 02:45:49,189
not the same

3683
02:45:46,250 --> 02:45:51,290
is now you know so and in the course of

3684
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:52,790
that change in that hybridization some

3685
02:45:51,290 --> 02:45:55,580
of it was natural and really positive

3686
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:58,400
but other parts of it have affected our

3687
02:45:55,579 --> 02:46:02,780
ability to process it which is led into

3688
02:45:58,399 --> 02:46:04,760
immune diseases and what we're looking

3689
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:09,050
at that was how to repair that you know

3690
02:46:04,760 --> 02:46:11,180
how to to move away from that that cycle

3691
02:46:09,049 --> 02:46:14,959
and I think the best way to do it is to

3692
02:46:11,180 --> 02:46:16,850
just stay as far away from them as

3693
02:46:14,959 --> 02:46:19,219
possible in the production of everything

3694
02:46:16,850 --> 02:46:21,530
that we're doing yeah so we always say

3695
02:46:19,219 --> 02:46:23,659
seed to seed a lot of people say seed to

3696
02:46:21,530 --> 02:46:25,640
sale but I think that it's really

3697
02:46:23,659 --> 02:46:27,649
important that it's seed to seed because

3698
02:46:25,639 --> 02:46:29,629
we can talk about healthy cannabis and

3699
02:46:27,649 --> 02:46:31,850
that you know or we can talk about how

3700
02:46:29,629 --> 02:46:33,649
healthy cannabis is for you but it's

3701
02:46:31,850 --> 02:46:36,979
important to talk about healthy cannabis

3702
02:46:33,649 --> 02:46:39,529
as well because you know we can isolate

3703
02:46:36,979 --> 02:46:41,539
a wheat grain and we can say all these

3704
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:43,790
wonderful things that you know this

3705
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:45,350
particular wheat grain has for you but

3706
02:46:43,790 --> 02:46:47,660
we're not at all looking at the way that

3707
02:46:45,350 --> 02:46:48,470
the wheat grain was grown and also and

3708
02:46:47,659 --> 02:46:50,059
that's important

3709
02:46:48,469 --> 02:46:52,760
some of the inputs that have gone into

3710
02:46:50,059 --> 02:46:54,649
the soils that we know use those inputs

3711
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:56,930
are different and now it's affecting our

3712
02:46:54,649 --> 02:46:59,959
soil microbiology and its ability to

3713
02:46:56,930 --> 02:47:02,630
process nutrients which is just a

3714
02:46:59,959 --> 02:47:04,639
challenge so you have to be able to get

3715
02:47:02,629 --> 02:47:08,029
soil testing to be able to know if your

3716
02:47:04,639 --> 02:47:09,979
inputs are working properly and you know

3717
02:47:08,030 --> 02:47:12,950
that's a lab in itself too so there's

3718
02:47:09,979 --> 02:47:15,709
soil labs there's cannabis terpene labs

3719
02:47:12,950 --> 02:47:17,510
it turns into like a lot of labs all of

3720
02:47:15,709 --> 02:47:22,009
a sudden to back what you already know

3721
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:25,630
really yeah in this modern way of you

3722
02:47:22,010 --> 02:47:28,520
know scrutinize ation of medicine I mean

3723
02:47:25,629 --> 02:47:30,049
food would be affected greatly as they

3724
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:37,310
had to get laboratory tests to do it

3725
02:47:30,049 --> 02:47:39,979
this way well we never did our own soil

3726
02:47:37,309 --> 02:47:42,019
testing we we sent that out to a

3727
02:47:39,979 --> 02:47:46,969
professional AG lab here in the

3728
02:47:42,020 --> 02:47:49,970
Netherlands but I always tested my soils

3729
02:47:46,969 --> 02:47:53,539
i've always tested my water i've always

3730
02:47:49,969 --> 02:47:56,689
tested my this was either for organic or

3731
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:59,630
any farming or for cannabis cultivation

3732
02:47:56,690 --> 02:48:03,489
and i really

3733
02:47:59,629 --> 02:48:08,059
believe in the science of cannabis and

3734
02:48:03,489 --> 02:48:11,059
gas chromatography in HPLC analytical

3735
02:48:08,059 --> 02:48:16,659
chemistry I mean that is the foundation

3736
02:48:11,059 --> 02:48:19,519
of modern cannabis and it's medicines

3737
02:48:16,659 --> 02:48:24,170
I'm excited now that both worlds are

3738
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:26,979
being recognized as valid and yeah again

3739
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:29,478
that the bridge just happened it's so

3740
02:48:26,978 --> 02:48:37,489
inspiring it's so exciting to be here at

3741
02:48:29,478 --> 02:48:39,438
this time and be a part of this we

3742
02:48:37,489 --> 02:48:40,969
totally agree we think that it's you

3743
02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:43,970
know it's it's a wonderful time to be

3744
02:48:40,969 --> 02:48:45,829
alive for cannabis and I feel like the

3745
02:48:43,969 --> 02:48:47,779
most important thing that you know I

3746
02:48:45,829 --> 02:48:50,600
personally can offer because we can only

3747
02:48:47,780 --> 02:48:54,200
really talk you know from our from

3748
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:57,710
ourselves is that you know I can aw or a

3749
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:59,270
voice she would like to be represented

3750
02:48:57,709 --> 02:49:01,309
and and she meaning that you know

3751
02:48:59,270 --> 02:49:03,380
primarily you know it's a feminine parts

3752
02:49:01,309 --> 02:49:07,189
of plant that we're using and the energy

3753
02:49:03,379 --> 02:49:09,438
of the plant is feminine but yeah and I

3754
02:49:07,189 --> 02:49:12,170
think that if we each go out into the

3755
02:49:09,439 --> 02:49:14,720
world and are a good voice for the plant

3756
02:49:12,170 --> 02:49:17,030
then it's going to move this plant

3757
02:49:14,719 --> 02:49:24,829
forward in a way that you know it needs

3758
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:27,860
to go I'm in favor of cannabis

3759
02:49:24,829 --> 02:49:30,920
normalization and I presume that means

3760
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:31,640
to be taxed and regulated by the

3761
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:34,600
government

3762
02:49:31,639 --> 02:49:37,010
if you're involved in the sale of it and

3763
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:44,780
whether that be for medicinal or

3764
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:47,000
recreational purposes but I also AM been

3765
02:49:44,780 --> 02:49:49,550
around long enough to realize that if

3766
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:53,000
you look at who owns the world it's

3767
02:49:49,549 --> 02:49:56,389
mostly bankers and lawyers that own all

3768
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:59,120
of the big businesses out there and I

3769
02:49:56,389 --> 02:50:02,389
presume it'll be with Gerardus too but

3770
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:04,729
as long as it's legal for the rest of us

3771
02:50:02,389 --> 02:50:07,609
to boutique it if you want to sell small

3772
02:50:04,728 --> 02:50:10,069
amounts or large amounts whatever and do

3773
02:50:07,610 --> 02:50:12,450
it in in a way that we care about like

3774
02:50:10,069 --> 02:50:16,500
craft beer or something like that

3775
02:50:12,450 --> 02:50:18,150
then I I'm in favor of it and also for

3776
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:20,190
people if they want to grow their own

3777
02:50:18,149 --> 02:50:22,619
personal use it they should just be left

3778
02:50:20,190 --> 02:50:28,440
alone if they want to sell it then it

3779
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:30,870
should be taxed or regulated so that was

3780
02:50:28,440 --> 02:50:33,659
a nice conversation we were all having

3781
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:36,271
here but I just want to jump in with a

3782
02:50:33,659 --> 02:50:39,329
question from the chat someone was

3783
02:50:36,271 --> 02:50:43,110
asking if we had any experience working

3784
02:50:39,329 --> 02:50:45,390
with cannabis and pets and Selina you

3785
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:48,569
had mentioned last week that you did

3786
02:50:45,390 --> 02:50:49,799
some work with cannabis and horses did

3787
02:50:48,569 --> 02:50:51,659
you want to talk a little bit about that

3788
02:50:49,799 --> 02:50:54,719
and whoever else has some experience

3789
02:50:51,659 --> 02:50:56,819
they want to share yeah I'd be honored

3790
02:50:54,719 --> 02:51:00,899
so we had one horse that we worked with

3791
02:50:56,819 --> 02:51:02,431
and we worked with her owner this worse

3792
02:51:00,899 --> 02:51:05,909
that actually had an unfortunate

3793
02:51:02,431 --> 02:51:08,730
accident where she got her leg caught in

3794
02:51:05,909 --> 02:51:13,110
a fence and had a wound that wasn't

3795
02:51:08,729 --> 02:51:14,219
healing they had a vet come along they

3796
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:17,250
made some suggestions

3797
02:51:14,219 --> 02:51:19,379
they also saw us that weekend's ad alone

3798
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:22,649
this Expo so we have this really

3799
02:51:19,379 --> 02:51:25,229
beautiful SABS that is great for open

3800
02:51:22,649 --> 02:51:27,420
wound care and we suggested that these

3801
02:51:25,229 --> 02:51:29,270
that it contains frankincense myrrh and

3802
02:51:27,420 --> 02:51:32,040
lavender we make sure that we use

3803
02:51:29,271 --> 02:51:35,641
grapeseed oil as our base oil because

3804
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:37,920
it's animal and pet friendly and yeah

3805
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:41,369
from the feedback that we got healed up

3806
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:42,750
beautifully and no qualms the one

3807
02:51:41,370 --> 02:51:44,490
suggestion that we always have

3808
02:51:42,750 --> 02:51:47,549
especially with wound care and animals

3809
02:51:44,489 --> 02:51:49,409
in general especially to hugs is you

3810
02:51:47,549 --> 02:51:51,959
want to put that salve on the wound and

3811
02:51:49,409 --> 02:51:53,190
then take that dog for a walk so make

3812
02:51:51,959 --> 02:51:54,659
sure that you're getting them to be

3813
02:51:53,190 --> 02:51:56,040
active right after otherwise they're

3814
02:51:54,659 --> 02:51:59,010
gonna start looking at the wound and

3815
02:51:56,040 --> 02:52:01,280
because it does contain THC and

3816
02:51:59,010 --> 02:52:03,810
cannabinoids that can be potentially

3817
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:07,311
psychoactive we want to be mindful of

3818
02:52:03,810 --> 02:52:12,149
that so you can use it as a spray as a

3819
02:52:07,310 --> 02:52:13,681
salve we use drops primarily one of the

3820
02:52:12,149 --> 02:52:16,529
things that we have formulated is a

3821
02:52:13,681 --> 02:52:19,500
micro dose drop so we can accurately

3822
02:52:16,530 --> 02:52:25,021
dose or I believe our cvd drops are like

3823
02:52:19,500 --> 02:52:26,010
0.66 milligrams of CBD per drop RTC 10.8

3824
02:52:25,021 --> 02:52:28,500
- so

3825
02:52:26,010 --> 02:52:30,359
able to really accurately dose low dose

3826
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:32,370
and work out from there

3827
02:52:30,359 --> 02:52:36,479
we've helped animals from anything from

3828
02:52:32,370 --> 02:52:41,310
arthritic pain to seizures to end of

3829
02:52:36,478 --> 02:52:44,358
life care to helping in treating and

3830
02:52:41,309 --> 02:52:47,489
being a companion healer in the

3831
02:52:44,359 --> 02:52:51,120
treatment of cancers some successful

3832
02:52:47,489 --> 02:52:54,449
some not it's in the in the fact that

3833
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:57,149
the we had this beautiful I'm just gonna

3834
02:52:54,450 --> 02:53:02,000
tell the story is that okay I was like

3835
02:52:57,148 --> 02:53:04,349
oh if I just tell the story okay so

3836
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:07,500
there is this really beautiful dog that

3837
02:53:04,350 --> 02:53:10,290
we were helping and he had a type of

3838
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:12,350
cancer that started to just really

3839
02:53:10,290 --> 02:53:15,779
affect all of the soft tissue

3840
02:53:12,350 --> 02:53:17,700
his owner very heart center did

3841
02:53:15,779 --> 02:53:22,260
everything she possibly could to save

3842
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:24,270
her beautiful dog friends and it was

3843
02:53:22,260 --> 02:53:26,670
interesting because he had gone through

3844
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:28,649
some very invasive surgeries where they

3845
02:53:26,670 --> 02:53:31,260
had literally removed all of the tissue

3846
02:53:28,648 --> 02:53:35,358
except for the ligament and muscle so

3847
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:35,359
this dog had a lot of healing to do and

3848
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:42,059
so loved so loved by his guardian and I

3849
02:53:39,930 --> 02:53:45,029
she's just such a sweet person to my

3850
02:53:42,059 --> 02:53:47,239
heart what ended up happening was he was

3851
02:53:45,029 --> 02:53:49,770
able to recover to a certain extent and

3852
02:53:47,239 --> 02:53:51,930
the disease was progressing but it was

3853
02:53:49,770 --> 02:53:53,430
it wasn't as fast it wasn't his rapid

3854
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:55,859
what we were using at that point was a

3855
02:53:53,430 --> 02:53:58,109
one-to-one synergy oil so an even ratio

3856
02:53:55,859 --> 02:53:59,880
of THC the CBD and we were beginning to

3857
02:53:58,109 --> 02:54:02,640
ramp up and what we were noticing is

3858
02:53:59,879 --> 02:54:05,129
that this dog was beginning to get his

3859
02:54:02,639 --> 02:54:06,840
appetite back more playful again that

3860
02:54:05,129 --> 02:54:10,079
spark was coming back which was really

3861
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:13,380
exciting with this particular type of

3862
02:54:10,079 --> 02:54:16,109
cancer that he had there was also a

3863
02:54:13,379 --> 02:54:18,629
chance of heart failure so we had

3864
02:54:16,109 --> 02:54:22,290
instructed his guardian I don't call

3865
02:54:18,629 --> 02:54:25,108
animal owners I call them guardians cuz

3866
02:54:22,290 --> 02:54:28,439
Guardian had decided to go with a raw

3867
02:54:25,109 --> 02:54:32,579
food diet just lightly cooked and we

3868
02:54:28,439 --> 02:54:34,229
were using the flora to support the

3869
02:54:32,579 --> 02:54:37,079
prevention of this now it was something

3870
02:54:34,228 --> 02:54:39,898
that Steve and my colleague his mother

3871
02:54:37,079 --> 02:54:42,869
she's uh she's

3872
02:54:39,898 --> 02:54:45,510
fascinating longer the short of it she

3873
02:54:42,869 --> 02:54:47,609
was able to guide us in that she had had

3874
02:54:45,510 --> 02:54:50,550
the same experience with her dog and she

3875
02:54:47,609 --> 02:54:53,220
had given us the warning on this she

3876
02:54:50,549 --> 02:54:55,049
also works as a blood technician at an

3877
02:54:53,219 --> 02:54:57,418
animal blood bank so she has a lot of

3878
02:54:55,049 --> 02:55:00,208
experience firsthand with sick animals

3879
02:54:57,418 --> 02:55:02,340
and helping get them better but what

3880
02:55:00,209 --> 02:55:03,779
ended up happening was this beautiful

3881
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:06,449
dog got to a certain state of health

3882
02:55:03,779 --> 02:55:08,850
where he was happy-go-lucky and really

3883
02:55:06,449 --> 02:55:11,609
excitable and they were on one of their

3884
02:55:08,850 --> 02:55:14,578
regular walks and he spotted a deer and

3885
02:55:11,609 --> 02:55:16,918
he started chasing the deer and he ended

3886
02:55:14,578 --> 02:55:20,430
up going into cardiac arrest and she

3887
02:55:16,918 --> 02:55:22,559
heard him down just just down the gully

3888
02:55:20,430 --> 02:55:24,630
and she ran to him and he was having a

3889
02:55:22,559 --> 02:55:27,269
heart attack and I ended up passing in

3890
02:55:24,629 --> 02:55:30,599
her arms but the feedback that we got

3891
02:55:27,270 --> 02:55:32,640
was that she was so grateful that he had

3892
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:34,859
been able to maintain a state of health

3893
02:55:32,639 --> 02:55:37,439
where his quality of life was so good

3894
02:55:34,859 --> 02:55:39,748
that he was able to really enjoy those

3895
02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:41,550
last moments of his life doing exactly

3896
02:55:39,748 --> 02:55:43,289
what he had loved to do and he hadn't

3897
02:55:41,549 --> 02:55:46,228
chased a deer for months so it was like

3898
02:55:43,289 --> 02:55:48,329
a really big deal so as hard as it was

3899
02:55:46,228 --> 02:55:50,248
for her it was also such a blessing for

3900
02:55:48,328 --> 02:55:51,930
her to have cannabis as one of those

3901
02:55:50,248 --> 02:55:54,418
allies to help make things a little bit

3902
02:55:51,930 --> 02:55:55,859
easier and I can say this to cannabis

3903
02:55:54,418 --> 02:55:57,629
also helped her go through that

3904
02:55:55,859 --> 02:55:59,908
experience as a caregiver and as a

3905
02:55:57,629 --> 02:56:03,059
guardian watching someone she loved so

3906
02:55:59,908 --> 02:56:07,918
dearly and still does go through such an

3907
02:56:03,059 --> 02:56:09,600
invasive experience before he passed but

3908
02:56:07,918 --> 02:56:11,279
what I've seen is that cannabis can be

3909
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:13,770
applied in so many different ways for

3910
02:56:11,279 --> 02:56:16,619
animals and because animals don't have

3911
02:56:13,770 --> 02:56:19,709
these precognition zuv this is devil

3912
02:56:16,619 --> 02:56:22,350
drug or this evil plant or it's gonna

3913
02:56:19,709 --> 02:56:25,020
make me high or whatever they seem to

3914
02:56:22,350 --> 02:56:30,140
respond in my experience any way is

3915
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:37,319
better to the medicine wear of it baby

3916
02:56:30,139 --> 02:56:39,868
of course it's cannabis made so so it's

3917
02:56:37,318 --> 02:56:41,809
it's for us it's been a really beautiful

3918
02:56:39,869 --> 02:56:46,168
experience and we've been able to help

3919
02:56:41,809 --> 02:56:47,939
dogs cats with anxiety issues with so

3920
02:56:46,168 --> 02:56:49,738
many different things especially animals

3921
02:56:47,939 --> 02:56:51,180
that unfortunately have been you know

3922
02:56:49,738 --> 02:56:53,011
have been subjected to traumatic

3923
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:55,201
experiences it can help with that as

3924
02:56:53,011 --> 02:56:58,201
well just to alleviate that anxiety and

3925
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:59,430
those symptoms of you know where where

3926
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:01,979
they kind of lose control or they can

3927
02:56:59,431 --> 02:57:03,810
become aggressive we've had experience

3928
02:57:01,979 --> 02:57:07,171
actually with my mom she has two dogs

3929
02:57:03,810 --> 02:57:09,149
that both have epilepsy and we were able

3930
02:57:07,171 --> 02:57:13,110
to help get the seizures under control

3931
02:57:09,149 --> 02:57:16,710
several a day down to none within a week

3932
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:18,751
of using a low dose one two one drop I

3933
02:57:16,710 --> 02:57:20,670
think we were at I would say well

3934
02:57:18,751 --> 02:57:23,399
actually it was one milligram one of the

3935
02:57:20,671 --> 02:57:25,649
dogs was a boxer Gracie and the other

3936
02:57:23,399 --> 02:57:26,819
one he's still with us Jake a little

3937
02:57:25,649 --> 02:57:29,490
Jake your buddy his little cocker

3938
02:57:26,819 --> 02:57:32,370
spaniel but jiggered used to have

3939
02:57:29,490 --> 02:57:34,411
seizures all day every day and it was it

3940
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:36,120
was really hard and this was the

3941
02:57:34,411 --> 02:57:38,819
difference and for him his quality of

3942
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:42,090
life is much better his appetite of

3943
02:57:38,819 --> 02:57:44,399
courses always been there but even for

3944
02:57:42,091 --> 02:57:48,951
Gracie you know she ended up passing as

3945
02:57:44,399 --> 02:57:53,940
a boxer who ended up going blind who

3946
02:57:48,950 --> 02:57:55,620
really had a hard time with integrating

3947
02:57:53,940 --> 02:57:58,291
with other animals socially after that

3948
02:57:55,620 --> 02:58:00,720
point because she was she's she used to

3949
02:57:58,290 --> 02:58:03,060
be top dog and then mom got another dog

3950
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:06,569
who became the top dog a little yippie

3951
02:58:03,060 --> 02:58:08,729
your bull terrier so he was the dog and

3952
02:58:06,569 --> 02:58:10,671
it was interesting to see Gracie go

3953
02:58:08,729 --> 02:58:15,390
through that but I know for her

3954
02:58:10,671 --> 02:58:17,069
especially at end of life it was she

3955
02:58:15,390 --> 02:58:18,661
looked forward to the dropper she could

3956
02:58:17,069 --> 02:58:20,640
hear the little ding-ding-ding on the

3957
02:58:18,661 --> 02:58:22,171
little bottle and that was her kind of

3958
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:24,060
like signal to perk up and get her

3959
02:58:22,171 --> 02:58:26,190
medicine and those drops on her little

3960
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:27,630
cookie was was something that I know I

3961
02:58:26,190 --> 02:58:29,461
mean the cookie was great but she

3962
02:58:27,630 --> 02:58:32,760
recognized the drops for what it was was

3963
02:58:29,460 --> 02:58:34,200
pretty powerful with animals I mean you

3964
02:58:32,761 --> 02:58:36,390
have to make sure that the Guardian is

3965
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:38,399
well educated of course there's a trial

3966
02:58:36,390 --> 02:58:40,200
and error I always recommend that we

3967
02:58:38,399 --> 02:58:43,979
pair it up with food being mindful of

3968
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:46,890
fats making sure that we do trial runs

3969
02:58:43,979 --> 02:58:49,890
just like you would with with anybody I

3970
02:58:46,890 --> 02:58:53,640
usually recommend that we start either

3971
02:58:49,890 --> 02:58:55,380
in the afternoon or after dinner so for

3972
02:58:53,640 --> 02:58:57,630
example after six o'clock so you can

3973
02:58:55,380 --> 02:59:00,240
have a first drop you know and we always

3974
02:58:57,630 --> 02:59:02,700
micro dose and then just witness for the

3975
02:59:00,240 --> 02:59:05,521
next 24 hours how that animal will

3976
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:05,810
respond just like humans everybody is a

3977
02:59:05,521 --> 02:59:06,771
little

3978
02:59:05,810 --> 02:59:09,409
different so it's not a

3979
02:59:06,771 --> 02:59:11,870
one-size-fits-all approach so monitoring

3980
02:59:09,409 --> 02:59:15,140
making notes keeping on top of things

3981
02:59:11,870 --> 02:59:16,460
tracking it is really important just so

3982
02:59:15,140 --> 02:59:18,890
you can get an accurate dose for that

3983
02:59:16,459 --> 02:59:20,390
animal and do them due diligence to be

3984
02:59:18,890 --> 02:59:22,699
able to get the medicinal benefit that

3985
02:59:20,390 --> 02:59:24,681
they're looking for some animals can

3986
02:59:22,700 --> 02:59:28,250
absolutely get high so that's the other

3987
02:59:24,681 --> 02:59:30,950
thing to be mindful of is if you are you

3988
02:59:28,250 --> 02:59:33,440
know if you are dosing your dog for

3989
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:38,630
example and their homework are you gonna

3990
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:40,640
play for us I'm sorry I was I thought I

3991
02:59:38,629 --> 02:59:41,989
was muted that's okay I was getting

3992
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:44,359
stoked about you playing this is great

3993
02:59:41,989 --> 02:59:49,431
well hey I wanted to add something about

3994
02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:53,210
our dog our dog Floyd who is our family

3995
02:59:49,431 --> 02:59:55,761
pet suffered from some kind of allergic

3996
02:59:53,209 --> 02:59:57,709
response we don't exactly know we think

3997
02:59:55,761 --> 02:59:59,720
it could be a grass allergy because it

3998
02:59:57,709 --> 03:00:02,619
really became very prevalent during the

3999
02:59:59,720 --> 03:00:05,180
warm summer months of last year and

4000
03:00:02,620 --> 03:00:06,620
we've looked up so many different

4001
03:00:05,181 --> 03:00:08,899
treatments because basically what he was

4002
03:00:06,620 --> 03:00:11,079
doing is licking his paws so much just

4003
03:00:08,899 --> 03:00:13,609
because of irritation from this allergy

4004
03:00:11,079 --> 03:00:17,239
that he would basically lick his paws

4005
03:00:13,610 --> 03:00:21,530
raw I mean just licked the fur right off

4006
03:00:17,239 --> 03:00:27,500
it and like disfiguring to look at like

4007
03:00:21,530 --> 03:00:30,230
this blood swollen paws and we had him

4008
03:00:27,500 --> 03:00:32,000
on him on a medicine and new medicine

4009
03:00:30,229 --> 03:00:34,549
that's been advertised quite a bit here

4010
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:39,319
in the states called a pack well ethical

4011
03:00:34,549 --> 03:00:43,069
is a sulfonamide jak inhibitor jak2

4012
03:00:39,319 --> 03:00:45,199
turrets yeah basically again you're

4013
03:00:43,069 --> 03:00:47,931
treating the symptom and not treating

4014
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:50,960
the cause by deadening chemically the

4015
03:00:47,931 --> 03:00:53,920
immune response of the animal by just

4016
03:00:50,959 --> 03:00:59,180
you know basically like giving a

4017
03:00:53,920 --> 03:01:02,379
epilepsy patient benzodiazepines you're

4018
03:00:59,181 --> 03:01:04,790
just treating the symptom ology of the

4019
03:01:02,379 --> 03:01:08,119
electic event and they're not actually

4020
03:01:04,790 --> 03:01:10,340
going after the underlying cause so we

4021
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:12,440
were kind of beside ourselves because we

4022
03:01:10,340 --> 03:01:14,079
saw all kinds of negative effects about

4023
03:01:12,440 --> 03:01:17,390
using this stuff called a pack we'll

4024
03:01:14,079 --> 03:01:21,100
which is readily prescribed now in fetta

4025
03:01:17,390 --> 03:01:24,439
nary applications

4026
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:29,568
we decided to take him off of apical and

4027
03:01:24,439 --> 03:01:31,189
just put him on a CBD regimen of took

4028
03:01:29,568 --> 03:01:35,930
him off of everything what else do we

4029
03:01:31,189 --> 03:01:38,328
have month yeah he no longer gets on

4030
03:01:35,930 --> 03:01:40,158
spot flea treatments which we we hear

4031
03:01:38,328 --> 03:01:40,788
that one of the side effects of flea

4032
03:01:40,158 --> 03:01:42,260
treatments

4033
03:01:40,789 --> 03:01:44,119
you know these very powerful

4034
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:46,609
insecticides that you put on your

4035
03:01:44,119 --> 03:01:49,039
animals if they're in a outdoor

4036
03:01:46,609 --> 03:01:51,498
environment to protect them from from

4037
03:01:49,039 --> 03:01:54,109
you know very dangerous insects and

4038
03:01:51,498 --> 03:01:56,510
whatnot I mean a lot of those have a lot

4039
03:01:54,109 --> 03:01:59,748
of whole laundry list of side effects

4040
03:01:56,510 --> 03:02:01,158
and we started seeing shudders tremors

4041
03:01:59,748 --> 03:02:02,299
he would just be sitting there and all

4042
03:02:01,158 --> 03:02:04,850
sudden he would just start shaking

4043
03:02:02,299 --> 03:02:07,038
almost like a like a like epileptic

4044
03:02:04,850 --> 03:02:10,550
seizure our previous animal actually

4045
03:02:07,039 --> 03:02:13,418
suffered from canine epilepsy and we

4046
03:02:10,549 --> 03:02:17,358
spent a fortune in the conventional

4047
03:02:13,418 --> 03:02:20,059
canine you know therapeutic way to try

4048
03:02:17,359 --> 03:02:23,059
to figure things out but we're too bad

4049
03:02:20,059 --> 03:02:25,398
we didn't really try CBD earlier but

4050
03:02:23,059 --> 03:02:30,559
here's the upside so the upside is that

4051
03:02:25,398 --> 03:02:32,898
this summer but CBD so the base solution

4052
03:02:30,559 --> 03:02:36,799
that I start with this about a thousand

4053
03:02:32,898 --> 03:02:39,878
milligrams and 30 mils of oil that's

4054
03:02:36,799 --> 03:02:43,608
what sort of a base solution to start

4055
03:02:39,879 --> 03:02:45,550
titrating your pets dose and what we did

4056
03:02:43,609 --> 03:02:48,619
is we just added it to his dry kibble

4057
03:02:45,549 --> 03:02:50,658
you know put a couple drops on and we

4058
03:02:48,619 --> 03:02:54,560
kind of titrated them up to what we have

4059
03:02:50,658 --> 03:02:58,189
mont about six drops a day eight drops a

4060
03:02:54,559 --> 03:03:01,219
day of that of that solution and i'll

4061
03:02:58,189 --> 03:03:03,590
post pictures up to my facebook is just

4062
03:03:01,219 --> 03:03:07,238
like night and day you could see his

4063
03:03:03,590 --> 03:03:07,238
paws my daughter had saved

4064
03:03:08,148 --> 03:03:15,948
yeah my fries okay I might have froze up

4065
03:03:12,238 --> 03:03:15,948
for a second my pitch and my daughter

4066
03:03:17,860 --> 03:03:23,300
the pictures of his eyes after I think I

4067
03:03:20,510 --> 03:03:26,000
froze again but um we'll post those and

4068
03:03:23,299 --> 03:03:29,869
you could see for yourself the condition

4069
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:32,739
that the animal is in now he has no

4070
03:03:29,870 --> 03:03:35,360
tremors he used to get all kinds of

4071
03:03:32,739 --> 03:03:37,699
bumps almost like I don't want to say

4072
03:03:35,360 --> 03:03:40,130
acne but just some kind of skin

4073
03:03:37,700 --> 03:03:43,460
irritation from his allergy we see none

4074
03:03:40,129 --> 03:03:45,949
of that we see no yeast infection he's

4075
03:03:43,459 --> 03:03:48,619
to get secondary staph infections and

4076
03:03:45,950 --> 03:03:53,271
yeast infections from licking his his

4077
03:03:48,620 --> 03:03:55,730
fur right off of his it would expose his

4078
03:03:53,271 --> 03:03:57,710
skins to start getting staph infections

4079
03:03:55,729 --> 03:04:01,100
and that's a really key thing is when

4080
03:03:57,709 --> 03:04:03,799
you start smelling a different essence

4081
03:04:01,100 --> 03:04:06,170
especially coming from paws or areas of

4082
03:04:03,799 --> 03:04:08,629
open wounds you have to be concerned

4083
03:04:06,170 --> 03:04:11,090
with staph infections with animals

4084
03:04:08,629 --> 03:04:13,849
especially dogs his dogs you know like

4085
03:04:11,090 --> 03:04:15,319
to lick themselves and you know I mean

4086
03:04:13,850 --> 03:04:17,420
there are in some times not the most

4087
03:04:15,319 --> 03:04:20,289
sterile of environments but it is

4088
03:04:17,420 --> 03:04:24,829
certainly just with our animal anyway a

4089
03:04:20,290 --> 03:04:26,180
night-and-day I mean it's just it's just

4090
03:04:24,829 --> 03:04:27,860
like you could see it what do you look

4091
03:04:26,180 --> 03:04:31,700
like last year and all posted his paws

4092
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:36,530
red raw from just licking incessantly to

4093
03:04:31,700 --> 03:04:39,829
now just having full skin and or full

4094
03:04:36,530 --> 03:04:41,960
hair and no side effects so what we feel

4095
03:04:39,829 --> 03:04:45,680
that we're doing Selina is where we're

4096
03:04:41,959 --> 03:04:48,589
boosting his own endocannabinoids system

4097
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:50,210
to be his own Audis pharmaceutical

4098
03:04:48,590 --> 03:04:55,280
company right so when there's an

4099
03:04:50,209 --> 03:04:58,549
illogical pathogen or an antigen

4100
03:04:55,280 --> 03:05:00,040
response that it you know elicits a an

4101
03:04:58,549 --> 03:05:03,500
immune response

4102
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:07,550
his body is fully fortified with enough

4103
03:05:03,500 --> 03:05:08,930
CBD to basically keep his body healthy

4104
03:05:07,549 --> 03:05:10,759
and again I wanted to say one other

4105
03:05:08,930 --> 03:05:12,620
thing before because I think Natasha had

4106
03:05:10,760 --> 03:05:15,159
mentioned this you know every time you

4107
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:18,940
take any of these cannabinoids you're

4108
03:05:15,159 --> 03:05:21,170
putting Faxon ins into your body

4109
03:05:18,940 --> 03:05:23,899
oxidants or water-soluble things like

4110
03:05:21,170 --> 03:05:26,180
ascorbate and vitamin C and whatnot fat

4111
03:05:23,899 --> 03:05:28,309
soluble antioxidants are just things

4112
03:05:26,180 --> 03:05:30,639
that you need to have in your diet and

4113
03:05:28,309 --> 03:05:32,478
consuming and again I do believe that

4114
03:05:30,639 --> 03:05:36,278
prolonged cannabis

4115
03:05:32,478 --> 03:05:39,019
use provides a background of

4116
03:05:36,279 --> 03:05:42,039
antioxidants in Oedipus tissue and fatty

4117
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:44,779
structures like the brain that help keep

4118
03:05:42,039 --> 03:05:46,930
free radicals and reactive oxygen

4119
03:05:44,779 --> 03:05:50,300
species from causing all kinds of

4120
03:05:46,930 --> 03:05:53,090
mutations and so yeah again like go back

4121
03:05:50,299 --> 03:05:55,698
to the wreck versus medical it's also

4122
03:05:53,090 --> 03:05:58,748
been shown that cannabis use will

4123
03:05:55,699 --> 03:06:01,819
protect your pancreas from undergoing

4124
03:05:58,748 --> 03:06:03,920
oxidative damage which can lead to all

4125
03:06:01,818 --> 03:06:07,219
kinds of conditions including cancer of

4126
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:09,710
the pancreas so again I think David

4127
03:06:07,219 --> 03:06:13,549
Allen said if at whether you understand

4128
03:06:09,709 --> 03:06:15,709
it or not all cannabis use is medical

4129
03:06:13,549 --> 03:06:18,198
because these things are happening

4130
03:06:15,709 --> 03:06:21,469
inside the tissues and inside the

4131
03:06:18,199 --> 03:06:23,090
cellular mechanisms in your body you're

4132
03:06:21,469 --> 03:06:26,028
not even aware of it and while you're

4133
03:06:23,090 --> 03:06:28,090
enjoying your your creational hi and get

4134
03:06:26,029 --> 03:06:30,078
rekt with your friends and everything

4135
03:06:28,090 --> 03:06:31,309
you know remember when you said to your

4136
03:06:30,078 --> 03:06:33,170
college roommate hey let's go kill some

4137
03:06:31,309 --> 03:06:35,328
brain cells let's go smoke one right

4138
03:06:33,170 --> 03:06:36,619
you're actually ironically just doing

4139
03:06:35,328 --> 03:06:38,898
the opposite you're actually growing

4140
03:06:36,619 --> 03:06:41,420
brain cells protecting your brain from

4141
03:06:38,898 --> 03:06:43,908
oxidative damage and other oxidative

4142
03:06:41,420 --> 03:06:46,789
events that are very important to

4143
03:06:43,908 --> 03:06:49,279
control in your body because those

4144
03:06:46,789 --> 03:06:51,619
oxidative things can be very damaging

4145
03:06:49,279 --> 03:06:54,229
what about like eating versus smoking

4146
03:06:51,619 --> 03:06:57,649
versus vaporizing versus topical in your

4147
03:06:54,228 --> 03:06:59,959
opinion versus insertion well I mean

4148
03:06:57,648 --> 03:07:03,139
again the studies show the the the

4149
03:06:59,959 --> 03:07:05,809
famous UCLA tashkent study shows that

4150
03:07:03,139 --> 03:07:08,299
you know cannabis users who smoke

4151
03:07:05,809 --> 03:07:09,528
cannabis have a lower incident of lung

4152
03:07:08,299 --> 03:07:11,898
disease than people who don't smoke

4153
03:07:09,529 --> 03:07:14,569
anything at all so that tells you that

4154
03:07:11,898 --> 03:07:17,328
these molecules that we're inhaling into

4155
03:07:14,568 --> 03:07:21,398
our lung have a prophylactic effect to

4156
03:07:17,328 --> 03:07:24,498
basically protect from some of the other

4157
03:07:21,398 --> 03:07:26,118
environmental on slots you get from

4158
03:07:24,498 --> 03:07:28,908
breathing the air in New York City or

4159
03:07:26,119 --> 03:07:31,100
walking behind a bus that's spewing out

4160
03:07:28,908 --> 03:07:34,430
all kinds of diesel fumes or we're

4161
03:07:31,100 --> 03:07:36,920
constantly assaulted with carcinogenic

4162
03:07:34,430 --> 03:07:39,680
materials all throughout our lifetime so

4163
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:42,590
it's a really in our benefit to have in

4164
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:44,898
our daily consumption not only cannabis

4165
03:07:42,590 --> 03:07:46,430
but cats and antioxidants and

4166
03:07:44,898 --> 03:07:49,129
heart-healthy mala

4167
03:07:46,430 --> 03:07:51,500
skills like the the polyunsaturated

4168
03:07:49,129 --> 03:07:53,420
fatty acids and hemp seed oil we've

4169
03:07:51,500 --> 03:07:54,770
talked about quite a bit I mean those

4170
03:07:53,420 --> 03:07:57,109
are the kinds of things that are going

4171
03:07:54,770 --> 03:08:00,620
to help nourish your body and help your

4172
03:07:57,109 --> 03:08:04,068
body fight these infections and not some

4173
03:08:00,620 --> 03:08:08,770
pill that you have to buy from companies

4174
03:08:04,068 --> 03:08:11,959
somewhere I totally agree mark and even

4175
03:08:08,770 --> 03:08:14,420
eating like not just the cannabis plant

4176
03:08:11,959 --> 03:08:16,488
but also the hemp seed plant and the

4177
03:08:14,420 --> 03:08:20,180
hemp seed oil and the hemp seed protein

4178
03:08:16,488 --> 03:08:21,818
and even just fruits and vegetables and

4179
03:08:20,180 --> 03:08:24,199
mushrooms and all of these other

4180
03:08:21,818 --> 03:08:26,959
complementary foods we need to access

4181
03:08:24,199 --> 03:08:29,109
all of our nutrients Joshua and Kelly

4182
03:08:26,959 --> 03:08:31,818
did you guys have anything to add about

4183
03:08:29,109 --> 03:08:35,630
cannabis and pets yes I said you had

4184
03:08:31,818 --> 03:08:38,090
some experience also um yeah Maggie Lou

4185
03:08:35,629 --> 03:08:40,898
she lived to be a we think seventeen and

4186
03:08:38,090 --> 03:08:44,420
a half and she was a black lab so

4187
03:08:40,898 --> 03:08:49,250
probably somewhere at 12 years old she

4188
03:08:44,420 --> 03:08:51,409
started to have lots of tumors all over

4189
03:08:49,250 --> 03:08:54,079
and I was treating them topically with

4190
03:08:51,409 --> 03:08:56,779
my regular you know our oil that we do

4191
03:08:54,079 --> 03:08:58,609
because we make it into SABS or we put

4192
03:08:56,779 --> 03:09:00,590
it into the dog food we put it in the

4193
03:08:58,609 --> 03:09:02,779
raw dog food every day you know it's

4194
03:09:00,590 --> 03:09:05,988
just part of our daily nutrient it's not

4195
03:09:02,779 --> 03:09:08,090
something that we utilize just for a you

4196
03:09:05,988 --> 03:09:09,709
know an ailment or a malady you know

4197
03:09:08,090 --> 03:09:12,949
it's just something that's utilized

4198
03:09:09,709 --> 03:09:14,299
every day and we started noticing that

4199
03:09:12,949 --> 03:09:16,880
Maggie Lee was getting more and more

4200
03:09:14,299 --> 03:09:19,579
tumors and then I thought wow she seems

4201
03:09:16,879 --> 03:09:24,349
like she's in pain so then I started to

4202
03:09:19,579 --> 03:09:30,590
give her the CBD THC blend of the

4203
03:09:24,350 --> 03:09:34,970
half-and-half and she uh sorry I had

4204
03:09:30,590 --> 03:09:37,398
like a something happen there and within

4205
03:09:34,969 --> 03:09:39,079
a year I just I just thought I was

4206
03:09:37,398 --> 03:09:40,939
killing her paint honestly I just

4207
03:09:39,079 --> 03:09:43,398
thought wow here's a dog she's in pain

4208
03:09:40,939 --> 03:09:45,829
I'm just killing her pain until she

4209
03:09:43,398 --> 03:09:48,108
passes you know she's 12 year old big

4210
03:09:45,829 --> 03:09:50,389
black lab you know she's had a wonderful

4211
03:09:48,109 --> 03:09:52,880
life she's gonna pass we'll just try to

4212
03:09:50,389 --> 03:09:55,250
make her comfortable well you know I was

4213
03:09:52,879 --> 03:09:58,549
sort of giving her heroic doses of it

4214
03:09:55,250 --> 03:10:00,829
just to keep her down you know in the

4215
03:09:58,549 --> 03:10:02,509
grass and keeping her just calm and

4216
03:10:00,829 --> 03:10:04,430
feeling good and she could still stand

4217
03:10:02,510 --> 03:10:07,370
up and go pee and do what she needed to

4218
03:10:04,430 --> 03:10:09,739
do so she was getting heroic doses for

4219
03:10:07,370 --> 03:10:11,990
about three months and probably on the

4220
03:10:09,739 --> 03:10:14,329
third or fourth month I noticed that the

4221
03:10:11,989 --> 03:10:16,789
tumors were starting to shrink and by

4222
03:10:14,329 --> 03:10:18,770
maybe the eighth month all of the tumors

4223
03:10:16,790 --> 03:10:23,270
were gone every single tumor in her

4224
03:10:18,770 --> 03:10:25,670
entire body was totally gone and you

4225
03:10:23,270 --> 03:10:27,409
know she did heroic doses for three

4226
03:10:25,670 --> 03:10:29,870
months and that's just a really

4227
03:10:27,409 --> 03:10:33,109
interesting thing that we noticed and

4228
03:10:29,870 --> 03:10:35,210
and then she lived to be seventeen and a

4229
03:10:33,109 --> 03:10:38,750
half and just died of old age with no

4230
03:10:35,209 --> 03:10:42,709
tumors and zero pain what what's a

4231
03:10:38,750 --> 03:10:57,228
heroic dose just so we can put it well I

4232
03:10:42,709 --> 03:11:00,079
mean III loved I loved that we have yeah

4233
03:10:57,228 --> 03:11:03,139
I mean that's what we did we had we

4234
03:11:00,079 --> 03:11:04,909
would gauge you know how much CBD we put

4235
03:11:03,139 --> 03:11:07,099
in there because we had like a more of a

4236
03:11:04,909 --> 03:11:09,859
pure CBD strain that we made an extract

4237
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:12,500
out of and then we had a THC strain that

4238
03:11:09,859 --> 03:11:14,689
we made an extract of oil extract out

4239
03:11:12,500 --> 03:11:16,728
and we put the two together in order to

4240
03:11:14,689 --> 03:11:19,639
make medicine that wouldn't knock her

4241
03:11:16,728 --> 03:11:21,079
out to the market yeah but but we didn't

4242
03:11:19,639 --> 03:11:22,849
we can't really tell you what the

4243
03:11:21,079 --> 03:11:25,939
milligrams were because we didn't have

4244
03:11:22,850 --> 03:11:28,370
the ability to test it at that time but

4245
03:11:25,939 --> 03:11:31,970
I can say that I utilize it for my

4246
03:11:28,370 --> 03:11:35,720
migraines and I would take a heroic dose

4247
03:11:31,969 --> 03:11:40,519
which meant that I'm gone and out for 24

4248
03:11:35,719 --> 03:11:43,309
hours done just totally sleeping and

4249
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:45,319
gone so I was giving her the same amount

4250
03:11:43,309 --> 03:11:48,920
that I was taking which was a full

4251
03:11:45,318 --> 03:11:51,889
tablespoon she hasn't even thought so oh

4252
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:56,290
yeah she would just be totally asleep

4253
03:11:51,889 --> 03:11:58,969
and out of it and in perfect

4254
03:11:56,290 --> 03:12:01,300
he wasn't like she wasn't allergic or

4255
03:11:58,969 --> 03:12:04,608
uncomfortable she was just really

4256
03:12:01,299 --> 03:12:06,920
relaxed just relaxed asleep wanting to

4257
03:12:04,609 --> 03:12:08,659
be outside in the grass feeling

4258
03:12:06,920 --> 03:12:10,219
fantastic at a point where she has

4259
03:12:08,659 --> 03:12:11,479
tumors on her like we wouldn't do that

4260
03:12:10,219 --> 03:12:15,640
yeah

4261
03:12:11,479 --> 03:12:19,010
you know extreme situation yeah just

4262
03:12:15,640 --> 03:12:21,440
yeah we dosed her up all the way up to

4263
03:12:19,010 --> 03:12:23,390
like a full tablespoon which I still was

4264
03:12:21,440 --> 03:12:25,670
trying to keep it a one-to-one because I

4265
03:12:23,390 --> 03:12:27,920
think the ratio is very important you

4266
03:12:25,670 --> 03:12:29,870
know my that I think that talking about

4267
03:12:27,920 --> 03:12:33,409
milligrams and percentages is really

4268
03:12:29,870 --> 03:12:35,750
interesting but I love the idea of you

4269
03:12:33,409 --> 03:12:37,521
know a balance a balance of the

4270
03:12:35,750 --> 03:12:40,370
cannabinoids are a balance of the

4271
03:12:37,521 --> 03:12:43,880
terpenes or our balances because our

4272
03:12:40,370 --> 03:12:46,280
body can only uptake so much you know at

4273
03:12:43,879 --> 03:12:48,229
a certain time so it was still a

4274
03:12:46,280 --> 03:12:50,570
one-to-one ratio that we were giving her

4275
03:12:48,229 --> 03:12:53,119
so we were upping her CBD tremendously

4276
03:12:50,569 --> 03:12:57,110
as well at that time a teaspoon was a

4277
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:58,970
normal dose yeah so we were tripling it

4278
03:12:57,110 --> 03:13:01,250
for her were you guys like giving her

4279
03:12:58,969 --> 03:13:02,719
cuz I played around those dosing and

4280
03:13:01,250 --> 03:13:04,879
we've done it where we've like put it on

4281
03:13:02,719 --> 03:13:07,219
blueberries and stuff to make sure that

4282
03:13:04,879 --> 03:13:10,279
that animal can eat it it was your dog

4283
03:13:07,219 --> 03:13:12,140
just like licking it off the spoon no

4284
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:15,440
you know dogs don't really like to have

4285
03:13:12,140 --> 03:13:17,931
things on their paws and if you just put

4286
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:20,569
the oil on their paws then they always

4287
03:13:17,931 --> 03:13:22,521
lick it off they don't like having

4288
03:13:20,569 --> 03:13:24,529
anything on their paws they like their

4289
03:13:22,521 --> 03:13:26,750
paws clean and usually no matter how

4290
03:13:24,530 --> 03:13:29,420
sick they are they'll still want to lick

4291
03:13:26,750 --> 03:13:31,700
their paws so we're making our own raw

4292
03:13:29,420 --> 03:13:33,351
dog food now so now we can just put a

4293
03:13:31,700 --> 03:13:36,590
little bit in the raw dog food and they

4294
03:13:33,351 --> 03:13:39,021
just eat it the difference yeah but for

4295
03:13:36,590 --> 03:13:41,899
medicinal you can put it on the paws and

4296
03:13:39,021 --> 03:13:44,391
and if you make it a olive oil just put

4297
03:13:41,899 --> 03:13:47,840
your touch a touch of olive oil even if

4298
03:13:44,390 --> 03:13:49,699
you're doing like a another extract of

4299
03:13:47,840 --> 03:13:57,860
some sort you know dogs love olive oil

4300
03:13:49,700 --> 03:14:00,740
okay and that was a medicinal mushroom

4301
03:13:57,860 --> 03:14:05,060
cannabis oil to that we were using today

4302
03:14:00,739 --> 03:14:07,690
yeah at that point it's just you know

4303
03:14:05,060 --> 03:14:10,369
throw everything at it and it like you

4304
03:14:07,690 --> 03:14:12,140
instead of the kitchen what's in it for

4305
03:14:10,370 --> 03:14:14,000
us whatever's in the forest not our land

4306
03:14:12,140 --> 03:14:15,649
and stuff so which turns out to be

4307
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:17,510
pretty darn medicinal in the end because

4308
03:14:15,649 --> 03:14:21,229
I mean but it's medicinal mushroom

4309
03:14:17,510 --> 03:14:23,390
extracts on their own our world to

4310
03:14:21,229 --> 03:14:25,189
themselves and to put the two together

4311
03:14:23,390 --> 03:14:27,590
with Matt with with kin

4312
03:14:25,190 --> 03:14:29,750
I mean we've had amazing results yeah we

4313
03:14:27,590 --> 03:14:31,310
encourage other people Mico cannabis we

4314
03:14:29,750 --> 03:14:34,940
think it's incredibly important it's

4315
03:14:31,310 --> 03:14:37,789
like to mastered genres of medicine

4316
03:14:34,940 --> 03:14:41,000
coming together and there's 5,000 years

4317
03:14:37,790 --> 03:14:42,351
of medicinal mushroom knowledge in the

4318
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:45,950
Chinese

4319
03:14:42,351 --> 03:14:50,569
there's Russians and Japanese and Korean

4320
03:14:45,950 --> 03:14:52,280
people at not people but medical papers

4321
03:14:50,569 --> 03:14:54,619
there's tons of them you know if we if

4322
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:56,690
we you know could read Japanese or

4323
03:14:54,620 --> 03:15:00,650
Korean or even Russian for that matter

4324
03:14:56,690 --> 03:15:02,870
there's a ton of of medicinal mushroom

4325
03:15:00,649 --> 03:15:04,549
studies on health and well-being and we

4326
03:15:02,870 --> 03:15:06,680
can't read those but there's a lot we

4327
03:15:04,549 --> 03:15:10,009
can and so putting it together with

4328
03:15:06,680 --> 03:15:12,500
cannabis has been an amazing thing yep

4329
03:15:10,010 --> 03:15:14,329
we think that it's a world that and the

4330
03:15:12,500 --> 03:15:17,149
dogs could I look at it really well

03:15:32,329 --> 03:15:38,390
mean THC or TPA or you are you using

4338
03:15:34,729 --> 03:15:40,039
Rasta for using D carbs or combo that

4339
03:15:38,390 --> 03:15:41,989
was just a question from the chat I

4340
03:15:40,040 --> 03:15:44,750
thought would be an interesting thing to

4341
03:15:41,989 --> 03:15:47,930
clarify that yeah which is really

4342
03:15:44,750 --> 03:15:50,780
important yeah it's a THC a at the

4343
03:15:47,930 --> 03:15:52,460
beginning so oftentimes because we're

4344
03:15:50,780 --> 03:15:55,190
just keeping that temperature super

4345
03:15:52,459 --> 03:15:57,799
super super low and then it goes on for

4346
03:15:55,190 --> 03:15:59,659
probably about five to seven days which

4347
03:15:57,799 --> 03:16:03,469
is probably around 100 degrees yeah

4348
03:15:59,659 --> 03:16:05,299
maybe a hundred and ten at the most you

4349
03:16:03,469 --> 03:16:09,109
know at the very very highest there and

4350
03:16:05,299 --> 03:16:11,469
then we strain off that and then we put

4351
03:16:09,110 --> 03:16:13,641
more oil in there and then that gets

4352
03:16:11,469 --> 03:16:15,829
decarboxylated with all of the different

4353
03:16:13,640 --> 03:16:18,260
mushrooms and everything in there and

4354
03:16:15,829 --> 03:16:22,180
then that will be added as the activated

4355
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:26,601
THC you know the non acidic version so

4356
03:16:22,180 --> 03:16:29,720
and then we also have the CBD which you

4357
03:16:26,601 --> 03:16:32,420
know is also slow-cooked in with the THC

4358
03:16:29,719 --> 03:16:34,489
a so just trying to add all of the

4359
03:16:32,420 --> 03:16:38,421
different versions of it it's primarily

4360
03:16:34,489 --> 03:16:42,831
low simmer cooked to keep it more on the

4361
03:16:38,421 --> 03:16:44,331
less active are you guys doing any stuff

4362
03:16:42,831 --> 03:16:47,421
I think you mentioned a little bit

4363
03:16:44,331 --> 03:16:50,181
before with raw cannabis and juicing and

4364
03:16:47,421 --> 03:16:52,940
even just do you ever feed some of the

4365
03:16:50,181 --> 03:16:56,301
leaves or put that into pill form do you

4366
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:59,681
ever work with that with your animals um

4367
03:16:56,300 --> 03:17:03,200
you know cannabis is such an incredible

4368
03:16:59,681 --> 03:17:06,111
you know fibrous plant I think that it's

4369
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:09,229
really hard to digest in raw form if

4370
03:17:06,111 --> 03:17:10,971
you're not you know just to maybe blend

4371
03:17:09,229 --> 03:17:12,790
it up in a blender a lot of people put

4372
03:17:10,970 --> 03:17:16,460
it in caps and I just think that that's

4373
03:17:12,790 --> 03:17:18,290
it just my own intuitive feeling feels

4374
03:17:16,460 --> 03:17:19,790
like that's pretty harsh on the

4375
03:17:18,290 --> 03:17:21,500
intestines unless you're doing some type

4376
03:17:19,790 --> 03:17:23,060
of a parasitical cleanse or something at

4377
03:17:21,501 --> 03:17:27,229
the same time which might be nice for a

4378
03:17:23,060 --> 03:17:29,150
short version period but for a longer

4379
03:17:27,229 --> 03:17:31,520
term I think that juicing is really

4380
03:17:29,150 --> 03:17:35,030
wonderful and we definitely utilize that

4381
03:17:31,521 --> 03:17:37,881
you know making teas is great you know

4382
03:17:35,031 --> 03:17:40,401
that there's so many ways that you and

4383
03:17:37,880 --> 03:17:42,320
to be able to start seeing that cannabis

4384
03:17:40,400 --> 03:17:44,331
is a basic nutrient but yeah we're

4385
03:17:42,320 --> 03:17:47,240
talking about it as like a medicine but

4386
03:17:44,331 --> 03:17:50,661
you know the hemp seeds is a basic

4387
03:17:47,240 --> 03:17:54,220
nutrient that our DNA has not had for

4388
03:17:50,661 --> 03:17:56,601
several generations because of you know

4389
03:17:54,220 --> 03:17:59,600
the interesting measures that we've put

4390
03:17:56,601 --> 03:18:01,461
upon it you know as humans you know on

4391
03:17:59,601 --> 03:18:04,371
the planet but now that we're starting

4392
03:18:01,460 --> 03:18:06,800
to get it back into our bodies and our

4393
03:18:04,370 --> 03:18:09,470
DNA where we're starting to research and

4394
03:18:06,800 --> 03:18:11,751
study it again you know the dogs like to

4395
03:18:09,470 --> 03:18:13,610
chew on the canada stocks - oh yeah

4396
03:18:11,751 --> 03:18:14,900
always give them the cannabis stocks

4397
03:18:13,611 --> 03:18:18,681
they love it they'll rip them up until

4398
03:18:14,900 --> 03:18:20,570
it's done they play games with it so I

4399
03:18:18,681 --> 03:18:22,940
just want to change topics a little bit

4400
03:18:20,570 --> 03:18:26,960
another question for Joshua and Kelly

4401
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:28,881
came up a question from Martin Giles he

4402
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:31,820
wanted to know how to increase

4403
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:34,610
phosphorus and potassium during

4404
03:18:31,820 --> 03:18:36,890
flowering using organic practices if you

4405
03:18:34,611 --> 03:18:39,831
had any tips sir could if you could

4406
03:18:36,890 --> 03:18:42,081
amend or head some yeah I don't know if

4407
03:18:39,831 --> 03:18:45,501
you mean add to that oh for sure that's

4408
03:18:42,081 --> 03:18:47,601
like our passion so you just can look at

4409
03:18:45,501 --> 03:18:49,970
at phosphorus and phosphorus is this

4410
03:18:47,601 --> 03:18:52,579
amazing thing that comes from the soil

4411
03:18:49,970 --> 03:18:54,350
and it's easily found in

4412
03:18:52,579 --> 03:18:56,450
plants that have already up taken it

4413
03:18:54,350 --> 03:18:59,120
from the soil you know to take it from

4414
03:18:56,450 --> 03:19:00,710
its original form like a mineral or

4415
03:18:59,120 --> 03:19:03,140
something makes it really hard to digest

4416
03:19:00,709 --> 03:19:06,259
in the same way that a supplement that

4417
03:19:03,139 --> 03:19:07,549
you buy from you know a health food

4418
03:19:06,260 --> 03:19:09,920
store you know maybe you're only

4419
03:19:07,549 --> 03:19:13,549
digesting 10% of that because it's raw

4420
03:19:09,920 --> 03:19:16,250
mineral but if it's found in plants

4421
03:19:13,549 --> 03:19:18,859
already then it's easily uptake Abul and

4422
03:19:16,250 --> 03:19:21,590
that's why I Balaji is so important for

4423
03:19:18,860 --> 03:19:24,290
our own bodies to uptake nutrients as

4424
03:19:21,590 --> 03:19:25,940
well as for plants so we can look at

4425
03:19:24,290 --> 03:19:28,311
different plants that have high

4426
03:19:25,940 --> 03:19:29,810
phosphorous qualities and we always know

4427
03:19:28,310 --> 03:19:31,579
that the highest amount of the

4428
03:19:29,810 --> 03:19:35,209
phosphorus in that plant is going to be

4429
03:19:31,579 --> 03:19:38,060
found in the root and in the seed so at

4430
03:19:35,209 --> 03:19:42,079
the very end of a life cycle of a plant

4431
03:19:38,060 --> 03:19:44,119
it seeds and then it's taken all of the

4432
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:46,010
phosphorous out of the plant and then

4433
03:19:44,120 --> 03:19:47,840
you're going to fight out of the soil

4434
03:19:46,010 --> 03:19:49,399
and put it into the plant and you're

4435
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:52,460
going to find a tremendous amount of

4436
03:19:49,399 --> 03:19:55,609
phosphorus in the plant from the plant

4437
03:19:52,459 --> 03:19:58,099
in those seeds so when we study seeds

4438
03:19:55,610 --> 03:20:00,710
you know cover crops and things like

4439
03:19:58,100 --> 03:20:02,989
that we realize that a lot of phosphorus

4440
03:20:00,709 --> 03:20:06,259
is found in seeds and actually oddly

4441
03:20:02,989 --> 03:20:08,600
enough one of the highest seeds out

4442
03:20:06,260 --> 03:20:10,729
there is the poppy seeds so you can you

4443
03:20:08,600 --> 03:20:13,130
can take poppy seeds and you cannabis

4444
03:20:10,729 --> 03:20:15,020
and also cannabis see it's super high in

4445
03:20:13,129 --> 03:20:17,209
phosphorous and you can blend them up in

4446
03:20:15,021 --> 03:20:19,850
your blender and you can feed it to your

4447
03:20:17,209 --> 03:20:22,669
tea brew or to your soils to be able to

4448
03:20:19,850 --> 03:20:24,440
uptake those nutrients easily the plant

4449
03:20:22,670 --> 03:20:26,870
doesn't have to break it down it's just

4450
03:20:24,440 --> 03:20:30,079
readily available in the microbiology is

4451
03:20:26,870 --> 03:20:33,380
ready to eat it so burdock is another

4452
03:20:30,079 --> 03:20:38,840
one Turkey rhubarb is another one you

4453
03:20:33,379 --> 03:20:40,670
can use Bracken fern another thing so

4454
03:20:38,840 --> 03:20:45,440
there's you can top dress that you can

4455
03:20:40,670 --> 03:20:47,810
utilize those wild weeds and compost you

4456
03:20:45,440 --> 03:20:49,190
can make teas out of them so like she's

4457
03:20:47,810 --> 03:20:50,479
listing off a lot of the things that

4458
03:20:49,190 --> 03:20:52,250
we've just used we've used a lot of

4459
03:20:50,479 --> 03:20:54,260
ferns a lot of frizz there's a lot of

4460
03:20:52,250 --> 03:20:57,590
Bracken ferns all across our property

4461
03:20:54,260 --> 03:20:59,389
right now burdock is an invasive species

4462
03:20:57,590 --> 03:21:01,370
in the forest so those government

4463
03:20:59,389 --> 03:21:03,949
contracts for people to go down and cut

4464
03:21:01,370 --> 03:21:05,450
burdock down everywhere so we're using

4465
03:21:03,950 --> 03:21:07,940
burdock roots

4466
03:21:05,450 --> 03:21:09,891
hi and phosphorous turkey rhubarb's

4467
03:21:07,940 --> 03:21:12,140
really easy to grow it's a perennial it

4468
03:21:09,890 --> 03:21:13,819
comes back it's it can be invasive in

4469
03:21:12,140 --> 03:21:15,619
your garden you just put it in there and

4470
03:21:13,819 --> 03:21:18,190
you can use it in all of your teas for

4471
03:21:15,620 --> 03:21:20,960
your Gardens for phosphorus so easy

4472
03:21:18,190 --> 03:21:22,700
utilizing those roots and teas so we're

4473
03:21:20,959 --> 03:21:25,459
chopping them up and making a tea out of

4474
03:21:22,700 --> 03:21:29,360
them to get used to utilize an easy

4475
03:21:25,459 --> 03:21:31,579
uptake Abul tea raw cacao is easy to get

4476
03:21:29,360 --> 03:21:34,730
there's a high in magnesium has every

4477
03:21:31,579 --> 03:21:36,771
other nutrient in the world in raw cacao

4478
03:21:34,729 --> 03:21:38,719
amazing list and you only need a tiny

4479
03:21:36,771 --> 03:21:41,030
bit so you can put it in tea brew and

4480
03:21:38,719 --> 03:21:42,680
throw it on your plants and you can get

4481
03:21:41,030 --> 03:21:45,530
phosphorous what was the other question

4482
03:21:42,681 --> 03:21:46,730
what was the other nutrient phosphorus

4483
03:21:45,530 --> 03:21:50,090
and potassium

4484
03:21:46,729 --> 03:21:53,299
Oh and potassium potassium is is super

4485
03:21:50,090 --> 03:21:55,819
easy to to find in any flowering plants

4486
03:21:53,299 --> 03:21:58,279
or that are yellow sunflowers have a

4487
03:21:55,819 --> 03:22:00,229
tremendous amount of potassium and

4488
03:21:58,280 --> 03:22:03,021
they've pulled it all up and out of the

4489
03:22:00,229 --> 03:22:05,750
soil there's lots of roots potatoes Wow

4490
03:22:03,021 --> 03:22:08,120
potatoes are so easy to grow and you can

4491
03:22:05,750 --> 03:22:09,940
make potato mash this or ferments to

4492
03:22:08,120 --> 03:22:12,740
feed your plants and and it's

4493
03:22:09,940 --> 03:22:16,010
immediately at a cabal kelp if you're

4494
03:22:12,739 --> 03:22:19,789
close to the ocean about sketchy

4495
03:22:16,010 --> 03:22:22,010
yeah oceans pretty interesting oils

4496
03:22:19,790 --> 03:22:23,960
accordingly so if you're making a soil

4497
03:22:22,010 --> 03:22:25,579
think about adding and roots and

4498
03:22:23,959 --> 03:22:27,859
different things like that to your so if

4499
03:22:25,579 --> 03:22:30,250
you're doing a soil blend if you have

4500
03:22:27,860 --> 03:22:32,870
piece of land and you're gonna try and

4501
03:22:30,250 --> 03:22:35,799
accumulate those materials that you know

4502
03:22:32,870 --> 03:22:38,271
are high in phosphorus maybe it's your

4503
03:22:35,799 --> 03:22:40,489
bones that you've been eating or maybe

4504
03:22:38,271 --> 03:22:43,370
there's bones around that you can burn

4505
03:22:40,489 --> 03:22:45,049
and stick those in your soil you can use

4506
03:22:43,370 --> 03:22:47,391
your chicken eggs you can save all your

4507
03:22:45,049 --> 03:22:49,609
chicken shells and put those in your

4508
03:22:47,390 --> 03:22:51,729
soil over the calcium is top dressing

4509
03:22:49,610 --> 03:22:54,771
mm-hmm um if you have an outdoor

4510
03:22:51,729 --> 03:22:56,209
situation you just take those basic

4511
03:22:54,771 --> 03:22:58,190
principles that we just gave you and you

4512
03:22:56,209 --> 03:23:00,310
try and accumulate the biomass and in

4513
03:22:58,190 --> 03:23:02,989
the soil if you can get it in the soil

4514
03:23:00,310 --> 03:23:06,440
breaking down composting that's your

4515
03:23:02,989 --> 03:23:09,560
ultimate and then utilizing fermented

4516
03:23:06,440 --> 03:23:11,720
raw leaf teas or raw root or raw seed

4517
03:23:09,560 --> 03:23:14,149
teas and the summer is the way to

4518
03:23:11,719 --> 03:23:16,369
liquefy those nutrients and put them in

4519
03:23:14,149 --> 03:23:19,159
on teas and it's free and you can you

4520
03:23:16,370 --> 03:23:21,470
can grow them yourself or you can

4521
03:23:19,159 --> 03:23:23,659
from nature or really another easy thing

4522
03:23:21,469 --> 03:23:25,939
if people are indoor growers you know

4523
03:23:23,659 --> 03:23:27,379
what we're all lacking and what soil is

4524
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:29,090
lacking and what cannabis plants are

4525
03:23:27,379 --> 03:23:31,969
lacking and health and well-being or

4526
03:23:29,090 --> 03:23:34,880
trace minerals and you can grow an aloe

4527
03:23:31,969 --> 03:23:37,219
plant in your indoor garden or in your

4528
03:23:34,879 --> 03:23:40,129
in your kitchen garden and you can add a

4529
03:23:37,219 --> 03:23:42,859
ton of trace minerals to it you know

4530
03:23:40,129 --> 03:23:44,689
that have 90 trace minerals there's 72

4531
03:23:42,860 --> 03:23:47,870
trace minerals in it and then you can

4532
03:23:44,690 --> 03:23:49,700
easily take those aloes Spears and then

4533
03:23:47,870 --> 03:23:52,280
we could either drink it or even add it

4534
03:23:49,700 --> 03:23:54,730
to our plants and then all the plant is

4535
03:23:52,280 --> 03:23:57,409
getting it easily accessible through

4536
03:23:54,729 --> 03:23:59,449
microbiology and soil it's all pretty

4537
03:23:57,409 --> 03:24:01,851
easy super good high compost is the

4538
03:23:59,450 --> 03:24:03,950
number one basis a question that came up

4539
03:24:01,851 --> 03:24:05,690
is when you're using the seeds you

4540
03:24:03,950 --> 03:24:07,070
mentioned cannabis and poppy seeds and

4541
03:24:05,690 --> 03:24:09,079
you're putting it into your fertilizer

4542
03:24:07,069 --> 03:24:11,029
or how are you using the seeds are you

4543
03:24:09,079 --> 03:24:12,739
sprouting them or you like are you doing

4544
03:24:11,030 --> 03:24:16,159
that first are you just using the seeds

4545
03:24:12,739 --> 03:24:18,289
as is someone was wondering you can you

4546
03:24:16,159 --> 03:24:19,940
can do either/or if you're gonna sprout

4547
03:24:18,290 --> 03:24:22,670
them you just want to sprout them up

4548
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:25,760
just a tiny bit so that the the

4549
03:24:22,670 --> 03:24:27,771
phosphorus is still really high from the

4550
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:29,960
seed you could blend the sprouts and use

4551
03:24:27,771 --> 03:24:31,940
and make it into a liquefied tea if you

4552
03:24:29,959 --> 03:24:34,039
had a lot of seeds you could grind it up

4553
03:24:31,940 --> 03:24:36,710
and use it as a top dress on your soil

4554
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:37,940
it should be really awesome and let the

4555
03:24:36,709 --> 03:24:40,100
roots come up and eat it

4556
03:24:37,940 --> 03:24:42,590
and it's easy to find hemp seeds so you

4557
03:24:40,101 --> 03:24:44,780
can just put them in a blender and top

4558
03:24:42,590 --> 03:24:47,000
dress over your soil which is really

4559
03:24:44,780 --> 03:24:49,851
nice to you a little bit there's lots of

4560
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:52,399
different ways that you can utilize seed

4561
03:24:49,851 --> 03:24:55,489
nutrients seed there's such an amazing

4562
03:24:52,399 --> 03:24:57,739
way to get all of our you know basic

4563
03:24:55,489 --> 03:24:59,149
minerals because they have everything

4564
03:24:57,739 --> 03:25:01,159
that they need to grow into a really

4565
03:24:59,149 --> 03:25:02,959
large plant at the at the beginning you

4566
03:25:01,159 --> 03:25:05,569
can utilize your cover crop like green

4567
03:25:02,959 --> 03:25:08,629
manure and just sprout it on the top and

4568
03:25:05,569 --> 03:25:10,940
and drop it you know throw it like that

4569
03:25:08,629 --> 03:25:13,279
big and pull it off and drop it on your

4570
03:25:10,940 --> 03:25:15,739
soil and let you know more microbiology

4571
03:25:13,280 --> 03:25:17,690
on the top layer your soil eat and live

4572
03:25:15,739 --> 03:25:20,690
off that so your cover crops that you

4573
03:25:17,690 --> 03:25:22,790
sprout on the top layer of your soil are

4574
03:25:20,690 --> 03:25:24,470
gonna have different nutrient mediums a

4575
03:25:22,790 --> 03:25:26,300
nutrient makeup so what you do is just

4576
03:25:24,469 --> 03:25:28,789
look at the nutrient makeup of all the

4577
03:25:26,299 --> 03:25:31,340
seeds that you're sprouting and utilize

4578
03:25:28,790 --> 03:25:33,300
those seeds in different cycles in order

4579
03:25:31,340 --> 03:25:35,450
to feed that into your

4580
03:25:33,299 --> 03:25:37,619
soil because you know the plants gonna

4581
03:25:35,450 --> 03:25:40,290
get different things out of the soil

4582
03:25:37,620 --> 03:25:41,880
based off its own based off its cycle so

4583
03:25:40,290 --> 03:25:43,590
if you can get in tune with the cycle

4584
03:25:41,879 --> 03:25:45,659
and what you're sprouting then using

4585
03:25:43,590 --> 03:25:48,420
seeds is a cover for the deficiencies it

4586
03:25:45,659 --> 03:25:50,430
into the deficiency is ever also just

4587
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:52,700
teased you can put you know your seeds

4588
03:25:50,430 --> 03:25:55,229
and teas and just ferment them in water

4589
03:25:52,700 --> 03:25:59,490
you know and utilize lactic acid

4590
03:25:55,228 --> 03:26:01,590
bacteria or e/m other cultures and it's

4591
03:25:59,489 --> 03:26:02,389
an incredible large worm home for that

4592
03:26:01,590 --> 03:26:08,719
question

4593
03:26:02,389 --> 03:26:08,719
[Laughter]

4594
03:26:10,969 --> 03:26:16,260
phosphate we choose not we're not

4595
03:26:13,379 --> 03:26:18,750
interested in traditional organics

4596
03:26:16,260 --> 03:26:21,270
letting the night and potash and

4597
03:26:18,750 --> 03:26:23,850
sulphate upon - we don't use those type

4598
03:26:21,270 --> 03:26:26,159
of charged minerals that are three can

4599
03:26:23,850 --> 03:26:28,380
you share why well because it's a the

4600
03:26:26,159 --> 03:26:31,680
the practice of gathering that out of a

4601
03:26:28,379 --> 03:26:33,750
mine alone is a problem I mean just the

4602
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:35,970
sulphate of potash would go to one go to

4603
03:26:33,750 --> 03:26:39,629
a mine it's like he takes two thighs

4604
03:26:35,969 --> 03:26:41,549
it's a really hot terrible place to work

4605
03:26:39,629 --> 03:26:43,139
with people with a bunch of lung

4606
03:26:41,549 --> 03:26:44,789
infections running around building

4607
03:26:43,139 --> 03:26:47,608
scaffold and trying to clean but it's

4608
03:26:44,790 --> 03:26:49,649
crazy it's basically crazy sauce and

4609
03:26:47,609 --> 03:26:51,989
then you put that into your and then

4610
03:26:49,648 --> 03:26:53,760
it's a charged element so it can be

4611
03:26:51,989 --> 03:26:56,010
organic it can be from the earth and

4612
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:58,020
stuff but it's charged up and your so

4613
03:26:56,010 --> 03:27:00,659
which can is to be left down there

4614
03:26:58,020 --> 03:27:02,850
reacts with the plant that way but what

4615
03:27:00,659 --> 03:27:05,100
we're saying is that even with bat guano

4616
03:27:02,850 --> 03:27:06,720
I mean there's a lot of reasons why not

4617
03:27:05,100 --> 03:27:08,609
to use bat guano maybe it's the

4618
03:27:06,719 --> 03:27:11,129
collection of the back dog treated late

4619
03:27:08,609 --> 03:27:13,350
maybe you realize as soon as they

4620
03:27:11,129 --> 03:27:15,389
started putting back wanto and ships and

4621
03:27:13,350 --> 03:27:17,040
putting in ships with potatoes and bring

4622
03:27:15,389 --> 03:27:18,689
them to Europe all the sudden million

4623
03:27:17,040 --> 03:27:20,670
people died cuz this crazy blight

4624
03:27:18,689 --> 03:27:23,120
happened and which is talking about

4625
03:27:20,670 --> 03:27:25,530
microbiology which is so important

4626
03:27:23,120 --> 03:27:29,579
different thing ya know what we want to

4627
03:27:25,530 --> 03:27:32,609
do is just be like word food ganja

4628
03:27:29,579 --> 03:27:34,409
poppies ten officials you know in our

4629
03:27:32,609 --> 03:27:36,540
soil and it's not a bunch of charged

4630
03:27:34,409 --> 03:27:38,850
minerals for us we're trying to say

4631
03:27:36,540 --> 03:27:42,420
alright we want the things that are

4632
03:27:38,850 --> 03:27:45,270
gonna react in a kind and gentle but yet

4633
03:27:42,420 --> 03:27:46,949
really easily a symbol and potent

4634
03:27:45,270 --> 03:27:48,180
I mean you can see our Instagram pages

4635
03:27:46,949 --> 03:27:50,039
are different planets and different

4636
03:27:48,180 --> 03:27:52,408
things we have giant plants we don't buy

4637
03:27:50,039 --> 03:27:57,029
things for our plants like our whole

4638
03:27:52,408 --> 03:27:58,889
entire farm is gross the local soil that

4639
03:27:57,029 --> 03:28:01,470
we've piled together in different ways

4640
03:27:58,889 --> 03:28:03,930
compost that we've made and huge weed

4641
03:28:01,469 --> 03:28:10,639
teas we're growing weeds with weed weed

4642
03:28:03,930 --> 03:28:13,199
weeds it's amazing yeah growing plants

4643
03:28:10,639 --> 03:28:15,269
and it's mean it's easier for the plant

4644
03:28:13,199 --> 03:28:17,399
to uptake so the idea is that you've got

4645
03:28:15,270 --> 03:28:19,109
this wonderful catalyst or or the

4646
03:28:17,398 --> 03:28:21,180
middleman and when you have the

4647
03:28:19,109 --> 03:28:23,189
middleman of a plant it's already up

4648
03:28:21,180 --> 03:28:25,139
taken everything that it needs from the

4649
03:28:23,189 --> 03:28:28,408
soil to then be able to give your plants

4650
03:28:25,139 --> 03:28:31,889
or give you so why are we going to this

4651
03:28:28,408 --> 03:28:34,020
basic raw mineral that we can't really

4652
03:28:31,889 --> 03:28:35,698
uptake and neither can the plan and it

4653
03:28:34,020 --> 03:28:38,130
takes a really long time for the soil

4654
03:28:35,699 --> 03:28:40,979
microbiology you know to break it down

4655
03:28:38,129 --> 03:28:43,469
you can utilize plants as a as a

4656
03:28:40,978 --> 03:28:45,478
catalyst for say magnesium you know as

4657
03:28:43,469 --> 03:28:48,420
an example of you can grow your own tiny

4658
03:28:45,478 --> 03:28:50,608
little alfalfa pot you can give your

4659
03:28:48,420 --> 03:28:52,889
alfalfa a tremendous amount of magnesium

4660
03:28:50,609 --> 03:28:55,439
and that's a plant that can up take

4661
03:28:52,889 --> 03:28:57,689
magnesium like in lots amounts so then

4662
03:28:55,439 --> 03:29:00,389
you can cut it three times a year and

4663
03:28:57,689 --> 03:29:02,550
make a ferment out of it make a raw brew

4664
03:29:00,389 --> 03:29:09,028
out of it but you know a chop dress out

4665
03:29:02,549 --> 03:29:10,948
of it sure is what you do it and it's

4666
03:29:09,029 --> 03:29:12,510
just easy gardening and farming you're

4667
03:29:10,949 --> 03:29:14,578
not driving anywhere you're not having

4668
03:29:12,510 --> 03:29:16,529
to do anything and people are able to do

4669
03:29:14,578 --> 03:29:19,139
this in indoor scenarios as well it's

4670
03:29:16,529 --> 03:29:21,689
not just for a farm we've been working

4671
03:29:19,139 --> 03:29:23,969
with really large indoor facilities to

4672
03:29:21,689 --> 03:29:26,970
learn to grow their own nutrients and

4673
03:29:23,969 --> 03:29:28,528
create closed-loop systems that are

4674
03:29:26,969 --> 03:29:30,868
working and they're on like you know

4675
03:29:28,529 --> 03:29:33,569
they're their tenth run and they're in

4676
03:29:30,869 --> 03:29:36,149
large recreational indoor facilities and

4677
03:29:33,568 --> 03:29:38,818
and they're having tremendous you know

4678
03:29:36,148 --> 03:29:41,309
growth and possibilities and health from

4679
03:29:38,818 --> 03:29:43,469
you know what people thought was never

4680
03:29:41,309 --> 03:29:44,850
possible and they're doing it cheaply

4681
03:29:43,469 --> 03:29:46,679
along with everyone in the pure

4682
03:29:44,850 --> 03:29:48,328
certified family and the pure farmers

4683
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:53,279
that are doing all this amazing work out

4684
03:29:48,328 --> 03:29:56,639
there I mean we're providing ways to

4685
03:29:53,279 --> 03:29:58,460
grow indoors with soil tests with lab

4686
03:29:56,639 --> 03:30:00,889
tests everything Pru

4687
03:29:58,459 --> 03:30:03,319
to work were utilizing natural outdoor

4688
03:30:00,889 --> 03:30:05,840
systems were utilizing indoors and

4689
03:30:03,319 --> 03:30:07,789
commercial settings and utilizing in the

4690
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:09,680
outdoor so it's not just a thing that

4691
03:30:07,790 --> 03:30:13,100
can only happen far away in the

4692
03:30:09,680 --> 03:30:14,120
mountains on barns it can happen end or

4693
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:16,460
indoors as well

4694
03:30:14,120 --> 03:30:18,200
I mean bonemeal is another thing you

4695
03:30:16,459 --> 03:30:19,849
know you that that's a crazy thing to

4696
03:30:18,200 --> 03:30:22,490
put in your soil I mean where does that

4697
03:30:19,850 --> 03:30:24,500
come from and really I mean do you know

4698
03:30:22,489 --> 03:30:27,020
blood meal you should think about

4699
03:30:24,500 --> 03:30:28,670
organic farms are utilizing massive

4700
03:30:27,020 --> 03:30:31,250
amounts of blood and bone meal I mean

4701
03:30:28,670 --> 03:30:33,829
you wouldn't believe the amounts that

4702
03:30:31,250 --> 03:30:35,930
organic farmers are utilizing you know

4703
03:30:33,829 --> 03:30:38,539
that are all certified organic and and

4704
03:30:35,930 --> 03:30:40,790
not only I mean you can think about what

4705
03:30:38,540 --> 03:30:43,010
what is it like when a when a steak sits

4706
03:30:40,790 --> 03:30:44,960
out for you know a few hours as opposed

4707
03:30:43,010 --> 03:30:47,000
to what an apple looks like when it sits

4708
03:30:44,959 --> 03:30:50,419
out for a few hours and the difference

4709
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:53,360
is between those smells you know meat

4710
03:30:50,420 --> 03:30:55,190
and and things that are from animals are

4711
03:30:53,360 --> 03:30:58,540
going to really draw they become a

4712
03:30:55,190 --> 03:31:01,340
prebiotic for pathogens as opposed to

4713
03:30:58,540 --> 03:31:03,050
plants become a prebiotic for more

4714
03:31:01,340 --> 03:31:06,319
beneficials not that they can't be a

4715
03:31:03,049 --> 03:31:08,539
prebiotic for for pathogens but that's

4716
03:31:06,319 --> 03:31:10,129
why you know it's so important that if

4717
03:31:08,540 --> 03:31:12,470
you're going to continuously add those

4718
03:31:10,129 --> 03:31:15,609
things into your soil that really you're

4719
03:31:12,469 --> 03:31:18,260
not drawing a beneficial microbiology

4720
03:31:15,610 --> 03:31:20,989
symbiotic relationship in your soil

4721
03:31:18,260 --> 03:31:22,728
that's going to help you long term you

4722
03:31:20,989 --> 03:31:24,530
know we know that we're feeding microbes

4723
03:31:22,728 --> 03:31:26,209
we're not feeding our plants so we know

4724
03:31:24,530 --> 03:31:28,280
that on microbes are feeding or so so

4725
03:31:26,209 --> 03:31:30,139
what microbes do we want to feed you

4726
03:31:28,280 --> 03:31:34,190
know we have to think about those

4727
03:31:30,139 --> 03:31:37,459
populations and phosphorus and potassium

4728
03:31:34,190 --> 03:31:39,649
are one of the harder things to access

4729
03:31:37,459 --> 03:31:41,119
when it comes to farming so that person

4730
03:31:39,649 --> 03:31:43,459
who asked that question is asking a

4731
03:31:41,120 --> 03:31:46,520
really good question because you know

4732
03:31:43,459 --> 03:31:51,769
it's usually a lot of finished off bad

4733
03:31:46,520 --> 03:31:53,569
you know well harmful or things that

4734
03:31:51,770 --> 03:31:55,100
take a lot to produce you know those

4735
03:31:53,569 --> 03:31:58,279
type of things so what we're just

4736
03:31:55,100 --> 03:32:01,340
utilizing is natural systems

4737
03:31:58,280 --> 03:32:03,530
lots of compost roots and and that's

4738
03:32:01,340 --> 03:32:05,750
what that's the alternative the

4739
03:32:03,530 --> 03:32:08,450
alternative to it and so the vitality

4740
03:32:05,750 --> 03:32:11,959
comes through the but you know plants

4741
03:32:08,450 --> 03:32:18,021
growth still to full potential

4742
03:32:11,959 --> 03:32:18,020
and then your systems can last longer oh

4743
03:32:19,101 --> 03:32:26,569
great great comprehensive answer guys

4744
03:32:22,351 --> 03:32:29,400
thank you so we're gonna wrap you on it

out more about the p r-- certification

4762
03:33:10,920 --> 03:33:15,389
and what that means and what pure farms

4763
03:33:13,620 --> 03:33:17,210
are out there they can find that out on

4764

there's a lot of people doing amazing

4766
03:33:19,469 --> 03:33:24,539
we're providing really amazing that's an

4767
03:33:21,620 --> 03:33:26,880
ecologically seven way one more question

4768
03:33:24,540 --> 03:33:29,460
for you guys from the chat people were

4769
03:33:26,879 --> 03:33:32,729
wondering do you add what do you think

4770
03:33:29,459 --> 03:33:35,850
about adding external microbes such as

4771
03:33:32,729 --> 03:33:37,590
mammoths PE or soil balance those type

4772
03:33:35,851 --> 03:33:39,630
products do you use anything like that

4773
03:33:37,590 --> 03:33:42,601
or do you just make your own tea blends

4774
03:33:39,629 --> 03:33:45,449
and stick to your own micro blends well

4775
03:33:42,601 --> 03:33:47,579
for our own property we utilize all the

4776
03:33:45,450 --> 03:33:49,140
indigenous microorganisms here because

4777
03:33:47,579 --> 03:33:52,351
we're trying to create beneficial

4778
03:33:49,139 --> 03:33:54,329
you know intelligence here on our

4779
03:33:52,351 --> 03:33:56,760
property you know we see your your

4780
03:33:54,329 --> 03:33:59,159
entire property as a micro biome you

4781
03:33:56,760 --> 03:34:01,920
know and we're creating the intelligence

4782
03:33:59,159 --> 03:34:06,090
here on our property but for our for our

4783
03:34:01,920 --> 03:34:08,219
products we go out and buy beneficial

4784
03:34:06,090 --> 03:34:10,560
microbiology and then add it to our

4785
03:34:08,219 --> 03:34:12,600
herbs as we were explaining before and

4786
03:34:10,560 --> 03:34:15,479
the most important part of your question

4787
03:34:12,601 --> 03:34:18,329
is just to make sure that you know where

4788
03:34:15,479 --> 03:34:21,180
that microbiology is coming from and you

4789
03:34:18,329 --> 03:34:24,120
know how it's made often these are made

4790
03:34:21,180 --> 03:34:24,560
on you know GMO substrates or often it's

4791
03:34:24,120 --> 03:34:26,061
pretty

4792
03:34:24,560 --> 03:34:28,520
and really large facilities that are

4793
03:34:26,060 --> 03:34:30,501
really unhealthy for the planet so it's

4794
03:34:28,521 --> 03:34:32,631
important to really find out how its

4795
03:34:30,501 --> 03:34:35,960
produced and and the company that stands

4796
03:34:32,630 --> 03:34:37,430
behind it so and if it's preserved if

4797
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:39,590
it's in liquid sometimes there's

4798
03:34:37,431 --> 03:34:42,950
preservatives and liquid so it's always

4799
03:34:39,591 --> 03:34:45,829
best to use raw materials to feed your

4800
03:34:42,950 --> 03:34:46,909
microbes so I mean if you don't have raw

4801
03:34:45,829 --> 03:34:49,101
material if you think you're out of

4802
03:34:46,909 --> 03:34:51,079
balance of microbes I mean maybe you

4803
03:34:49,101 --> 03:34:52,971
shouldn't get a soil test but to know

4804
03:34:51,079 --> 03:34:56,739
for sure or maybe you just know because

4805
03:34:52,970 --> 03:35:03,109
you can cuz you know but yeah

4806
03:34:56,739 --> 03:35:07,040
preservatives or another thing thank you

4807
03:35:03,110 --> 03:35:09,801
and I appreciate you Thurston thinking

4808
03:35:07,040 --> 03:35:12,079
of all these different points of how

4809
03:35:09,800 --> 03:35:14,239
your even your raw materials that you're

4810
03:35:12,079 --> 03:35:16,700
putting into your your substrates how

4811
03:35:14,239 --> 03:35:18,290
those are processed and I mean again you

4812
03:35:16,700 --> 03:35:19,761
have to think of all these issues and it

4813
03:35:18,290 --> 03:35:22,729
gets complicated because you even have

4814
03:35:19,761 --> 03:35:24,200
to think of the people that are making

4815
03:35:22,729 --> 03:35:26,149
these things and all right you know

4816
03:35:24,200 --> 03:35:30,971
