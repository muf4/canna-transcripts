7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,880
the link copy the link for the new chat

8
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,359
and then I got to post it into the old

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,480
chat and then you know what else you

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,560
have to do actually if I don't post

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,559
something in the chat

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,039
it

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,399
doesn't it actually just sits there with

14
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,960
nobody able to type I did that for about

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:44,280
20 minutes last uh last week so Eden I

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,960
have a question for you yes

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:53,198
sir uh have you ever seen a variety that

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,120
was extremely high in CBD like 20

19
00:00:53,198 --> 00:01:00,920
25% which had less than

20
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,640
3% THC

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,478
uh not that I'm aware of unless there

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,640
was a hemp varietal I was working with

23
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,640
back in the day

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,680
no what where was that question coming

25
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,959
from Sam yeah what what genetic is this

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,040
well it's just that uh there are people

27
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:23,959
who claim they have varieties which are

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:28,280
20 25% or even higher of CBD and they

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:33,239
say it had zero or really a tiny amount

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:37,599
of uh uh THC but the trouble is that

31
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:42,000
even if there's not a THC synthes making

32
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:46,959
THC for the plant the CBD synthase

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,519
produces about a 20 to 25 to one ratio

34
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:56,839
of THC so even if there's zero THC

35
00:01:51,519 --> 00:02:01,478
synthes CBD synthes makes some THC and a

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:05,600
25% that would be equal to about 1%

37
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:09,758
THC so it's biologically

38
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:13,199
impossible am am I still you're you're

39
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,318
oh so either I was frozen or you were

40
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,919
frozen so you're saying it was

41
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:21,119
biologically

42
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:24,039
impossible as far as I know

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,000
yes duly noted and I will keep an eye

44
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,679
out for that and people were watching

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,680
I'm I'm pretty clever with this stuff so

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,239
yeah I I would say you yes yes anybody

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,360
else that would be a little skeptical

48
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,400
but you yeah you're the master

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
geneticist of Master geneticist so I

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,039
would say yeah I

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,400
agree I'm just liking how clear his

52
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,719
voice is today it's all like loud and

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,120
clear and it's in my ears good the last

54
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,039
couple of weeks Sam's been in a tube

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,840
like at a distance from his microphone

56
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,120
so you sound great today

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,200

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,439

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,560
you a hug man that's such a long time

88
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,159
coming and dude you know it's a long

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,759
time coming it's it's also you know like

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,680
look this this isn't this isn't six-star

91
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,439
hash this isn't me being done this isn't

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,280
even under my own brand this is under a

93
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,439
brand Hank that we created for a

94
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,799
mid-grade brand for me mid-grade is

95
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,759
almost 70% THC in this particular hash

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
what makes it mid-grade to me is the

97
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,720
tpine content is not high enough I would

98
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,758
love a 10 to 12% this is like around

99
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,639
four so it's you know at room

100
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,160
temperature it's also been kept cold but

101
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,199
I left it overnight so now it's got that

102
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,800
nice Afghan flavor to it when it comes

103
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,280
out of the fridge you know at 4% tpin

104
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,000
you're not going to smell much because

105
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:03,239
everything's kind of slowed down it does

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,918
bubble um uh and melt in my Banger I can

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,960
vaporize it I wouldn't put it past a

108
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,478
fourstar personally so from a

109
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,079
perspective of Bubble Man The

110
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,199
Connoisseur of course I want to release

111
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,198
six plus star bubble hash but from the

112
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,919
perspective of the amount of sheer work

113
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,360
and and obstacles and burning Hoops that

114
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:26,240
I had to jump through just to make this

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,240
available and of course I'm so spoiled

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,879
when it comes to Hash that I'm sure 90%

117
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,879
of people are going to be like dude this

118
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,399
is some of the nicest hash in the market

119
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:39,600
right now but for me as a person I'm

120
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,879
like we have a we have a long way to go

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,560
so I've been uh already since this

122
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,478
released I've already been in touch with

123
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,600
some craft Growers we're going to look

124
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,359
at doing some fresh frozen we're just

125
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,160
going to try and oh it does have a nice

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840
smell though as it's open under my nose

127
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,880
that old school just Afghan kind of

128
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,879
flavor looks pretty darn nice I think uh

129
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,199
Johnny B ended up going and getting one

130
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,600
as well

131
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,038
I'm g hit some in my Banger right now I

132
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,960
got three coming and it um I went away

133
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,439
on Friday at one o'clock and came back

134
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,318
at two and when I got back there was a

135
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,839
card in the mail I was [ __ ] mad so I

136
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,919
went to the Shoppers yesterday to try

137
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,959

00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,879
morning at 11:00 a.m. I'm going to go

140
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,919
and pick up your hash I got one gram to

141
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,800
squish one gram to smoke and one gram to

142
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,639
put away because that's just me nice

143
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,400

144
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,918
Cannabis stores because I wanted one

145
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,198
right away of course that's not getting

146
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,120
here until the 99th or the 10th of March

147
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:40,639

158
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,080
funny to meet people in the industry who

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,639
are you know come from this super high

160
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,079
level and they want to get this thing to

161
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,800
a certain level but you are forced to

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,000
retake all the steps to get to that

163
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
level you don't just get to jump into

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the legal uh realm and then hope that

165
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,840
everyone's growing cannabis that's good

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,839
enough and and all this sort of thing so

167
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,878
we're we're pretty excited to be in the

168
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:28,519
game we're pretty stoked to have you

169
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,800
know Hank in the marketplace uh a high

170
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,918
THC and a mid phc what I really did was

171
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,280
I just broke up the microns you know I

172
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:40,839
put like uh I put my 73 my 90 my 120 and

173
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,359
my 45 into this which is called um a

174
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:45,959
high THC and I put the 190 the 160 and

175
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,000
the 25 into the mid-grade all of them

176
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,799
being golden hash none of them being

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,279
full of contaminant they all came out

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,158
pretty decent but that's why there's a

179
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,439
massive uh sort of price difference in

180
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,918
between the two grades whereas the THC

181
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,439
difference doesn't seem as massive you

182
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:01,959
know these are more things I was forced

183
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,839
into would I have loved to have released

184
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,598
a 90 Micron uh absolutely would this

185
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,839
have gone from a fourstar to maybe a

186
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,878
five-star had I isolated the microns and

187
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,439
sold them separately quite possibly I

188
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,560
think the 90 probably would have been

189
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:18,680
there but then I have to pay a $1,500

190
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,839
COA for every single Micron that I that

191
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:26,038
I yeah $1,500 COA with full you know

192
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,598
microbials with Tarpin with canabo with

193
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:32,360
fungicides and pesticides very expensive

194
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:36,000
um but forced to do that and also take

195
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,519
out like 10 plus grams of the product to

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,918
sort of you know send that off it's not

197
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,679
as as cheap as as we would like it to be

198
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,519
so there's minor things where we're

199
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,319
forced and then there's you know as best

200
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,879
that we can do we kind of try to figure

201
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,320
it out so uh all in all pretty stoked to

202
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,679
uh have a little Hank bubble rip with

203
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,360
the hash churches here in the morning so

204
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,679
I'm going to mute my mic and torch my

205
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,519
bowl and uh Marcus the amount you have

206
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:07,439
to uh send off you said 10 grams is that

207
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,240
whether it's weed or hash or whatever

208
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,120
because with weed you know that's only

209
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,360
uh you know a little bit of THC actually

210
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,240
whereas with hash that's a whole lot of

211
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,120
THC yes agreed we're trying our best to

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,680
kind of get you know the regulatory

213
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,200
framework lined up with the QA people so

214
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:32,559
they realize look like 10 grams of hash

215
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,640
is a lot more than 10 grams of of of

216
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,239
flour and we need to we need to identify

217
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,240
those differences uh big time yeah this

218
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
is part um there's also there's also

219
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,879
something we keep we have to retain

220
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,039
samples as well and that's like 20 to 30

221
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:51,000
grams that go in the vault and sit there

222
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,958
basically forever so it's uh you know

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,240
they take your margin and they just do

224
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,759
this to it

225
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,360
slowly slowly now keep in mind 20 GS

226
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,559
that you put in the vault uh is that

227
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,800
Frozen or refrigerated or otherwise it's

228
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,479
going to change a

229
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:11,278
lot exactly yeah well we keep it as cold

230
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,600
as we possibly can but these are things

231
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,320
that we've been noticing as well that

232
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,360
the regulatory framework doesn't have a

233
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
deep understanding of and it's not like

234
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,839
we're going to be testing it all the

235
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,519
time but yeah they keep it for retention

236
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,839
in case anything ever goes wrong in case

237
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,839
they ever find something that's wrong

238
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,920
with that

239
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,640
lot we need to be able to go into the

240
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,240
Vault and pull that out and uh go

241
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:35,919
through it if you remove the oxygen and

242
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,959
freeze it at like minus 30 Centigrade

243
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,559
then it does not change really hardly at

244
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,399
all in 10

245
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,319
years I I agree I've seen the exact same

246
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,039
thing from my own freezer um and then uh

247
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Jeremy spoke about that last week as

248
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,838
well in regards to using potential noble

249
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,720
noble gases to uh well removing the

250
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,079
oxygen and then replacing with um

251
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,720
nitrogen argon nitrogen yeah there's a

252
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,479
variety of uh of noble gases that you

253
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,399
can use but what you speak toward Marcus

254
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,120
is a reality I think a lot of us are

255
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,759
facing is we're finding these regulatory

256
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,519
loopholes that we're forced to deal with

257
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:17,000
because we're in the overregulation uh

258
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:21,078
Commodities of of the reality and I mean

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,200
$1,500 per COA I mean Jesus that is

260
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:27,479
just yeah I mean for micron pricon

261
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,600
that's that's just absolutely ludicrous

262
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,920
well that's why I'm forced do you how

263
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,560
hard it was for me to put the microns

264
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,838
together they like we got to they got

265
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,799
they're like we need only two grades and

266
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,519
I was like whoa what they're like we

267
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,479
need two grades I'm like listen I can't

268
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,039
do two grades it has to be three I have

269
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,360
to take the 220 out and keep that as

270
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,958
like you know and then of course they

271
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,278
wanted me to destroy the 220 which came

272
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:55,599
out at 48% THC I was like no I'm not

273
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,320
destroying the the 4 the two the 220

274
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,639
what we need to do is create some Sops

275
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,480
and some pcps that allow us to take the

276
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,079
material once it's been worked put it

277
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,920
back into the Vault so I can send it

278
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,599
over to Mike West on the other side and

279
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,759
uh have him do you know CO2 or

280
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,639
hydrocarbon or one of the solvent

281
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,159
extractions on that because holy smokes

282
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,759
can you imagine like 49% yields when you

283
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,838
run your material versus like 10 to 15

284
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,519
or 3 to five like some of these hemp

285
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,199
guys so the other thing the other thing

286
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,679
that extractors are doing is when they

287
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:35,000
don't have enough of Any Given product

288
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:39,479
whether it's flowers or water sift or

289
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,399
whatever they mix it then squash it and

290
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,320
it's all just one homogeneous

291
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,879
mix yes so they can get one single COA

292
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,760
Port bubble man is there is there an

293
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:54,639
appeal process or a process of Education

294
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,759
you can make them aware that they will

295
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,839
actually take hold or they're just the

296
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,679
system is what it is you deal with it no

297
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,560
the system is like all systems we've

298
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,078
always had to educate the system like

299
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:08,958
this is what all of us have been doing

300
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:11,439
for for 25 to 30 years some of us longer

301
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,359
um this is the system this is the system

302
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,880
requires self-education and so we will

303
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,600
do this but when you've climbed up to

304
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,958
the almost peak of the mountain and then

305
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,879
you kind of fall off the end and realize

306
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,000
oh like okay we're in this regulatory

307
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,198
framework now but I'm not where I wanted

308
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,679
to be I'm down here now so there's a a

309
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:34,479
massive appeal that needs to be made and

310
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,159
not just in education it's like the

311
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
knowledge needs to go not just from the

312
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,120
government folks but into the people who

313
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,479
own the companies into the understanding

314
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,879
of living soils and regenerative farming

315
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,680
practices and living biomes that produce

316
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,519
those precursors that Express the tpin

317
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,919
to the point that we actually want them

318
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,919
at to get to a system that's not only

319
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:57,919
representative of THC percentage but

320
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,679
actually gets into some of the other

321
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,278
components of the plan

322
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,879
to be able to allow people and not

323
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:08,639
handcuff them into being able to succeed

324
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,919
in this industry rather than fail and

325
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,198
right now people are up against a lot

326
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,838
the regulatory framework is absolutely

327
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:19,439
incredible and I'm not complaining about

328
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,839
the framework I'm just mildly bummed out

329
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,519
that for the last 25 to 30 years we

330
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,360
spent all this time sort of preaching to

331
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,360
the choir and now the choir's gotten off

332
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,639
the stage the doors have opened at the

333
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,278
back and now we have all of society

334
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,079
actually listening but they're listening

335
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,958
back down at this level they're not

336
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:43,198
coming in up here we need to come back

337
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,679
down to a reasonable level and hold all

338
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,599
these hands that we that we basically

339
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,799
begged to you know to be a part of this

340
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,639
and to to to come into this with open

341
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,439
arms now we have to very patiently you

342
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,799
know be like okay well look this can't

343
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,680
be like this because this is hindering

344
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,319
the ability to grow living soils and

345
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,879
this can't be like this because the

346
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,519
excessive packaging and testing uh is

347
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,519
keeping certain products from the market

348
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,159
and this can't be like this and so you

349
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,000
know they're not evil they're not like

350
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,600
out to get us I really don't believe

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,799
that I've spoken with quite a few of

352
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,600
these people they're just people that

353
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,479
literally were in the wine industry two

354
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,759
and a half years ago and now they're in

355
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,039
the Cannabis industry you know feeling

356
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,278
like they want to do the same thing so

357
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:32,360
you know what it is Marcus that they

358
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:34,958
want to air on the side of safety so

359
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,639
it's going to take a long while to drag

360
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:42,838
them to see what makes sense like 20

361
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:47,839
grams of of 80% THC hash is not the same

362
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:51,319
as 20 grams of uh 20% weed I mean that's

363
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,759
just reality we know it yeah yeah I I

364
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,278
agree I agree and someone said you are

365
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,959
complaining about the framework well

366
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,639
certainly some of the framework I'm

367
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,198
complaining about we need to fix that as

368
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,198
we always have we fought and and

369
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,159
practiced Civil Disobedience to levels

370
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,159
of such excessiveness to get the

371
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,639
framework that we have now well we're

372
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,519
certainly not going to just stop and and

373
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,318
and stick with what we have now it needs

374
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,560
to be it needs to be bettered but within

375
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,439
the framework itself you also have

376
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,958
people who think they're going to grow

377
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,800
amazing cannabis with shitty techniques

378
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,919
and without the the awareness and the

379
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,039
compassion and the love that really is

380
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,198
required so there's education that needs

381
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,838
to go there that has nothing to do with

382
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,318
framework um you know just all sorts of

383
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,920
people coming in to commoditize um

384
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:38,318
cannabis we need to make sure that

385
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,759
happens the right way and doesn't happen

386
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,879
the wrong way so I think there's

387
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,278
complaints uh to be had there and uh all

388
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,480
in all don't get me wrong I'm absolutely

389
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,720

00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,399

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,038
that what I want to see is everybody

433
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:52,200
able to smoke the equivalent of

434
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,079
99.9% dry sift whether it's water hash

435
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,880
whether it's

436
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:59,839
rosm how it's made is not as important

437
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,640
as that it's clean safe and uh suitable

438
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,918
for

439
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,038
consumers Sam did you ever think you

440
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:10,080
would see this in your

441
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:13,200
lifetime I I'm surprised it took so long

442
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:16,158
I under Carter we thought we were G to

443
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,440
get this you know move towards it he

444
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,200
promised decriminalization and then the

445
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,720
whole

446
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,279
Bourne uh setup where uh the drugs are

447
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,960
well he wasn't a drugs are he was the

448
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,519
drug advisor or whatever he was you know

449
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,519
he he got popped and everything

450
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:37,279
everything went skewy and uh we honestly

451
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,200
expected in 76 we would have full

452
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,480
Federal decriminalization or even

453
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,120
better and if it hadn't been for Keith

454
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,240
stro it probably could have happened but

455
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,879
you know unfortunately he thought he was

456
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,720
doing the right thing but it was not the

457
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,039
right thing and it set us back a couple

458
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,360
of

459
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,400
decades you guys yeah please atan for

460
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,479
those who don't know Keith strop was the

461
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,200
head of normal normal was actually

462
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,159
started with a $200,000 donation from uh

463
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Hugh

464
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,200
Hefner and so needless to say he was a

465
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:16,599
huge supporter but um at an event

466
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,798
apparently um key stro did lines of coke

467
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:22,279
with the actual drug advisor for the

468
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,558
president and basically came out and

469
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,200
went straight to the media and said hey

470
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,399
it's time to legalize you I just did

471
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,840
lines of coke with the you know the drug

472
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,679
here he was really annoyed because of

473
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:38,798
the whole paraquat thing and uh that was

474
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,519
the Tipping Point in his his mind if

475
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:44,240
they could spray poison on our cannabis

476
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,200
then why the [ __ ] are we protecting them

477
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,558
if they're going to be taking drugs you

478
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,960
know but uh yeah it's snitching just

479
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,319
ain't a good thing well there were they

480
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,120
were killing people and that's why they

481
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,359
were upset paraquat was killing and

482
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:02,439
harming people because of the government

483
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,839
uh zealously to you know continue its

484
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,679
prohibition policies and they started

485
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:10,480
spraying poison on uh cannabis and it

486
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,240
started affecting people's lives so I

487
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,079
understand the anger however as well as

488
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,000
the the wanting to change it and the

489
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,960
vitral going along with it but you know

490
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,159
Keith's decision uh ended up you know

491
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,600
costing us decades well he Keith's

492
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,559
feelings were correct his actions were

493
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,199
not

494
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:35,038
dude I had no idea I honestly am not

495
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,759
going to lie when you opened up your

496
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,720
mouth at Chan those are not the words I

497
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,038
thought you were gonna say about Keith

498
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,839
strob holy

499
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,798
[ __ ] hey I got no problem being not nice

500
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,199
to people who weren't kind I mean I know

501
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,759
he worked hard and he has tried to write

502
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,919
the wrong that he did he he done a lot

503
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:58,759
for cannabis but he he also put one of

504
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,080
the biggest foot in the mouth of the

505
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,640
I don't even know what to say I mean

506
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:07,158
Carter had all but promised and then it

507
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,679
just completely fell to

508
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,679
dust yeah I mean look Willie smoked on

509
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,360
top of the roof of the White House etc

510
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,559
etc so you know this is why we've had to

511
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,558
continue to fight is because of the fear

512
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,960
and the ignorance and the perpetuation

513
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,240
of this drug war and you know drug

514
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,120
Warriors meant their best but you know

515
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,919
we screwed up and we [ __ ] up along the

516
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,558
way to the point where we've had to

517
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,880
continue to fix things and we're still

518
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,558
still dealing with the Fallout and the

519
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,440
picking up and we're still not there yet

520
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:39,000
I mean we've done it in the 10th

521
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,600
Amendment you know States but nationally

522
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,880
you know we're we're working I myself at

523
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:48,319
Chen I look forward to Federal Beyond

524
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,600
decriminalization true legalization

525
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:54,079
where Interstate Commerce is allowed to

526
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,678
happen International

527
00:22:54,079 --> 00:23:00,278
Commerce I want Lebanese hash I want

528
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,000
okay but let's start with interstate and

529
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:06,200
then move on to I mean Canada's right

530
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,880
there and I'm sure Canada would love for

531
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,880
us to grow all the weed for

532
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,519
Canada said no no Canadian ever well we

533
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,079
used to grow quite a bit for you guys so

534
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,440
I mean we don't mind it going back and

535
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,639
forth let's keep it

536
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,080
synergistic I would be in Hawaii and

537
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,880
people would uh bring me BC bud and say

538
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,558
Yan this is Dei WWI

539
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,120
I want to know why they had a Jamaican

540
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:38,038
accent in in Hawaii and they had BC the

541
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,239
Jamaicans day everywhere the herb is M

542
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:44,278
all right this is a perfect segue into

543
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:48,558
rest in peace Mr Livingston the final

544
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:50,558

545
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,038
and and my goodness I don't know of you

546

any of you that actually know the whole

547
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,759
story but his wife went missing uh a

548
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,158
while ago she just wandered off and no

549
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,720
nobody has been able to find her for a

550
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,159
very long time uh and then bunny just

551
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,038
recently passed I was lucky enough to

552
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,840
see bunny many many times in concert was

553
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,519
lucky enough to puff with him and meet

554
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:13,798
him and be at his house and uh he was a

555
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:16,759
super Tripper and uh yeah the last of

556
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:21,319

the good herbs enjoying the good music I

560
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,679
can only imagine the music that is being

561
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,119
produced in the

562
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,559

594
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:04,240

really nice guys too totally yesterday

605
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:35,240
Clinton Fon who's I guess living in

606
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,759
Seattle uh did a little um sort of uh I

607
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,038
guess it was you know in honor of of uh

608
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,240
bunny uh and he just had his acoustic

609
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:44,440
guitar and that's another incredible

610
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,440
reae artist that you know the guy by

611
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,759
himself in his living room sounds so

612
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:53,519
full his voice is so perfect his tone is

613
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:55,919
is is just perfection and then he's just

614
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,558
playing beautiful acoustic guitar um he

615
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,759
did like three or four songs but for

616
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,000
those of you that don't know Clinton

617
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,960
fear on uh he had his own band The

618
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,759
Boogie Brown Band um couple of great

619
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,038
albums that you can that you can

620
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,038
download um I can't remember it was

621
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:12,640
something about the devil uh don't

622
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:14,720
disturb the Devil is a really good album

623
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,399
with Clinton me and the wife were in the

624
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,558
grill uh either the last time or the

625
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:22,319
time before I don't remember because

626
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:26,200
they all get kind of blurred but uh we

627
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:28,398
were there uh at I forget the name of

628
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,440
the place it's the really big V you

629
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:36,398
there on the beach uh for when you go

630
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,320
south of town but Alfred maybe

631
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:42,119
or it doesn't really matter but the end

632
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:44,038
effect was bunny was performing he

633
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:48,479
jumped off the

634
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:50,919
stage gave my wife a big kiss and then

635
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,038
uh you know shook hands with a few other

636
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,360
people and stuff like that and then jump

637
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,319
back up there but uh it really made my

638
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,719
wife's uh night

639
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,319
oh yeah I could imagine she would be

640
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,480
stoked on that I could imagine why he

641
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,119
would do that too because no one is

642
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,679
beaming more love than your wife while

643
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,439
dancing to reggae music like truly I've

644
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,960
been at regae shows with your wife and

645
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,919
she really is in heaven when she's at a

646
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,079
great reggae show particularly from one

647
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,000
of the reggae Elders because we we went

648
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,759
to quite a few reggae shows together and

649
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,200
she was always like there's no way the

650
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:31,398
person the artist on stage didn't see

651
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,960
her

652
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:36,518
beaming

653
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:40,120
yeah like you said we we've seen more

654
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:43,558
than a 100 or 200 I don't even know how

655
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:46,959
many Reay shows uh you know e even some

656
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:49,759
of the early uh Bob wher ones we saw him

657
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,159
perform twice in Santa Cruz at Pacific

658
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,558
there and it was amazing amazing shows

659
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,159
and you could easily see the difference

660
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:01,278
between the uh show that was about 3 or

661
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,320
4 years before his death and the one

662
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,038
that was a year or two before his death

663
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,558
he just did not have the energy or the

664
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:10,440
pizaz that he had from his previous

665
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,918
shows you could tell he was running out

666
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,360
of

667
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,000
steam yeah it's amazing that you got to

668
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,798
see him pre- running out of steam and a

669
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,398
little bit running out of steam that's

670
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:24,440
that's I just can't even imagine someone

671
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:27,398
said uh Steel Pulse guys are super chill

672
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,399
yes I'm I'm lack to farai I got to meet

673
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:32,079
those guys back stage at the I can't

674
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,959
even remember it was in Amsterdam with

675
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,158
Rob and I I had my two-foot rure in the

676
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,720
crowd and so Rob kind of found me and we

677
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,519
just took bong rips through the whole

678
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,360
show while Rob told me a cool story he's

679
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,679
like I know the bass player really well

680
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,719
I won't share the story because it's

681
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,600
Rob's story to share but he was like we

682
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,839
should go backstage after the show and

683
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,678
and bump into him and uh wow the guy was

684
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,439
very receptive to Rob they were

685
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,200
definitely brothers from another mother

686
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,000
he stopped everything when he saw Rob

687
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,640
and ran over and gave him a big hug they

688
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,640
have an incredible history they were

689
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,038
friends both here and further south yeah

690
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,600
yeah exactly so uh it was that was also

691
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,599
a cool experience to just be like I like

692
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,839
meeting kind of bands that I adore and

693
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,240
love in that situation I never want to

694
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,839
go backstage as the Rando like meet and

695
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,319
greet guy and just be like I don't know

696
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,558
those guys weren't as nice as I thought

697
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,398
it's like well no [ __ ] dude you like

698
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:29,000
interrupted them while they were working

699
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,119
like that's the truth Marcus and a lot

700
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,679
of people don't understand that that's

701
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,479
they that's the they're showing up to

702
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,038
work tonight you're you're yeah it's not

703
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,839
the same it's it's not the same but when

704
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:42,079
you meet them with a friend you know

705
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,319
like that that becomes quite different

706
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,278
and that's you know of course we all

707
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,480
want to meet these amazing musicians

708
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,038
that have inspired our lives and like

709
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,759
you know created the backdrop for the

710
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:54,119
soundtrack of Our Lives of course you

711
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,278
want to meet those guys and give them

712
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,239
high fives and respect and be like man I

713

714
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,399
to be supportive of you but there's

715
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,240
definitely a right way to do it and a

716
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,518
wrong way to do it and Uh I leared that

717
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,319
many you right when he would fly into

718
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,480
Amsterdam when he checked into his hotel

719
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,599
he gave me a call and tell me this hotel

720
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:21,000
room number so that I could bip over

721
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:21,000
there and uh help him uh get

722
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,638
herbal get herb belated I bet you those

723
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,440
guys weren't smoking the hash though

724
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:31,199
were they uh no some of them did you

725
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,759

726
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,200
mainly they smoked herb but uh they

727
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,839
would also uh put a little bit of hash

728
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,880
in their joints or even puff on hash I

729
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,199
mean when we were in Jamaica huge

730
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,039

The Grateful Dead Dog well that's also

763
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,200

764
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,200
Victor thing with the dog kind of making

765

Nipper I'm impressed that you knew that

773
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:37,079
actually when you said that I was just

774

780
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,480
day in grateful Deb history because

781
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,919
there's an incredible bird song from

782
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,000
3781 that everyone should go listen to

783
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:03,038

786
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,519
in high school what a what a great time

787
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,000
to be alive right so I must be 10 years

788
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,559
older than you because I think my senior

789
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,760
year in high school was 91 91 that's the

790
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,878
same with me Marcus maybe that was the

791
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,280
end of end of Brent was that the the end

792
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:28,039
of an era yeah Brent

793
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,040
died yeah right so

794
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,199
I I I remember everything in Grateful

795
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,960
Dead history just so you

796
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,638
know yeah you wouldn't be a true dead

797
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,240
head if you actually remembered

798
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,000
everything that's the big joke you know

799
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,439
but uh my parents were lucky enough to

800
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,039
back in the early 70s and us and H San

801
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,280
Francisco and all that that's where they

802
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,480
met but they weren't huge dead heads but

803
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,399
they did get lucky to see like the

804
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,519
closing of winterland in San Francisco

805
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:54,878
and W and all that and that's really

806
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,719
special I've been really enjoying

807
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,159

[ __ ] unbelievable Sam what was your

828
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,559
first Grateful Dead

829
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:54,679
show like The

830
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:56,639
Grateful I honestly don't remember but

831
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:00,239
it was in the late

832
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:02,759
60s so it was a while

833
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,199
ago that's the right answer for anyone

834
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,480
that saw the Grateful Dead in the late

835
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:10,439
60s just uh for your information did you

836
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,880
go to the Honda but you know I was never

837
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:18,000
a serious serious dead head I probably

838
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:22,400
saw him a dozen times but uh yeah I

839
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,920
mean back then in the late 60s I like

840
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,960
Jefferson Airplane and Country Joe and

841
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,039
the Fish I liked you know I mean the

842
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,358
dead is not as

843
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:35,800
psychedelic as some of the other music

844
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,400
and or at least I interpreted other

845
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,920
music as more

846
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,639
psychedelic Sam I got a question just

847
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,440
disagree with

848
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:50,199
that yeah well I I'm not saying that I'm

849
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:55,039
the the music God and my choice is final

850
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:58,879
but uh uh me personally I found uh you

851
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:02,920
know Jefferson Airplane really really

852
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,880
and and Country Joe and uh yeah there

853
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,838
was uh bu yeah

854
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,838
whatever I'm I'm not gonna it's my

855
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:13,199
personal taste well the the dead were

856
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:15,599
the house banned for the acid test for

857
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,879
for key and the pranksters when they did

858
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,920
that so when when that first whole

859
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,160
experimental thing mixed I mean the dead

860
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,519
were was in that melee not the airplane

861

not Quicksilver not anyone the dead were

862
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:32,079

um a total artist still so I mean it's

883
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,680
not that you're far off it's just the

884
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:29,400
Grateful Dead of millions of hours of

885
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,358
psychedelia and stuff but it's good to

886
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,400
have recognition to all the Psychedelic

887
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:37,598
movements of you know that

888
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,639
era hey Sam yeah I mean the first one I

889
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,640
remember was 13th floor

890
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,400
elevator you're going to get a shut

891
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,679
down I don't know how people do reaction

892
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,599
videos I remember for the longest time

893
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,719
if you used half a second of someone's

894
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,640
copyrighted music they shut you down on

895
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,239
YouTube shut down they do but then

896
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,559
there's people doing reaction videos

897
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,959
where they're like let's watch Stevie

898
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:06,480
Ron do Texas flood and they're just like

899
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,880
watching the entire video on their

900
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,119
Channel without basically breaking and

901
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,960
I'm like this must be a loophole of some

902
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,519
sorts maybe we need to do some reaction

903
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,760
videos on here hey Sam did you ever

904
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,400
listen to what Miles Davis was doing in

905
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,720
the in the late 60s and early 70s was

906
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,920
that ever I I what I really really

907
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:30,639
really liked was the Psychedelic side

908
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,680
coming out of San Francisco I mean the

909
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:37,118
the or north of San Francisco uh I

910
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,759
listened almost everything I listened to

911
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,440
rabish Shankar I listen to all kinds of

912
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,400
different stuff but what really turned

913
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:49,519
my crank was what I was talking about

914
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,519
awesome that's awesome

915
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,440

921
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:14,079
of the synthesizer person um not moo but

922
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,599
the synthesizer uh analog from San

923
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,920
Francisco yeah yeah I mean there was

924
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:21,318
some incredible psychedelia going on

925
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,880
there if you want to talk about crazy

926
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:25,759
yeah that yeah the dead actually were

927
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,400
really into buchas and and the Moog

928
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,560
synthesizers and they used to do their

929
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,680
own private acid tests together as a

930
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:34,358
band and just be in one room with a with

931
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,759
a modular synthesizer and you know from

932
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,679
what I understand talking to them behind

933
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,760
closed doors they would just get in a

934
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,838
room and just play with this and try to

935
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,000
understand soundscape and that's really

936
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,199
where like Mickey Hart and and you know

937
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,280
started looking towards midi and

938
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,598
starting to understand like hey like

939
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,200
sound what about sound what what's

940
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,880
removed this idea of an instrument and

941
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:58,000
um they really talked about a lot of um

942
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
you know different ways that they would

943
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,838
connect with the universe and and

944
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,599
spiritually through that and it's it was

945
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,078
very new to me as a younger guy because

946
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,119
I didn't really I always looked at that

947
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,640
stuff as like not real music and this

948
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,920
and that and I just you know as you get

949
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,879
more educated you start to understand

950
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,039
that it is and it's just sound it's it's

951
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,559
all in how you put it together and um

952
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,318
super interesting fascinating how they

953
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,559
got into that but bua is amazing and

954
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,800
that's the you know is the precursor to

955
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:23,838
where we're at right now with all these

956
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,240
modules and instrumentation that's being

957
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,239
built um it's fascinating man it's super

958
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,399
cool can you put that person's name in

959
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:34,279
the chat CU people could check him out

960
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,358
and see like crazy wires and walls of

961
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,000
analog sound and stuff it's very

962
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:41,719
interesting I mean San Francisco is

963
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,239
always gonna be a point of Awakening but

964
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:47,719
wow in the in the 60s with the MK Ultra

965
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:49,879
studies and if you watch a Ken key

966
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:52,959
documentary you'll find out that not

967
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,559
just Ken key but also ROM dos was part

968
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,358
of those MK Ultra Childs and it was part

969
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,519
of what made ROM dos become spiritual

970
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:02,000
and become an enlight you know whether

971
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:06,239
he's enlightened or not but a spiritual

972
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,960
being on Earth and you know kenkey you

973
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,919
know just getting filled up from this

974
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,159
this lore and then bringing it to the

975
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,720
people you know a lot of people talk

976
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,598
about them messing it up but at the same

977
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,519
time it was just an uncontrollable thing

978
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,680
that the the human beings needed so it's

979
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:24,239
it's fascinating to see the Psychedelic

980
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:27,358
Awakening that happened in the 60s and

981
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:30,639
we talk about it plenty but it's just an

982
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,039
amazing time I mention last time I

983
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,118
mentioned him last time and I'll mention

984
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:37,159
him again Sun raw if you want to get

985
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:40,358
psychedelic and trippy space is the

986
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:43,358
place it is when I when I went to high

987
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:47,239
school first year was

988
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:49,598
1965 LSD was still legal in

989
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:51,558
California that's how different the

990
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,800
world is

991
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,280
today but it was also the experimental

992
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,559
uh nature that the the sound due to the

993
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,319
technology was there so it was you know

994
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:02,720
colum what you're speaking toward is you

995
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:04,358
know you're a musician so now that

996
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,919
you're putting it together it's one

997
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:07,480
thing when you orally hear it when

998
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,599
you're not a musician but when you're

999
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,838
actually producing it you know where you

1000
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,079
mic it you know where you do your vocals

1001
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,759
you know if people knew how many actual

1002
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,960
hit songs were actually recorded in a

1003
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,480
bathroom because the sound vocals were

1004
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,440
actually awesome would blow many minds

1005
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,480
but you know the modelization the

1006
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,119
continued experimentation between you

1007
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,800
know what Pink Floyd and uh Grateful

1008
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,960
Dead were sonically doing really changed

1009
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,440
a lot of the atmospheric sound and

1010
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,039
access because then they started you

1011
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,800
know the access of the eight channels

1012
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,279
and started you know expanding just

1013
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,359
really fascinating if from just a

1014
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,240
musical standpoint of just understanding

1015
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,039
of how the musicians would just come in

1016
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:54,679
as Studio musicians back in the 40s 50s

1017
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:56,759
and 60s Bam Bam Bam Bam go off as

1018
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:59,879
opposed to now having an obnoxious

1019
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,839
amount of time to sit around in a studio

1020
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,760
and just

1021
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,599
experiment I mean really push the edges

1022
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,640
of the boundaries well yeah it's like

1023
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,000
Jerry Garcia said that you know we they

1024
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,000
always talked about how they got really

1025
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,280
their education uh in the studio that's

1026
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,159
that's really how they they learned was

1027
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,240
being in the studio his quote his quote

1028
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,039
was recording in the studio is like

1029
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,799
building a ship in a bottle playing live

1030
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:29,838
music is like being like a rowo on an

1031
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,800
ocean think about you know think about

1032
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:35,000
uh you know uh Sergeant Pepper's Lonely

1033
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,440
Hearts Club plan four four tracks four

1034
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,960
tracks that if you really think about

1035
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,079
that it's

1036
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,720
mindblowing yeah and most drum sounds

1037
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,720
from the 40s and 50s were recorded in in

1038
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:47,838
defunct uh movie theaters with One

1039
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:50,838
Singular microphone over top it was a it

1040
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,960
was a ribbon mic and it would just it

1041
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:54,558
was just a single monos source and we we

1042
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,079
think about like all these you think of

1043
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,680
drums you think of all these mics and

1044
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,079
it's just the it's environment it goes

1045
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:01,960
back to plants right it's your

1046
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,839
environment right it's your environment

1047
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,119
that you're actually in uh that's

1048
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,199
creating that nuance and that that

1049
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:11,039
intricacy has anyone ever seen the

1050
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:12,558
secret life of

1051
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,159
plants

1052
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:18,720
yeah it's so beautiful how Stevie Wonder

1053
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,000
does the soundtrack to it and it's just

1054
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:25,199
so interesting how in the 70s they're

1055
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,719
playing with Sonic sounds and you know

1056
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,399
there's a new device out these days

1057
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:34,239
called the Healy and it's like a

1058
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,400
frequency healing a biof feedback tool

1059
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,639
and people use it for healing and you

1060
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,000
know it might be uh a lot of reasons to

1061
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,199
believe it could be useful in the garden

1062
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,318
you know as a as one of those

1063
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,000
subsonic you know it's kind of like the

1064
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:50,318
schumans resonance thing where it's the

1065
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,039
7.8 but it could be any any uh frequency

1066
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:55,920
and you know so like Sonic sound and

1067
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:58,318
life go together if you find out it's

1068
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,400
beneficial and you want to grow cannabis

1069
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,719
by the acre then what do you do do you

1070
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,119
get loudspeakers

1071
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,879
or I think you're right I think that

1072
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,200
once you get into the field you just

1073
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,358
understand that you don't need a

1074
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,879
subsonic resonance because you have the

1075
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:17,318
Earth's resonance these types of tools

1076
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:20,480
are used for fake environments like

1077
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:23,199
green houses and indoor uh settings I I

1078
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,719
think but you

1079
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,639
know yeah there was some science back in

1080
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:31,719
the 70s about

1081
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:34,679
um the effect of sounds and the onset of

1082
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:38,279
Morning Light opening the statti on

1083
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:41,440
leaves and uh a whole transformation in

1084
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,280
their metabolic processes going on

1085
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,559
associated with the sounds of Sunrise

1086
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,920
and the change in

1087
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:49,920
light that is

1088
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:57,199
awesome hey just on the covid uh uh

1089
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,400
development man they're just there

1090
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:04,558
continues to be a number of papers and

1091
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:07,559
reports showing efficacy uh this one I'm

1092
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:10,599
looking at right here on a combination

1093
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:13,319
of tenses and CBD this was

1094
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:16,240
reported uh by a group in

1095
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:18,679
Israel and there's like two other groups

1096
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,799
that are getting a lot of press now one

1097
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:22,318
um in the

1098
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,519
University of South Carolina and the

1099
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,920
other one up there in in Canada

1100
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:30,280
University of Lethbridge that showed

1101
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,358
cbd's impact on taming the so-called

1102
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,240
cyto kind storm which is one of the

1103
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:37,279
things that leads to acute respiratory

1104
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:39,639
dpress syndrome which is what shuts

1105
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,440
people's breathing down in covid so

1106
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:46,159
there really is some you know

1107
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:50,000
biochemical rationale and basis for not

1108
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:52,719
only preventative uh measures against

1109
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,119
covid but also this paper right here is

1110
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,799
actually pointing out specifically the

1111
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:01,358
antiviral potential of just tpes and CBD

1112
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,920
so that's pretty exciting stuff it's

1113
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,400
been my experience yes it makes perfect

1114
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,838
sense CBD works with the immune system

1115
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,119
it just it's it seems like a no-brainer

1116
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:14,000
Mark I mean I it just and and I can't

1117
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:15,800
wait for the Science World the medical

1118
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,358
world to catch up with this idea yeah I

1119
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,480
think they're beginning to figure it out

1120
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,920
and there's a real biochemical mechanism

1121
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,599
because again the way that CBD impacts

1122
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:29,639
homeostasis and you know canono and full

1123
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:32,200
spectrum canono sort of impacts um

1124
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,920
homeostasis and they're not saying that

1125
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:37,159
these compounds are antiviral but

1126
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,079
they're they're showing that I guess

1127
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:45,480
both preventatively and that they can

1128
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:48,640
treat um uh the the real killing part of

1129
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:51,679
the Corona virus which is the acute

1130
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,879
respiratory distress syndrome was and

1131
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,078
it's a

1132
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,798
overstimulation of your own

1133
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,880
immunological response that again I

1134
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:04,679
think the canono depending on your your

1135
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,798
endoc canabo tone if you will uh uh can

1136
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:10,480
have a real impact on changing how your

1137
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:13,119
endoc canabo system is dealing with

1138
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,159
fending itself off from the virus so it

1139
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,760
also leads to believe that there is a

1140
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:22,399
genetic basis for fighting viruses like

1141
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,839
the Corona virus that you know the endoc

1142
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,519
canabo system can help understand the

1143
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:29,719
mechanism on how that works can you drop

1144
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,559
that link uh Dr Mark because I've been

1145
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:34,679
reading various uh preliminary studies

1146
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,400
but uh they haven't actually gone

1147
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,199
through or I haven't seen any actual

1148
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,400
study that's gone through the process

1149
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:43,000
but you know I've been reading numerous

1150
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,318
articles that have said that they're

1151
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,559
working on this so to to to hear that

1152
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:50,440
they're actually getting some actual

1153
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:52,839
traction would be amazing yeah I mean I

1154
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,720
I think that there's right now the the

1155
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:57,480
the research is very preliminary and it

1156
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:59,118
shows that there's a whole lot more

1157
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,519
research that needs to be done and

1158
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,200
before they really get to conclusive

1159
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,759
here's how you you know you know keep

1160
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:09,279
yourself healthy or here's how you can

1161
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,599
treat your disease if you have to get it

1162
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,640
I mean the point is is I guess there is

1163
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:18,318
a a a biochemical rationale for why

1164
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:20,679
these treatments should work and

1165
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:23,159
understanding that rationale is actually

1166
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:25,199
helping scientists figure out how they

1167
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:27,399
could actually deal with the virus a lot

1168
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:29,239
better and the other thing is that I

1169
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,838
don't know if you saw this statistic but

1170
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:34,838
because of the social isolation and

1171
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:37,519
people using mass and all that all the

1172
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:41,239
other forms of transmittable disease

1173
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:43,798
including influenza are all down so so

1174
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:46,519
really if we can just get Corona in

1175
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:48,400
check you know I think a lot of the new

1176
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:50,280
practices you know not saying that

1177
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,160
social isolation will remain but you

1178
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:57,480
know just our our overall you know

1179
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:59,598
education on how to not spread virus and

1180
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,679
how to not live on top of each other and

1181
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,680
breathe all over each other I guess is

1182
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,399
going to be useful but I'm with you

1183
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:08,798
bubble man I'm looking forward to live

1184
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,480
music coming back I see festivals that

1185
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:14,880
are now on the calendar that are selling

1186
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:17,199
tickets and selling RV passes and

1187
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,838
they're talking about doing festivals in

1188
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,558
Social isolation mode so God only knows

1189
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:23,400
what that's going to look like but yeah

1190
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:26,640
looking forward to music coming back for

1191
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,440
sure you know my question is this if we

1192
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,480
okay think of just how we were just

1193
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,480
coughing in each other's faces never

1194
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,039
washing our hands touching everything

1195
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,199
people coughing into their hands and

1196
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:40,119
then touching things how many people out

1197
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,679
on a cake right dude how many people

1198
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,798
were did we did did Humanity like you

1199
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:47,919
got to think all the influenza cases

1200
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:50,280
like 40,000 a year deaths was the same

1201
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,000
thing as covid like that you got that

1202
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,880
from your family members and from

1203
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,960
friends and from loved ones like that's

1204
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,720
how you got it I that's never been a

1205
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,480
part of the ation you know 40,000 people

1206
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,838
die a year from influenza and never did

1207
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,318
we think hey like maybe we should uh try

1208
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:06,239
to clean this up a little bit uh we

1209
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,838
might be killing our elderly population

1210
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,358
by coughing in their

1211
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,960
faces well I'd like to make a special

1212
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:15,199
note that there's been a hundred days of

1213
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,798
protest in India does everyone know

1214
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:22,879
about this the Farms Indian farmer

1215
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:26,719
protests about it and

1216
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:30,039
there's 200,000 and more people living

1217
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:33,279
in trucks on top of themselves with no

1218
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:36,920
mask on eating food together communally

1219
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:40,000
fighting for food sovereignty and small

1220
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:42,760
farmers I find it really interesting

1221
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,880
that there's no sickness spreading there

1222
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,599
and I wonder what's different about that

1223
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,200
human reality than the United States

1224
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,000
human reality because when you talk

1225
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,598
about people living on top of each other

1226
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,599
you would automatically think of India

1227
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:00,000
or Nigeria and logos and I just I find

1228
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,440
it really interesting that they they

1229
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
don't have the fear and the the numbers

1230
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,079
of spikes following it and I just I find

1231
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,239
it

1232
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:11,640
interesting well I mean India definitely

1233
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,519
has a ridiculous amount of cases I work

1234
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:16,239
with quite a few Indian people who are

1235
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,960
in contact with people back home all the

1236
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,199
time so they've definitely got it going

1237
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,039
on there but if you ever go to India

1238
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:24,838
what you'll notice is that like Corona

1239
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:27,239
virus is just like put it on the list

1240
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,078
bro there's like 10,000 things that can

1241
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:31,798
[ __ ] kill you there you can't even

1242
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:34,400
wrap your head around it it's kind of

1243
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:37,039
scary you know there's 10,000 Corona

1244
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,079
viruses that we deal with every year on

1245
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,719
an every year basis we we're dealing

1246
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:44,039
with Corona viruses so that's also

1247
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,959
interesting I'd love to jump in here

1248
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,719
about what Mark since we're talking

1249
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,599
covid and and infection and all that and

1250
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:54,039
point back to the papers that Mark was

1251
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:56,440
talking about um part of the education

1252
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,679
program that I've been doing is a a

1253
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,358
conversation about covid and how

1254
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:06,039
cannabis might have effects with with

1255
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:09,199
covid and um so the starting point there

1256
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:11,920
for me is the endoc canono system tone

1257
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,719
or health that the system has and every

1258
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,798
person's ocono health is different based

1259
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:19,439
on all the factors that can affect

1260
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:22,480
conoid health and when you start looking

1261
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,679
at the functions of the of the endoco

1262
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,318
system there are things like appetite

1263
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:31,279
and mood and but one of them is

1264
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:33,519
healing and so when you start looking at

1265
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,960
viruses in the context of healing what's

1266
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:39,079
true is we evolved being exposed to

1267
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,920
viruses of All Sorts bacteria fungi you

1268
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:43,839
know it's all going on because we're in

1269
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,000
it uh it's part of our gut it's part of

1270
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,719
our skin you know we are creatures of

1271
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,960
many different sorts all walking around

1272
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:54,039
together in this

1273
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,119
body we learn our endoc kinoid system

1274
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:59,199
evolved to deal with all of that and

1275
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,358
yes to some extent all of those things

1276
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,318
passing through there's a certain

1277
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,078
thinning of the herd if you will of

1278
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:08,400
people whose genetics Andor conoid

1279
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,798
Health caused them to be susceptible to

1280
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,160
an infection and I think that's true

1281
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:16,159
today with covid yes it's a a new

1282
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:18,598
version of a virus but it's the fact

1283
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,879
that I'm certain every one of us has

1284
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:24,920
been exposed to that virus at some point

1285
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,960
but we at least in my own case so far

1286
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,760
have not contracted the virus virus

1287
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,440
haven't allowed the thing to take root

1288
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:36,280
in my body and replicate and therefore

1289
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,480
result in me having an infection that or

1290
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,359
a diagnosis if you will and I think

1291
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,119
that's part of what endoc canono health

1292
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:45,119
is about is our body's ability to

1293
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:47,960
identify a virus and prevent it from

1294
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,318
taking root in our body and then there's

1295
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,720
the whole aspect of what if the virus

1296
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:55,679
does take root in your body and

1297
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:58,078
replicate and start pre reproducing

1298
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,798
madly all through your

1299
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,559
system how your body's immune system

1300
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:06,480
eventually responds to that again is a

1301
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:09,798
function of endoc canono health and I

1302
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,639
think this is why cannabis chemistry

1303
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:13,280
again it's all about the dose and the

1304
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:15,279
type of chemistry that you're ingesting

1305
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,760
or getting into your body however you're

1306
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,920
getting into your body but it's an it's

1307
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:25,200
an aid a supplement to enhance your

1308
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,318
endoc canono systems health because the

1309
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:31,279
plant canono very closely mimic many of

1310
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:35,159
the compounds that our bodies make to

1311
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,920
pre preserve our own homeostasis or

1312
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:40,798
endoc canono health and I think that's

1313
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,798
why science is starting to recognize as

1314
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,960
they build data over number of people

1315
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:48,119
who have been exposed to the virus have

1316
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,720
contracted it or a asymptomatic all of

1317
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:53,318
those various permutations of how this

1318
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,639
virus plays out in our bodies are really

1319
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:58,480
a function for each individual of their

1320
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:02,118
endoc nanoid health and their body's

1321
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:04,599
ability to recognize the virus as other

1322
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:07,838
and control its ability to replicate in

1323
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:11,240
your body and or limit the damage it can

1324
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:13,798
do and yeah Mark cyto storm you know

1325
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:16,239
that term but that's what kills most

1326
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:19,119
people with covid is their body's

1327
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:21,318
overreaction and again CBD particularly

1328
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,798
I know that one a little bit can tone

1329
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:27,318
down immune response it's a fascinating

1330
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:30,599
compound to me well regulate as well as

1331
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:32,519
down regulate the immune system and and

1332
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:35,680
and that's and that's the fundamental

1333
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:39,639
basis of so many disorders like

1334
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:42,879
psoriasis and and and eczema and and

1335
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:45,920
other things where your immune system is

1336
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,880
just on overdrive because it knows it's

1337
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,720
being attacked but it doesn't know by

1338
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,519
what so it's kind of like when Jean Luke

1339
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:55,399
Bard in Star Trek said fire all weapons

1340
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:58,719
it just fires all weapons and there's so

1341
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:01,318
much collateral damage that yeah the

1342
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,719
patient succumbs to that but you you

1343
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:08,318
know the thing like you say like the

1344
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:11,598
endoc canabo tone and that's almost like

1345
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:15,838
something that is is something that's

1346
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:18,440
nurtured that's genetic it's part of the

1347
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,838
diet I mean the my wife and I were just

1348
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:25,119
saying that old saying you are what you

1349
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:27,679
eat I mean it is never more true you are

1350
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,880
what you eat the molecules that make up

1351
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:34,919
you is because you ate those molecules

1352
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:38,559
right so I mean it is just the the how

1353
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,519
do I say this so when we switch over and

1354
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,680
part of getting away from the whole

1355
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:46,079
marijuana and cannabis stigma is to is

1356
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:49,558
to switch over to thinking of

1357
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:52,039
cannabinoids as vitamins as essential

1358
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,200
vitamins that we need in our diet and

1359
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:57,640
Wade you'll love it I was in a uh I was

1360
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:59,118
in a herb um Clubhouse early today as I

1361
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:02,798
was drinking my

1362
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:06,559
coffee and listening to this fella who

1363
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:08,280
claims um his health has been turned

1364
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,480
around he was overweight I think a

1365
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:13,119
diabetic I think he had other health

1366
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,480
issues but he has claim that cannabis

1367
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:20,880
juicing has literally saved his life and

1368
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:24,838
that fresh cannaboid acids a fresh diet

1369
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,880
rich in cannaboid acids has completely

1370
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:29,480
changed his health

1371
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,160
and that he needed like he had smoked

1372
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,480
for years and sounds like he had done

1373
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:35,038
other drugs and kind of like like a lot

1374
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,280
of people just kind of you know did it

1375
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,960
recreationally didn't really consider

1376
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,280
the health benefits but now he said this

1377
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,679
is part of his routine like I wake up

1378
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,200
and make a cup of coffee he wakes up and

1379
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:49,798
juices cannabis and he does it every day

1380
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:55,239
and he claims that again the cannaboids

1381
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:59,000
in their acidic form give the um uh

1382
00:59:55,239 --> 01:00:01,199
health benefits that you're not getting

1383
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,440
when you smoke cannabis and you're

1384
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:08,159
decarboxylating it and part of it is

1385
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:11,599
that the acidic forms those acids bind

1386
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:13,920
to other molecules and create different

1387
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,000
things that are happening Downstream and

1388
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,240
so I was just listening in this room for

1389
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,159
like about 10 or 15 minutes but got a

1390
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:23,519
whole lot just from from just hanging

1391
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,719
out and listening it's cool no I I think

1392
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,280
I think that it's fascinating to me how

1393
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:30,759
many manufacturers insist that you have

1394
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:33,400
to decarbox your plant material or your

1395
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,520
oil while you're making your product or

1396
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,599
it's not going to work and what they're

1397
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,838
really talking about is they're they're

1398
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,680
they're making product for

1399
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:44,558
psychoactivity right if you're making

1400
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:47,239
product for any other reason from the

1401
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:51,559
therapeutic benefit that possible with

1402
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:54,959
cannabis uh not be to leave it in its

1403
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:56,839
acid forms the canono definitely have

1404
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,599
different effects in the than they do

1405
01:00:56,838 --> 01:01:02,038
once they're decarbox yeah he claimed so

1406
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:05,680
he had started with full spectrum

1407
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:08,000
decarbox oil like like you said and what

1408
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:10,639
he said he got sleepy and it helped him

1409
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,280
with some of his digestive issues but it

1410
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:15,558
didn't really give him the full health

1411
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,960
benefits that he leaves now he still

1412
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:20,680
consumes and still I guess Vapes and

1413
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:23,639
still decarbox and gets plenty of

1414
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:25,598
decarbox can canabo which help on a

1415
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:27,920
whole different level maybe help them

1416
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,440
more in his brain because when you DEC

1417
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,680
carboxilate you're putting things in

1418
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,200
your brain as opposed to your body but

1419
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:37,118
your CB2 receptors which is your

1420
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:40,838
peripheral endoc canabo system are

1421
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,400
located from your toes down to your you

1422
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:45,000
just everywhere all throughout your body

1423
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,599
and so again if you're trying to get

1424
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,318
your health in line it makes sense what

1425
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:54,519
he's saying because um he's kind of

1426
01:01:51,318 --> 01:01:57,318
getting a a full spectrum in that

1427
01:01:54,519 --> 01:02:00,599
carboxilate canab oids are giving him

1428
01:01:57,318 --> 01:02:02,558
one health benefit and the decarbox ones

1429
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,720
are giving him another

1430
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:10,240
one I agree with that Mark thank you

1431
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:12,199
that's a great description of my

1432
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,479
experience well the thing about the

1433
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:16,639
Corona virus uh I've got my second shot

1434
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,838
the other day and so uh the nurse was

1435
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:22,000
explaining to me how of course the

1436
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:25,278
problem is the spikes so basically the

1437
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,400
RNA vaccine that they give you basically

1438
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:29,639
protects your system against the spikes

1439
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,480
penetrating and of course what Marcus

1440
01:02:29,639 --> 01:02:35,159
said earlier which was most fascinating

1441
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,838
is that you know the nurse stated me you

1442
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:38,358
know there's been no no flu this year

1443
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:39,719
and I looked at her crazy because my

1444
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:42,400
wife had the

1445
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:43,639
flu but she's like universally there's

1446
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,000
been none because we're washing our

1447
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:49,000
hands and wearing masks

1448
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,838
so um yeah I I I agree with you

1449
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,960
completely Wade is that you know there

1450
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:57,838
is definitely um you know CBD and

1451
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,079
cannabis in in in its way produce the

1452
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:03,119
the protection in the body and I have

1453
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:05,119
not seen the breakouts you know of

1454
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,880
people who have I know people who have

1455
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,160
used cannabis and do use cannabis who

1456
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,720
have caught covid but a lot of people I

1457
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:13,558
know don't and haven't but you know

1458
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:16,798
again people are isolating so that's a

1459
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:19,798
longer study you know still fascinating

1460
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:22,639
science has anyone read the BBC article

1461
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:24,239
about the gentleman who's got uh I I

1462
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:25,879
don't even know what they're calling it

1463
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:28,639
you know they've got a term for it like

1464
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:31,440
he's he's super immune or he's got a

1465
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:34,879
certain antibody in his body that is

1466
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,760
deflecting the spikes it acts as a as a

1467
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,920
defense mechanism against those spikes

1468
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,200
that you're talking about ATN um I I

1469
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,680
wasn't sure if anybody had read that

1470
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:45,278
same article or had any thoughts on it I

1471
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:48,558
don't really know enough other than what

1472
01:03:45,278 --> 01:03:50,798
I read um so I just was curious is

1473
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:53,079
anyone had read that same article or

1474
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:54,880
seen that it's fascinating he's a

1475
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,318
actually African-American guy which is

1476
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:02,160
also

1477
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:02,159
just opens up a whole Vortex of of

1478
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:12,318
questions a Vortex of questions you

1479
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:14,598
say yeah I mean s you know they they

1480
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,838
were they were talking about how certain

1481
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:19,920
subset of communities were were really

1482
01:04:16,838 --> 01:04:23,000
affected by by the the virus itself and

1483
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,278
uh to find this gentleman um they're

1484
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,519
looking for more individuals like him um

1485
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:29,920
they're trying to to understand what's

1486
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:32,559
going on uh but you know I thought that

1487
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,798
was really fascinating you know just

1488
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:38,559
just reading that on a basic we you know

1489
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:40,880
very basic News website um so check it

1490
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,760
out I don't know if there's any Mark Dr

1491
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,960
Mark I don't know if you're if you've

1492
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,480
seen that at all but I just thought it

1493
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,920
was fascinating to be honest I read it

1494
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,079
just yesterday yeah I so there was a

1495
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:53,680
woman again going back to this Clubhouse

1496
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:57,798
room a woman who is a doctor in there

1497
01:04:53,679 --> 01:05:01,399
and she said that she was aware of this

1498
01:04:57,798 --> 01:05:04,400
uh she was over a hundred years of age

1499
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,838
this woman and she's I guess is so old

1500
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,119
that she's actually never been

1501
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:09,519
vaccinated for anything in her life but

1502
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:12,680
she's never gotten

1503
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:14,278
anything in her life and she's 111 or

1504
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:17,159
something like that no so she's not

1505
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:20,039
going to get vaccinated and they think

1506
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:25,759
that yeah again I I think a lot of it

1507
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:29,640
with viruses Colin has to do with how um

1508
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:33,039
tuned your immune system is and how well

1509
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:34,960
your immune system is able to respond

1510
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,039
and I think that this is different for

1511
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,199
different people I mean like like my dad

1512
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:43,359
for instance my dad was in a house where

1513
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:47,078
my stepmom got it and I think my one of

1514
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:50,358
my stepmom's uh uh uh children got it

1515
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:52,278
too so my dad was around it and my dad

1516
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:55,038
is immune compromised and he had

1517
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:56,159
something called um uh valley fever

1518
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,880
which is a

1519
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,598
a a fungal uh uh infection that you get

1520
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,358
in your lungs so he was already very

1521
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:03,880
prone to getting this and we were just

1522
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:06,000
like oh it's just a matter of day I'm

1523
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:08,318
gonna get a phone call my dad's got

1524
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,119
covid I gotta go out to Arizona and de

1525
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,719
it you know I was just waiting for that

1526
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:14,920
whole thing to happen never happen for

1527
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:18,480
some reason again my dad just seems to

1528
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:20,440
have this super strong immune system

1529
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,039
that even though he's been around it and

1530
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,838
he's probably been exposed to it he's

1531
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:28,000
able to you know deal with it or it

1532
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:31,519
might just take the form of a couple

1533
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,960
days of sniffles and just not be as as

1534
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:36,278
life-threatening as as it is to other

1535
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,679
people and and and nobody quite knows I

1536
01:06:36,278 --> 01:06:41,760
mean it's a virus viruses a weird like

1537
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:45,440
that if you look back to the AIDS virus

1538
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,039
and what happened with AIDS there was uh

1539
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,920
most people who contracted AIDS

1540
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,839
particularly early on died pretty

1541
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:54,200
quickly but it turns out that one of the

1542
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,558
earliest patients and I wish I could

1543
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:59,239
remember this person's name he's become

1544
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,119
publicly known but he was diagnosed with

1545
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:05,199
it back in the early 80s and he's still

1546
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:07,278
alive he's and it wasn't he never

1547
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:10,838
contracted any of the conditions that

1548
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:15,278
typically result from AIDS and again

1549
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:17,719
AIDS is a virus most people and I it's

1550
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:20,599
to me it's just it's really about the

1551
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:22,838
genetics of the individual and how well

1552
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:25,318
their body is able to either resist

1553
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:27,000
infection or deal with the infection in

1554
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:29,719
a way that doesn't compromise your

1555
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,798
health and so genetics plays a part in

1556
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:33,199
it but the epigenetics of our life and

1557
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,920
it's just like the cannabis plant in

1558
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,199
this way we talk about how the cannabis

1559
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,159
plant and our cells are related in the

1560
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:41,639
way that we can care for our plants or

1561
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:43,879
care for our bodies if a plant if it's

1562
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,838
genetics are such that it's not going to

1563
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,119
have any trouble dealing with molds it's

1564
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:50,159
probably not going to have much trouble

1565
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:51,480
with molds if it's genetics are you see

1566
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,598
where I'm going with that and I think

1567
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:58,119
the same is true with people and how

1568
01:07:54,599 --> 01:08:01,599
well a plant sits if a plant is sitting

1569
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:04,480
in very poor soil and is overwatered its

1570
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:08,798
genetics may help its ability to resist

1571
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:11,519
pest or disease but you contrast that

1572
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:14,559
with a plant that's in full sun in full

1573
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,560
living soil living water everything is

1574
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,319
as good as it could possibly be for that

1575
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:23,960
plant it's likely going to fully express

1576
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:26,400
its genetic ability to to resist pests

1577
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,239
and infection of various viruses or

1578
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,838
fungus or whatever and I think it

1579
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:32,838
carries over to humans as well and just

1580
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:35,238
to be really clear I don't I'm not

1581
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:37,479
saying that cannabis is the Beall end

1582
01:08:35,238 --> 01:08:39,479
all answer to it there's so many things

1583
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:42,158
about life where we have Choice the

1584
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:44,399
quality of food the kind of rest you get

1585
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,519
uh how much stress you allow to build in

1586
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:50,079
your life all of those things play a

1587
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:52,799
part in in how well your endoc canono

1588
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:56,198
system can function in your body to

1589
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:58,759
allow you to enjoy good health I really

1590
01:08:56,198 --> 01:09:01,238
feel like there's a fundamental thing

1591
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:03,640
there that's going on there's all these

1592
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:05,399
things we have choice about genetics you

1593
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:09,759
don't have much choice about but

1594
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:11,798
cannabis can help you to find Health in

1595
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,920
the midst of all this madness that is

1596
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:16,600
life on this planet in this

1597
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:19,640
three-dimensional reality that we call

1598
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:22,239
the world on that note yes here I am

1599
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,239
stoned

1600
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,920
again I wish you wouldn't have muted it

1601
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,239
I would have loved to have heard your

1602
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,600
laugh that would have been the perfect

1603
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:32,919
mic drop for that uh well uh it'll

1604
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,319
happen

1605
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:38,480
again anyway yeah no I I feel really

1606
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,039
passionate about this I really feel like

1607
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:43,079
a lot of the health issues that are

1608
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:45,119
going on in our world today are because

1609
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:47,359
for many of us we've made poor choices

1610
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,559
in our life you know riding motorcycle

1611
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,880
in my life was resulted in some aches

1612
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,520
and pains that to this day linger and

1613
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,719
cannabis helps me deal with those

1614
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,760
traumas that didn't heal properly and

1615
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,679
again healing is a function of the ECS

1616
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:04,280
it's just all of the choices that we do

1617
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,440
have however you make those will be part

1618
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:08,960
of what your endoc canono health is

1619
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:10,238
going to be and that is part of how we

1620
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,239
respond to

1621
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:13,238
viruses

1622
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,920
so anyway enough of

1623
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:21,919
that well it's it's just amazing how you

1624
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:24,719
know science has to you know appeal to

1625
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,158
Politics as opposed to politics appeals

1626
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,719
to science

1627
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,359
um which is why I'm going to kind of

1628
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:32,600
segue here for a second um I've been

1629
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:34,279
working with the last seven months uh

1630
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,800
with a group called the veterans Action

1631
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:39,719
Council we're basically a group of

1632
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,719
cannabis veterans um who've been using

1633
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:44,439
medical cannabis as well as other

1634
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:46,399
psychedelics and we've come together and

1635
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:48,879
tomorrow we're going to release our

1636
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:52,279
first white paper which is actually a

1637
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,840
green paper uh we're calling it which is

1638
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:56,198
uh basically it outline significant

1639
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,360
concern

1640
01:10:56,198 --> 01:11:00,119
uh within the medical cannabis Community

1641
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:02,479
for veterans and what we feel are

1642
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:05,319
potential remedies so uh we're going to

1643
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:09,678
be releasing that tomorrow it also

1644
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:11,759
includes um Robert Randall and uh Alice

1645
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,480
o submittal to the federal government

1646
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,719
back in 1993 and to the Clinton

1647
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:19,119
administration because that's how far

1648
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:22,399
back we haven't done anything here in

1649
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:25,599
the United States at the federal level

1650
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:29,238
and um sandwiched also in there is is

1651
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:32,640
Michael Crow's recent success um as we

1652
01:11:29,238 --> 01:11:34,919
all know in December 2nd of 2020 medical

1653
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,560
marijuana was actually legalized across

1654
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,399
the world because our friends spent a

1655
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,239
decade getting it pulled off the

1656
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:45,960
schedule 4 off the

1657
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:49,000
1961 uh convention treaty so um medical

1658
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,359
marijuana is legal and we want access

1659
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,560
here in the United States especially

1660
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:57,319
veterans so uh we're launching this uh

1661
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,360
green paper as an educational tool for

1662
01:11:57,319 --> 01:12:02,799
people to take at the federal level

1663
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:05,039
other veterans uh to uh use you know

1664
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,279
around the world because this is uh real

1665
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:09,319
literature real information uh Robert

1666
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:12,119
Randall for those who aren't aware was

1667
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:14,639
patience zero he was the first patient

1668
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:17,719
to sue the federal government and win

1669
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:20,199
his right to receive marijuana grown by

1670
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:23,639
the federal government uh and which it

1671
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:25,799
opened up to 22 other people until

1672
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:28,679
1992 when they compassionate

1673
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:31,520
investigative new drug program was uh

1674
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:34,800
basically shut down for uh the addition

1675
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:37,239
of any new patients we want to see that

1676
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,320
reopened um in the sense that we want to

1677
01:12:37,238 --> 01:12:42,119
be able to get veterans to be able to

1678
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:44,759
import cannabis since we can't have

1679
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:47,479
access to the night of cannabis uh but

1680
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:50,760
at the same time I think we also want to

1681
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:53,279
pressure Dr alol and them into actually

1682
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,320
growing medical grade cannabis to the

1683
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:59,880
Quality that we're actually selling on

1684
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,759
in our dispensaries today uh because

1685
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:05,840
they're only down to one patient now do

1686
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:08,480
you know that yes and to be honest Dr

1687
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:12,239
ooui doesn't make these decisions it's

1688
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:13,119
the Nida that gives him a contract what

1689
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,359
to

1690
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:19,639
grow agreed and we're going to utilize

1691
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:22,079
the uh this information to utilize to

1692
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:24,039
pressure them into changing and either

1693
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:27,079
reopening the system so that cannabis

1694
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:28,760
can be grown uh you know to the

1695
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:31,238
standards that we're seeing today or

1696
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,119
we're going to import it from countries

1697
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:34,839
that are internationally doing it and

1698
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:39,039
that have over-the-counter products

1699
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:40,600
available such as Canada Uruguay Israel

1700
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,719
and the

1701
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,239
Netherlands you know that's amazing that

1702
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,039
you're doing this work man you know my

1703
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:48,439
dad is 100 first Airborne first of the

1704
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:51,119
506 he is fullblown Parkinson's has had

1705
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:53,559
it for almost two decades and um you

1706
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:58,599
know he's been someone that's

1707
01:13:53,560 --> 01:14:00,280
been struggling with access and um you

1708
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:04,039
know he's got plenty of access through

1709
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:07,679
me um however the the type of access you

1710
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:09,238
know there's a certain kind of ideology

1711
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,119
that I think he carries you know when he

1712
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:13,839
thinks of the VA and and you know he

1713
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,800
wants to keep that camaraderie there and

1714
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,639
it's really hard I see it from a lot of

1715
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,159
different levels with with certain

1716
01:14:17,639 --> 01:14:22,199
patients coming from the VA and and

1717
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:23,839
veterans in general um they want to feel

1718
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:26,599
that camaraderie but it's just not there

1719
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,600
from the VA at all um and it's a really

1720
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,360
touchy subject but but I really commend

1721
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,079
you man that's that's a a very hard

1722
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:36,158
thing to be you know hard path to be on

1723
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:37,279
so really excent work man that's awesome

1724
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:39,759
well that's why we're doing it we're

1725
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:42,479
doing it for your dad and for others

1726
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,719
because um we have access where we are

1727
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,959
so we're trying to utilize our voice and

1728
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,639
our privilege for those who don't have

1729
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,880
and don't have access for those who

1730
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:53,199
don't know I'm a combat veteran of

1731
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,400
Operation Desert Shield Desert Storm 30

1732
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:58,079
years ago today I was in well well no I

1733
01:14:55,399 --> 01:15:02,719
was in I was wounded in Germany uh but

1734
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:05,639
uh you know um so I was put on uh going

1735
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:07,760
from morphine to congratulations uh I

1736
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:10,199
want to get off morphine I asked the

1737
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,639
doctor he said hashish and I was in

1738
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:16,319
Germany so that basically started me off

1739
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:19,159
on an exploratory journey into the

1740
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:21,279
underground into trying to not make

1741
01:15:19,158 --> 01:15:23,719
criminals out of my friends and not get

1742
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:26,000
myself murdered or ripped off which you

1743
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:28,960
know thousands of other veterans a deal

1744
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,960
with on top of that it's expensive I

1745
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,960
mean there needs to be one of the things

1746
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,760
we want to see is what you have up there

1747
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,679
in Canada Marcus is having access so

1748
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,239
veterans are actually subsidized so I

1749
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:42,359
you know depending on your disability

1750
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:44,519
you're given a certain amount of grams

1751
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:46,479
of access per month so then you can go

1752
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:50,199
down to a dispensary and however you

1753
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:53,399
ingest if it's Edibles hases or

1754
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:56,198
flowers the gram situation is applicable

1755
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:59,638
to whatever your usage is so we want

1756
01:15:56,198 --> 01:16:01,359
that same access that you have in Canada

1757
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:03,719
because we can't go get it filled at a

1758
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:06,439
px so if we have to go to a dispensary

1759
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:09,439
then we want a voucher program so that

1760
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:11,599
it alleviates the costs so many veterans

1761
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:13,919
like your father are also on a 100%

1762
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,840
disability which means you're on a very

1763
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,319
very limited income for the cost of

1764
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,199
inflation food etc etc and when you

1765
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:23,759
start looking at the cost of cannabis

1766
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:25,599
not including the cost of your uh

1767
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,840
paraphernalia which can Canada actually

1768
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,960
you do if you use uh you know a certain

1769
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:33,159
cannabis paraphernalia the C the country

1770
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,600
will actually subsidize that and

1771
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:38,559
reimburse you for that which again we

1772
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,520
have none of this type of access so uh

1773
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,199
our our veterans should be able to have

1774
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:46,239
this type of access and access points

1775
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:48,039
without a doubt and um here soon yeah

1776
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:49,879
we're working on some other things as

1777
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:51,519
well but this is kind of our first

1778
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,960
volley so we're going to be putting that

1779
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,120
across the wire at 6:00 a.m. in the

1780
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:58,000
morning or so but oh here I'll drop it

1781
01:16:56,119 --> 01:17:00,119
in chat you guys can get a preliminary

1782
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,880
it's on our veterans Action Council

1783
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:06,639
website on um under uh projects and uh

1784
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,000
this is our first project that we have

1785
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:12,760
that we've released so uh we're just

1786
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,319
trying to uh be a rally point for other

1787
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:18,320
veterans so that we can actually uh

1788
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:21,158
pressure the VHA into these changes that

1789
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:23,759
we want to see because you know veterans

1790
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:25,879
are an encapsulation of society and so

1791
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,840
we're a small piece of Society so we're

1792
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:31,279
trying to do our best to crack the glass

1793
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,600
ceiling so that others have access as

1794
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:36,679
well so we're just trying to uh lead the

1795
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:40,159
charge by storming the beach and um

1796
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:43,079
follow us I'm out can we go back to the

1797
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:45,719
German Doctor Who told you

1798
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:49,279
hashish sure well I was actually

1799
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:53,600
American doctor and I was in uh the

1800
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:56,880
hospital and I was uh they put me on

1801
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:59,480
morphine um and of course they give they

1802
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:03,440
they give you a button right so you can

1803
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:04,959
do take as much morphine as you want and

1804
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,119
I was an artist I was a creative person

1805
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,880
I was a musician so if I wanted to sit

1806
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:13,439
and drool all over

1807
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:15,679
myself morphine is perfect for that

1808
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,879
however I didn't like the feeling I

1809
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:19,840
didn't like the sedation I didn't like

1810
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,159
the coming out there was nothing about

1811
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,119
it I liked except it stopped the pain

1812
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,559
but I could not be in my creative mind

1813
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:29,399
I'm left-handed so I'm always in my

1814
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:31,600
right mind right so I couldn't I

1815
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:33,238
couldn't travel there naturally or as

1816
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,800
free flowing

1817
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:37,919
so I asked this I asked the physician

1818
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,199
when he came

1819
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:44,760
in I said I want to get off this

1820
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:48,839
morphine and he said have you heard of

1821
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:51,920
hashish and I laughed and he laughed and

1822
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:55,119
I kept laughing and he stopped laughing

1823
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:57,840
and I realized that you know he was

1824
01:18:55,119 --> 01:19:00,719
serious and he said look I I I've heard

1825
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:04,639
of people you know utilizing that to you

1826
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:06,840
know get off it and I basically said

1827
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:10,920
well where the hell do I find that and

1828
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:14,159
his response was I don't know try a

1829
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:18,199
bar and that's where it started yeah I I

1830
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:22,238
got went to a bar in ansbach and uh

1831
01:19:18,198 --> 01:19:25,479
Germany and you know in my my terrible

1832
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:27,638
German English uh was able to score a

1833
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:29,839
little bit of hash and it was very I

1834
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:32,520
don't think I don't I don't think it was

1835
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:35,960
a full gram you know it was very small

1836
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,960
and then how do I ingest

1837
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:44,520
it got one of them they're bar

1838
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:47,039
grams so oh and it was it was you know

1839
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:50,520
it it was all crumbly it didn't squish

1840
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:53,079
you know it was you know probably waxed

1841
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,320
you know Afghan they already made rosin

1842
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:56,000
with it and they were just giving you

1843
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:58,920
what was in the

1844
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,359
bags you never smoked before you never

1845
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:04,639
smoked before that I had but you know

1846
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:07,439
when we had hash which was very rare it

1847
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:09,880
was the old you take a pen you put it on

1848
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,119
the pen you light it you put on a piece

1849
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:15,000
of cardboard and put the glass over it

1850
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:19,359
and you do the the slid under the

1851
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,560
glass so yeah hash under the glass so so

1852
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:24,119
you you you grew up in in Louisiana

1853
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,639
right so so the kind of hash that you

1854
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:30,039
were getting was like black hash or

1855
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:32,400
Lebanese red hash or it was never golden

1856
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:34,840
right no no no I didn't see golden hash

1857
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,920
so I was actually in Saudi Arabia and I

1858
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,639
actually bought real Lebanese uh

1859
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,880
everything that I had seen and

1860
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,600
everything from that I would if you go

1861
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,199
along in certain areas in New Orleans

1862
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:47,199
you know they would try to sell you

1863
01:20:44,198 --> 01:20:50,119
scrapings out of their bong if you smell

1864
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:52,839
it you could smell bong water you know

1865
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:54,639
so you knew that was fake ass hash uh

1866
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,800
but the other stuff you know you kind of

1867
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,159
kind of looked hopefully for a little

1868
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,119
piece of gold on the top of it from you

1869
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:03,000
know where it was chipped off so I knew

1870
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:04,920
to kind of look for that but no no no

1871
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,238
all all we had access to in Louisiana

1872
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:10,560
was crappy uh you know Coca-Cola press

1873
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:13,119
Mexican it wasn't until I was up in West

1874
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,719
Virginia that I saw real hash and that I

1875
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:16,279
tried it and we did the whole you know

1876
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,920
stick the pin through the cardboard and

1877
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:20,559
put the glass over it and then my

1878
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:24,000
friends went to a head shop in

1879
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,960
Pittsburgh and bought one of the old um

1880
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,520
what was with the glass dome but it was

1881
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:31,719
a a heating uh a vapor soldering a

1882
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,400
soldering plate on the top vaporizer

1883
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:35,039
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and

1884
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:36,719
you know those oh that was oh we're

1885
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:38,639

1886
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:42,279
you're like oh this sh all burnt oh my

1887
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:45,000
God this terrible yeah uh so there's

1888
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:48,279
just no access to Quality cannabis or

1889
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,198
hash until yeah I was D we we've come a

1890
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:52,479
long way that actually makes me feel a

1891
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:55,439
lot better about where we are right now

1892
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:57,119
sometimes I forget where cuz where I am

1893
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,319
and where I need to kind of go back it's

1894
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,559
a very small Journey compared to where I

1895
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:06,119
was in high school also buying all these

1896
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:09,239
different hashes no coas no you know

1897
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:10,559
Sops like this [ __ ] was like oh yeah

1898
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:12,319
looks like they pressed this with their

1899
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,280
feet or something there's like some hair

1900
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:17,359
some weird skin in in in there like but

1901
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:19,399
there it was you know we were just like

1902
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:22,439
happy to smoke it I was lucky to have it

1903
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:25,599
to get you high yeah of course man I for

1904
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:28,399
me the my I I got got to you know we got

1905
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:30,320
Afghani we got a little Moroccan we got

1906
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:34,439
red and blonde

1907
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:38,359
Lebanese and we got Indian and Nepali

1908
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:41,399
Charis and that was pretty special um

1909
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:43,119
you at least back in the 90s yeah Manali

1910
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:46,599
cream or

1911
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:48,719
Parvati you know just like nice nice

1912
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:51,480
nice things and then you know Nepali

1913
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:54,239
cream which was kind of like way above

1914
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:56,439
that whole region and uh that was kind

1915
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:59,119
of always the nicest and Jamaican

1916
01:22:56,439 --> 01:23:01,198
Jamaican gun so so the kicker is when I

1917
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:03,599
moved here to the Bay Area the only

1918
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:06,599
place I could score weed was actually

1919
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:09,000
going across the bay to in front of the

1920
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,280
Ben and Jerry's on haon ashberry and

1921
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,639
because that's where all the dead head

1922
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:16,719
kids were hanging out and you could buy

1923
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:19,920
the eighth quarter three quarters or

1924
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:22,319
quarter right off the street so you know

1925
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,960
it's been a long way to think about how

1926
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:28,158
and where we get access to our what year

1927
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:31,600
was that ATM oh that was

1928
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:34,039
93 93 94 absolutely yeah yeah yeah I

1929
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,520
would have to I worked at that I was an

1930
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:37,479
before I got hired onto the Cannabis

1931
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,360
Action Network I was a night manager at

1932
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:43,479
an ice cream parlor and I used to get

1933
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:46,519
would close at 10: I'd shut down shop at

1934
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:49,359
10:30 I would jog to the North Berkeley

1935
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:52,760
BART catch the BART to the transfer

1936
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:57,839
point at uh MacArthur make it into San

1937
01:23:52,760 --> 01:24:01,960
Francisco jump on the 7 or the 5 uh 52

1938
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:04,719
bus or 53 going up to hate ashberry jump

1939
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:07,480
out at the corner of hate and Asbury

1940
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:11,239
score my [ __ ] real quick on the corner

1941
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:14,039
then jump on the other Corner real quick

1942
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:16,079
to catch the bus going back to the BART

1943
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:18,158
and then Bart all the way back to the

1944
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:21,319
East Bay which is usually the last BART

1945
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:24,559
to the East Bay and then walk another

1946
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:27,238
mile home so that's how I used to score

1947
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,760
weed on the street so to know that now I

1948
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:30,759
only have to go to a dispensary and

1949
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,920
actually purchase it you have no idea

1950
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:36,679
how thankful I am of just that simple

1951
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,319
Trek because that used to be a two-hour

1952
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:42,399
you know Trek just on and and trying not

1953
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:45,000
to stink up when you score that that

1954
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:47,158
that bud from those dead heads that [ __ ]

1955
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,880
stunk and of course all you had was just

1956
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:51,679
a quick [ __ ] you know roll up and

1957
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,560
just stick it in your [ __ ] and just hold

1958
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:55,719
that people weren't [ __ ] like staring

1959
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,159
you down the [ __ ] boser on the BART like

1960
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:01,319
I know what you got on

1961
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:03,319
you that's Monica and I used to live at

1962
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:05,960
Paige and Clayton one corner from the

1963
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:10,679
corner of pton ashbery where that Ben

1964
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:12,960
and Jerry's is and yes even even up to

1965
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:16,279
2010 uh there were still kids standing

1966
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,679
at the corner selling uh one two and

1967
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:21,158
three and four finger bags it would

1968
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:23,520
stink when you walked by that corner

1969
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:24,960
right like you would smell you knew you

1970
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,719
knew were walking up

1971
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,158
there was a certain number of and I hate

1972
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:32,359
to keep being you know pedantic here

1973
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:35,238
certain number of dead heads and a

1974
01:25:32,359 --> 01:25:37,319
certain given environment it there would

1975
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:39,599
it would smell like weed and like you

1976
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:42,479
walk by a cluster of like three or four

1977
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:45,800
people it would smell like weed and yeah

1978
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:47,799
I mean isn't it funny I mean it's like

1979
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,000
when the Grateful Dead wasn't on tour

1980
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:53,039
this is where they set up

1981
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,359
shop yeah and which was ironic I ended

1982
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:59,760
up with when I was with can I had one of

1983
01:25:56,359 --> 01:26:02,000
only like five Street permits where I

1984
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,840
actually was given by the uh chief of

1985
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,960
police of San Francisco where I could

1986
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,000
set up and I could set up my booth on

1987
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:11,319
the corner of CH of uh of um haon

1988
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,560
ashbery so I mean it was just really

1989
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:14,920
weird to go I used to score drugs right

you're sitting there talking about the

2029
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,000
beginning of all the changes and I was

2030
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:50,600
gonna you know mention the changes with

2031
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,279
the growing and and Chin's talking about

2032
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,639
the morphine trip and I remember that

2033
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:56,279
and having to get off of all of the

2034
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:57,800
morphine by using cannabis and and amino

2035
01:27:56,279 --> 01:27:59,479
acids and stuff so I'm just mean

2036
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,000
listening just like listening on

2037
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:05,118
clubhouse and just taking in all you

2038
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,000
guys and chatting away and you know

2039
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:08,439
saying good morning and then my newest

2040
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,238
thing which I really like is I mean

2041
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:12,359
actually putting dry sift directly into

2042
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:13,759
my smoothies so instead of juicing the

2043
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:15,559
leaf and I've been just sifting those

2044
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,600
gland heads I've been actually putting

2045
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,239
dry sift into my smoothies and I showed

2046
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,079
it yesterday and I've been talking about

2047
01:28:19,238 --> 01:28:23,678
that and I've really seen a difference

2048
01:28:21,079 --> 01:28:26,960
in just my mood and everything lately

2049
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:28,880
just last week and a half CAU your mouth

2050
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,600
and like when you because I throw it in

2051
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,920
the smoothie and and I mentioned

2052
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,960
yesterday I could taste a little bit on

2053
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,800
my teeth so I kind of yeah was like it's

2054
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,520
was a little bit there on the teeth but

2055
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,480
the flavors of the tpin from the sift is

2056
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,600
so much different from just the juicing

2057
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:45,638
of the leaf that I get that grainy taste

2058
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,800
so I've been experimenting too by

2059
01:28:45,639 --> 01:28:48,880
listening to a lot of people in

2060
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,480
clubhouse and finding the best regimen

2061
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,639
for my medicine because I've been

2062
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:55,718
hitting a lot of high THC and I see how

2063
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:57,359
that affects me but I also want to see

2064
01:28:55,719 --> 01:28:59,239
how the more

2065
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:01,719
of

2066
01:28:59,238 --> 01:29:04,158
i' I'm just testing my own body right

2067
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:05,760
now again like always so you know good

2068
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:08,158
morning I would think that it would

2069
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:11,000
leave like a little grit in your mouth

2070
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:13,920
like like even if you could really

2071
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,800
really homogenize it in your blender and

2072
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,480
make a really fine dispersion in your

2073
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,760
smoothie that it would still like after

2074
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:24,479
you after you've completely drinken your

2075
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,920
smoothie it doesn't leave like a grit

2076
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:28,959
behind it all

2077
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:31,079
or I occasionally do what John's doing

2078
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,960
and I find the taste kind of pleasant

2079
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:35,639
it's like finding a little nuggets of

2080
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,600
flavor exactly that's what I like about

2081
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:39,719
it it's those flavors that I'm getting

2082
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,400
from those T that I'm not getting when I

2083
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:43,158
was actually just putting raw Leaf in my

2084
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:45,118
smoothies for a long time then I used to

2085
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:46,759
do the juicing and take the raw I used

2086
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:48,839
to freeze it in the freezer and then

2087
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,920
like put those in my smoothies back in

2088
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,520
the days after my surgery and stuff like

2089
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:54,840
that so I've been doing this for quite

2090
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:57,480
some time but I really really enjoy just

2091
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:58,760
putting the sift in the smoothie in the

2092
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:00,399
in the morning because you do get those

2093
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,760
little genuine little nuggets of

2094
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:04,719
different flavors like oh yeah are you

2095
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:07,280
adding lethin or anything to your

2096
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:10,319
smoothie and if so what smoothie flavor

2097
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:12,679
are you using with what resin I'm using

2098
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:14,519
good food and I just order these suckers

2099
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:18,039
online I get a dozen delivered to my

2100
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,840
door every basically two weeks and I

2101
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:22,479
have different flavors so some I use

2102
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,400
almond milk with some I use grape juice

2103
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:27,198
with so I have a Kai they're all natural

2104
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:28,799
more raw food drinks that I've been

2105
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:30,879
getting into and stuff like that so been

2106
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,600
paying attention to that type of Healthy

2107
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:36,279
nutrition like crazy so I mean this one

2108
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,679
in particular um yeah everything's

2109
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:41,238
really healthy so I mean I got cold brew

2110
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:44,679
coffee bananas cashew budy vanilla bean

2111
01:30:41,238 --> 01:30:48,079
cocoa nibs roasted coffee beans U mocha

2112
01:30:44,679 --> 01:30:51,679
power and Himalayan pink salt well the

2113
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:55,238
reason I was asking if you added um any

2114
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,520
any spikes to it in the sense um why

2115
01:30:55,238 --> 01:30:59,279
does my video keep cutting out it's

2116
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:03,520
really weird um like that picture you

2117
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:07,599
John yeah there you go um it's

2118
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:09,119
um oh my my my my brain transport for

2119
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,520
better absorption is what you're talking

2120
01:31:09,118 --> 01:31:13,000
thinking about well it breaks down if

2121
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:15,639
you use uh something like soy leathan it

2122
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,600
actually breaks down the acid so it's it

2123
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:20,079
it's more uptable for your body whereas

2124
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,960
it sounds like you're going for the thca

2125
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:24,559
experience for the acid experience for

2126
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,920
the the feeling as opposed to uh the

2127
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:31,080
body high Etc because that would

2128
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:33,960
actually break it down uh

2129
01:31:31,079 --> 01:31:35,439
thought hey I'm just you know I I I like

2130
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,520
the thoughts I think I might have done

2131
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:39,439
that in the past but sunflower seed

2132
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:42,159
version of it too atan I don't know if

2133
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:45,039
You' used that before um that that's

2134
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:48,479
also a nice a nice one sunflower seeds

2135
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:52,519
or oil just the oil the sunflower L

2136
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:55,839
letin letin okay yeah let's say this

2137
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:55,840
letin Le

2138
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:00,320
ask Mark I wanted yeah I want to make

2139
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:03,559
sure

2140
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:06,559
we yeah the sunflower letin actually

2141
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:10,440
comes in sunflower oil that is a great

2142
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:13,480
vehicle for canabo so it's it's a good

2143
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:16,319
way to to emulsify them absolutely I

2144
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:19,238
agree with that and sunflower doesn't

2145
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:20,599
have um as it's a taste is pretty

2146
01:32:19,238 --> 01:32:23,919
neutral I mean there's definitely a

2147
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:28,000
flavor to it but it's pretty neutral in

2148
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,000
flavor as part as far as oils

2149
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:34,000
go yeah so my daily is being a smoothie

2150
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,279
with sift as you can see I'm just

2151
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,279
getting

2152
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:40,800
healthy I'm uh thinking you might need

2153
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,400
some stitches on that shave job on your

2154
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,119
chin there Johnny B what uh I'm working

2155
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:46,920
on that come on you know I just then I

2156
01:32:45,118 --> 01:32:49,679
riped it off and I B again I was just

2157
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:51,880
like haven't shaved in a

2158
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:54,600
while I thought that was a tattoo don't

2159
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:57,840
shave for a while I thought that was a

2160
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,480
tattoo it's just a teardrop on his chin

2161
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,119
it means something totally different I

2162
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:04,519
thought it was that's what I thought it

2163
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:07,118
was oh Johnny Be is not gonna get a

2164
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,239
tattoo on his chin no he's got some

2165
01:33:07,118 --> 01:33:12,519
tattoos though I you

2166
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:14,079
know the Phoenix the dragon that I

2167
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:17,480
chased and the Phoenix that rised above

2168
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:19,399
my he's cracked but he's not broken

2169
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:21,638
absolutely I feel like we're all a

2170
01:33:19,399 --> 01:33:23,118
little cracked but not broken it's one

2171
01:33:21,639 --> 01:33:24,920
thing I wanted to discuss here and when

2172
01:33:23,118 --> 01:33:26,960
you were talking both the new changes in

2173
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:28,239
the system and how you got into this how

2174
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,239
Everything's changed quite a bit with

2175
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:33,079
the IPOs and being able to get hash on

2176
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:35,439
the legal Market I find that over the

2177
01:33:33,079 --> 01:33:38,439
last 30 years growing has changed quite

2178
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:41,039
dramatically in the last like few years

2179
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:43,799
with LEDs and VPD and looking at the

2180
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,639
soils and the microbes and and the root

2181
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,079
Temp and like there's so much different

2182
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:48,760
from when I was talking with my old

2183
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:50,359
friends been growing for 30 years and

2184
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,920
like now they're like it's a whole new

2185
01:33:50,359 --> 01:33:53,519
game they have to learn how to grow

2186
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,679
again with the years of experience

2187
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,600
theyve had so um yeah I'm just touching

2188
01:33:56,679 --> 01:34:02,480
basis on that and how there's been so

2189
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:04,360
much change in the growing Community uh

2190
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:07,319
in the last few years it's been quite

2191
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:09,960
actually a new learning curve totally

2192
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:12,599
well Marcus when you were gushing before

2193
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,198
about about your uh you know your guys's

2194
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:18,000
tremendous achievement at a bar in bark

2195
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:20,599
and I I it sounded like something I said

2196
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,679
on hash Church a couple weeks ago I was

2197
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:25,520
really you know complimenting you guys

2198
01:34:22,679 --> 01:34:26,840
and part of it is that anybody who's

2199
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,639
who's has to

2200
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:32,840
undertake getting the the mass

2201
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:36,400
production not at an artisan level but

2202
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:40,079
at a mass-produced level a product out

2203
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:43,198
under GMP manufacturing knows the

2204
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:46,600
tremendous challenge that that exists

2205
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:48,960
and and what underpins that is is

2206
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:52,280
quality it's all about quality and it's

2207
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,198
all about quality at at a reproduced at

2208
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:57,158
a at a higher level

2209
01:34:54,198 --> 01:35:00,238
at a higher higher volume of production

2210
01:34:57,158 --> 01:35:02,479
which is not a trivial thing to do with

2211
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:05,198
anything that's plant-based let alone

2212
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:07,118
cannabis and so that that's a tremendous

2213
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:09,000
Challenge and the last thing I'll just

2214
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:11,920
mention is as you know I mean any

2215
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,880
company has got products you know

2216
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,800
products is the PW right but really when

2217
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:20,199
it comes down to it it's the people man

2218
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:22,920
it's the people that make these

2219
01:35:20,198 --> 01:35:24,319
products and the companies that are

2220
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:27,960
successful

2221
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:30,559
are the ones that know how to retain

2222
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:33,279
their talent because if they treat

2223
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:37,800
people in this quote unquote industry is

2224
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:40,439
just throw away you know5 $20 hour

2225
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:42,560
employ but if if these employer

2226
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:46,359
employers don't realize that their

2227
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:48,679
employees have to see a future in that

2228
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:51,039
company for them or else they're going

2229
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:53,800
to split they're going to go elsewhere

2230
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:56,479
and they can't just be viewed as some

2231
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:59,440
Expendable Workforce they're there in

2232
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:02,638
your lab markets getting once in a

2233
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:04,879
lifetime training from a Pioneer like

2234
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:08,319
you who's basically taken this thing

2235
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:11,440
from Artisan level to GMP production

2236
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:13,399
I'll bet you guys that you guys get like

2237
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:15,638
hundreds of resumés of people chomping

2238
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:18,479
at the bit wanting to just get in there

2239
01:36:15,639 --> 01:36:21,920
and get that training and again like if

2240
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:25,158
it if it goes anywhere from here it's

2241
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:29,399
going to be towards GMP level production

2242
01:36:25,158 --> 01:36:33,238
so really it just sets the bar so high

2243
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:35,920
that once you once you hit that I mean

2244
01:36:33,238 --> 01:36:39,559
it's like everything else working up to

2245
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:42,440
that has been just such a a huge

2246
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:44,360
nonlinear adventure and something done

2247
01:36:42,439 --> 01:36:46,079
with Incredible headwinds because if you

2248
01:36:44,359 --> 01:36:49,799
think about that stuff was illegal for

2249
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:52,800
so long taking any technology out from

2250
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:54,360
you know the way we used to kind of keep

2251
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,679
everything really quiet now we're all

2252
01:36:54,359 --> 01:36:59,079
out on the internet you know bragging

2253
01:36:56,679 --> 01:37:02,359
about Brands and trying to get you know

2254
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:04,279
big deals going I mean it's no trivial

2255
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:06,639
event and the shareholders the people

2256
01:37:04,279 --> 01:37:09,439
who throw the money down that make this

2257
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:12,960
whole thing happen need to make sure to

2258
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:15,799
defer risk that it's done by GMP if it's

2259
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,359
not done by GMP you know then they're

2260
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:20,920
taking a tremendous risk at putting

2261
01:37:18,359 --> 01:37:23,118
products out there that are going to be

2262
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:25,560
just you know falling flat on their face

2263
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:27,679
so you guys have set the bar and you

2264
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,480
know I hope we can get there soon here

2265
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:33,480
in the US and I hope that someday the

2266
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:35,519
Border won't make a difference anymore

2267
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:37,718
and we'll be able to get your product as

2268
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:40,480
you'll be able to get our product and

2269
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:43,198
there'll be a free flow of technology

2270
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:45,799
and commerce at the US Canadian

2271
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:47,678
border that would be something indeed

2272
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,599
Mark that would be something and I'd

2273
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:52,199
eventually love to see it worldwide I'd

2274
01:37:49,599 --> 01:37:54,719
love to see how people in different

2275
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:57,759
environments can use their Terre to get

2276
01:37:54,719 --> 01:38:00,279
their plants to express to this unique

2277
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,039
method and and see like oh well this

2278
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:04,439
particular area of the world just seems

2279
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:06,800
to really like this Cult of ours seems

2280
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:08,719
to do the best there and you know it

2281
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,639
might take 20 or 30 or 40 years but

2282
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:12,679
we'll suddenly start learning the way we

2283
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,440
know that the best lavender you know

2284
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:16,440
comes from France and then the second

2285
01:38:14,439 --> 01:38:18,719
best Lavender is in the black forest in

2286
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:20,238
Germany and you know for whatever reason

2287
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,039
everyone grows lavender all over the

2288
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:24,118
world but it doesn't seem to express

2289
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:27,158
itself the same way as it does in these

2290
01:38:24,118 --> 01:38:28,799
two regions in France and Germany and so

2291
01:38:27,158 --> 01:38:31,238
cannabis is going to do the same thing

2292
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,639
so many different cool cultivars um

2293
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:34,638
really quickly I want to shout out

2294
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:38,480
denail I haven't used this yet but they

2295
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:40,639
sent me their new blender um uh Banger

2296
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,519
that is supposed to just be absolutely

2297
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:45,880
it's like falling film Mark the dab goes

2298
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,119
in and then it goes up the side so this

2299
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:50,359
is your heat Source you heat the sides a

2300
01:38:48,118 --> 01:38:52,839
little bit and it's really as it goes up

2301
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:54,639
and down the sides uh you get your your

2302
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:56,840
dab and you can and just put a marble on

2303
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:59,719
top like that for uh this is a super

2304
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,039
trippy puke and Beagle uh carb cap that

2305
01:38:59,719 --> 01:39:03,520
they gave me years ago but I'm going to

2306
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:06,519
use that as my my marble well hook it up

2307
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,159
and let's do an online on camera demo

2308
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:11,480
right are you ready dude well I'm gonna

2309
01:39:09,158 --> 01:39:14,118
when this one I'm G to I'm going to film

2310
01:39:11,479 --> 01:39:16,198
yeah he 3D printed this dab tool for me

2311
01:39:14,118 --> 01:39:20,039
as well so this is like a really nice

2312
01:39:16,198 --> 01:39:23,000
dab tool that um that that unscrews from

2313
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:24,639
here and so you can replace the handle

2314
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,399
with some other different ones and then

2315
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:31,000
they also sent me um his new thing which

2316
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:32,960
is called D modium and I'm not even sure

2317
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,639
what I did with the D

2318
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:38,039
modium um he it showed up in like a

2319
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:40,800
little Jeweler box I probably lost it at

2320
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:44,000
this point but it's a new uh material so

2321
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:46,239
he sent me these really cool tweezers so

2322
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,359
I could pick up these hot little DM

2323
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:52,598
modium balls and get them into my Banger

2324
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:55,359
um so yeah I'll be doing a video on that

2325
01:39:52,599 --> 01:39:57,039
with the 4K camera and uh putting that

2326
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:58,799
up on my channel in a bit I always

2327

2349
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,880
surely I convinced everyone in my family

2350
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:56,079
that they should be using C

2351
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,719
which is kind of the case now uh but it

2352

hash into the United States you know um

2388
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:41,960
because uh yeah we all got together

2389
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:43,319
started checking each other on Wellness

2390
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:45,118
checks you know it's been this whole

2391
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:47,079
covid reality where we all been kind of

2392
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:49,799
worried about each other and as you know

2393
01:42:47,079 --> 01:42:52,118
uh our veterans suffer from you know 22

01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:54,599
suicides a day on average we've lost

2395
01:42:52,118 --> 01:42:58,839
more to suicide on unfortunately than uh

2396
01:42:54,599 --> 01:43:00,960
we have to war and um by checking in

2397
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:03,599
with each other we realized you know we

2398
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:06,319
could probably do some work together and

2399
01:43:03,599 --> 01:43:08,880

01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:23,760
standby um she is at um yeah uh I'm not

2404
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:27,440
sure exactly where she is um

2405
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:30,079
part of one of our guys Rico Pera was

2406
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:32,118
part of uh her studies and worked with

2407
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:34,960
her at the University of Arizona and is

2408
01:43:32,118 --> 01:43:37,839
very much in contact with her but right

2409
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:41,198
now I'm not sure what necessarily is

2410
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:44,119
happening as we know uh one of our other

2411
01:43:41,198 --> 01:43:46,678
uh Brothers uh Brian Buckley at the

2412
01:43:44,118 --> 01:43:50,799
Helman Valley Growers company they just

2413
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:54,679
got an IRB uh to do human studies on

2414
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:57,320
their Vape cartridges in Sandy Diego so

2415
01:43:54,679 --> 01:44:00,359
uh they're going to be uh recruiting I

2416
01:43:57,319 --> 01:44:03,158
think around 60 or so Veterans for a

2417
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:05,639
control study of where they'll be using

2418
01:44:03,158 --> 01:44:08,279
uh real world cannabis uh cartridges

2419
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:10,480
that you can buy currently and they'll

2420
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:12,639
go to dispensaries pick which ones they

2421
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:15,158
want there have a selection of of four

2422
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:18,118
to five or something like that to choose

2423
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:21,479
from and then they'll do the study uh it

2424
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:23,598
is basically uh on the effects of PTSD

2425
01:44:21,479 --> 01:44:25,359
because to do the IRB they could do

2426
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:27,000
post-traumatic stress altogether so

2427
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:30,158
they're going after the individual

2428
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:32,238
symptoms to show that in the end have

2429
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:34,920
the scientists go oh wellow those are

2430
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:38,198
all the different symptoms of pts uh

2431
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:41,239
oh so yeah there's uh there's scientist

2432
01:44:38,198 --> 01:44:44,079
going on observational study right uh

2433
01:44:41,238 --> 01:44:48,000
Rico's making me know that uh Dr sisly

2434
01:44:44,079 --> 01:44:49,319
will be publishing soon so uh we'll let

2435
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,599
you know and as soon as I get that

2436
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:53,399
across my desk I'll send that to you

2437
01:44:51,599 --> 01:44:56,440
right 18 in the study you were talking

2438
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:58,479
about there the the PTSD study the with

2439
01:44:56,439 --> 01:45:01,158
cartridges that's just an observational

2440
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:04,158
study that they're doing right uh he's

2441
01:45:01,158 --> 01:45:07,158
working with yes uh nedic out of uh

2442
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:09,960
Israel uh so they're actually doing uh

2443
01:45:07,158 --> 01:45:13,759
full study and uh replications I think

2444
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:16,118
they're also when uh his company expands

2445
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:18,800
into Michigan they want to replicate the

2446
01:45:16,118 --> 01:45:22,759
same study with the veterans in Michigan

2447
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:25,639
so um let's see he is also stating that

2448
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:27,960
the uh study is complete the results of

2449
01:45:25,639 --> 01:45:30,480
the doc study will be released soon so

2450
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,439
that's where we stand oh watching hash

2451
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:36,079
Church hi

2452
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:37,678
r hi Dr Sue also if you're watching yeah

2453
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:40,000
we should have Dr Sue

2454
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:42,199
on oh yeah we could we could totally

2455
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,039
have her on and we have access to her oh

2456
01:45:42,198 --> 01:45:47,559
she's a very engaging speaker and you

2457
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:52,599
know I mean again I think we need 10 Dr

2458
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:55,840
sus or 20 Dr sus or 30 Dr sus Dr Addy

2459
01:45:52,599 --> 01:45:57,719
Ray is also very well spoken and I I

2460
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,079
like uh what I've heard from her and had

2461
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:00,719
a few conversations with her on

2462
01:45:59,079 --> 01:46:03,279
clubhouse she's another one we could be

2463
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:07,079
inviting on great yeah we just had her

2464

and um also Dr suis Le works with the

2466
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:16,439
Dem Collective as well and uh I bet we

2467
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:18,598
could even potentially get Ethan Russo

2468
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:20,519
to join us one day if we you know if we

2469
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:22,920
had a a plan for that and you know we

2470
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:25,080
could get some good conversations also

2471
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:28,279
I'd like to just say Kevin mccurnin you

2473
01:46:28,279 --> 01:46:32,238
Kevin mccar has put out a lot of

2474
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:33,880
information you know about the current

2475
01:46:32,238 --> 01:46:36,598
pandemic and then just different

2476
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:38,560
scientific things so we really love and

2477
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:40,960
appreciate the work he's doing out there

2478
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:44,679
as well I invited him

2479
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:47,158
today uh Dr Mark also just to clarify of

2480
01:46:44,679 --> 01:46:48,920
course Dr ssle was stuck with and for

2481
01:46:47,158 --> 01:46:51,519
the audience she was stuck with the

2482
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:52,880
actual Nida cannabis uh which is the

2483
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,520
stuff that's grown at the University

2484
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:59,079
Mississippi held in crates fails

2485
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:02,560
microbials all that other stuff while uh

2486
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:05,039
Brian Buckley and the HGC they're using

2487
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:07,880
you know real world cannabis uh that you

2488
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:10,639
can get dispensar so doc Sisley was a

2489
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:12,359
blinded uh Placebo controlled with that

2490
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:15,319
ditch weed

2491
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:17,960
so yeah well I mean even even that ditch

2492
01:47:15,319 --> 01:47:20,920
weed we know will will work better than

2493
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:24,039
than nothing at all but I mean h how

2494
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:26,039
ridiculous that they still you know have

2495
01:47:24,039 --> 01:47:28,679
researchers especially people who want

2496
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:31,719
to do observational clinical research

2497
01:47:28,679 --> 01:47:34,239
their hands held to well you need to put

2498
01:47:31,719 --> 01:47:36,639
a proposal through naida to get you know

2499
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:39,919
University of Mississippi you know weed

2500
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:42,079
that that Monopoly is just about to

2501
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,079
end and hopefully we're going to be

2502
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:45,920
pressuring that with our green paper as

2503
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:47,679
well because we're presenting it and

2504
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:50,359
it's to be Ule you can take it and go

2505
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:53,118
educate your Educators as well as your

2506
01:47:50,359 --> 01:47:55,118
constituency senators and house members

2507
01:47:53,118 --> 01:47:57,238
so that you know at the state level and

2508
01:47:55,118 --> 01:48:00,039
at the federal level because uh we're

2509
01:47:57,238 --> 01:48:03,279
able to do these uh cannabis through the

2510
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:05,840
VA at least recommendation discussions

2511
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:08,198
in these states that are legal and uh

2512
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:11,440
allow for medical cannabis but we're

2513
01:48:08,198 --> 01:48:14,238
trying to kick the door open for all 50

2514
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:17,118
uh States and territories so um the

2515
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:19,279
work's going to be not easy to do but uh

2516
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:21,839
you know this is a tool for you to

2517
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:23,719
utilize to educate people so that we can

2518
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:25,360
change the discuss and move the Line in

2519
01:48:23,719 --> 01:48:28,239
the

2520
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:29,118
Sand and we can import Bubble Man hash

2521
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:32,238
into

2522
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:34,880
America yes that's that's our real

2523
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:38,158
agenda here which is we need to get

2524
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:41,079
Marcus's hash down

2525
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:43,279
here I'm always I'm always talking with

2526
01:48:41,079 --> 01:48:44,679
Colin about certain things and I've got

2527
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:47,000
some conversations going with some

2528
01:48:44,679 --> 01:48:49,840
groups in California so maybe one day

2529
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,439
again we'll uh we'll have the brand down

2530
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:53,880
there we'll see how it goes it's you

2531
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:57,960
know it's so much work to really just do

2532
01:48:53,880 --> 01:49:01,440
it in one place that uh I didn't want to

2533
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:03,319
detract what I was doing here just give

2534
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,279
you a mute yeah I think I think we'll

2535
01:49:03,319 --> 01:49:07,599
we're gonna

2536
01:49:04,279 --> 01:49:11,319
be might seeing it sooner than later

2537
01:49:07,599 --> 01:49:12,920
Mark yeah exactly it could happen it's

2538
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:14,679
all the timing right it's not like I

2539
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:16,880
haven't been having these conversations

2540
01:49:14,679 --> 01:49:19,000
they just always seem to go sideways in

2541
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:21,079
the 11th hour and because I've had this

2542
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:24,198
brand for so long I'm like yeah I can

2543
01:49:21,079 --> 01:49:27,279
wait for like years more more so not

2544
01:49:24,198 --> 01:49:30,799
rushing this yeah you could wait the

2545
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:32,880
market won't wait for you though right

2546
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:35,599
so you know what funny thing about the

2547
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:38,480
market was it wasn't the same thing it

2548
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:40,039
was before I started selling these bags

2549
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:41,839
and so then I had this different

2550
01:49:40,039 --> 01:49:44,319
perspective than most people I had this

2551
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:48,279
perspective like oh like so you can

2552
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:50,519
follow the market or you can create the

2553
01:49:48,279 --> 01:49:53,079
market and those are two different

2554
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:56,119
things and they're very different

2555
01:49:53,079 --> 01:49:59,279
Pathways that may very well lead to in

2556
01:49:56,118 --> 01:50:02,359
the same direction but they're just one

2557
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:04,439
little Notch off changes everything and

2558
01:50:02,359 --> 01:50:05,198
that's kind of what I'm you know trying

2559
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:07,919
to

2560
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:09,799
constantly convince my team of is that

2561
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:12,399
hey like we should be more along the

2562
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,520
lines I mean straddling that line

2563
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:17,759
delicately not picking one Camp blindly

2564
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,560
but kind of straddling that fence on

2565
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,400
both sides and and gaining access from

2566
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,440
both those perspectives instead of only

2567
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:26,839
one

2568
01:50:24,439 --> 01:50:26,839
be the

2569
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:33,880
market be the market isn't that what go

2570
01:50:31,719 --> 01:50:38,560
ahead in general people like to go for

2571
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:38,560
quality or quantity I'm talking about

2572
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:46,360
producers and generally generally the

2573
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:48,920
quality comes from smaller

2574
01:50:46,359 --> 01:50:51,319
sizes generally speaking that's why it's

2575
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:54,920
so difficult to bring the quality to the

2576
01:50:51,319 --> 01:50:57,399
big you st stage and that's why Mark is

2577
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:59,599
you know Mark scallon's given Marcus so

2578
01:50:57,399 --> 01:51:02,479
much Kudos is because it's not super

2579
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:05,440
easy to have quality at at a at a large

2580
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:07,319
scale it it can be done and it's always

2581
01:51:05,439 --> 01:51:10,559
a hard you know it's always a goal but

2582
01:51:07,319 --> 01:51:14,238
you know generally the quality is in is

2583
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:15,840
in the small uh you know small holder um

2584
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:18,238
and I like what Johnny B was saying I

2585
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:20,719
mean things have changed in the growing

2586
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:24,279
world and we've seen an absolute you

2587
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:27,560
know let's say explosion of of living

2588
01:51:24,279 --> 01:51:30,000
soils in indoors and uh you know it just

2589
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:34,199
continues to prove itself and when you

2590
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,760
say you have to relearn everything one

2591
01:51:34,198 --> 01:51:38,839
of the things you're relearning is you

2592
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,599
don't have to do so much so once you

2593
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:43,440
create the bed once you create maybe a

2594
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:45,319
wooden bed or some kind of a bed for

2595
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:47,559
your plants to grow in and you recognize

2596
01:51:45,319 --> 01:51:49,238
that a larger soil and a bigger root

2597
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:51,599
base you know is going to keep a health

2598
01:51:49,238 --> 01:51:54,158
to your plants and then maybe now you're

2599
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:57,000
using predators maybe 30 years ago you

2600
01:51:54,158 --> 01:52:00,879
never needed Predators honestly 30 years

2601
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:03,319
ago I mean who had a lot of pests so as

2602
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:05,960
cannabis grows and as cannabis gets used

2603
01:52:03,319 --> 01:52:08,039
all over the place you know and the

2604
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:10,439
environment changes and more extreme

2605
01:52:08,039 --> 01:52:13,359
conditions are created pests get created

2606
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:17,279
so you know the use of predator mites in

2607
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:19,960
in nurseries and even kangan water as uh

2608
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:22,279
Eric from uh you know the greenhouse

2609
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:25,198
down in in California talks a lot about

2610
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:28,639
is uh you know this kangan water used in

2611
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:30,719
in clones and nurseries um and even for

2612
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:32,840
folar sprays I mean there are some new

2613
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:37,239
technologies that can be used but you

2614
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:40,880
know having living soils beds uh you

2615
01:52:37,238 --> 01:52:42,919
know um an IPM through Predators I mean

2616
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,800
you find you have to use a lot less

2617
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:47,880
attention and and that's really

2618
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:50,480
beautiful to see and incredible amounts

2619
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:52,599
of people are changing over so really

2620
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:57,198
right now it's how to build a bed and

2621
01:52:52,599 --> 01:53:01,199
how to layer in soil and make it last 20

2622
01:52:57,198 --> 01:53:02,759
cycles and then create the the and then

2623
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:05,598
help one of the things we need to do is

2624
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:07,800
help influence like the recreational

2625
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:10,078
regulations because in some cases the

2626
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:13,000
regulations are so stringent that it's

2627
01:53:10,078 --> 01:53:15,319
hard to produce living soils and a

2628
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,399
recreational thing but we'll always go

2629
01:53:15,319 --> 01:53:22,078
back to green life Productions in Steve

2630
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:24,960
cwell down in Las Vegas area up in PRP

2631
01:53:22,078 --> 01:53:28,039
but uh in in Nevada has very stringent

2632
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:31,800
microbial laws and also they've had to

2633
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:35,399
work together with digilabs Laboratories

2634
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:37,960
in Nevada to to be able to bring um

2635
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:40,238
living soils to a stringent market so

2636
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:41,639
they are real forerunners in an indoor

2637
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:43,279
market that's one of the reasons why

2638
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:44,560
they've been pure certified for a really

2639
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:46,639
long time they're one of the ones that

2640
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:49,560
really made a difference and they've

2641
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:51,400
really brought LEDs to the Forefront you

2642
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:53,440
know and how to use those proper how to

2643
01:53:51,399 --> 01:53:54,960
recycle all your water and everything

2644
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:56,919
from your air conditioners and

2645
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,239
dehumidifiers I mean these are closed

2646
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:00,920
loop how to have wor worm farms and

2647
01:53:59,238 --> 01:54:04,078
everything and continuously build their

2648
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:07,480
soil they're on 24 Cycles right now

2649
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:08,840
indoors in that situation and what one

2650
01:54:07,479 --> 01:54:11,799
thing that's really exciting is they've

2651
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:14,440
been recently able to bring hash to the

2652
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:16,400
market so ganja Gill who's been on here

2653
01:54:14,439 --> 01:54:19,439
a few times you know is is has been

2654
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:21,000
helping them get their Tech dialed in um

2655
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:23,399
and green life Productions is now

2656
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,319
bringing beautiful to the market in

2657
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:29,078
Nevada and Las Vegas so you know um

2658
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:33,439
beautiful Works being done even in

2659
01:54:29,078 --> 01:54:36,519
stringent High microbial uh uh

2660
01:54:33,439 --> 01:54:39,638
jurisdictions or States I just wanted to

2661
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:44,599
mention I've been using bio controls

2662
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:44,599
good bugs to kill the bad bugs for 45

2663
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:51,319
years I recently like that I like copert

2664
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:53,118
over there in N and in the Netherlands

2665
01:54:51,319 --> 01:54:55,679
sorry to interrupt you please come on in

2666
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:58,519
a sec but uh you know place people like

2667
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:02,639
s companies like

2668
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:05,040
senta support GMO and really harmful

2669
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:07,159
practices on Earth and and one thing

2670
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:09,599
about copert and and correct me if I'm

2671
01:55:07,158 --> 01:55:14,039
wrong but they they you know produce

2672
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:16,520
bugs with in non- GMOs um and they don't

2673
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:18,439
uh involve themselves in a larger

2674
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:20,199
companies that do harmful practices on

2675
01:55:18,439 --> 01:55:22,559
Earth so cprit's been a good one there

2676
01:55:20,198 --> 01:55:25,519
are other ones plenty of other ones but

2677
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,520
that they sell all

2678
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:33,599
over I was going to say I've recently

2679
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:35,679
added these to my uh bug line so

2680
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:38,440
actually and since I've done this a

2681
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:40,960
couple months ago my plants have never I

2682
01:55:38,439 --> 01:55:44,078
don't have spidermites or nothing so um

2683
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:46,639
it's been living bug living bugs for me

2684
01:55:44,078 --> 01:55:49,799
is actually changed so I'm using uh

2685
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:53,118
perus Hotpot I'm using spidermite

2686
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:55,639
Destroyer I'm using Predator m I'm using

2687
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:57,639
M preventor so these are little things I

2688
01:55:55,639 --> 01:55:59,800
actually added to my garden for the

2689
01:55:57,639 --> 01:56:02,319
first time of growing after like 30

2690
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:05,560
years and guess

2691
01:56:02,319 --> 01:56:05,559
what I'm

2692
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,560
happy a

2693
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,399
long yeah when I added everything in

2694
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,440
Combined I used to try ladybugs I used

2695
01:56:12,399 --> 01:56:16,638
to try these little fix but I've never

2696
01:56:14,439 --> 01:56:17,960
added everything at once and I think

2697
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:19,719
that was the biggest thing is listening

2698
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:21,560
to all you guys and really just taking

2699
01:56:19,719 --> 01:56:23,359
that next step just being an old SCH

2700
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:25,199
grower not want to go to that next

2701
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:26,719
little you know that next little okay

2702
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:29,319
I'll jump over the fence so I finally

2703
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:30,960
did that and um it's been quite a great

2704
01:56:29,319 --> 01:56:33,439
thing of looking at how this whole thing

2705
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,198
works because I mean we got to consider

2706
01:56:33,439 --> 01:56:38,279
we got to look at right now we're

2707
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:40,719
looking at Spectrum coverage yields the

2708
01:56:38,279 --> 01:56:43,359
grower and what's coming from that right

2709
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:46,078
so lots of good stuff hey Johnny also uh

2710
01:56:43,359 --> 01:56:48,158
check out some nemoes definitely uh I

2711
01:56:46,078 --> 01:56:50,238
have those too sorry and I have Nemo

2712
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:52,799
toads in my soil

2713
01:56:50,238 --> 01:56:55,000
awesome and then inject in those

2714
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:57,079
nematodes into your soil in a way that

2715
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,599
they don't die off right away you know

2716
01:56:57,078 --> 01:57:01,920
and you can do that in in different ways

2717
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:05,800
the way that you apply the nematodes to

2718
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:08,639
your soil you know um to slowly disperse

2719
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:11,239
them evenly throughout your soil will

2720
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:13,960
help them live longer and and and in the

2721
01:57:11,238 --> 01:57:15,238
bed you know so I've done them when they

2722
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:16,679
come on on a form where you just

2723
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:17,919
sprinkle them over or then you can

2724
01:57:16,679 --> 01:57:19,520
actually get them in a little thing we

2725
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:21,520
throw them in our reses and then they

2726
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:22,960
just apply by water so I've had two

2727
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:25,840
different methods

2728
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:28,000
okay that's super good one thing that's

2729
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:30,800
often overlooked with people we still

2730
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,439
see it is the misdiagnosis of broad

2731
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,520
mites and russet mites and it really

2732
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:37,319
really takes having a microscope and

2733
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:40,079
turning the leaf upside down and looking

2734
01:57:37,319 --> 01:57:42,118
at the leaf I mean a trained eye can see

2735
01:57:40,078 --> 01:57:44,439
it right away when they walk into the to

2736
01:57:42,118 --> 01:57:47,559
the um to a garden generally the The

2737
01:57:44,439 --> 01:57:49,519
Leaf tips are bending down with broad

2738
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:52,280
mites and and and russet mites it's

2739
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:53,719
often the the leaves are tacoed and then

2740
01:57:52,279 --> 01:57:57,559
there's also that yellow look to the

2741
01:57:53,719 --> 01:58:00,679
leaves and so um swiki and cucum Maris

2742
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:02,679
together um we have found really works

2743
01:58:00,679 --> 01:58:05,440
really well with with both broad mites

2744
01:58:02,679 --> 01:58:08,158
and ret mites it can also work for thrip

2745
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:09,118
because it's it can be a thrip um thing

2746
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:11,839
too as

2747
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:14,519
well and um using those like we said

2748
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:17,119
before in your uh in your mother room

2749
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:20,239
you know and in your cloning and and in

2750
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:23,679
your vegetative place is essential

2751
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:26,399
because to try and it to try and you

2752
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:28,560
know take care of the Colony after it's

2753
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:30,679
in the flower room is you know say it's

2754
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,760
too late you know you're already your

2755
01:58:30,679 --> 01:58:34,399
but your plants need to build buds

2756
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:37,239
rather than worry about getting sucked

2757
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:42,439
on from underneath the leaves

2758
01:58:37,238 --> 01:58:44,479
so flat leafed very flat Supple leaves

2759
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:46,279
is is what we're looking for and any

2760
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:48,479
compromise to the leaf you know that

2761
01:58:46,279 --> 01:58:50,639
there's some microscopic thing I mean

2762
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:52,319
the spidermites are easy to diagnose

2763
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:55,078
because you walk into a room and you

2764
01:58:52,319 --> 01:58:58,759
white dots and in the worst case you see

2765
01:58:55,078 --> 01:59:00,078
you you see webbing um you know so there

2766
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:02,159
there there's different things for

2767
01:59:00,078 --> 01:59:04,759
spidermites but it's nice to maybe name

2768
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:07,319
your species get uh you know pilus and

2769
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:09,599
Cal fornicus or two that work really

2770
01:59:07,319 --> 01:59:12,359
good with spider might some people use

2771
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:15,840
Anderson um you know but uh talk to your

2772
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:19,319
local bug you know supplier and if it

2773
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:22,480
can be expensive but when you get

2774
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:25,399
into trying to combat a situ ituation

2775
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:28,839
that's going out of hand it's very

2776
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:31,118
difficult to to do that so keeping ahead

2777
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:33,599
of that is always good for anything even

2778
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:36,359
powdery mil you know Milos or dowy Milos

2779
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:38,840
or different things so anyway uh

2780
01:59:36,359 --> 01:59:44,920
prevention is the

2781
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:44,920
key say that again prevention is the

2782
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:52,920
key prevention is the

2783
01:59:49,158 --> 01:59:55,839
key got it

2784
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:57,719

2822
02:01:36,279 --> 02:01:42,238
cannabis not as a performance-enhancing

2823
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:45,199
drug but as a food as an as an

2824
02:01:42,238 --> 02:01:46,919

2829
02:01:55,039 --> 02:02:01,800
big moment so the First Nation the SES

2830
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:03,880
First Nations is also uh gonna be a part

2831
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:06,719
of the event so we're going to talk

2832
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:09,400
about how you know rightful access to

2833
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:12,319
First Nations communities in Canada can

2834
02:02:09,399 --> 02:02:15,238
be enhanced through regenerative farming

2835
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:17,319
and through uh intentional medicine and

2836
02:02:15,238 --> 02:02:20,439
and and good products like we talk about

2837
02:02:17,319 --> 02:02:22,158
here and intentional products and maybe

2838
02:02:20,439 --> 02:02:25,799
you know I don't know how First Nation

2839
02:02:22,158 --> 02:02:27,799
could maybe interact with American um

2840
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:29,679
you know native groups and Nations but I

2841
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:33,119
think there's good communication you

2842
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:35,158
know potential there so we are very

2843
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:37,198
excited about what can happen um the

2844
02:02:35,158 --> 02:02:40,399
First Nations uh different First Nations

2845
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:43,238
groups in Canada are able to create

2846
02:02:40,399 --> 02:02:45,920
their own Realms still in a lot of ways

2847
02:02:43,238 --> 02:02:48,638
so it's really important for them to be

2848
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:50,440
able to get education in the way that we

2849
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:53,440
give it and other people give it so that

2850
02:02:50,439 --> 02:02:55,399
they can help with their addiction

2851
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:57,519
problems and different ailments that

2852
02:02:55,399 --> 02:03:00,039
they have within their communities and

2853
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:01,440
maybe diff this CBD medicine Mark like

2854
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:04,000
you're talking about today and some of

2855
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:06,638
this intentional ways that we are able

2856
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,479
to analyze cannaboids could be very

2857
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:10,078
beneficial to these First Nations

2858
02:03:08,479 --> 02:03:12,118
communities which do have a lot of

2859
02:03:10,078 --> 02:03:13,880
issues with health and well-being and

2860
02:03:12,118 --> 02:03:17,598
and there's a lot of reasons why that is

2861
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:20,800
so we're really excited to support them

2862
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:22,560
and everyone else because they have the

2863
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,679
ability to influence

2864
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:27,840
other Federal jurisdiction laws if

2865
02:03:24,679 --> 02:03:30,599
there's success there so big love to
