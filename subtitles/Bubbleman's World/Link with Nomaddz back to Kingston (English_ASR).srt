66
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,159
or the other side of the island but uh

67
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,199

we're really here for tourist trip so

73
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,400

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,799
it's exciting times here in Jamaica

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
telling you it was amazing at the

76
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,280

83
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Protege CD release party today that's

84
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:54,839
Ancient Future it's a dichotomous name

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,759
how Protege makes the future ancient

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,920
while we're going to learn tonight and

87
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,560
uh we're just actually going on a detour

88
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,598
to the highway you can see a part of it

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,039
up there uh we're driving through a

90
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,959
small little town very tight Road got

91
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,199
some big trucks in the way and we have

92
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,360
not lost the nomads Evie and birdy are

93
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,478
still in front of us doing their thing

94
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,919
we got dabbed up in the grill before we

95
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,918
left but we haven't dabbed since so uh

96
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,159
it'll be good to get back to back to

97
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,079
Kingston and get the uh denail going

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,479
we're low on dabs but what we suspect

99
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,000
we're going to do for the next couple of

100
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:32,719
days rather than uh not have dabs is is

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
uh get a nice steam chalice and uh

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,759
probably we should have two or three of

103
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,919
those over at our buddy's house anyway

104
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:45,400
and uh have a nice chalice session I got

105
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:48,359
to admit I got a really nice um head

106
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:50,359
Buzz head rocker bell ringer if you will

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,319
from hitting those Vapor chalises last

108
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,720
night obviously you're not getting the

109
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,839
concentrated hit it's a much lighter

110
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,320
tasty sort of fluid hit but what you got

111
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,319
to do is you got

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,080
to right so you're getting it going

113
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,439
you're getting it going you're getting

114
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,680
it going and uh eventually once it

115
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,639
finally gets going you get these hits

116
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,000
but you get this Li headed almost like

117
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,400
you're going to fall down like you've

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,639
been hyperventilating so that's part of

119
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,638
the The Vapor chalice

120
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
experience and this is the country right

121
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,758
here

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,000
this is just some beautiful [ __ ] right

123
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:41,520

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,519
the tree

125
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,360
monster yeah I got

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,080

127
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,600
wide angle lens

128
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,120
man gives you that little extra bit that

129
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,290
you don't have to really pan over to

130
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,319
get much wider frame

131
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,439
[Laughter]

132
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,479

00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,038
Spanish town but this will whip Us in

138
