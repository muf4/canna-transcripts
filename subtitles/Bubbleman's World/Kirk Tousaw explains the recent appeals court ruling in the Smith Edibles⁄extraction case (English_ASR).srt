00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,198
Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World.

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,320
I have a special guest here today with

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,800
us. I have a local Vancouver activist,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,960
lawyer, Kirk Tousaw. Where are you from

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,558
originally? Uh I'm from uh just outside

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
of Detroit, Michigan. Detroit, Michigan.

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,199
I remember when you showed up. It has to

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,159
be like 10 years now. Yeah. 2002 we came

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840
to to Vancouver. 12 years ago. So Kirk's

11
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,878
been around a long time in the scene. Uh

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,280
you worked with uh Mr. Conroy for I did

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,920
for a while there. Mr. Conroy QC. Mr.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
Conroy QC. There it is. Great mentor,

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
great lawyer. And today, one of the

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,000
reasons uh I invited Kirk over to talk

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,120
was um the Owen Smith um extract edibles

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
case that was recently um I don't know

19
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,280
if you'd call it convened or uh judgment

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,478
rendered by the court of appeal.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,719
Judgment rendered by the court of

22
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,879
appeal. So, a lot is people are talking

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,359
about what it means and what it is and

24
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,079
how it affects Canadians uh patients,

25
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,239
designated growers, non-patients.

26
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,079
Uh, so I thought I'd invite Kirk over to

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,798
go over a little bit of a how the case

28
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:27,359
started. Um, the first decision in 2012

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,200
and then where we're at just recently.

30
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,319
Yeah. And thanks uh very much to you

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,118
Bowman for having me here. And um before

32
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,559
I give you that kind of recap, uh your

33
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,959
viewers may be interested to know that

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,759
you actually uh were the focal point of

35
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,599
two moments in uh in both the trial and

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
the court of appeal decision. And I'll

37
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,438
uh I'll tell those stories a little bit

38
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,679
later. Excellent. But I had Yeah. I had

39
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:53,519
the great privilege and uh really good

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,159
fortune uh to be retained by Owen Smith

41
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,798
uh who was at the time of his arrest a a

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,719
baker uh of edible products and a maker

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
of other cannabis based medicines for

44
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,679
the Vancouver Victoria can cannabis

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,920
buyers club of Canada. Victoria based

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,879
operated by Ted Smith, no relation to

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,598
Owen Smith. Uh and Owen was making

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,840
cookies in his apartment. Uh the smell

49
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,079
uh leaked into the hallway. Uh police

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,080
showed up uh and he was arrested

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,040
ultimately and charged with possession

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,800
of THC for the purpose of trafficking.

53
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,359
uh and uh we immediately decided that

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
since he was making these medicines uh

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,760
for sick people uh for people who use

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,560
them for medicinal purposes uh to better

57
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,280
their quality of life and because the

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,719
existing scheme in Canada at that time

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,759
did not allow for patients to use

60
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,759
anything other than dried marijuana um

61
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,359
in the MMA. We thought, well, we've got

62
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,120
to challenge the law uh because people

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
are being helped by this. This is uh

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,719
literally saving some people's lives,

65
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,878
improving the quality of life of other

66
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,598
people, and there's no reason that uh

67
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,479
Owen Smith should face 5 10 years in

68
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,158
prison maximum uh for engaging in this

69
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,679
behavior. So, we launched constitutional

70
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:10,399
challenge. Uh in 2012, uh we went and

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,200
did about a 20-day trial. a bunch of

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,680
members of the club, very very brave uh

73
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,238
people that I was really honored to

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,319
meet, uh came and testified about the

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,878
impact that medical cannabis and medical

76
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:26,079
cannabis derivative products uh either

77
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:29,598
topical products or edible products or

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,000
tinctures or concentrated uh forms of uh

79
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,119
cannabonoids like bubble hash for

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,680
example. uh how these products assisted

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,039
them in regaining quality of life or

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
treating their serious symptoms and

83
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,439
conditions. So, they told their stories

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
to the judge and I I had the privilege

85
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,959
of helping tell those stories. Uh and it

86
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,959
is a privilege. Uh Ted Smith testified

87
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,239
about the club and the history and the

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,640
background of the club which has been

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,560
serving and helping people in Victoria

90
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,559
and elsewhere for a very very long time.

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
It's got to be 15 plus years. Yeah. I

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,719
mean, right there from the beginning.

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,360
Absolutely. uh of really a medical

94
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,560
cannabis now revolution in Canada. Uh

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,120
and so we were successful. Uh the judge

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,878
uh understood that uh restricting

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,159
patients to dried marijuana only

98
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,680
violated their dignity, violated their

99
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,680
autonomy. Uh it infringed on their

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
section 7 charter rights, the liberty

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
and to security of the person in a

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
manner that wasn't consistent with the

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,800
principles of fundamental justice

104
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,439
because the rules and restrictions were

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,840
arbitrary. It made no sense to him and I

106
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,879
think to any thinking person why you can

107
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,599
grow and possess the dried product or as

108
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,279
a designated producer you could grow uh

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
the dried product and provide it to your

110
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,679
patient. But then the minute you put it

111
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,359
into a tea or made it into an oil or

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,879
turned it into a cookie and and wanted

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,040
to administer it in a different form

114
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,719
than either smoking or vaporizing it or

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,520
a or a hash or concentrate. Um you

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,639
became a criminal. And I think that you

117
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,240
could I arbitrary, isn't it? The analogy

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,680
of the tea, you know, like explaining to

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,000
the judge that look, you know, she's

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,160
using it legally as a dried herb. The

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,319
minute she puts it in her hot water,

122
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,320
steeps it and pulls it out. I mean, cuz

123
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,038
that sounds less like you're making an

124
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,918
extract, but the reality is you are

125
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,240
that's what you're doing. You're

126
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,918
extracting the cannabonoids into a a

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,079
weak oral solution and then you're

128
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,918
ingesting it orally. Uh, and of course

129
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,279
the medical cannabis forms you filled in

130
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,519
for the government had the option of

131
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,839
checking oral uh, which the judge found

132
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,439
to be puzzling and and their Health

133
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,959
Canada's document information for

134
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,879
healthcare practitioners document is

135
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,680
chalk full of information about how to

136
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,399
ingest it. uh bunch of studies

137
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
referenced in the footnotes about

138
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,399
edibles, topicals, all sorts of science

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
and and and it was sort of like, well,

140
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,839
you're telling doctors about all this

141
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,160
stuff and you can check off oral, but if

142
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,319
the patient actually does that, they're

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
committing a crime for doing that. And

144
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,079
so, we educated the judge about about

145
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,319
cannabis and cannabonoids. And here's

146
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:01,038
where Mark actually comes in uh because

147
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:03,759
he provided me with some very very good

148
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,159
macro photos of tricoms. uh and

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,639
close-ups of tricoms living from the

150
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,520
plant and from uh dried cannabis. And it

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,319
was instrumental really uh in educating

152
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,198
the judge about what the medicine is uh

153
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,120
and how it's not really in the plant uh

154
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,360
that is contained in these in these

155
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
things called tricoms. Uh and I really

156
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
when you when you get a visual like

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
that, right, it sinks it in. It's

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,478
educational for certain. That's exactly

159
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,079
it. And and part of what I do in the

160
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,758
courtroom is educate because most people

161
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,839
don't have any idea about this stuff. I

162
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,639
mean, certainly if they're uh if they're

163
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,679
not either consuming medical cannabis or

164
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,519
even if they are, but don't understand

165
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,000
really how it's all working other than

166
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,079
it works, you got to educate them. So,

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,319
so we were great. That was great. The uh

168
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,639
the the decision came down. We were very

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,960
pleased to win that. The judge struck uh

170
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,038
dried marijuana from the MMA. The judge

171
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,439
modified the definition of marijuana in

172
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,839
the MMA to include all schedule 2

173
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,240
substances. So, uh, that actually

174
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,239
included synthetic THC, for example, but

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
basically cannabis resin, anything you

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,639
can make with cannabis. Did he strike

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,240
the word dried and then he struck it up

178
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,598
and then just used the word marijuana?

179
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Just use the word marijuana. That's

180
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,399
right. He also helped define as all of

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,240
these as all of these schedule two

182
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,079
substances. All right. Um, and

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,519
ultimately that that remedy gets

184
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,879
disagreed with in the court of appeal

185
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,279
when we get to that point. So the the

186
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,439
other side appeals of course uh and we

187
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:32,239
go and argue the appeal uh

188
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,160
and we we spent about half of the oral

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,560
argument time discussing a legal concept

190
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,080
called standing. And this this becomes

191
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,918
relevant because there was a dissenting

192
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,120
opinion in the court of appeal that that

193
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,598
dealt with the standing issue. And

194
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,879
standing is basically your right to make

195
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,439
certain arguments to the court. Um, you

196
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,959
have to have, for instance, in a search

197
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,560
warrant situation, you're supposed, you

198
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,560
have a reasonable expectation of privacy

199
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,519
in your home, for example, but your

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,360
buddy sitting on the porch in your home

201
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,839
does not have the same reasonable

202
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,720
expectation of privacy in your home that

203
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:07,679
you have. And so your your buddy doesn't

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,319
have standing to raise, for example, a

205
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
challenge that search warrant uh in your

206
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,120
home. So, if they get caught up in a

207
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,959
bust and they happen to have some drugs

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,918
on them or something like that and they

209
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,279
were otherwise arrested and validly

210
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,639
searched, if even if the search warrant

211
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,119
that got the cops in the front of your

212
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,639
house was completely invalid, that

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
person has no standing to raise that

214
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
because the charter doesn't confer to

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,360
them a right of privacy in your home

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,879
because it wasn't their home. So, so the

217
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,038
argument on standing that the court

218
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,200
grappled with was, well, Owen Smith is

219
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,080
not a medical patient. He was not a

220
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,839
participant in the MMA scheme. In other

221
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,839
words, he wasn't a designated producer

222
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,839
producing for a medical patient. He had

223
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:51,360
no license. So, how is he in a position

224
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,760
to challenge whether or not the MMA are

225
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,039
arbitrary and unconstitutional? And the

226
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,879
answer is given by the Supreme Court of

227
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,958
Canada quite a while ago. The the answer

228
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,639
is he's being charged under a criminal

229
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,159
statute. His liberty is at risk. and the

230
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,679
criminal statute, the control drugs and

231
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,240
substances act under which he will be

232
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,919
con convicted you're arguing is

233
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
unconstitutional because the medical

234
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,079
exemption is unconstitutional and I

235
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
didn't think and in fact the crown

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,320
agreed this is well settled case law but

237
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,560
we spent a bunch of time in the court of

238
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,839
appeal on that issue now ultimately we

239
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,679
won in the court of appeal that's what

240
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,720
happened in 2014 just a couple of weeks

241
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,359
ago right uh incredibly uh pleased to

242
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,680
get a great result we uh two of the

243
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
judges of the three agreed that the

244
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,439
charter order is breached, that your

245
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,599
right to life uh liberty and security of

246
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,320
the person is breached by the

247
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,639
restriction uh to dried marijuana only.

248
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,760
And they use some very good language uh

249
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,120
in the decision about what section 7

250
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,600
actually protects, you know, because

251
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,278
it's not just about medical cannabis.

252
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,759
What are these rights that we have under

253
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,200
the charter? And the the right that was

254
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,799
interpreted in the visa court of appeal

255
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,640
was they said look this choice of

256
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,079
medicine the choice of the mode of

257
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,120
ingestion of a physician approved

258
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,080
medicine like this is goes fundamentally

259
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,879
to what it means to have dignity uh and

260
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,278
independence and autonomy in our society

261
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,159
and I thought that was absolutely spoton

262
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,720
and and great language isn't it super

263
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,480
compelling puts a smile on my face

264
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,759
doesn't it and and you read that and

265
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
you're like you know what that's right

266
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,759
that's what that is what it means in a

267
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,159
free and democra ocratic society to have

268
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,759
liberty and security of your person. If

269
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,278
you can't make medical choices for

270
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,200
yourself, what do you have? And it's

271
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,360
almost not even a medical choice as much

272
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,600
as it's like, okay, you're legally

273
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,159
allowed to order pizza, but if you take

274
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,240
it out of the box, you have breached a

275
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,319
serious law and could potentially serve

276
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,000
time in prison. That's right. It's like,

277
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
no, wait a minute. Why would you even do

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
that to your people? That's like an

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
entrapment of sorts. No, it's it's it's

280
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
a tragedy and it's an ongoing tragedy

281
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,839
and it obviously should be fixed the

282
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,159
best way to fix it is obviously the

283
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,160
outright legalization of of marijuana

284
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,919
generally. But the second best way to

285
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,519
fix it is to implement a working medical

286
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,439
marijuana system in this country. And I

287
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,839
think we've got a long way to go before

288
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,240
we have that. So, but this is a step

289
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,720
forward. We win. We get a 2 to1 uh

290
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
decision. The descent uh wrote about

291
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,440
standing. He felt that Mr. Smith

292
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
shouldn't be able to challenge these

293
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,839
laws because he wasn't a participant in

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,800
the scheme in any way. didn't try to be.

295
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,640
Um, and you sort of say, well, he

296
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,679
couldn't have like I mean, he could not

297
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,480
have applied under the MMA to bake

298
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,799
cookies for the members of the Cannabis

299
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
Fires Club of Canada in Victoria, right?

300
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,559
He couldn't do that. So, what's the

301
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
point? What's the point of doing that is

302
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,518
sort of what I said in the court of

303
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,120
appeal, actually. uh and uh luckily two

304
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,399
of the judges agreed with us and also

305
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,720
luckily Supreme Court of Canada the

306
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,480
president was on our side and the crown

307
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
quite honorably and correctly uh

308
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,360
conceded that point at the start of the

309
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,278
oral argument. So really I think a great

310
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,800
decision, a great step forward. I'm very

311
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,919
excited to have been a part of it. We we

312
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,639
may be on the way to the Supreme Court

313
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,199
of Canada. Uh there was a disscent uh if

314
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,720
the crown wants to go up um I believe

315
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
they have an automatic right of appeal.

316
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,440
They don't even have to ask permission.

317
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,278
That's what that's what a descent is.

318
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,240
That's what that's what that means. And

319
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,720
so I got one in my case years ago. Ah,

320
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,879
for for for my side though, two two

321
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,879
judges were against me, but one thought,

322
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,559
you know what, you should there was a

323
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,200
few reasons why. He's got a point,

324
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,199
right? It's a case I actually used from

325
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,560
time to time in uh in various

326
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,278
proceedings. And I'll tell you, here's

327
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,239
the other way Mark uh uh assisted here

328
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,720
with uh the court of appeal decision is

329
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,799
uh you were in the courtroom for uh oral

330
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,959
argument in the court of appeal and I

331
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,958
actually stole one of your lines. Uh and

332
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,638
and I said I was saying to the judges,

333
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,000
it's explaining what a tricom is. Of

334
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,799
course, because you got to educate them,

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,240
too. Uh and and I said, "You got to

336
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,399
think about it this way. Uh the tricoms,

337
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,159
the resin

338
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,000
glands, that's that's the message.

339
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,078
That's the message. The plant, it's just

340
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the messenger." Nice. And anybody that

341
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,159
watches Bubble Man's World Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,919
has heard Bubble Man say those words.

343
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,600
Yeah. Herb is the messenger. That's

344
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,078
right. And bubble is the message. That's

345
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,680
right. So, I can definitely accept that

346
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,359
one. But if it don't bubble, it ain't

347
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,359
worth the trouble. That was the skunk

348
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,200
man. That was the first one I used and

349
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,639
then I then I came up with that one. So,

350
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,720
I come out of a t-shirt or two with that

351
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,240
on there.

352
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,320
Yeah. It was fun to be able to to say

353
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,079
that and it's and it's true, too. So, it

354
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,600
was very very good. Yeah. Well, you

355
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,958
definitely have vast knowledge when it

356
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,240
comes to um you know canabonoids, how

357
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,838
they're produced, where they're

358
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,399
produced, a vast knowledge that a lot of

359
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,880
people don't really have generally even

360
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,240
in our scene in the scene that is the

361
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,320
cannabis community. And uh so it's nice

362
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
to see uh someone in your in your

363
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,680
position who can you know stand up and

364
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,000
get these laws not only you know fight

365
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,399
them but potentially change them. Yeah.

366
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,559
uh to have a good solid foundation. I

367
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,039
mean, I'm constantly disappointed when I

368
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,278
see a media story done on cannabis

369
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,599
because they just they don't seem to be

370
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,360
inspired to do great work. They don't

371
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,278
seem to be inspired to be like, don't

372
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,800
you have one guy who will just be really

373
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,039
good and learn about like it's not that

374
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,679
hard. You can learn about it. It it can

375
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:14,639
be very frustrating to sort of read uh

376
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,638
things that are so uh inaccurate. Yeah,

377
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,079
there's so much of it and that's easy to

378
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,680
do. But I appreciate the compliment.

379
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,879
It's it's nice of you because from

380
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,399
somebody with the knowledge base that

381
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,439
you have, it's it's a great you have the

382
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,839
knowledge. You definitely know what

383
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,720
you're talking about and good I mean God

384
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,639
thank us because uh if someone else was

385
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,639
standing up there trying to defend this

386
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,320
without that knowledge in my opinion

387
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,159
that simple knowledge of explaining

388
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,519
where the canabonoids are manufactured

389
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,198
inside the glandular tricom head and

390
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,759
that it's such a small small percentage

391
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,838
of the actual plant matter. There's a

392
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,679
huge understanding that would literally

393
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,440
change everything that we're even

394
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,759
fighting against right now. No, it's a

395
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,199
that's that's absolutely right. And I

396
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,319
mean, one of the joys of being a

397
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,919
litigator is that uh you get to learn a

398
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
lot about interesting subject matter and

399
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,958
I've been privileged to be able to do a

400
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,278
lot of litigation involving medical

401
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,078
marijuana and marijuana generally. And I

402
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,360
I love the plant and have for my entire

403
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,879
life. So, it's been an absolute

404
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,919
privilege to be able to blend those two

405
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,320
disciplines together. Yeah. And and try

406
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,838
and do good work for people. Very cool.

407
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,160
Yeah.

408
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,040
Well, I guess uh my one last question

409
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,719
would be where where do we sit with this

410
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,919
decision? Where what does this mean?

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,600
Does this mean that patients that have

412
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:32,000
MMA at this point with the injunction

413
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,399
going on are able to possess and make

414
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
their own extracts?

415
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,879
or is that I mean that's the question of

416
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,000
the day, isn't it? Uh it's a very

417
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,480
interesting scenario because uh when the

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,039
trial judge granted us the relief we

419
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,959
were seeking the the crown asked for a

420
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,799
year for the government to fix the

421
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,119
regulatory scheme. They they asked for

422
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,359
his ruling essentially to be suspended

423
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,320
for a year. It's called a suspension of

424
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,159
a declaration of invalidity. Uh and that

425
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,839
gives the government a chance to respond

426
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,679
legislatively. They've done this before.

427
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
They did it after Parker. They did it in

428
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,078
a bit after uh one of the heads

429
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,278
decisions. Uh and so they did after

430
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,120
Baron. Uh and so not uncommon. And so

431
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,278
what the judge did is he said, "Well, as

432
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,720
to patients, no, it's going to go into

433
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,198
effect right away. If you are an

434
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,600
authorized person, you can make your

435
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,799
edibles, you can make your topicals, you

436
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,920
can make your uh concentrates and other

437
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,439
derivative products. If if you're not a

438
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,319
patient, if you're designated producer,

439
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
then we're going to give the government

440
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
a year uh to to legislate." Well, at the

441
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,838
end of that year, government hadn't done

442
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,439
anything. They came back asking for more

443
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,519
time and and the judge, I think, quite

444
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,040
rightly said, "Well, I'm not just going

445
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
to give you more time to give you more

446
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,599
time. I gave you a year to do something,

447
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,720
not to do nothing." And he denied that

448
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
relief. And so, at that point,

449
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,800
designated producers in BC became able

450
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,839
to produce all schedule 2 substances for

451
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,000
their patient, uh, including, uh, bubble

452
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,519
hash, including dry sift, including

453
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
edibles, topicals, you name it,

454
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,759
anything. uh theoretically even pure

455
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,240
synthetic THC could have been produced

456
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,078
uh by designated producers. Now this

457
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,838
this court of appeal modified the remedy

458
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,000
said the judge sort of went a little bit

459
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,159
too far in granting the relief. Yes, it

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,078
was unconstitutional to limit patients

461
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
that dried marijuana only. Yes, it

462
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:22,000
violates their section 7 rights. But

463
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,120
when the judge actually rewrote the MMA

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,919
to redefine marijuana as all schedule

465
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,439
two substances, rather than just sort of

466
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,480
throwing the ball back into the

467
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,558
government's court and saying, "Here's

468
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,038
the problem. Fix it." Right? He went too

469
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,759
far. So, they modified that remedy. They

470
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,119
said, "To the extent of of changing the

471
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,240
remedy, we're actually going to grant

472
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,519
the crown uh relief on this appeal.

473
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
We're going to declare that those

474
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,960
provisions limiting to patients that

475
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,279
drive marijuana only are arbitrary,

476
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,679
violate section seven, and we're going

477
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,440
to suspend that declaration for a year

478
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,080
to give the government a chance to

479
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,440
respond legislatively. And so, what does

480
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,918
that mean for patients? I mean, the

481
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,960
government's really been given a year to

482
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,400
amend a regulatory scheme that no longer

483
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,720
exists in order to allow patients to

484
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,880
have access to these products. But what

485
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,798
happens in the meantime? uh our

486
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,559
designated producers now unable to

487
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,038
produce for their patients when they

488
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:20,160
were a week and a half ago even though

489
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:22,000
we won uh the section 7 issue. Are

490
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,200
patients no longer able to make their

491
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,798
own medicines uh in British Columbia or

492
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,720
anywhere in the country? I mean, I think

493
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,679
these are some unanswered questions by

494
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,919
the way uh the remedy section of the

495
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,200
decision was crafted. And I I got to be

496
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,120
honest with you, I got to think about it

497
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,558
myself before I sort of leap to

498
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,599
judgment. And I like to talk to some

499
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,759
smart people about that like Mr. Conroy

500
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,678
uh and and take some guidance on what it

501
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,839
really means. And there's no is there is

502
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,519
it not set up in a way that you can be

503
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,038
like okay we need to understand we have

504
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,119
a few questions in regards to your

505
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,160
ruling. There's no way to get more any

506
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,879
back and forth with them. No, there it's

507
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,880
I'm unaware of any it's a very it's

508
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,039
there's not it's not really a dialogue,

509
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,880
right? It's a presentation followed by a

510
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,640
decision. Are there firms that you can

511
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,640
hire that have brilliant people that

512
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,240
just specialize in looking at cases and

513
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
then telling you what they believe that

514
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,919
case? Well, you you could yeah, you

515
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,720
could go to a constitutional lawyer. You

516
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,120
could get a legal opinion uh on what the

517
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,880
impact is and you could have some you

518
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,879
could place some value and some stock in

519
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,120
that and let that guide your actions,

520
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
right?

521
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,558
Um and we of course can go to the

522
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,798
Supreme Court of Canada. My client Owen

523
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,639
has not made any decisions about we

524
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,279
whether we want to go uh to the Supreme

525
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,400
Court of Canada because perhaps we don't

526
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,119
agree with that remedy. Um myself as

527
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,919
somebody that's been an observer of how

528
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,399
the government's responded in the past

529
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,320
to declarations of constitutional

530
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,640
invalidity. I I don't have a tremendous

531
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,519
amount of confidence that this time

532
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,120
they're going to do it the right way. Uh

533
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,720
because that's not unfortunately the

534
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,479
track record. And of course, all of

535
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,480
this, you know, there's two other issues

536
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,960
that sort of arise. How how valid is

537
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,519
this decision out of British Columbia

538
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,759
that it's much more impactful than the

539
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,879
trial court decision. Uh whether or not

540
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,960
it's completely persu uh binding across

541
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,640
the country, I think is a legal question

542
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,240
that would have to be settled maybe even

543
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,919
on a province by province basis. Um and

544
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,880
then the other uh the other issue is

545
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,200
does it affect the MMPR? you know, uh,

546
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,960
are producers under the MMPR going to be

547
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,319
allowed to now provide these products to

548
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,480
their patients? So far, the answer is

549
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,240
no, but perhaps that's part of the

550
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,919
government's regulatory response. I

551
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,919
don't know the answer to that. I have a

552
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,159
strong feeling that part of their reason

553
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,120
to allow it is that they'll want to

554
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,440
allow it for LPS.

555
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,359
Could be. I'm not sure why they didn't

556
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,640
do that in the first place then. Yeah.

557
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,158
You know, I mean, that's difficult to

558
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
sort of understand the government's

559
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,720
thinking behind a lot of this stuff. I

560
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,359
mean, I just can't I I I don't really

561
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,079
see like small amounts of dried flour as

562
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,839
really as medicine. Well, for some for

563
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,839
some it is. I mean, to be fair, for some

564
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,519
people that is their preferred mode of

565
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,199
ingestion and absolutely their right to

566
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,759
choose it is part of their individual

567
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,279
dignity, autonomy, and independence. For

568
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,158
them, of course you would. And I know

569
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,678
you would. Absolutely. You just happen

570
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,520
to have a different mode of ingestion.

571
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,600
Well, you know what? And not even that,

572
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,119
but lately I get a lot of people since I

573
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,158
started this group on Facebook called

574
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,719
the endockinabonoid system. Um, I've had

575
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,720
almost daily a person who has been

576
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,400
diagnosed with a terminal illness

577
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,159
contact me and ask me how they can get

578
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,919
what they need and what is it that they

579
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,799
need. And I'm, you know, I'm like, well,

580
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
you need to saturate your

581
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,119
endockinabonoid system. You need to take

582
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,440
like a gram of like concentrated resin

583
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,599
gland heads. And there's different ways

584
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,519
of like it's even when I pull out my

585
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,839
creams that are, you know, the CBC cream

586
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,200
that's good for uh muscle pain and

587
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,158
stuff. Everyone sees it and they're

588
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
like, "Oh, I need to get some of that.

589
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
Where can I get some of that?" Yeah.

590
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,199
It's like, "Well, you know, it would be

591
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,038
nice if you could just get it at the

592
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,038
pharmacy or any of these other, you

593
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,119
know, I I at the supermarket. At the

594
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,279
supermarket, at the dispensary, at the,

595
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,359
you know, they're just not available

596
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,678
enough in the model that we're currently

597
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,558
in." Yeah, that's right. And truth be

598
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,400
told, I mean the the medicine is in the

599
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:15,119
cannonoids in the resin glands and that

600
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,600
is where it is. The rest of the stuff is

601
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,798
extraneous. Yeah, absolutely. Um it may

602
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,319
have other impact, flavor, taste. People

603
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,480
prefer to ingest it in a certain way,

604
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,480
but at the end of the day, we we know

605
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,200
where the medicine resides, right? Even

606
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,960
in one of Owen Smith's uh most recent

607
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,120
blogs there on Cannabis Digest, I

608
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,480
believe. Yes. Uh he wrote quite a bit

609
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,639
about Dave Pate who uh was the uh work

610
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,679
did work for Horafarm and one of our

611
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,840
experts in sport and he is an expert. Oh

612
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,320
yes really. And if you read Dave Pate's

613
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,558
words it's like all the medicinal value

614
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,480
is in the glandular head of the trial.

615
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,359
That's right. And and actually all of

616
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,240
the transcripts from the trial including

617
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,439
uh Dr. P's testimony are available uh

618
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,079
online. I think it's at

619
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,240
cannabisdigest.ca CA or if not you can

620
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,558
certainly find a link to it. Uh it's a

621
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,120
great site orology. Yeah, it's a good

622
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,960
good site. Absolutely. Well, I really

623
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,558
appreciate your time, Kirk. It's been an

624
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,720
absolute pleasure. It's uh been great to

625
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,158
come up here uh to your place and enjoy

626
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,558
your hospitality and have the

627
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,640
opportunity to talk to uh uh the people

628
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,158
that love Bubble Man as well. Excellent.

629
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,919
Great program. Thanks a lot, man. Thank

630
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,060
you. Awesome. We'll talk to you guys

631
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:31,670
soon.
