00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,159
to Whistler and we made some uh bubble

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,799
hash next to chimus Creek with Phil you

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,279
might remember it while the bubble has

12
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,238
been sitting out on cardboard and drying

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,239
in my Gorilla Grow Tent completely

14
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,000
sealed from the environment in a nice

15
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:56,759
low 30% humidity 60%

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,079
temperature and we're now kind of ready

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,558
to get it off the cardboard and get it

18
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,679
into the little

19
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,399
containers and 90 this is yeah this is

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,118
the 90 this is the My Little Pony so

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,080
while I'm scraping and collecting John's

22
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,599
going to tell you a little bit about My

23
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,920
Little Pony we've told you about it

24
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,319
before but he's going to tell you again

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,960
and then all sitting here exactly so if

26
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,599
you want to talk I'll be the guy

27
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,679
scraping resin in the background

28
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,879
scraping resin My Little Pony as you can

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,200
see this is what we have R so this is

30
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,519
actually the tops was all the bottom so

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,118
this about half of what you

32
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,319
see and fresh frozen there about half of

33
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:37,478
was sitting out there so you roughly

34
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:39,438
about 24 that's about 10 oz there so um

35
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,478
roughly what SE here in the bubble hat

36
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,679
and the the Mind Little Pony nice strain

37
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:48,118
bubble

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,560
Kem cross with a stunk Haze

39
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,959
NL and and we talk a lot about this

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,039
right now because um it was from 1992 is

41
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,359
written on my bag it was just a

42
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,680
handwritten had skml something it was a

43
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,239
northern skunkies or you know there's a

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,520
lot of we're talking about it cuz I

45
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,079
called it medy My Little Pony and uh it

46
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,840
was also cross with another strange that

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,680
I've worked with so yeah that's kind of

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,719
the story behind it and it's just so

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,800
tasty it is I call it dessert it is it

50
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,759
really is dessert I had another buddy

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,640
over today and the first thing he said

52
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,598
is oh I remember that smell it was that

53
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,359
Northern L it's definitely got an old

54
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,199
school smell to it it's got a definitely

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,680
old school smell to it and they old

56
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:35,000
school beans and it's something I've

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,360
collected over the years and um I I

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,719
can't even really recall where they

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,800
actually came from but um that's the

60
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,680
story and I got a little video that I

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,680
said in the past that I actually have a

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,840
twee on there and I was running the

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,080
other strings you had some use that my

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,759
someone had we got it I was just

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
actually going to give a quick tip here

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,719
while doing this which is quite helpful

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,318
to know uh when you're getting nice

68
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,639
sticky bubble off like this it's you

69
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,000
know you've gotten it down to a nice

70
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,958
powder form but it's still bit sticky

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
rather than just go straight what I do

72
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:11,799
is I go at an angle and I kind of go

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,598
real slow to avoid um the shooting

74
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,360
bubble you know the flicking shooting

75
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:20,238
bubble that just releases and and shoots

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,480
off off the cardboard and into the great

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,239
unknown so just a quick little tip not

78
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,119
to cut John off on his My Little Pony

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,039
story

80
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,000
cuz me I uh use when I'm cleaning used

81
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,280
to be Glazer by trade that was after my

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,680
accident that's what I used to do and we

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,680
used to clean the glass with a razor

84
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,519
Blaze and you clean it on an angle so it

85
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,719
doesn't shatter same thing excellent

86
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,719
yeah it's something that I do exactly

87
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,438
the same thing and it's uh it's it's a

88
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,120
great thing to actually uh just point

89
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:48,000
out the color on this is absolutely

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,599
spectacular we should hit that it's

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,680
completely

92
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,598
white yeah and definitely we will be

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,719
just get it into its container so we can

94
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:00,959
get this cardboard off

95
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,519
here and get the next one up there we

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,640
go that's

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,000
45 why you written all these containers

98
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,639
you know dollar stores they work for now

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,479
soon to come yeah that'll get us to the

100
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,478
next maybe these little slick pads yeah

101
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,918
once we get them into the oil

102
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,120
slick let's see what we got here well

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,359

just really good dudes I have to

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
say so one thing about My Little Pony

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,240
when I always run and I think we

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,800
discussed this before I was on the for

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,800
is really everybody always wants to get

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,079
this gr hash but it really comes down to

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,478
the growing and growing in your

124
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,279
environment of course and and for me

125
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:15,038
organic growing is what I've always when

126
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,799
I changed over Mark made some suggest he

127
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,719
goes you know you did stuff in the past

128
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
he says it wasn't really melting well

129
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,440
back in the days I wasn't always using

130
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,280
well Nutri I use Med one right now um I

131
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,879
I wasn't using an all organic base and I

132
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:32,359
don't know what it is but um for me it's

133
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,759
uh it's what's working for me and uh

134
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,680
yeah it's definitely working for you man

135
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,879
the resin is beautiful long flush I

136
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,519
always flush for at least 35 days so

137
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,680
this key just lost water um letting the

138
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,079
plant go to turn letting it finish off

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,759
so not cutting it to a day actually the

140
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,439
plant go all the way until it stops

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,800
actually drinking so there's little

142
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,439
things that I do that actually help me

143
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,439
achieve this actually beautiful bubble

144
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,519
hush that I get mhm well well as you've

145

and and and I I'm also getting very good

147
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,440
quality and that I can down I'm a bit of

148
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,800
a snob really comes down to what you're

149
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,038
doing in that room and uh for me it's uh

150
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,400
controlling my temperatures um and U

151

153
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,000
sitting on the 4x2 screens and they've

154
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:26,560
been completely protected for the last

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,199
12 days that one's clean so you can turn

156
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
it sideways if you need be you can get

157
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,720

00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,240
yeah nice sound

166
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,598
anyway wow well this 120 is um what I've

167
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,800
seen actually and I've ran the same kind

168
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:01,399
of batch now three times same amount you

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,038
res and I'm seeing this definitely a

170
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,318
bigger yield and I

171
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,318
really what we may mention it come down

172
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,720
to the temperatures it was actually 0

173
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,680
deges God did we use cold water the

174
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,520
water was ice cold the ice wasn't

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,120
melting nothing I think the temperatures

176
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,918
with everything everything just being so

177
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,680
cold actually you discussed about being

178
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:22,399
in a freezer in the past and stuff like

179
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,560
that it was a nice cold environment when

180
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,478
we made this house you know it didn't

181
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,038
stick it came off the screens perfectly

182
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,639
water was just glacial

183
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,360
cold you know what didn't need to rinse

184
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,240
it out like rinsing the top of the resin

185
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,240
or nothing because the water was just so

186
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,478
cold it was so so cold we still used a

187
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,160
ton of ice which was you know great oh

188
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:45,719
no we did

189
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,080
yeah all right so 120 wow this is a nice

190
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,759
here let me just make sure we got the

191
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,279
cleanest possible screen even though

192
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:56,000
your 160 was beautiful why bother

193
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,598
contaminating any of the 120 if one

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,680
doesn't have look at the color look at

195

all the time great um for what I've seen

228
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,000
from what I've been cutting roughly into

229
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,000
that rubber made bin which you've seen

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,919
in some of the other videos it's roughly

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,519
about 400 to 430 G of of fresh and this

232
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,958
is what I'm getting consistently about

233
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,039
90 maybe just under 100 G of dry of dry

234
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,958
and and and by that's a nice little pile

235
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,958
man that's a beautiful pile that that

236
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:55,439
that you want to spin it around a little

237
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,439
excited spin her around like you said

238
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,959
even that 160 looks marvelous what do we

239
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,720
got here 73 73

240
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,439
my one of my fa hard not to be I I was

241
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,759
actually discussing this with a friend

242
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
today and I was showing him the

243
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,078
different the different grades and he's

244
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,560
talking about yeah I got a two bag

245
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,759
system I'm like two bags what's a two

246
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,078
bag system I've never about

247
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,919
1998 oh yeah we do that for years old

248

boy old school guys and I was like well

249
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,360
see this is the problem it doesn't it's

250
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,120
cool to do things for years but what's

251
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,919
even cooler is to accept that you can

252
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,720
learn and constantly better

253
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,519
yourself like I've I've been doing this

254
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,600
for years too and trust me I'm you know

255
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,120
we're learning every day like I don't

256
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,320
ignore I know a lot of you people right

257
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,519

262
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,759

264
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:54,439

too busy looking at this resin well

268
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:05,719
right away I think we have to hit each

269
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,679
one y and just talk about uh this is

270

absolutely [ __ ]

303
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:35,679
delightful put on here Beau in put chain

304
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,679
down push this in a little for

305
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,759
you a little dabble do you I think uh

306
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,838
with this particular bubble what I'm

307
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:50,399
going to do I'm not sure what I've done

308
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,000
now with my oh my dab

309
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,919
kit I think I might go more along the

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,440
lines of the Dabber traditional it all

311
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,639
it did was melt instantly and stick to

312
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,199
this thing it's not you're not having

313
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,799
good success with that no this this was

314
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,799
what I'm thinking is heat the Dabber up

315
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:10,919
and then dip it in to this 90 oh yeah

316
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:13,039
that's crunchy and then pull it out wow

317
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,399
yeah my

318
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,679
turn let me get the I love holding the

319
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,679
pipe from the bottom and really show the

320
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,479
here we

321
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:25,719
go this

322
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,480
is yeah it's it's like the smell and the

323
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,560
flavor is definitely very unique that's

324
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,560
uh that smells like My Little

325
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,959
Pony but we're talking about does it

326
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,679
have really that hay smell to

327
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:44,559
it and really um really trying to

328
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,000
determine oh it's nice it's Unique it's

329
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,439
different it's not Haze to me but

330
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,440
there's a unique taste in there it's

331
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,159
fruity there's undertones that are

332
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,559
almost

333
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,719
unrecognizable just remind me of old

334
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,479
things school well that's why they had a

335
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,680
date on at ' 92 and I know that's pretty

336
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,278
clear

337
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,679
so and who knows where are they came

338
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,679
from

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,519
but oh that was a great hit I'll tell

340
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,439
you it's eye closing hash literally

341
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,919
makes you want to close your

342
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,920
eyes very nice

343
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,799
material

344
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,360
it's great that we could wait for two

345
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:38,000
full weeks and just leave it be and

346
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,759
that's really in my opinion the uh the

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,240
kicker in in in properly drawing bubble

348
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,919
hashes well you know what

349
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,399
like feeling very it's just very it's

350
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,319
just I don't eat anymore right now I'm

351
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,360
just I'm happy defin strong one thing

352
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,240
I'll say about um properly drawing

353
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,120
bubble and how you can tell the

354
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,039
differences and I've learned this uh

355
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,440
really just in playing with full melt

356
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:06,399
dry sift pure 99% head dry sift when I

357
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,240
squeeze dry sift together it's hard

358
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,839
right away and it's almost sometimes

359
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,799
hard to make it flat and thin it's just

360
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,680
you push a dab together and it's almost

361
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,639
hard instantly bubble very rarely does

362
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,519
that because most people's bubble is

363
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,680
still moist it still has wet in it you

364
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,879
know it's

365
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,519
not just grease all the time a lot of

366
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,759
the times that bubble has moisture in it

367
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,399
it's the wax membrane and it might

368
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:36,839
appear to look nicer but it's degreg and

369
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,799
to a hash smoker who's a recogniz not

370
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,279
recognized but um an experienced hash

371
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:44,120
smoker will feel the difference in their

372
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:46,278
throats that's that little bit of

373
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,600
harshness you you must have as being a

374
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,439
judge this year at Legends and sitting

375
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,759
with the the the Heavies you you know

376
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
what I mean like those guys are serious

377
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,480
has smokers Oh serious they're not it's

378
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,278
not and they're not doing it for any

379
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,519
recognition they're not doing it for any

380
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,838
like to be in a magazine or they're just

381
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,839
like that's who they are and they take

382
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,160
it very seriously so I think that's what

383
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
was so great about being able to judge

384
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,480
there and stuff was was talking with

385
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,600
them and and asking and then and then

386
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,240
it's just the passion you see in people

387
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,360
that's it for for no reason re and and

388
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,919
and and then looking over at you going

389
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,199
you're just like us yeah that's it I'm

390
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,198
just so passionate about the same John's

391
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:30,439
definitely passionate some of you have

392
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,958
made comments in the YouTube videos like

393
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,199
man I love how the grower is so proud

394
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,518
that's his passion that's why John and I

395
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,958
click cuz I'm in the same boat I don't

396
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,039
grow but what people do grow I want them

397
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:48,679
to know how great it is and how you

398
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:51,360
offer them that is you teach them about

399
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:54,318
purity you know before we had bubble

400
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,278
bags and water extraction you know pre

401
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,719
99 you know a lot of people most people

402
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,480
had never seen this and it just didn't

403
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,720
exist in a lot of people's stash most

404
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,838
people haven't been you know exposed to

405
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,038
full melt dry sift or full melt bubble

406
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:15,359
pre pre 1990 99 sorry so here we are 15

407
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:17,919
years later oh my mine was um black hash

408
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,438
and you let it stand on fire put it on

409
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,400
it smell awesome and it was killer was

410
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,840
the best I still hear people to this day

411
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,600
it had the gold seal on it it's like

412
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,558
oh

413
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,079
yeah and then you you go to amam they

414
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,440
have little stuff please help yourself

415
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,558
could you imagine how they would never

416
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,240
be

417
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,240
this and then John I

418
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:47,160
know

419
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,519
oh it's like yellow and then there's

420
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,679
tiny little flakes little pieces that

421
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,519
didn't quite get microplan that got you

422
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,240
know we'll have to separate those out

423
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,839
because they are uh they're just a

424
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,519
different color and they look totally

425
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,199
wild mix that's what I just took a piece

426
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,720
over that and hit it yeah well those are

427
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,880
the best pieces to get rid of right away

428
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,960
cuz they're the most likely to have

429
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,840
trapped moisture and that's why I did

430
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,480
that and even a piece that's small the

431
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:12,558
size of the tip of a match head is

432
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:17,640
enough it's enough to have M

433
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:19,798
moisture so I guess uh it was a success

434
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,240
the fresh frozen batch and whiske always

435
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:25,000
a success actually I would say yeah out

436
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,640
of what I see sitting in front of me I'm

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,640
cold cold cold and you've been saying

438
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,799
that to me ever since I

439
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,440
keep it cold keep it cold keep it cold

440
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,158
absolutely well doing it at 0°

441
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,880
temperatures while it's snowing out yeah

442
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,240
that was nice hey come on we'll be doing

443
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,600
it again we'll be getting up there

444
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,759
sooner than later hopefully into the

445
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,558
pton back country maybe the ice cave to

446
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,640
do a nice batch I really want to get

447
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,359
that done this winter I think that it

448
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,400
would be valid to show some epic

449
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:55,678
snowboarding epic skiing ski flying and

450
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,440
sledding all mixed in with a video where

451
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,159
we go to the ice cave and make a fat

452
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,640
batch of fresh frozen I know maybe some

453
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,240
dry sift some dry sift so yeah just want

454
