organic rockar minute it's super super

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,160
nice it's definitely a strong body

167
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,478
effect but definitely good with it re

168
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,800
activity as well it kind of keeps you

169
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:31,060
active and thinking about things ick a

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,360
couple of Sy if you had some nice ones

171
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,680
[Music]

172
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,120
I guess one of the great things that

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,120
working at a place like this would be

174
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,720
that you know what better way to learn

175
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,399
the ability of the strain than to

176
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,319
bioassay it than to than to try it

177
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,439
yourself I personally would feel more

178
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,759
comfortable purchasing something off of

179
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:53,158
a bud tender that had actually used the

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,319
strain than one that was telling me you

181
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,120
know how it the effect what the effects

182
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,158
should be yeah you know I want to know

183
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,360
what the effects were exactly how you f

184
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:04,000
the fact

185
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,759
and lean towards maybe a bit more in

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,079
what you felt about I also appreciate

187
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,240
the fact that you're a hash maker oh yes

188
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,959
and you know I think every Bud tender

189
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,280
should be at least have to go through

190
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:18,519
hash education yeah hash eation hash

191
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:22,399
acation and and learn about the resin

192
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:24,359
yeah before trying to you know explain

193
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,399
it definitely especially water

194
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,120
extraction oh yeah it's very clean way

195
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,560
for people to get their medicine

196
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,959
absolutely some people may have elments

197
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,958
that such as long lung issues they can

198
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,278
get the same effect but not some smoke

199
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:41,718
absolutely 100% pretty right smell

200
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,278
this I didn't smell it on the first one

201
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,959

and tell people you grew it organically

239
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,599

getting a bunch of these

243
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,320
strains you're going to have to try them

244
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,320
all out yeah come absolutely I look

245
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,480
forward to the days where there's more

246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,320
um melts and dry sifts on the menu

247
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,399
that's uh well you know I don't smoke

248
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,839
much but you know that cuz that's the

249
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,799
after you're on the dry sift and the

250
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,639
hash and you've got that product you're

251
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:49,479
available to it it's well you look at

252
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:52,159
this you look at this as you know a jar

253
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,759
of hash I look at this as one of my nug

254
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,480
jars full of hash that's right with a

255
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,759
blue shoe to it yeah to the hash you

256
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,879
know what I mean like that's what I

257
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,399
would what I see both of us would die to

258
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,120
just grab this whole thing and then

259
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,958
crush it over

260
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,839
screens oh yeah like I would go do that

261
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,638
right now yeah right now we can set it

262
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,320
up in the backroom we almost did it the

263
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,278
last place we were at yeah but um what I

264
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,278
do like to do though the most is is you

265
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:21,078
know is introduce this to other people

266
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,159
that that that are patients and stuff to

267
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,078
say look like this is what's available

268
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,399
down there yeah yeah you know and uh you

269
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,078
know you can come down you can you can

270
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
get signed up bring your license down

271
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,199
because some people are getting the

272
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,879
stuff mailed to them that is absolute

273
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,759
garbage from some of these places like

274
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,838
like the whole plant is being put into a

275
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,679
wood Shredder and then and then it's

276
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,600
sold in in pill bottles that's sent in

277
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,120
the mail from these government grown

278
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,680
places and it's just complete garbage

279
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,639
quite different from being offered that

280
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,239
you you won't see that yeah yeah you

281

know people need to know that right and

282
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,839
uh you know I hope this kind of lets

283
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,278
people know that there is better things

284

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,959
inclined to to ask to see a few more

289
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,360
just for the audience because I so far I

290

291
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,320
been impressed with so it's you know

292
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,078

00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,360
update it nice you know what let me give

328
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,479
this a squeeze and put it under the

329
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,560
cameraman's nose cuz what a cruel cruel

330
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,639
world this is he's watching us all smell

331
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:56,319
this smell this but that is really like

332
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,600
and the cameraman really loves smelling

333
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,959
it as well a really nice deep Cush yeah

334
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,278
and also once again these eight little

335
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:09,198
little little just solid nugs of real

336
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,159
nice nice excellent good been one of

337
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,519
them like I like the bar you guys are

338
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:17,078
setting so far excellent that they here

339
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,759
this is great to keep as high as you can

340
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,719
well I think it's good because if you do

341
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,959
then the people who are out there

342
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,720
producing these grades of medicine if

343
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,198
their grades aren't cutting it they're

344
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,800
forced to up their standards up their

345
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,278
standards which is a great thing for

346
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,679
them to do because they want to up their

347
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,078
standards they want to do better they

348
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,359
want to produce a nicer product and then

349
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:38,078
it just works out for everyone they're

350
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,240
happier you're happier and most

351
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:43,799
importantly the end user the patient the

352
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,560
the person who's buying this cannabis

353
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,159
isn't it important that they're the most

354
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,679
happy exactly the patients that going to

355
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,639
be using that as this is cannabis that

356
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,039
if you were to purchase and go home you

357
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,120
certainly would not be disappointed

358
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:58,879
later on you know sometimes you can get

359
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,679
sold herb where you're like oh did I get

360
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,600
hit

361
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,359
that is nothing but a disappointment a

362
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,040
one it's a one joint wonder One joint

363

we'll make sure that we show Darren

365
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,720
smoking some of this herb maybe I'll

366
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:13,838
take some Vapor hits through uh one of

367
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,920
the vaporizers that we have access to

368
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
and we'll give you guys a little bit of

369
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,559
a background on um the quality of the

370
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,560
resin I'm obviously only giving you my

371
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,879
opinion on the smell uh the feel and the

372
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,958
look of the bud but that's generally a

373
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,480
pretty solid uh giveaway if you can nail

374
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,159

396
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,560
some every time I open it I'm

397
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,879
like [ __ ] you know what you know what

398
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,078
I'll say about this place as well I'm

399
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,318
going to say a second thing maybe some

400
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,239
of you at home have noticed but for Bud

401
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:38,399
that they're showing to people this

402
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,600
looks like Bud that has never ever been

403
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,879
touched it literally looks like look at

404
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
that dude that's that looks I listen

405
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,679
I've seen a lot of bud that's never been

406
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,600
touched and that looks like Bud that's

407
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,519
never been touched that's a rarity I

408
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,639
think it's another great standard to up

409
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,278
because it's like guess what this is

410
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,159
someone's medicine don't you be touching

411
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,278
it don't even though you know we've

412
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,799
squeezed a few buds I know we did and I

413
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,959
feel terrible maybe we should buy those

414
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:07,279
particular buds this I will not give a

415
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,318
squeeze I like touching the touching it

416
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,038
giving it a squeeze and if you know what

417
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,959
the dense buds I had no problem doing

418
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,640
that with the MK it didn't change it it

419
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,640
didn't alter it at all but this it's so

420
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,959
this looks like it's never been touched

421
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,880
man look at the resin content on that KX

422
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,600
right there let's get that up close

423
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,080
yeah

424
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,918
tails that fox t awesome really good

425
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,720
that's a healthy happy plant it it

426
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,360
certainly is so here's a question that

427
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,319
the viewers at home might want to ask

428
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:41,519
how can people who are watching this

429
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:43,879
that are like oh my gosh do you need to

430
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:47,119
be a Canadian or do you need to be from

431
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,640
BC or do you what do you have to be at

432
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,678
we try to we well we definitely do have

433
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,759
everyone have a medical license um so we

434
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,640
definitely Canadian Canadian what if an

435
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,679
American comes up with a medical license

436
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,840
as long as they have Canadian

437
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,000
license like a a Canadian prescribes

438
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:08,519
license by a doctor doctor practitioner

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,400
or a specialist then we can definitely

440
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,200
go years to that which isn't impossible

441
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,600
to get so now you're hearing this uh you

442
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,319
us uh people down in the America that

443

you are also able to come up here as

444
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,279
long as you were to get the doctor to

445
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,720
prescribe it while you're here which

446
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,678
shouldn't be that difficult cuz he could

447
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,480
prescribe you any other number of drugs

448
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,038
you would then be uh able to have access

449
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,440
to come here and access uh

450
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,798
