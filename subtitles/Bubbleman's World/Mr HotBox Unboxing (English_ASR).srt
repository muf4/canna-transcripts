00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,719
zan from the mr. hotbox the vaporization

5
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,420
from the future company and I first

6
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,909
heard about mr. hotbox and zan from a

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,939
good friend online friend Adam also

8
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:41,250
known as handmade and I saw that he got

9
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,170
one of your units and right away I was

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,619
like dude that looks like a killer

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,370
little electric nail I also been I also

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:53,099
love the fact that you guys had the

13
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,390
battery pack that came with it yeah yeah

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,550
why don't you tell us a little bit about

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,340
how you guys came to be in regards to

16
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,919
starting mister help us yeah mr. hotbox

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,650
we've been around for about four years

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,590
now and we originally started out of

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,450
Bellingham Washington we saw that there

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,118
was a need for an email that basically

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,159
could last you forever you could take

22
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,409
wherever you wanted and that's we filled

23
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,969
that market which is I guess kind of

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,909
goes hand in hand with why you offer a

25
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:24,688
lifetime warranty on it exactly yeah we

26
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,040
were hash smokers and we note that we're

27
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:27,959
sitting there with a torch every single

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,360
day and we were like we need something

29
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,519
that's just gonna be consistent that's

30
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,750
gonna give us yeah we're not dealing

31
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,060
with something that looks kind of

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,700
sketchy or anything like that either so

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,969
that was the first mr. hotbox was born

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,540
and then two years later this is our

35
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:48,569
newest version of it so this is mr.

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,150
hotbox classic we went like how Apple

37
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,979
had wood

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,620
the iPod Classic back in the day after

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,469
they discontinued the first iPod so this

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,650
is like the new sleeker design that we

41
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,620
we came out with that had our totally

42
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:07,380
our own circuit board it's designed by

43
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,189
our own team but one of the guys on our

44
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,259
team is a SpaceX engineer and and it

45
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,579
looks like it was engineered by a SpaceX

46
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,519
engineer I'm not gonna lie

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,790
it truly does so they got the bubble man

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,510
custom on there they also got my logo on

49
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:26,299
the back there then they got their name

50
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:30,090
right on the front

51
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,980
mr. hotbox just a nice little unit I

52
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,560
gotta say like it feels like I could

53
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:38,340
drop this thing and that I would not be

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,770
worried they broke it exactly be okay

55
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,080
yeah we've there's there videos on the

56
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,450
phone somewhere of us shooting the first

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,430
one with like pellet guns and all

58
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:52,109
dropping in and throwing it and then you

59
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:55,080
talking about taking some dabs out this

60
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,780
is truly like an indestructible email so

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,459
let's set it up yeah yeah the box also

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,009
has got some other things in there as

63
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,530
well and it's yeah stuffed it receptacle

64
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:06,989
so this is our power supply that allows

65
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,640
you to it's a big boy but it allows you

66
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,500
to plug it into anywhere in the world

67
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,548
you can go or switch lunge and make up

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:20,269
Africa anywhere and depending if it's

69
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:23,040
110 volts AC or 220 it's all ready to go

70
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,989
and so and for those of you that have

71
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,539
seen my video at the krasnopolskiy in

72
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,030
Amsterdam the High Times Cannabis Cup

73
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,500
where I plug in my gmail and I'm getting

74
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,049
things ready and I'm getting it all

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,939
organized and I come over to sort of

76
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,280
feed on the nail if it's heated up and I

77
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,909
look in the units flashing and I I'm

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,159
like oh [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm sure a few of you

79
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,810
remember that video it was it was

80
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,210
because the D nail at the time I don't

81
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,000
know if they

82
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:52,719
fixed it since they only really set it

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,479
out to be working off I guess 120 110

84
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,960
170 in Old North America

85
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:01,810
not quite the 240 volt which is in

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,020
Europe and it fried my whip luckily I

87
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,610
had an extra whip but that's one of the

88
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,980
reasons I ended up using the dab inator

89
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,560
which is another electric nail company

90
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:13,239
owned by a friend of mine Max and so you

91
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,250
know for this one one of the main

92
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,319
reasons I love the fact that it's

93
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,759
beefcake I love the fact that it looks

94
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,988
indestructible that it's warrantied for

95
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,230
life but one of the things I was really

96
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,609
really excited about is that they make

97
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,960
this little battery now we don't have

98
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,910
one here because they're so popular

99
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,409
they've sold out of them but they're in

100
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,360
the middle of manufacturing some more

101
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,980
and if you want to pass another other

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
dental battery it's smaller than the one

103
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,819
I've been using which this is just not a

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,069
very good battery at all it works for

105
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,659
maybe twenty to twenty minutes they're

106
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,579
claiming their battery is two to

107
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,470
two-and-a-half hours and they've done it

108
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:46,750
with your experience it's not just like

109
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,970
a theory and some two to two and a half

110
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,589
hours of a small little battery smaller

111
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,540
than this in the same metal finish

112
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:54,669
correct yep same metal finish love that

113
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,050
dude yeah and it has a long enough cable

114
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,090
so like you could even wrap it around

115
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,460
and just stick it underneath so you can

116
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:03,039
just how this whip feels great thanks

117
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:05,079
it's really loose and it's not it

118
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,350
doesn't feel like it's like too strong

119
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,180
yeah that was some of the other many

120
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,810
complaints that we heard from about

121
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,949
emails in general with that there was

122
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:20,500
the whip was a pain in the butt what's a

123
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,399
chrome it was either out of Kevlar and

124
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,370
it made it so it

125
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,859
would let you both this is a riffle um

126
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,680
and so do you go upside down or right

127
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,169
side up I do it upside down look at this

128
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,269
yeah personally just to keep the oh yeah

129
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:38,180
that's tight and nice in there too yeah

130
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,918
that's not like a loose fit I've got a

131
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,459
puking beagle in this one just because

132
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:46,399
we thought it would be a nice idea to

133
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:48,319
transfer the the whip but the way this

134
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,879
fits I don't think we're gonna have to

135
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,069
transfer the whip at all I think we'll

136
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,649
be able to transfer the entire yeah hole

137
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,500
and just put this one away you know

138
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:59,060
because that's usually it doesn't pull

139
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,060
out so nice like that that's actually a

140
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,538
really nice concept yeah having it not

141
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,629
be so loose and having it I mean it

142
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:11,240
feels snug in there yeah we wanted

143
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:13,399
something that was snug but because if

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,620
you have an air gap we were finding that

145
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,929
it was it doesn't really give you an

146
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,930
accurate temperature reading and so like

147
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,319
people people we've seen other nails

148
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:27,259
have an air gap people are us to have

149
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,819
their nail set to like 800 degrees or

150
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,680
something and then they're still getting

151
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:40,098
like a low Tim tabs on their nail and a

152
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:43,038
mic something that you noticed well in

153
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:44,538
the sense that if the thing isn't tight

154
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,209
around the quartz you definitely not

155
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:48,050
going to get that accurate temperature

156
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:50,418
well look at this guy

157
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,819
so yeah you press the power button five

158
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:54,500
times to turn it on it's a safety unit

159
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,538
let's say baby pen yeah exactly it's

160
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,418
like it to prevent someone turning it on

161
00:06:56,538 --> 00:07:02,538
or off special battery yeah exactly

162
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:04,038
and so right now it's set to two hundred

163
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,899
and eighty-three degrees Celsius that's

164
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,990
kind of the temperature that said about

165
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:12,408
five 80s yeah yeah five five 80s yeah

166
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,658
600 but sometimes you'll smoke get it

167
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:17,329
down to like 550 or something like that

168
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:18,539
or a little bit lower but if you want to

169
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:21,629
just change that

170
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,540
the the temperature you just click the

171
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,430
up or down arrow right here so depending

172
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,990
on what temperature you want you can

173
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,160
just click the arrow to your heart's

174
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:34,170
content and then the check mark here lot

175
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,540
is the menu function so that allows you

176
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,970
to change the safety timer so it

177
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,280
automatically sets to 30 minutes also

178
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,590
like you click the check mark again to

179
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:49,019
select that menu function but so you can

180
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:50,310
thirty minutes 120 240 or four month in

181
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,529
eighty minutes and pending on your

182
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,600
session italics let's go for for a yeah

183
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,759
I usually just like for any because it's

184
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,560
it prevents it from shutting out off

185
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,360
when you don't want it to and then you

186
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,850
type the many of you just select exit

187
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,830
menu and then if you want to change it

188
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:08,370
between Celsius and Fahrenheit you can

189
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:11,849
go into the unit's section okay and go

190
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,129
so I did and we have a story behind mr.

191
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,410
haibach says a robot from the future and

192
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,350
from the year 2050 seven he beat all the

193
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:22,439
other vaporizers in the great vaporizer

194
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,560
war not a gimmicky name but so we say

195
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:31,439
the global standard for the year 2050

196
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:33,120
seven is Celsius and the other option is

197
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,549
Fahrenheit so you can change it to

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,190
Fahrenheit if you'd like to and it works

199
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:41,309
just the same either way perfect

200
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:44,630
beautiful nice and easy and clean and

201
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:46,949
and tight and so when you're ready to

202
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:50,039
power up the coil you just click the

203
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,050
coil power button and it starts heating

204
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,759
nice and so does it let you know what

205
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:55,979
it's got up to temperature or is it so

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,779
you're just you're looking at that I

207
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,190
don't what's right here so yeah it's

208
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,839
starting to climb and if I don't have

209
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,940
feeling that it would show us that yeah

210
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,100
that you're climbing that's great and

211
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,710
then the H also lets you know that the

212
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,080
coils on so like if it's off they go

213
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,759
away plucked yeah exactly

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,870
beautiful well played well played on

215
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,789
what else you got some other accessories

216
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,980
here like your arms and such yeah so

217
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:20,009
this is a little carb cap that mimics

218
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,980
our actual mr. hot box design that fits

219
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,379
our quartz nails and our titanium nails

220
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,129
this is the head to our titanium nail so

221
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:31,500
it you can fit both that fits nice and

222
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:33,750
tight oh yeah it should fit even if you

223
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,480
didn't yeah I like that it seals well

224
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:41,220
beautiful yeah I push this all the way

225
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:45,600
down very cool and then so then we also

226
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,610
have it so that's like you can vaporize

227
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,340
flour out of it this is which we have a

228
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,830
bunch of jars of Thank You dragonfly

229
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,629
earth medicine for the lovely flavors

230
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,660
that we're gonna hit here today yeah

231
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:59,549
it's this is something that is unique to

232
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,230
us we designed this I guess has never

233
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:03,599
seen one yeah it's like a little

234
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,340
cartridge so like your Kuo goes around

235
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,980
this top piece will show you here

236
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,509
shortly but and then you've grind up

237
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,610
your herb throw it in this little

238
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,490
compartment and slide it in my little

239
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,610
seven and just starts baking away like a

240
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,710
volcano and what a what would you grind

241
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,190
it up with you can grind it up with a

242
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,870
mister

243
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,519
I asked tomorrow I was like oh I'm gonna

244
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,459
go get a grinder he's like oh no no no I

245
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,769
got one of those too so yeah this is one

246
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:34,039
we made for bubbleman that has his logo

247
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:37,759
on it then but we made a grinder that

248
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:39,799
has unique teeth design that allows it

249
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,778
to actually cut your flour instead of

250
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,068
just ripping smashing it and kind of

251
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,750
like tearing it apart like that's what

252
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:46,278
innovation is all about let's be honest

253
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,828
how many grinders are there out there

254
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,929
there's still room in my opinion to

255
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:53,028
create a grinder that actually grinds up

256
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,588
the herb in a proper way rather than

257
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:57,289
what he's saying which is ripping and

258
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,240
smashing it and it's uh it's not quite

259
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:02,088
as quite a good little sound on this one

260
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,159
I like it very cool super lightweight

261
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:08,389
too for what it's made out of like

262
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:11,809
beefcake again but super lightweight mr.

263
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,490
hotbox very cool very very cool and yeah

264
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:16,729
this is just the head there titanium you

265
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,068
know the base of our herb attachment and

266
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,470
titanium nail are the same so if you

267
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:23,389
didn't want to smoke herb or vaporize

268
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,300
okay you can just as you can do

269
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:29,060
additional yeah the deep dish and it we

270
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:31,490
tried to design our quartz and touching

271
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:33,138
nails to be very similar so I like the

272
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,539
fact that it's very beefy you know I've

273
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:38,990
got of course Corey cotton who produced

274
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:42,019
created a beautiful little drop down for

275
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,568
my pipes it was a gift from flat 41 I've

276
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:46,159
broken it since and waiting on him to

277
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:47,559
come pick it up which is actually

278
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,969
supposed to happen today or tomorrow

279
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,739
he's gonna pick up the remnants and said

280
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,259
for sure he can fix it for me so

281
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,889
generally you know this this feels

282
00:11:54,259 --> 00:12:00,259
really light as well is this okay yeah

283
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:01,909
really nice and how hot does it get when

284
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,528
you've got you can hold it you can hold

285
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:05,688
it yeah this is the key right here

286
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:07,100
you'll notice the quartz I have no

287
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:08,838
problem putting right into the stem of

288
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,879
my motherships because courts generally

289
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,100
even with a hot whip on it I can usually

290
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,809
grab them at the bottom and lift it out

291
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,699
and

292
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:17,919
and interchange it although with mr.

293
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:20,498
hotbox because it fits so nice and tight

294
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,719
on the top of the quartz bowl I'm not

295
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:24,189
worried that it's gonna fall out and I'm

296
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,920
definitely not worried that this part is

297
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:30,278
gonna get super hot and affect the

298
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:32,649
distal of my pipe these however I will

299
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,419
say that I'm less comfortable with the

300
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,370
smaller ones that I've seen putting them

301
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,289
right into the pipe just because they

302
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,110
can get really hot they can start

303
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:43,528
expanding and the glass can can

304
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,480
eventually produce cracks in them also

305
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:47,889
having someone put this into your Vista

306
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,360
Bowl that maybe isn't paying attention

307
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,068
you can chip it and you know these

308
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,959
motherships aren't cheap so you want to

309
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:54,698
take good care of them but today we are

310
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,219
gonna try the herb attachment without a

311
00:12:54,698 --> 00:13:00,278
drop down and I would love to be able to

312
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,800
try that later on for sure cool looking

313
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:04,360
unit man I really think this is you're

314
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,429
onto something right there thank you

315
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,269
what a cool way to be able to load and

316
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:12,818
unload the herb dish yeah it was

317
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,589
something that it was a long time coming

318
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:17,318
and finally enough people were like

319
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:20,620
hello love mr. hotbox but I'd only use

320
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:23,409
it if I could vaporize flour all right

321
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,328
like that's just weight and it got

322
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:27,159
contacted that same person within a week

323
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:29,438
it was like we made the thing that we

324
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,240
thought about for you yeah this one

325
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:33,969
looks just beautiful man I'm super

326
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,230
excited to get a rip in so that's what

327
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,059
we're gonna do we're gonna have a rip

328
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,060
I've got a bunch of different maple

329
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:44,120
butters I've got these ones which is

330
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:47,000
from heavenly days and then I've even

331
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,889
got a little Frenchie cannoli water hash

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,839
that we should definitely probably rip

333
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,740
up just because it's the last that I

334
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,180
have and it's a full full flavor so yeah

335
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,149
I don't know if you want to have

336
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:00,859
yourself the first rip off the unit sure

337
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,989
you don't want to go first it's yours

338
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,989
[Music]

339
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,729
you drove up you're so generous and kind

340
00:14:09,318 --> 00:14:14,059
to come all the way up with your time

341
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:17,420
but I won't say no to rip of course my

342
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:19,188
tolerance is still mildly low but that's

343
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:20,809
what building tolerance is all about

344
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:23,389
having some rip so I think I'm gonna hit

345
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:25,369
the Juanita mmm

346
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,318
one thing about this one Nita as you hit

347
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,448
it through your pipe and then everything

348
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:32,679
tastes like Juanita it's got such a

349
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:37,458
strong terpene profile really nice nice

350
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:40,818
resin from it's called Juanita lana

351
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:42,768
biddy bolsa lava rosin one gram and that

352
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:45,610
is from my good friends at maple butter

353
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:48,438
I feel like I should probably use your

354
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,409
dad you know

355
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:52,250
exactly so we'll make sure that that's

356
00:14:51,409 --> 00:15:06,169
nice and tight

357
00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:07,929
I did just do some photographs I think

358
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:12,318
it's good on the bottom now it's perfect

359
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:14,328
yep excited to have a little rep and

360
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:16,759
when I say little I really do mean

361
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:18,558
little not hitting us the monster dabs

362
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,808
but what we'll build it up we'll get

363
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:23,110
back not that I ever really hit monster

364
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:26,198
dabs I have to admit I'm not a huge

365
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,259
monster dad guy seems to be more of uh

366
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:32,299
of the youth takin taking grand grand

367
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:35,330
two grand abs and stuff

368
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:37,879
yeah so yeah it's just nice to see that

369
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,560
I love the whip and the blue light on

370
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,230
the front of the unit that's real nice

371
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,609
kind of combination thing very cool that

372
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,730
you've got these at first when I saw

373
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,350
these unique inserts for how you plug in

374
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,779
the whip and the plug I was kind of like

375
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,870
oh [ __ ] I won't be able to use any of my

376
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,399
current whips but you know what this is

377
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,429
such a nice whip that comes with it I'll

378
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,620
just have to uh get myself an extra yeah

379
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:03,769
we can we can get you any other whips

380
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,909
that you need and yeah these sorry to

381
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,679
cut you I'm just saying that the

382
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:09,169
connectors make it so this is

383
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,659
technically ip65 so like you could

384
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,819
technically break your bone on top of it

385
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,740
and it's not going to short out here -

386
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,560
mr. hotbox or the house so that these

387
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:22,820
are splash proof massage water resistant

388
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,929
buttons as well as connectors huge bonus

389
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,510
yeah so that's why we have different

390
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:29,870
connectors is that screws it and seals

391
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:31,309
it in versus the other you know one of

392
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,899
the things you'll find out there is when

393
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:35,569
companies offer you a lifetime warranty

394
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,850
on their product it means one of two

395
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,640
things either a they're completely

396
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,620
[ __ ] insane or B which I'm guessing

397
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,110
is the case in this case as well as the

398
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,710
case for me with bubble bags we build

399
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,419
the products so well and so good that we

400
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,820
eliminate the majority of the things

401
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:54,319
that people would require warranty from

402
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,700
in the first place and if you can

403
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,430
eliminate all those sort of stupid

404
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,080
little mistakes mishaps then what you're

405
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:02,509
really doing is you're warranting the

406
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,400
product for things that actually would

407
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:06,740
require a warranty yeah and when you've

408
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,440
done it properly it's not hard to offer

409
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,450
a lifetime warranty because the product

410
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,549
is built properly I mean the fact that

411
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,980
it's got buttons that are waterproof and

412
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:19,279
the seals on both the power and the whip

413
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,750
being splash proof that's a big deal you

414
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,059
know again how many times have you seen

415
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:28,700
a pipe or a glass of water go over right

416
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:30,980
over it's been fine

417
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,289
all right well shout out to mr. pop box

418
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,240
and shout out to mothership and shout

419
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,220
out to maple butter because those three

420
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,788
companies at

421
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:44,220
point-in-time are making this rip for me

422
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:44,220
the bubble man possible give thanks

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,269
love the little hold of the car that's

424
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:14,990
great

425
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:14,990
been able to really sort of get around I

426
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,308
think if you're gonna hit that one mmm

427
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,870
you should hit it out of this pipe yes

428
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,009
and then we should hit the other flavors

429
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,209
out of this one because I'm telling you

430
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:29,000
yeah you're not gonna taste anything

431
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:31,288
else I'm good today it smells amazing

432
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:42,538
tastes amazing and that's three rips

433
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:44,849
already on a tiny little black Wow all

434
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:47,640
right we'll go for a little cleaning up

435
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:56,149
thanks to glob mops as well for making

436
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:58,980
this a EZ clean yeah jeez nice the way

437
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,700
we're both obsessed zan and I with

438
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,339
obviously keeping our our bowls clean

439
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,288
although if you saw my puking Beatle

440
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,259
before I pulled it out if there's

441
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:12,359
anything but cleaning fluid dirty it was

442
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:15,179
a little dirty it was a little dirty so

443
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,609
yeah there we go I think you could

444
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,288
possibly do your own q-tips for this

445
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:21,058
yeah that's it I think that would be a

446
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:22,589
really smart idea ones that are just

447
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:24,210
mean not that these don't fit good they

448
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:26,908
actually fit nice and snug and I'm not

449
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:30,960
finding that it's a danger to flip them

450
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:33,240
around and clean that yeah perfectly but

451
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,890
something that you could possibly do mr.

452
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,890
hotbox q-tips yep that's you read our

453
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,070
minds a little bit of a mess on the

454
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,370
outside of a car

455
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:47,619
that's to be expected Wow Thank You

456
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:51,219
maple butter rosin that is just a nice

457
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:55,269
light hi completely the opposite from

458
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,279
the heavenly days rock star 73 micron

459
00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:00,160
bubble hash pressed into rosin which is

460
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:04,359
this ridiculous white rosin this stuff

461
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:09,120
is like super intense full body full

462
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:12,119
full mind really oh yeah look at that

463
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:16,209
and pretty exciting

464
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:21,729
new electric nail one that I can travel

465
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:23,019
with with a battery most excited is is

466
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,779
my current situation

467
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:27,789
I am currently most excited I've had a

468
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,170
bunch of great products sent to me

469
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:32,769
recently that I'm going to be doing more

470
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:36,519
unveiling and unboxing videos as well as

471
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:40,629
the the full package from vape exhale

472
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:44,319
and but today it's all about mr. hotbox

473
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:47,260
I obviously love any type of unit that

474
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,149
allows me to use my current glass mm-hmm

475
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:50,559
you know what I mean I love the ability

476
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,450
to hit out of my motherships

477
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,980
yeah I think that they're great pipes I

478
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,920
know that there's a huge hype on them

479
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,230
but truly the way they hit the perks the

480
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,840
uniqueness of thought and the concept

481
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,940
that Scott has put into these as well as

482
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,329
the rest of the blowers that work with

483
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,980
him and our part owners it's hard to say

484
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:12,189
that they haven't done a great [ __ ]

485
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,920
job yeah you know they're fantastic

486
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,350
pieces to hit and unlike any other I

487
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,650
mean I remember years ago when the

488
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:22,149
mothership was less known of and people

489
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,880
walking around dispensaries just like

490
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,620
hitting them and I was like what piece

491
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,290
is some of these they're this hits like

492
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,359
literally the best that I've hit and I

493
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:33,849
agree with you and I think that's why

494
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,740
sometimes people they get it mixed up

495
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:37,209
and maybe you know maybe there's a there

496
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,099
is a bunch of hype I mean the pipes

497
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,920
definitely got very expensive and it was

498
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:43,539
the thing to have but sometimes there's

499
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,009
really the hype is there for a reason

500
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,430
yeah you know what I mean that it

501
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,529
actually

502
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,019
has a foundation in reality yeah which

503
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:51,789
these pipes are great [ __ ] pipes yeah

504
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:54,430
you know the first time I had a fat bag

505
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:56,319
I just wanted one yeah that was mighty I

506
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,630
was like oh my god not because I thought

507
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,069
it was like a Ferrari and cool and

508
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,740
people would think that I was cool if I

509
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:05,409
owned it was that I wanted it yeah it

510
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,799
the intake like the breath that you get

511
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,500
it just like clean and no restriction

512
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,279
really no restriction at all just

513
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,859
beautiful

514
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:18,069
so you've also got a really cool little

515
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:20,709
vaporizer unit here that I have you know

516
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:23,169
I think Dean L sent me something years

517
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,299
ago and it just it was weird I don't

518
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,009
know it was like a glass thing or

519
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:28,419
something yeah with it like a heater on

520
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,970
top of it or something like that

521
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,360
something like that yeah and don't get

522
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,259
me wrong because then one of the first

523
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,229
vaporizers that I really hit that

524
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:41,589
absolutely destroyed me was this Dutch

525
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,059
guy and it was also the heater on top

526
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:45,579
yeah I'm just trying to remember the

527
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:46,240
name sublime inator no no way before the

528
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:48,460
sublimator

529
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,589
waited before the sublimator that's on

530
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,289
Rico and that also was a very unique hit

531
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:54,519
yeah a little bit more you know that you

532
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,230
have to pay attention because it's got

533
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:58,210
this big sort of hanging on him and it

534
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,849
was a little bit more dangerous in that

535
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,220
sense but no this was years prior his

536
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:05,829
name was Everett the gentleman who had

537
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,930
the vaporizer and it was soma always had

538
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:10,299
one at this house and it was the first

539
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,880
time I saw this vaporizer was in 1995 at

540
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:15,039
the Cannabis Cup and it was it was like

541
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,080
it had this big heater that sat on the

542
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,329
top of like a jar it was unlucky

543
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:23,049
mother's and let me tell you that

544
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:24,730
vaporizer it's very big it's very good

545
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,409
Scott Hughes felt like a big glass bong

546
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,150
and the piece that goes into it it's not

547
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,590
like something that's very portable yeah

548
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,470
even though it kind of started as a

549
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:33,970
portable idea he had the jar around the

550
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,279
waist and whatnot but this this is a

551
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:39,430
great concept and an idea to offer to

552
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,960
people with electric nails yeah you know

553
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,810
what I mean because there's definitely I

554
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,370
don't consider it an operative a per

555
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:50,740
eyes but when I have my yeah yeah just

556
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:53,139
plug in all day long exhibit if I can

557
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,809
just pop it off yeah and put it onto

558
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,960
another unit yeah you can just throw it

559
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,960
on

560
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,539
just a little unleashing but that it's

561
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,390
not even hot if I touched it here it

562
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:13,779
would burn my fingers very badly but on

563
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:16,570
the bottom of the joints almost no heat

564
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:18,399
whatsoever so then this is just the oil

565
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:21,279
goes around the top like this so it's

566
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,320
heating the intake air like like a

567
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,519
volcano basically just has like a heat

568
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:28,569
gun inside the base of it and most other

569
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,879
vaporizers just have like a heat gun and

570
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:33,129
that's what's producing that hot air or

571
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,350
like a coil and then you sucking through

572
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,390
it is producing there yeah heat in the

573
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,549
air so this is this is our version of it

574
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,009
so you hit it more like a vape and

575
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:44,019
versus like clearing a bowl or something

576
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:47,019
like just a little bit lighter of a hit

577
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:50,529
because yeah exactly

578
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:53,829
and so yeah you just put it on your

579
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:58,420
regular bone and just grind up some

580
00:24:53,829 --> 00:25:01,599
power and then you just throw your flour

581
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,430
into the little compartment insert your

582
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,619
compartment in here so one of the

583
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,810
reasons the sublimator is so effective

584
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:10,299
and in fact just noticing this it would

585
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:14,200
probably be a best idea if you're using

586
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:17,649
this to have the pen inside the unit

587
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,750
before you fill it get it warm

588
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,070
you know maybe not blazing hot you don't

589
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,809
want to burn yourself but you would

590
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:27,000
definitely want to get this little dish

591
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:27,000
yep warm and is that something you guys

592
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,940
yeah because that we found that same

593
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,469
thing we've tested a whole bunch of

594
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,330
different times like just loading up a

595
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,880
cool cartridge and just start hitting it

596
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:42,279
and it takes about like 20 seconds or 15

597
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,070
seconds before you actually get some

598
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:48,430
milk unless unless it's in there so like

599
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:51,639
you either heat it beforehand and then

600
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,890
loads of power and then or you load your

601
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,009
fire in and then just let it sit for a

602
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,560
couple seconds like five to ten seconds

603
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,869
you can

604
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,889
and start pulling through and that that

605
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:06,379
just gives enough time for the actual

606
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:08,480
pans absolutely no design it's

607
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,660
definitely like it's to me it's very

608
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,980
much like a personal vaporizer yeah I

609
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,680
mean sure you could share with a buddy

610
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,440
or two but the way an electric nail can

611
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,269
be shared with hundreds of people is

612
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,090
kind of unparalleled in the industry

613
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:24,589
yeah for how fast it is to load and

614
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:27,649
clean and load and clean and it's always

615
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:28,909
hot it's just going yeah it's probably

616
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,910
not gonna be like that with the

617
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,590
vaporizer of the herb you know you could

618
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,140
probably bust up a bunch of herb and I

619
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:38,149
guess in a sense you can have a few of

620
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,400
these already but you know really that's

621
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:44,000
almost a design for a mass unit for a

622
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,950
dispensary yeah you have a small like

623
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,009
little design that just fits these

624
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,630
things hold nature a lot yeah and so you

625
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,279
pull them out you stuff them with the

626
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,770
herb you put them in the thing that

627
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:57,200
would be a good way in a in a blink to

628
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:59,119
speed that process up not that we need

629
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,069
to I mean you could hit concentrates off

630
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,319
this thing and how many concentrates in

631
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:06,589
a row do you really really mean before

632
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:09,230
your blasted I got pretty blasted just

633
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:12,799
off the last three rips and the wanita I

634
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:15,049
was extremely tasty I was hasty that was

635
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,930
great well why don't we pick an herb

636
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,029
from from the Dragonfly earth medicine

637
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:25,610
crew we've got so many different ones

638
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:34,910
it's kinda ridiculous for Turkey no

639
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:37,669
that's a nice smell remember we both

640
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,220
said the motherships yeah I was just

641
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,700
thinking about the mothership was it's

642
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,700
just different

643
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:52,539
let's do it

644
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:56,149
ya know it's dance its density on fire

645
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:58,029
like that - really yeah like British

646
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:02,810
foam being

647
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:04,519
that's wild like that that's uh you

648
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:08,659
wouldn't I'm looking at this father you

649
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:10,460
wouldn't think there was like all right

650
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:14,900
they're really knowledgeable in their

651
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:17,059
soil and the the soil food web and you

652
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,670
know the way they feed and the intention

653
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:21,319
that is behind the growing I really like

654
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,259
but they were totally responsible for

655
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:26,059
the last episode of hash Church the soil

656
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:30,049
Edition where they got some just

657
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:32,119
wonderful people in to talk about you

658
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,950
know the science of soil the

659
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,579
spirituality of soil like there is

660
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,069
everything

661
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:39,980
yeah they had Swami on there and him and

662
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:42,409
Nicky we're just giving one perspective

663
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:46,880
while you have this guy column dropping

664
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:49,400
hardcore knowledge on compost there's a

665
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,130
great episode that's boom I felt like I

666
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,050
learned a lot and I like that about

667
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,700
hashed Church that's what everyone loves

668
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:58,430
about a hash Church I'm usually in the

669
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,900
conversation and part of the people that

670
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,060
are kind of in the noble on that

671
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,310
particular conversation yeah but in with

672
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:06,259
soil it was it was very much I felt like

673
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:09,289
a noob that there was a lot to be

674
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:12,349
learned so give thanks to the dragon

675
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,690
flavor of Medicine Shelton them out and

676
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:24,879
this is all there so you kidding me

677
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:27,259
Starkiller across with public oh yeah

678
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:35,120
mothership going in the mothership yeah

679
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:36,950
effects that's like earthy yeah it's so

680
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,479
is there a little trick to not burning

681
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,819
yourself when you pull this out I guess

682
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,319
you just want to push a little yeah it's

683
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:47,539
just I mean yeah my technique is get a

684
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,609
little pinch and then just kind of push

685
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:51,740
it down which is you know it's gonna

686
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:54,019
heat it up to a red-hot temperature you

687
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,359
know in luckily there's not I mean the

688
00:29:54,019 --> 00:30:01,369
edge of this little dish is there's so

689
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:02,929
little surface contact that is if you

690
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:04,359
want to have it a little cooler you can

691
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,860
always just put it in obvious

692
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,769
we realize that the terpenes are

693
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:10,269
volatile so you know you want to hit

694
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,980
them both at the same time you want to

695
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:14,019
get that heat at the right temperature

696
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,490
the minute the heat is exposed to the

697
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:17,528
Terps because the Terps start

698
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,288
evaporating pretty much immediately and

699
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:24,519
you want to be able to capture those

700
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:28,058
I won't say no I wonder if we should try

701
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:32,200
it out of this this pipe yeah just so I

702
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:35,349
can actually taste yes but taste the

703
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,200
sunshine all right there we go it's

704
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:45,579
exciting no carb on this necessary oh

705
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:47,019
just this yeah I didn't need to turn up

706
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:52,599
the temperature a little bit sorry

707
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:55,120
spaced out what to what temp what are we

708
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:58,058
going to so we're so good so we're gonna

709
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,729
crank it up to 300 degrees Celsius cuz

710
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:04,000
so because you're beating the air that's

711
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:06,250
coming through it it it you heat it up a

712
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,169
little bit hotter than you normally than

713
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:12,599
your normal vape tips that you'd like to

714
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:15,460
set on a volcano or another vaporizer

715
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:17,528
that first taste was insane really yeah

716
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,470
I'm telling you insane it's almost worth

717
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:22,119
leaving it and oh yeah right away what I

718
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,980
was gonna say is leave it at 280 hit

719
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,979
your first rip then turn it up because

720
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:29,200
when he turned it up this thing went up

721
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:32,849
in temperature fast like it's already at

722
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,850
the temperature that he said it to

723
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:40,109
that was great dude

724
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,720
like all the way down to the end here

725
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:45,689
you take that one over grab this one

726
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,630
passing ships yeah do the night even

727
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,640
repel it's very much brown it's like

728
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,340
I've definitely was it was a very very

729
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,759
very nice green look at the depth yeah I

730
00:31:53,339 --> 00:32:00,000
gotta show them that hopefully I can at

731
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:05,490
the angle that the cameras at so you can

732
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,700
kind of see the difference in the the

733
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,259
grabbing as it gravan it's always hard

734
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,279
to tell but there's major differences in

735
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:19,529
the color there so that's a

736
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:25,259
substantially vaporized dish well it

737
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:27,149
came out beautifully so yeah beautiful

738
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:29,819
and it's actually warm this time so I

739
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:33,150
suspect a bit although the flavor on

740
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:35,099
that first rip I barely exhaled anything

741
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,380
there was a tiny little plume right at

742
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:40,049
the start and then it was just pure

743
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:47,190
flavor it's almost like you don't want

744
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:50,069
to be exhaling it yeah that's really

745
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,650
nice I have to say that's that's a great

746
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:54,089
herb vaporizer thank you yeah I'm a

747
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,340
little bit of a snob when it comes to

748
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:58,230
greater vaporizers I'm not I'm not a big

749
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:04,230
fan of all the different kind of like

750
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:06,120
plastic hard composit yeah yeah same I'm

751
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,450
the same way I'm not a fan of that yeah

752
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:12,149
I income when I was in college I had a

753
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,980
buddy who had a volcano we probably

754
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:22,019
smoked it of us every day at some point

755
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:25,980
throughout the day so familiar that

756
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:28,349
first step um with the volcano so I was

757
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,329
like that's yeah I want something that's

758
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:32,009
gonna at least hit well yeah absolutely

759
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:34,539
and you know what nothing against

760
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:37,119
volcano they set the bar very early

761
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:39,220
late 90s early 2000s with that unit it's

762
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,549
a total Hospital friendly unit it

763
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,079
removes all concept of prohibition and

764
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,659
you know getting people to think in a

765
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,750
different mindset but at the same time

766
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:52,779
there's no comparing the rip that you

767
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:55,119
get off of a good sort of vaporizer

768
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:56,950
that's designed to actually make as the

769
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,469
Arab regardless of what the pipe that

770
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,840
you're smoking out of you is for me the

771
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,289
pipe is a part of it to filtering that

772
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,059
that vapor through the pipe depending on

773
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:09,039
the perk and the amount of water that's

774
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:11,918
present and just the feel of the glass

775
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,000
is a part of the experience to me yeah

776
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,329
to me too

777
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,940
and that's that's love of the volcano

778
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:20,799
it's a great unit but yeah that was the

779
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,710
one lacking thing for me to I was like I

780
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,050
got my piece that I like smoking through

781
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,909
gives me a really clean hit I'd love to

782
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:32,019
be able to add that mm-hmm have that

783
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:33,969
functionality well sure you know opened

784
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:38,949
up the ability for me to have a little

785
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:45,879
vapor up every once in a while you know

786
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:46,960
I've got the flavors this is great huh

787
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,390
thank you

788
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,110
glad they popped up today yeah thank you

789
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,609
for having me

790
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,140
make a little video on bubble man's

791
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,059
world I know I haven't made a ton of

792
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,279
videos lately I've definitely been a

793
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,110
little under the weather

794
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,670
in that sense just having hurt my leg

795
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,670
but I'm feeling a lot better

796
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:11,790
that just goes in even awkwardly with my

797
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,469
arm like this it just goes in nice boom

798
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:17,469
yeah and the crazy thing about that herb

799
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:19,869
attachment is until we started making

800
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:22,899
them they they have the tolerances

801
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:27,099
within like within a thousandth of an

802
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,690
inch and that's been more precise than a

803
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:32,139
lot of a lot of things that are made

804
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:34,360
these days and so like yeah we're like

805
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:36,639
that that basically has the tolerances

806
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,539
of an airplane or like anything air

807
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:42,019
aerospace-grade or

808
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:46,550
like that and unlike many other things

809
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:48,019
on the market so hey listen nice to be

810
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,000
able to pull it out and look at the

811
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:53,380
