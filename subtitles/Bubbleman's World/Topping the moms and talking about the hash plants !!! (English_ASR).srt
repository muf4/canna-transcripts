00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,120
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world I

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,720
am sitting here today and I'm trimming

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,480
down my Moms making sure they stay short

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,599
I don't want these tall lanky moms so

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,160
it's hard to cut out these perfectly

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,359
beautiful that's an Afghan right there

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,320
can tell from the structure and the

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:26,080
smell I got o sweet skunk look at that

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,800
big seems like such a shame but I was

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,278
telling Dr Atomic the other day when he

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,278
was here and I was giving him clones

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,399
that as many as you can because soon

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,960
I'll just be tossing them away anyway

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,679
keep your moms down don't let them get

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,759
Too Tall cut them down these two here

16
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,840
are not moms these are the BC hash

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,799
plants and these BC hash plants have

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,120
been a little bit hurting they've got

19
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:51,078
the uh classic copper uh deficiency Leaf

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,399
curl happening I'm not sure if this is a

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,399
copper deficiency but I'm going to be

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,518
flushing them today with a half power

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,120
food and uh pH to 6.3 and hopefully that

24
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:03,000
will bring this out they've both been

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
exactly the same they're the only two

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,560
plants that are doing this and every

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,599
time the new health comes out it seems

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,040
to be seems to be healthy but um

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,438
everything below that seems to be

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,080
stressed a little bit so these are the

31
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:18,758
things I'm figuring out in my garden um

32
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,359
keeping the moms down I've got a tent

33
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,680
blooming right now and I've got another

34
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,319
