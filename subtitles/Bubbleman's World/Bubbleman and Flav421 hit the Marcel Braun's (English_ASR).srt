33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,640

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,840
only one yeah we'll have I don't know I

35

dab I'll talk about this one this is the

62
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,878
smoke volume two piece that Marcel did

63
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,000
for the book

64
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,840
compilation um when I was talking to him

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,719
he sort of described it as as a totem

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,519
piece for him because the Phoenix and

67
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:01,400
the octopus are both very uh close

68
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,400
Animal Spirits for him it's very large

69
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,799
chugs very hard not

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,920
necessarily the best for anything but

71
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,920
hash really cuz as you can

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:20,159

73
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,679
we love this guy up yeah yeah I'll take

74
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,598
some of this you want this hash oh yes

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,040
that was a really nice beautiful full

76
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:31,479
melt that that bubble man has provided

77
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:35,919

78
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:38,919

80
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,840
liquid yeah so this is absolutely a

81
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,518
stunner I don't think a lot of people

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
even realize that the Phoenix is coming

83
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,200
out of the top there it's almost so

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,159
subtle the way the wings are holding the

85
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,399
top disc yeah actually I'm give a shot

86
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,798
of the disc cuz it's a giant I'll

87
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,519
photograph it as well and we'll make

88
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,079
sure that we insert pictures as we're

89
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,400
talking about the different parts to the

90
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,280
pipes I'll show some nice close-ups for

91

94
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:21,680
almost right up to the head right up to

95
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,679
the neck that smoke went

96
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,120
beautiful now this one I haven't smoked

97
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,080

101
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:40,159
an anger fish oh okay um it was done as

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,919
part of the project 33 right at Living

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,680
glass works that's beautiful yeah it's

104
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,359
they're all so different these are all

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,840
so different you really couldn't have

106
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,479
had like a greater selection of pipes

107
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,519
man this is a beef cake piece I'll tell

108
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,038
you this is quite something to have

109
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,758
someone go and pass this over to you no

110
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:00,759
it's a heavy it's a heavy chunk of glass

111
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,720
this is generally not pass over at like

112
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,199
concerts when you're just like at a fish

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,479
show and you turn around and someone's

114
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,280
like hey did you want to take a hit of

115
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:09,279
it even though fish 2000 was yeah well

116
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,519
of course that's Marcel right all right

117
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,519
let me

118
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:25,079
out whoa chugger

119
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:28,759
yeah and he's a beast

120
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,159
wow love that old school can and how

121
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,160
perfect down

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,919
foot well the ready lines are kind of

123
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,039
off the off the chart yeah they're

124
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:42,079
completely over the top it's like a

125
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:44,560
ratachello that just continues

126
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,680
on very very nice yeah and I agree with

127
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,160
you the old school can stop the

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
down like you can see it's grommeted in

129
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,120
like there

130
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,198
is very a lot of difficulty taking the

131
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,319
down stem out You' have to take it all

132
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,400
out out blah blah blah yeah and the down

133
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,840
stem

134
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,758
is about that long I wouldn't want to be

135
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,279
the one charged with that job no no

136
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,919
certainly not excellent and so that's

137
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,359
Marcel's totem piece yeah that's sort of

138
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,918
the way he described it I wouldn't like

139
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,598
claim it as that I wouldn't say it's

140
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,680
like his totem piece just in

141
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,319
conversation with him I like the idea

142
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,879
though cuz it's I mean I've bought of

143
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,800
course Marcel's first two pieces of his

144
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,800
first three from 1999 Marcel 1 and three

145
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
and though he only did three pieces that

146
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,240
year and they were all octopus and fish

147
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,120
oriented MH and he kind of kept up and

148
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,598
played along with that octopus theme for

149
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,918
a few more years he did the fish 2000

150
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,279
pipes with the

151
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:45,038
dolphins and he ended up I think it was

152
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:48,038
around 01 or

153
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,318
02 hard to remember May when he did the

154
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:51,839
first goddess piece that was one of I

155
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,680
remember him bringing it over and it was

156
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,318
this beautiful orange and

157
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,879
yellow incredible piece and then yeah

158
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,360
from there on we found him found himself

159
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,000
doing the Phoenix I remember he actually

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,360
brought the Phoenix the first Phoenix

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,399
piece it was a sculpture a huge

162
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,319
sculpture he brought it to the

163
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,758
degenerate art show that Slinger and I

164
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,680
threw at the M the one that he did on

165
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,520
his own not the one that him and yeah

166
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,918
this was a sculpture a giant huge

167
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:19,439
sculpture and it had a bowl and it had a

168
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:21,439
bubbler uh in in the uh in a in sand so

169
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,240
there was a dish yeah this was from

170
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,800
degener R1 this was from degenerate R1

171
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,680
and it was a giant clear Phoenix that

172
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,079
was 5T tall coming up out of the sand it

173
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,199
was completely over the top he drove it

174
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,839
up in his little truck and the crate was

175
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,759
like literally filled the back of his

176
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,839
truck and when he showed up with that

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,720
piece I'm telling you when he showed up

178
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,679
with that piece first it was Jason Lee

179
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,800
and hops they sent the motorcycle in

180
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,598
when that piece showed up we all said

181
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,478
okay nothing else has to show up we have

182
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,839
an art show right here oh [ __ ] yeah do

183
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,038
you know what I mean for the time that

184
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:55,359
it happened and whatnot and hops being

185
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,598
unknown and Jason Lee just being at a

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,720
level of you know I mean he's always

187
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:01,639
been killing it but he was just really

188
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,319
killing it so good and that motorcycle

189
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,680
showed up and we were like okay we're

190
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,680
good to go and then Marcel showed up

191
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,879
with the

192
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,560
crate he blew my mind yeah we're really

193
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,759
good to [ __ ] go how can this not blow

194
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,879
your mind totally yeah well I think we

195
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,280
should move to the buck fish piece yeah

196
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,599
cuz Singularity it's it's very fragile

197
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,439
very difficult we got to have a lot of

198
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,360
open space um as you can see it's a nail

199
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,120
with a

200
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,399
dome and the pipe comes out so we'll

201
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,240
leave this this guy to last this buck

202
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,038
and Marcel piece is absolutely

203
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,479
incredible the first time I saw a photo

204
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,120
of it I want to say it was maybe magido

205
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,959
who had it in his hand but maybe it was

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,879
a different one that he had it was a

207
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,239
buck one of these fish yeah no buck is

208
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,000
known for doing doing the fish designs

209
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,959
yeah completely over the top the SK yeah

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,278
I mean Buck is is a a just a how

211
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,599
everybody knows absolutely love this

212
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,200
really thin stem that comes into the

213
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,278
mouthpiece and the way you can hold it

214
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,399
with this giant ball is just it's really

215
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,679
quite a comfortable uh comfortable piece

216
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,679
you want to uh yeah load it up and take

217
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,359
the first hit

218
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,958
fantastic um I've been smoking he pieces

219
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,519
for a long time so I have to say I'm

220
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,879
fairly comfortable holding them and

221
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:23,200
passing them around but there really is

222
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,439
an unsaid etiquette in puffing with

223
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,920
people's headpieces of this level you

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,000
really have to be smart you can't be

225
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,479
moving all quick you don't want to be I

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,759
mean for instance when I rolled up here

227
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,278
I had my keys I still have them yeah I

228
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,799
wear my keys around my neck well the

229
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,559
first thing I did when I got around this

230
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,120
glass was I took them off my neck and I

231
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,518
put them away any type of a necklace

232
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,360
with a medallion or even those glass

233
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,399
beads sometimes or metal discs like

234
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,639
leaning into a headpiece like this could

235
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,480
really put you in an uncomfortable

236
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,679
situation I've stopped wearing a lot of

237
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,519
last pendants just for that exactly even

238
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,199
what you just did you know just the way

239
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,759
FL put his arm he just put his arm in

240
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,680
between these two pieces to grab a piece

241
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,519
of hash that's fine he owns these pieces

242
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:15,078
he can do that but to be someone else

243
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,159
and to just think that you can do that

244
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,039
to clip something it's just so the glass

245
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,120
deserves a certain amount of respect it

246
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,879
doesn't mean you have to be like walking

247
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,399
uh you know all super scared and and not

248
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,000
confident you want to have confident

249
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,078
when you hold glass like this but at the

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,600
same time you really want to move a

251
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:37,519
little bit slower than you normally do

252
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,159
such as that's for me this for you all

253
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,000

294
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,278
little max if most of you know Max he

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,839
doesn't generally make pieces really

296
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:50,360
small he likes to make some nice big

297
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,880
ones um this one is absolute Beauty U I

298
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,680
held it up to the light I took some

299
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,480
pictures I'll show you guys in the video

300
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,799
it just came out yellowy gold really

301
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,159
nice looking looking piece and it's a

302
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,399
dry pie

303
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,198
pretty large Sherlock like Reef thing

304
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,039
but and which volume smoke is this pce

305
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,120
smoke volume two smoke volume two I have

306
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,799
smoke volume one but it's a it would

307
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,278
take up a large chunk of yeah it's a

308
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,559
much bigger piece heavy

309
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,799
too I I I bet much heavier than any of

310
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,518
the pieces on this table more likely the

311
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,519
weight of that piece and that piece

312
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,879
combined we really should got some beine

313
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,320
yeah I don't hit uh straight hits very

314
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,278
AC like that I have to admit since I got

315
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,040
the

316
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,519
denail and you have the denail you can

317
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,639
pretty much put it in most of these

318
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,839
pieces which is a nice thing to just be

319
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,560
able to like hold out that bowl and

320
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,920
throw it into another 14 piece no it is

321
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,198
yeah it's fantastic actually in uh fit

322
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,360
in pretty much any of these although I

323
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,879
tried it does not fit into Singularity

324
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,800
well Singularity is you know you hit

325
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,720
Singularity how you don't start

326
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,479
modifying a piece like Singularity you

327
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,440
don't we should actually we should we

328
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,639
should hit Singularity sure sure you

329
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,839
want me to roll a couple of dabs so this

330
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,759
section

331
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:11,680
here is filled with I believe it's a on

332
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:14,079
gas or but argon Argon gas yes

333
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,838
and when placed

334
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,638
onto the the base it blows up you can

335
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,120
touch it you can move your finger around

336
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,079
it it's like Elric exactly it's like the

337
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,078
ball we'll set it up later on and do a

338
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,758
little video for you yeah but it's

339
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,638
beautiful but the pipe itself is just

340
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,240
this little guy here

341
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:37,159

rainbow yeah that's incredible yes super

343
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,519
beautiful when uh Marcel was talking

344
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,159
about it was something like

345
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,759
35 of these were needed just to get

346
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,159
these three to match um the piece is a

347
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,759
collaboration obviously by delene

348
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,759
Peralta Aon serson Marcel braa and

349
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,079
Robert

350
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:58,360
Mickelson so all yeah gods of the of the

351
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,278
glass game that's doubled so there's one

352
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,240
on the bottom as well as the

353
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,838
top of the

354
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,639
Dabber

355
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
oh I missed that fabulous so you can

356
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,320
take the one on the end and then when

357
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,719
you pass it back to me I'll just pull

358
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:16,040
that one off and yeah put it on the top

359
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,040
so for sure all right you got it

360
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,320
all really hard just great to hit all

361
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,319
these pieces this is just such a

362
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,680
beautiful piece of glass and I love the

363
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,639
way they created I one of the things

364
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,519
that Flav was didn't really talk about

365
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,120
that all these little pieces all these

366
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,000
little pieces

367
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:44,278
around each one of them comes off the

368
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,318
piece so I guess if you the piece is

369
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:50,278
very poetic in my opinion if I can just

370
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:53,559
give my quick opinion here is to have

371
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:57,159
every single piece a single a singular

372
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,239
entity to be able to come off and then

373
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:02,198
come together to create the larger art

374
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,680
form much like any of us has small

375
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:06,439
individual aspects that come together to

376
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,879
create the single

377
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,560
self I just feel this pipe on such a

378
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,159
different level it is such a true work

379
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:16,679
of art um it's definitely not your

380
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,519
everyday pipe and even these little all

381
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,719
these little guys yeah that I believe

382
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,440
that was Robert I would say it is it

383
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,800
reminds me of his art for sure uh he

384
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,360
does a lot of that and he does it well

385
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,120
and these are impeccable all these

386
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,399
little guys that go around the base

387
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,278
they're all joining hands and feet and

388
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,078
knees and they're making the pattern of

389
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,360
uh yeah it's just really quite quite an

390
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,359
interesting piece of

391
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:47,559
