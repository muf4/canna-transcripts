West has been using one of those for a

105
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:39,319
couple of years I was using one just the

106
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,079
other day in fact I got one for a

107
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:44,719
Christmas present from the great

108
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,120
neighbors and I got it like I guess of

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,720
course the mail came late but I mean

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,639
cold starting and then I got this thing

111
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,440
woohoo 642 dude I'm in the other boat

112
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,280
Johnny I've been using temptech pretty

113
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,879
religiously but now I'm just cold

114
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,119
starting because I find that when I

115
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,560
forget my temp teac I'm too annoyed I'm

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,199
like oh man I'm not going to get that

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
perfect dab and this that and the other

118
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,120
thing and they definitely are different

119
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,680
rips to heat your Banger up to like that

120
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,840
900 Degrees let it settle down and drop

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,879
that dab in is very different from a

122
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,719
cold start but cold start like you know

123
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,120
anything you can get the skills going

124
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,759
and towards you know I've been doing it

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,439
for the last three or four days and uh

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm sure I'll end up going back to my

127
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,120
Temp Tech eventually but it's nice that

128
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:31,638
we have these options back and forth we

129
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:36,240
go back and forth tried the have you

130
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,879
tried the new uh puffco Peak I did try

131
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
the new puffco Peak and I was impressed

132
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,199
you're very quiet Again Sam we got to

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,160
get you a little bit louder but yeah the

134
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,160
puffco peak the new one I guess it's the

135
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,120
puffco peak Pro is that correct yeah

136
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,840
that thing rips that thing like rips and

137
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,280
and don't get me wrong I also tried the

138
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:56,119
sort of middle version because you had

139
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:59,959
the puffco then you had companies create

140
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,519
um a kit for the puffco with a different

141
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,839
um heater a different coil all you know

142
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,120
different pieces that you could put in

143
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,598
that increased the quality of the puffco

144
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,000
but now puffco Pro is released and uh

145
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,399
yeah it's uh I was impressed with it

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,759
anyway I don't own one but uh it

147
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,478
surprised

148
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,840
me yeah I I may try i' I burned through

149
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:25,839
Four puffco Peaks so I kind of gave up

150
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,318
on that instant you know cuz I hear

151
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,000
people all the time I I uh I don't know

152
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,598
if you've heard of Clubhouse but it's a

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,478
new social media platform with live

154
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,959
discussions and a lot of people get on

155
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,120
there and they start talking about their

156
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,758
puffco peaks but you know I'll still

157
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,038
stick with my Mothership and my Dil

158
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,000
thanks that actually still works so

159
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,719
well I really like the puffco peak Pro

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,319
it's one of my chist I I put this thing

161
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,919
through the paces and tried to find what

162
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:59,319
could possibly be wrong with it and the

163
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,000
atomizer alone is such an improvement um

164
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,759
and the temperatures like you can

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,120
actually use like full melt in this

166
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
device and get it to the right

167
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,560
temperature um and then you can actually

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,439
hit plus 10 degrees if you start really

169
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,759
really low you can kind of bump up 10

170
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,719
plus degrees at a time um it's really

171
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,800
cool and then I got this little kind of

172
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,160
recycler for it which is really great I

173
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,560
mean it's puffco kind of nailed it with

174
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,680
this one in a way that um I was not

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,439
expecting um it's much better build

176
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,879
quality to me the most amazing thing

177
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:38,038
about the puffco uh Peak Pro was

178
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,479
actually that it with your iPhone or any

179
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:44,478
other smartphone you can program the

180
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:47,800
temperature so that a single hit starts

181
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,878
low and end High

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,680
exactly yep another great part that's

183
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,400
like a that's like a cold start right

184
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,639
you get you hit hit it a little bit you

185
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,279
get some of those turps you hit it a

186
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,360
little hotter little bit more you

187
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,598
increase the temperature that's uh

188
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,400
that's how the Trinity pen was designed

189
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,560
the Trinity pen was designed that if you

190
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,638
hold that button down for a little bit

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,478
you'll get that 500 degree low temp dab

192
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,960
you hold it down like a second full

193
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,598
cycle you're getting up to a 6650 dab

194
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,239
and if you did it four times you could

195
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,719
literally get your Johnny B like 800

196
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,519
fahrenheit hot red nail

197
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,120
RIP

198
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,240
just I was going to say I like I like

199
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,560
the third hit when I do the cold start

200
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,719
and hit it with the the torch again and

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,000
heat it up and C of course of course you

202
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,560
do you're

203
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,839
like you're the anomaly Johnny Be you

204
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,799
want that hot

205
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,159
rip I it's what works for me it's and

206
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,919
it's only at certain times because a lot

207
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,439
of times in the morning I really like

208
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,240
that turpy like cold start that's why I

209
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,839
like this tpom meter I like those

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,919
flavors in the morning but as the day

211
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,120
progresses I guess that that harder hit

212
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,639
is what hits me harder so the morning

213
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,240
those flavors wakes you up you're

214
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,278
feeling more energetic and as the day

215
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,440
progresses if it got some good pain then

216
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,559
of course I hit it hot and hey I'm right

217
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,120
back at it right there you go hey

218
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,439
welcome uh welcome best friend Farms is

219
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
in the

220
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,600
house oh he's just connecting his audio

221
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,958
I'm already like welcoming him when he's

222
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,959
not even like fully in but uh yeah we

223
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,479
got him hanging out I think I'm about to

224
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,078
do a little dab I was a little bit

225
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,720
nervous this morning I haven't felt that

226
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:29,759
energy for a while where I'm like am I

227
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,920
going to fail at this am I going to like

228
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,360
be not able to do this it was very

229
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,360
strange to not have my keyboard hook up

230
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,079
to my C computer that's never that's

231
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,639
never happened to me before so the joys

232
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:47,599
of Technology oh bro it's so true it's

233
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,639
so true just ridiculous yet on the same

234
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
flip side the joys of Technology the

235
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,439
very thing that allows us to get

236
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,839
together during these times of covid and

237
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,920
share our faces and our sort of

238
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,279
emotional contacts and our our words

239
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,000
together with all these different people

240
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,000
that are watching online I'm sure we

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,639
have uh gez I don't even know how many

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,159
we got in there right now but I'm sure

243
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,078
it's a couple

244
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:12,039
hundred hey at least at least it's not

245
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,639
Google meetups

246
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:18,599

Google Hangouts thing was like not good

248
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,959
that was fun honly remember being in

249
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:30,719
India you would have to book a phone

250
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:32,799
call to a 24 hours 48 hours of Advance

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
okay then you make your phone call and

252
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:39,000
it's screechy screechy

253
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:45,240
screechy oh my God I thought of you this

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,759
this week Marcus the Kum kumal uh

255
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,720
your in India has happening right

256
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:54,838
exactly wow I was there in

257
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,240
1998 so it'll be

258
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,959
um yeah that'll be some years ago now

259
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,159
holy smokes

260
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:05,439
uh I would advise anyone who wants to go

261
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,240
check out the Kumba in India to go check

262
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,399
it out it's definitely a neat reason to

263
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,320
have you know if you're going to India

264
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,679
it's a it's a good spot to kind of have

265
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,399
On Your Horizon it doesn't really affect

266
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,638
your rest of your traveling you can

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,720
obviously continue on from wherever it

268
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,959
is I don't know if it's in alabad jaur

269
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
varasi or haridwar but I'm sure it's

270
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:28,039
going to be in one of those four spots

271
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,759
because it has been uh for the last like

272
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,159
uh I don't know 4,000 years years or

273
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,879
however many thousands of years they've

274
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,399
been doing this

275
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,000
thing pretty cool pretty cool definitely

276
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,000
one of my eye openers amazing experience

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,039
for me smoking G uh smoking hash on the

278
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,039
on the ganes with the Babas out of the

279
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,519
Chillum and he would every day he must

280
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:52,599
have said this I mean honestly this man

281
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:55,159
was like skunkman Sam in a in a sadu all

282
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,399
he said was one more Chillum we are

283
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,799
making one more Chillum we are making

284
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,879

285
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:05,838
hanging out with Sam one more bong load

286
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,838

packing best friend Farms is going to

288
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,560
make another attempt to joining us I

289
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,599
guess he's uh also having maybe some

290
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,278
technical difficulties sometimes it

291
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,320
happens I can see he's trying to connect

292
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:22,720
his audio now we'll see how it goes

293
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,399
we'll see how it goes so on the news

294
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,879
they uh for the Kumba they uh they had a

295
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,360
sadu that seemed to be rolling in front

296
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,720
of procession the entire oh the rolling

297
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,120
the rolling sadu yeah there was one guy

298
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,040
and I met him at the Maha kumaa he had

299
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,759
rolled from the northern tip of India to

300
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,039
the southern tip of

301
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,679
India he he just rolled and you meet

302
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,399
people like this at the Kumba I met

303
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,278
another guy who was holding his arm up

304
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,159
for 12 years it had turned into a stone

305
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,120
and you could hang like heavy things off

306
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,519
of it because it was not like you you

307
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,519
couldn't bend this guy's arm it had

308
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,879
turned into a stone another guy had held

309
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,519
his hand closed for I don't even know

310
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,919
how long it was but his nails were

311
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,879
growing out the top of his hand from him

312
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,559
holding his hand in a fist he just had

313
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,919
Nails coming out of his hand and there

314
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,719
was a guy standing on one leg as well

315
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,838
and he had been standing on one leg I

316
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,839
want to say for at least a decade uh

317
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,079
just he had this kind of thing set up to

318
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,480
hold his leg up his leg was also a stone

319
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,319
uh it wasn't moving anymore if you

320
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,399
looked at it closely you were like oo

321
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,120
that doesn't look good definitely a trip

322
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
to just you know you know do things that

323
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,000
the mind tells you are impossible that's

324
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,440
the one thing I would say I had in

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,958
common that kept reoccurring itself with

326
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,760
my trip to India was that um I get I

327
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,879
just kept witnessing the impossible

328
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:46,838
things that I my North American brain

329
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,480
didn't believe could could happen maybe

330
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,600
also was wondering why you would want

331
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,159
that to happen but at the same time that

332
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,278
sort of you know just doing of this

333
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,159
strange thing to REM almost to remove

334
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,759
your Consciousness from your body cuz

335
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,399
got to imagine the amount of pain that

336
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,639
that would have after a while when that

337
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,759
limb was entropy and just dying and just

338
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,519
slowly you know not working anymore

339
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,278
definitely a trip not something oh what

340
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,600
Mark's Mark's saying he didn't get the

341
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,439
the zoom link

342
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,959
again that is so strange to me he's in

343
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,720
the chat with us and he's everyone else

344
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,599
gets it they all click on the link and

345
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,160
they come in but Mark is not getting the

346
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,639
link and I really don't know why that is

347
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:35,919
and even more important guess what my

348
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:40,278
keyboard has disconnected from

349
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:42,039
my oh no oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I got a

350
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,679
mouse I got a mouse I might be able to

351
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:47,120
do it with a mouse let's see let's

352
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,159
see oh look at that I could do it with

353
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,078
the mouse that is funny though that my

354
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,439
keyboard has done that

355
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:55,679
again might be an update you need to put

356
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,959
in need to do a b might be might be a

357
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,278
new new keyboard for for Mark coming in

358
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,919
here in the near future let's let's hope

359
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,720
we don't disconnect and that the mouse

360
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:05,439
will do everything that we need because

361
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,920
these are brand new batteries for this

362
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,560
keyboard anyway I just sent the the link

363
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,599
I feel that that's happening lately and

364
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,879
I'm not sure why like how could Mark be

365
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,120
in a group chat with all of us and not

366
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,000
get the link to the show whereas

367
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,360
everyone else clicked on the very same

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,679
link I sent to the very same chat room I

369
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,079
don't like that I'll tell you it took me

370
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,198
it took me a couple of minutes to sort

371
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:34,799
out because there was a thread of emails

372
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:37,719
and in the initial the first email that

373
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,078
you meant that you sent saying that you

374
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,800
wanted to do a church this morning is

375
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,159
the one that has the link in it and all

376
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,479
the subsequent emails did not have it so

377
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,600
you got to go back to that first one and

378
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,800
open it all the way open and there it is

379
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,079
the Z the zoom link that's what I Marcus

380
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,679
you know you know what it is Marcus it's

381
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:01,599
the DEA and the dark cannabis web are

382
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,638
trying to Mark away from our knowledge

383
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,600
that's what it is it's the science it's

384
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,399
the anti-science mafia once again just

385
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,600
doing it ah come on hash church we got

386
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,278
to get these anti-h churches you know

387
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
what's funny is that 20 years ago we

388
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,679
would have been all over that [ __ ] and

389
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,759
it would have been for sure our belief

390
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:23,559
and it probably would have been also

391
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:25,680
true so it's not too far uh of a reality

392
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:29,559
that we've kind of come out of here but

393
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:32,000
now we got Dr Mark joining I think my

394
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,679
keyboard's set back up I think

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,559
everything is going as it

396
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:40,039
should must be

397
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,439
a must be a plot it's a

398
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:45,318
conspiracy uh I don't see him though I

399
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,680
don't see do oh he's trying to join and

400
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:49,519

436
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,240

a nice chill Sunday you know I've been

439
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,320
kind of like regardless of whether or

440
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,519
not we have a plan or a disc

441
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,839
or something really juicy to talk about

442
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,720
I thought you know what people have

443
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,918
really been digging the consistency of

444
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,159
the last two or 3 weeks of us kind of

445
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,038
joining we don't have to commit to four

446
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,320
hours every day but if it comes and it

447
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:46,839
happens and a natural conversation seems

448
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,879
to uh develop like it usually does um

449
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:52,279

509
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:19,079
of like before the conert people sort of

510
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,158

00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,839
getting ready for the show getting ready

515
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,119
for the show is sometimes more fun than

516
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,839
the show itself well it takes a lot

517
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,879
longer when you're traveling from like

518
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,759
the center of Canada and driving to some

519
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,240
venue on the east coast and you had to

520
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,319
get tickets and you had to cross a

521
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,079
border and you had to like break down

522
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,720
and get pulled over by cops and almost

523
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,000
busted and then you got ripped off but

524
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,440
then you got good weed and then you

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,880
ended up at the concert venue but you

526
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
had a flat tire but then you found some

527
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,039
grilled cheeses you ate some mushrooms

528
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,440

554
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,200
classic and they're great because we

555
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,839
relate to them you know the easiest I

556
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,000
ever got over the Border here in British

557
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,558
Columbia by far cuz I've been trying and

558
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,278
trying and trying and just constantly

559
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:10,119
getting denied but when fish came up and

560
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:13,278
I can't remember if it was like 96 or

561
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:15,519
seven or eight but one of those years I

562
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,558
was just like I was at the show I was

563
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,038
like kind of tripping and it was just

564
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:20,399
like everyone was like all right man

565
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,558
we're going you know it's like we got to

566
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
go back we got to go Portland's tomorrow

567
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,720
you know like I'm like all right well

568
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,360
you know what I'm [ __ ] coming and I

569
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,319
just got in my car and drove with this

570
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,278
procession of freaks and at the time I

571
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,079
looked really like the least amount of a

572
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,679
freak and I was in a brand new rent a

573
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:43,158
car so I'm I want to tell you I got

574
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,759
through there so quick every single

575
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,960
person that was at that show that was

576
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,919
wearing patchwor clothes and dreaded out

577
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,519
and like just super flying their freak

578
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,038
flag they were all pulled over when I

579
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,918
drove through I could see them all

580
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:57,519
getting torn apart by their Vans none of

581
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,038
them cared because they're all Americans

582
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,679
anyway and they can't be denied into

583
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,798
their country but I'm the Canadian and I

584
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,320
can be denied into the country I don't

585
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:07,278
really care about being denied into

586
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,599
America other than the fact that I

587
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,839
really want to see the show tomorrow in

588
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,278
Portland you know from the actual venue

589
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,639
not from

590
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:18,400
someone's uh recording like a month

591
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,720
later

592
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,159
so that's what it's up for me

593
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,240
unnecessary the whole [ __ ] border

594
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,799
hold down is just such a bunch of

595
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,679
[ __ ] man it's just it is it's a it's

596
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:33,480
a bummer for sure it's definitely a

597
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,880
bummer for us to have between our two

598
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,720
countries we were talking about it the

599
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,120
other day how great a country from like

600
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,079
the tip of Alaska you know maybe down to

601
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,359
like Guatemala or Venezuela or something

602
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,599
just have a west coast country we've all

603
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,479
dreamed about it in the past no borders

604
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,000
you know get Elon to build some crazy

605
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,519
tubes that just we can blast down there

606
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,720
in like four hours or whatever going 600

607
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,278
miles an hour that would be pretty sweet

608
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,000
but uh you know we got what got got to

609
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,558
do got to got to do the best we can with

610
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,278
what we have and uh it doesn't stop us

611
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,759
from dreaming because uh had we not been

612
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,119
dreaming all these years I'm certain

613
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,960
that my company wouldn't have been

614
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:17,079
signing uh contracts with provinces for

615
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,360
hash uh Supply and I'm sure that etan

616
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:20,839
wouldn't still be doing what he's been

617
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,319
doing for the last uh you know 20 to 30

618
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,000
years and and many others so clearly the

619
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,839
things that we've congratulations on

620
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,919
that markk I know that that's no easy

621
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:34,158
feat and being able to you know get your

622
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,520
product into the you know uh masses uh

623
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,039
you know or at least having that ability

624
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,038
to grow that market share is just an

625
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,839
unbelievable opportunity but remember

626
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,960
what they always say be careful what you

627
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,439
wish for now a lot of people need your

628
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,679
hash and it's like wow I mean when you

629
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,440
scale up production to say one to say

630
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,080
like multiple kilograms it's one thing

631
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,000
but when you're now doing that at

632
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:02,158
hundreds of kilograms that is just

633
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,798
yeah that's off to you I mean and a

634
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,399
responsibility like you said it's a

635
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,359
responsibility it's not just about

636
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:10,038
supplying one time it's about supplying

637
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,240
and then consistently supplying and

638
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:15,079
making sure that you're taking care of

639
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,440
both your medical patients and your

640
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,079
wreck Market because I do see you know

641
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,720
some difficulties in having both of

642
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,879
those markets I see a lot of companies

643
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,038
kind of go

644
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,480
like just right right to wreck Med can

645
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,640
be difficult you have to deal with

646
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,720
patients there's all these other things

647
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,278
and I feel like I I don't like the idea

648
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,640
of the med patients getting the short

649
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:36,359
end of the stick on all of that so it's

650
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,240
definitely a discussion and it's

651
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,079
something that we're going to pay

652
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,120
attention to we want to make sure that

653
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,359
uh that everyone has access GMP

654
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,678
compliant Mark like is it is it going to

655
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:48,319
be GMP compliant if it's not there it

656
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,440
looks GMP compant eventually absolutely

657
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,918
eventually we've got GMP um Consultants

658
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,558
that we speak with on the regular and uh

659
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,840
it's definitely you know gmp's serious

660
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,798
business it's great to get into to that

661
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,199
pharmaceutical market and into you know

662
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,679
markets like Germany and and parts of of

663
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,600
Europe like that but at the same time

664
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,798
you know you want to talk about needing

665
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:14,759
a Runway to create a GMP facility the

666
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:16,918
costs are so over the top they're

667
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,000
already over the top with our you know I

668
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,440
don't want to say over regulated

669
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,398
industry but it is it is very regulated

670
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,240
I think we look at it as way over

671
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:28,199
regulated because of how underregulation

672
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,480
our food and our water and our air tends

673
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,960
to be people are just so it's so easy to

674
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,640
poison either of those three things and

675
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,319
you can profit off that poisoning

676
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,159
substantially and so people in the

677
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,000
Cannabis industry are kind of like why

678
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,039
do we have to be so regulated and it's

679
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,640
kind of like you know what don't worry

680
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,278
about it it's good for the patience on

681
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,840
that sense we don't need to be over

682
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,079
regulated from the perspective of

683
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,038
packaging and all that [ __ ] but when

684
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,960
it comes to the over regulations of

685
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:55,119
certificate of analysis making sure we

686
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,960
test being extremely extremely sensitive

687
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:01,000
about what if any pesticides are ondes

688
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,079
are are being allowed and all of that

689
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,519
sort of thing I love the sort of over

690
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:09,359
regulated uh that side of it I dislike

691
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,079
the over regulated aspect of you know

692
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,759
some of the rest of it that comes into

693
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:15,038
play where you just get painted into

694
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:18,879
these corners and you just got to you

695
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:21,278
know do your best to uh to to to get out

696
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,240
of those corners and uh you know to

697
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:27,000
create this thing that has not been yet

698
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,880
created it's it's just still scaling up

699
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
it's just still happening so I would

700
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,440
like to tip my hat off truly to all the

701
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,720
companies uh both in the US and Canada

702
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,840
that have managed to get products to the

703
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,079
market it really is a long and Winding

704
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,639
Road um but it's worthwhile sticking to

705
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,879
it Marcus could I ask a question so when

706
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,200
you're when you're using all that water

707
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,919
are are you are you recovering anything

708
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,399
from your water because I would assume

709
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,080
Again part of your GMP would be to try

710
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,038
to you know again standardize a process

711
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,480
to make sure that you're getting

712
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,158
everything that you need to get and I

713
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,519
would also just think from a a sanitary

714
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,720
point of view sending hashw water down

715
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,798
the sink may not be the most you know

716
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,798
best you know route for its sanitation

717
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:16,480
so is what what can you comment on like

718
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,000
the discharge of your water well we're

719
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,919
definitely looking at it you know we're

720
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,798
building a quiver as you know so the

721
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,840
whole purpose of Embark was to build a

722
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:26,158
quiver so when I when I started the

723
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,359
company with my partners part of me was

724
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,200
wanting to stick with my ego and like

725
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:31,158
you know what I'm the solventless guy

726
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,679
and that's what we're going to this is

727
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,799
going to be all about bubble and that's

728
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,679
what we're going to do because that's

729
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:37,158
all I've been doing and I I sort of

730
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,919
thought of these different conversations

731
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,880
I've had I think of my relationship with

732
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,600
Dr Mark I think of my relationship with

733
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
Mike West some of my you know chemist

734
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,918
friends that understand that it's just

735
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,960
chemistry and it's just molecules and

736
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,919
chemicals are everywhere and everything

737
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,000
and that sort of helped me to the point

738
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,480
where it was like you know what if we're

739
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,839
going to build this company I don't mind

740
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,720
having a big solventless division but I

741
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,398
really believe the quiver is going to be

742
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,159
important important and it comes into

743
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:03,278
importance with your question when you

744
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:05,840
start deciding look how are you going to

745
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:08,079
recover the say the tpin or the phenols

746
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,879
out of your Waters uh after you've

747
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,240
washed it is there anything that you can

748
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,600
do for that if you've got a solventless

749
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,000
setup that's going to be a little bit

750
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,558
more difficult but if you've got a seven

751
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,159
modalities of extraction you've got CO2

752
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,599
and hydrocarbons and ethanol and dual

753
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:27,159
solvents and turpine extraction and salt

754
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,918
uh dry sift rosin and bubble hash now

755
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,640
you have these alties that you would

756
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,960
require so we are setting things up so

757
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,559
certain things that happen in the

758
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,000
solventless room that we don't want to

759
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:41,678
just discharge out can be saved and

760
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,240
eventually go over to that other uh you

761
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,640
know side of things so things like

762
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,159
pressing raws and bags things like you

763
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:52,360
know not wanting to put the 220 into

764
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:55,000
your uh final product but it's 40% or

765
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,638
30% you know it's it's contaminated but

766
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,440
it still has resin in it you know the

767
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,599
cut the client doesn't want it mied into

768
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,080
their A or B grade but we don't want to

769
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,918
throw it out so all of these little

770
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,079
things we're definitely thinking

771
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,759
consciously and uh we definitely don't

772
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,720
want to be just tossing things away

773
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,119
unnecessarily because we understand the

774
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,798
value of the plant so we're working on

775
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:17,000
it is the best answer I can give you and

776
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:20,558
I'll I'll explain my answers with Embark

777
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,960
um like I did on my live show yesterday

778
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,278
because we're going to go public

779
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,880
eventually because I'm a Founder because

780
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,200
I'm a deep part of this uh company and

781
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,799
because we're so regulated in Canada I

782
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,919
have to be very careful with what I say

783
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:38,558
and don't say and my problem is I don't

784
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,000
know really what I can't say and so I've

785
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,158
always been so transparent and so open

786
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,720
with everything you know my partners are

787
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:47,840
like don't like please just like be

788
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,960
careful and so obviously I don't want to

789
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,398
put um my company at risk or my license

790
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,600
at risk but we are making way to become

791
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,319
more and more transparent without

792
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,959
putting our license at risk so that's

793
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,439
all I'll say about that but

794
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,079
congratulations to the whole team at

795
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,558
Embark uh they have been kicking ass

796
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:09,199
taking names and kicking ass Mar Marcus

797
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,599
a great trick that I have found is you

798
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,080
take a lawyer and then you transplant

799
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,558
them into your hip so that everywhere

800
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,240
you go you have somebody who's making

801
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,319
sure you're safe so I might go for a

802
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,960
lawyer hip transplant for your own

803
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,798
protection for embark is what I'm

804
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,798
suggesting you know dude I know that's

805
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,918
like funny but I'm seriously considering

806
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:32,278
it

807
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,960
well it is funny but it is side of not

808
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:37,278
saying anything you know it's difficult

809
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,960
especially when you have an online you

810
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,440
know show like hash church and and you

811
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,798
know people know you as being such a

812
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,360
great resource for information and it's

813
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:51,720
it's difficult to say no I've had to do

814
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,158
that too Marcus it's like impossible

815
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,038
because because the the the the

816
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,120
community is so hungry for information

817
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,119
you know and and and they'll come you

818
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,558
with such passion and want to know

819
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,839
everything and you can't always divulge

820
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:09,678
everything because part of the value

821
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:12,678
you're capturing for for embark is for

822
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,880
yeah a a group of investors who well

823
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,440
that's just it opportunity and you give

824
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,278
away so much that you really create a

825
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,759
level and I mean I've had this happen

826
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,558
with my own friends that where they

827
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:24,440
become so entitled because I've been

828
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,960
giving them so much that they now

829
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,798
actually expect for me to give them

830
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,079
certain things and it's had it's I've

831
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,679
had difficulties with friendships forget

832
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,798
about like complete and total strangers

833
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,320
with just an entitlement that says you

834
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:41,398
need to to to show me this or to tell me

835
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,200
this and I'm like listen like please

836
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,000
understand my position like try to have

837
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,038
empathy for me I'm not evil I'm not

838
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,638
trying to keep things from people but my

839
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,359
goodness if you're truly my friend you

840
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:53,079
would have an understanding of where I'm

841
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,558
coming from and understand that it's not

842
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:57,798
to keep things you know it's that I'm

843
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,759
I've I've created a situation for myself

844
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:03,000
myself and now it's my my responsibility

845
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,398
to navigate

846
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,079
it well and know that whatever it is

847
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:11,719
shared on hash Church uh is patented by

848
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,320
Sam already well that's it he's got the

849
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,398
pen and paper there and he's just

850
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,320
patenting away it's wonderful I did see

851
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,638
recently that next Leaf released a

852
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,800
patent for water extraction and I'm very

853
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,280
excited to see what is going to go on

854
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,320
with that talk about previously

855
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,240
published art there's already been a

856
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,919
patent that's existed for from Reinhardt

857
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:36,239
Delp from 1997 till 1990 or 2018 I

858
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:37,398
believe his patent fin number do you

859
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,279
have the patent number you could share

860
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:43,679
with me um I could find it for you real

861
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,760
soon by just punching in next Leaf so

862
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,280
for everybody out there you know like a

863
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,679
lot of people have been asking me about

864
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,040
patents because I got a couple and you

865
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,039
always have to look at the most the key

866
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,358
thing in the patent always look at claim

867
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,039
number

868
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:00,559
one claim number one claim number one is

869
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,119
what they're claiming that's usually

870
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,440
like their main thing and if you look

871
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,760
and if you can figure out a way around

872
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,960
claim one well and it's probably not

873
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,320
going to hold up and there's still no

874
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,679
precedent in the United States for uh

875
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,599
cannabis space patents to hold up in an

876
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,480
infringement case against it so there's

877
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,838
still a lot of questions about whether

878
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,358
or not you want to patent anything at

879
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:29,078
all you know why

880
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:32,559
would a lawsuit now right between GW

881
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:35,119
Pharmaceutical and canopy I think right

882
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,159
I think I think I heard about this on

883
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,838
the the biscon thing but if if memory

884
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:45,039
serves me correctly people have been

885
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:48,559
using CO2 extraction for Botanicals for

886
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:51,000
for for a long time so where is the

887
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:54,799
invention on using it for cannabis I I

888
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,760
don't know well someone patented someone

889
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,599
patented it a long time ago Mike West

890
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,000
was the one telling me about this and he

891
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:04,599
sold it for

892
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,639
$10 and 1% and canopy bought that patent

893
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,559
by buying a bunch of companies up that

894
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,279
happen to hold that CO2 patent and like

895
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,318
anything I think most people were just

896
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,599
cuz it was patented a while ago it's an

897
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:18,279
older patent and so I guess you know

898
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,838
people were like well it's there's no

899
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,079
value to that and then canopy bought it

900
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,639
and kind of some lawyer probably saw it

901
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,079
in their portfolio and was like holy

902
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:28,039
[ __ ] like I let's look into this and

903
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,800
yeah I wish Mike West was around he has

904
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,519
a little bit more information am I

905
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,960
missing something there are companies

906
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,719
that sell CO2 extraction machines I all

907
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,960
kinds of people out there doing CO2

908
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,399
extraction how is well think of think of

909
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,159
how many people to one company think of

910
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,119
how many people were making bub saying

911
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,719
using water to make coffee is

912
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,519
proprietary to Mr coffee or something

913
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,078
agreed I'm 100% in agree and I I felt

914
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:54,559
like it the first time around when I was

915
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,720
in my lawsuit with Reinhardt Delp and

916
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,119
found myself for 5 years in a lawsuit

917
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,239
because I was selling Bubble Bags

918
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,599
teaching people how to make water hash

919
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,879
and here's this guy saying well I

920
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,640
patented that in

921
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,760
1997 before I showed Mila you know which

922
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,920
I guess Mila maybe didn't know because

923
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,640
she showed the process to Mark Rose and

924
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,079
Elden a couple of days later and they

925
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,078
were sitting there looking at it and

926
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,000
Elden was like two five gallon shaped uh

927
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,119
nylon bags with screen bottoms and

928
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,400
you've got the same thing Mark Rose is

929
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,760
sitting there call going it's the it's

930
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,519
the isolator it's using ice to isolate

931
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,599
it's the ice o lator he named the

932
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,159
product he manufactured the product

933
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,440
Elden invented the product Mila sold the

934
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,440
product and that's really was the

935
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,880
beginning of Reinhardt Delp you know

936
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,480
kind of losing control of his of his

937
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,640
market cap I came along tried to sell

938
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,159
isolator bags it didn't work out so we

939
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:52,039
made our own with extra bags and extra

940
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,679
screens and that became bubble bags and

941
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:56,279
that's how I ended up in a nice little

942
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:59,519
fiveyear lawsuit with Reinhardt Delp

943
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,240
happily paid him figures out which I was

944
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,599
very happy to do because that was the

945
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,399
honest right thing to do Mila was kind

946
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,920
of trying to portray that she was the

947
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,519
one that got screwed in reality it was

948
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,119
Reinhardt Delp who got screwed uh and I

949
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:15,280
made sure that he got paid for that uh

950
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,480
and that I paid for him for royalties

951
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,960
for the entire time my company was alive

952
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,599
from 1999 right off into the future so I

953
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,280
felt pretty good about that but it is

954
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,800
interesting how the history can be

955
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,119
Rewritten for a very long time nobody

956
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,839
knew Reinhardt was involved whatsoever

957
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,000
they just thought of me as a guy that

958
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,599
came along and stole the isolator idea I

959
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,480
would also like to say that I took care

960
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,280
of Elden by giving him free tickets to

961
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,800
the legends of hash parties and I

962
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,040
also took on Mark Rose as my

963
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,800
manufacturer the very same guy who named

964
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,639
isolator bags and and manufactured them

965
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,800
he ended up hitting me up a couple years

966
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:54,159
later because I guess Mila decided to

967
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,880
get Turkish immigrants to make the bags

968
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,598
instead of the Nepali people that were

969
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,720
doing it in Nepal with Mark R he felt a

970
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,960
little screwed that pushed him over to

971
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,919
my camp and we've been working happily

972
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,159
ever since for about 20 plus years so

973
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,519
there's a little history of water

974
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:10,199
extraction for you right there maybe

975
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,880
there'll be new history 20 years from

976
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,078
now with people like next leaf and their

977
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,318
patents I don't know how it plays out

978
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,480
Mark but I'll tell you patent court is

979
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:20,559
terrifying you think that it's going to

980
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,039
play out one way but it never does and

981
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,799
the judge can lean any way he wants and

982
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,000
you can still end up burning hundreds of

983
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,200
thousands of dollars in the courts you

984
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,039
know with the case over years so my

985
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:34,318
advice is that companies get together

986
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,358
they work things out uh don't bring

987
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:37,920
lawyers into it because they are the

988
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,799
ones that will they're the ones that

989
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,559
will take your money and uh they're

990
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,480
they're almost like secret Partners on

991
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:46,239
both sides of the table they want to be

992
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,400
difficult back and forth because that's

993
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,598
where they make their money

994
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,920
unfortunately also that only only last

995
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:58,880
for 20 years and then uh you have no

996
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,440
protection exactly well well said Sam

997
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,680
that is a big big big big deal and it's

998
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,440
uh it's something that I don't think a

999
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,719
lot of people pay attention to now I'm

1000
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,200
certain there is methodologies maybe Dr

1001
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:12,318
Mark knows where you can extend patents

1002
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,919
by filing paperwork and doing certain

1003
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,199
things depending on the situation I

1004
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,318
could be wrong but yeah yeah so what

1005
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:20,598
what happens is is when you file a

1006
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,920
patent sometimes you file very very

1007
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,119
broadly and when the patent office gets

1008
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,800
it they basically divide it into what

1009
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,200
are called divisional patents and those

1010
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,880
patents are individually prosecuted and

1011
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,039
will grant individually so like for

1012
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,519
example like with the hydrogenation they

1013
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,279
recognize that there were multiple

1014
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:42,480
inventions there there was the process

1015
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,800
there was the composition there was the

1016
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,880
you know a a method to control tumor

1017
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,318
growth there's various claims that you

1018
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,280
could

1019
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:54,559
make and each of those claims in and of

1020
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,000
itself can become its own issued patent

1021
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,039
and so as certain claims are easy to get

1022
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,079
because there's no prior art like

1023
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:05,159
composition of matter hhca for example

1024
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,039
there was no hhca until we disclosed it

1025
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:10,679
so that was an easy you know patn to get

1026
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,880
it was an easy to get that one but other

1027
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,679
things were we had hhca combination with

1028
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,760
other canabo well the other canono were

1029
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:21,960
known so now you're talking about having

1030
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,119
to evaluate the prior art which is

1031
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,800
relevant here versus not relevant in the

1032
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,920
other easy to get cases so you're easy

1033
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,800
to get cases or they're the first cases

1034
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,559
that are going to issue but then what

1035
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,680
you do is you file what's called a

1036
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,599
continuation in part and the

1037
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:42,118
continuation in part is still the

1038
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:45,200
original patent date when you originally

1039
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,599
filed and you're just basically adding

1040
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,559
claims onto that patent without changing

1041
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,359
the body or the description of the

1042
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:56,239
patent you could add additional claims

1043
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,960
and keep on getting those as continued

1044
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,879
issued that basically extends the

1045
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,599
lifetime because every time you get an

1046
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,960
issued patent that's another 20 years 20

1047
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,640
years 20 years 20 years 20 years right I

1048
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,318
don't know why we don't respect sorry go

1049
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,559
ahead no I was just gonna stop by just

1050
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:17,119
saying in the Cannabis industry it's

1051
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,799
likely that you know a lot of the you

1052
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,519
know sort of secret things that are done

1053
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,880
can be can be the form of intellectual

1054
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:26,559
property rather than a patent would be

1055
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,838
something called a trade secret so a

1056
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,119
trade secret is kind of like the recipe

1057
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,960
to make Coca-Cola right the six

1058
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,880
ingredients to Coca-Cola are printed on

1059
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,720
the side of Coca-Cola can right so

1060
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,200
everyone sees what the ingredients are

1061
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:43,399
the whole Magic is is the recipe and how

1062
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,519
to make it right so that's usually like

1063
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,480
most of like like if you're taking

1064
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,719
proprietary genetics and doing some type

1065
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,920
of you know either a solventless

1066
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,558
extraction or solvent based extraction

1067
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,599
but making a particular like a live

1068
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:02,839
resin or a or a particular product that

1069
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,440
could be made reproducibly time and time

1070
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:06,679
again and Mark you know the whole

1071
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,519
premise of

1072
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:12,799
GMP good manufacturing practices is

1073
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:15,280
being able to do something consistently

1074
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,760
time and time again and when I say

1075
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,079
consistently again with cannabis things

1076
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,040
change so you have to basically set an

1077
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,920
error bar or an understand a tolerance

1078
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,440
of what your product specifications are

1079
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,680
so if it has this much much mercine it

1080
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,920
meets specification but if there's not

1081
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:35,399
mercing it doesn't meet specifications

1082
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,680
right and it could go on to basically be

1083
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,559
another product turn that stuff into

1084
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,558
distillate or something but you know GMP

1085
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,839
is is again it's in all the other

1086
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:48,040
Industries for food ingredients for the

1087
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,719
ingredients that we use in our medicines

1088
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:52,279
for the ingredients we use in the

1089
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:55,078
cosmetics and personal care product

1090
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,760
Industries so these are all the adjacent

1091
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,760
industries that were basically already

1092
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,720
using good manufacturing practices now

1093
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,520
this will spill over into the Cannabis

1094
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,598
industry and it's just really good to

1095
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:09,239
see because again when you're doing

1096
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,280
small scale hash production you could

1097
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:15,318
see the nuances of how this thing could

1098
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,200
come out very very different even on a

1099
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:21,159
small scale so imagine now committing

1100
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:23,719
you know hundreds of thousands of grams

1101
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:26,440
or liters now you're talking about you

1102
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:27,639
know a lot of material being processed

1103
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,358
at any one

1104
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:33,118
particular time oh trust me I know it

1105
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:35,558
well it's terrifying there's very very

1106
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,480
small numbers like if you get a skew

1107
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,160
it's got to be between this percentage

1108
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,400
of of THC they're not thank God they're

1109
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,199
not doing it with Tarpin yet like oh you

1110
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,838
don't have enough mercy and that fails

1111
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:49,159
it's like but if you put something into

1112
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:52,039
your skew that falls below or goes above

1113
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,838
your THC percentage you know you you

1114
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:55,519
can't sell it under that skew anymore

1115
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,400
you'd have to either make a new skew or

1116
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,960
you'd have to have another skew you made

1117
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,720
that it fits into or and so you have to

1118
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,880
do all of these these different things

1119
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:06,239
it's definitely a very complex system

1120
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,920
but at the same time this is all we

1121
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,719
wanted for the longest time stop

1122
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,318
segregating us let us assimilate into

1123
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:16,159
society let cannabis be a part of the

1124
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:17,920
world and a big part of that this is

1125
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,199
what comes along with it like of course

1126
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,200
if it's going to be a big part of the

1127
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,679
world and it's not going to be

1128
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:24,838
segregated into the closet anymore well

1129
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:26,358
then it's going to be like everything

1130
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:29,480
else in the world and it's going to fall

1131
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:31,400
into all of those other sort of you know

1132
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,079
modalities which is like yeah we have to

1133
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,639
do this properly it has to be like I

1134
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:36,359
know you've been doing this for 30 years

1135
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,558
and it's been fine and safe but it's

1136
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:41,199
like we do this for your medicine we do

1137
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,760
this for your food and um we're going to

1138
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,639
do it with with cannabis as well so

1139
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,559
thank goodness that we'll never you know

1140
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:48,920
for me as long as they never take away

1141
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,240
the ability for us to grow

1142
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,680
recreationally and grow medically so

1143
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:55,719
anyone that wants to put the time and

1144
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:58,159
the energy can still access cannabis and

1145
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:01,118
the resins exactly the way they want but

1146
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,838
on the flip side for the other 80 plus

1147
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,358
per of the population and it's probably

1148
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,558
higher they should be able to go and buy

1149
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:10,639
it like they do their milk and their

1150
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,599
pasta and anything else and when they

1151
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,759
buy that they should be insured that

1152
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,599
it's been created safely and that it's

1153
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,440
not going to have a bunch of a bunch of

1154
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,119
crap in because you would not believe

1155
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,400
the awareness you need to have to set up

1156
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:27,480
a hash facility to make hash to make

1157
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,079
sure nothing in that room is shedding

1158
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,039
nothing is releasing or chipping or you

1159
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,119
know contaminating your final product

1160
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:37,440
and I can't tell you where I've seen

1161
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,480
that in different Labs I've seen it in

1162
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,280
in things that you could not possibly

1163
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,679
imagine you know putting putting your

1164
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,040
books down on top of a of a deep freezer

1165
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:48,879
and then the deep freezer slowly

1166
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,719
chipping and releasing paint you know uh

1167
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,440
box cutters that instead of plastic

1168
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,759
bodies have metal bodies that have been

1169
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,200
painted yellow and red and black and

1170
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,119
every time you put those down they chip

1171
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,799
little bits of paint I've seen this in

1172
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,960
Labs before so once you become that

1173
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,680
crazy person in the lab running the

1174
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,639
facility and keeping all of this stuff

1175
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:11,558
from happening you just can't believe

1176
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,799
how easy it is for microbials and for

1177
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,760
contaminations that shed off of

1178
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,519
different things to that you know that

1179
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,720
you're trying to keep out you become the

1180
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:24,079
ultimate goal tender you're just trying

1181
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,879
to keep this stuff out and it it it

1182
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,599
becomes a real challenge the bigger you

1183
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,160
get and the the the higher up you scale

1184
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,838
yeah I agree Marcus I went through that

1185
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:34,159
um here in the state of Massachusetts

1186
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:37,279
where I got

1187
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,519
so wild with it that I I I had to look

1188
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,119
at the air filters because I was

1189
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,960
finding things that were falling and set

1190
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:45,760
settling and I looked at our hide off

1191
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,358
rotovap one day coming in from the

1192
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,119
solventless side and I just like wiped

1193
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,558
on it and I was like that's in my half

1194
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:54,920
yeah that's it right here you know we've

1195
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,839
been scoping this thing for like a while

1196
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,318
this is before we even released anything

1197
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:01,838
we just we narrowed everything down and

1198
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:04,719
really cut all the the different nuances

1199
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:08,078
out to really just get the room clean

1200
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:10,279
and I mean I mean as as clean like eat

1201
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,640
off the floor clean you know oh yeah

1202
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,400
Hospital clean hos exactly Hospital

1203
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:17,480
clean and that's how we that's how I

1204
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,318
operate um and I know that's you how you

1205
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,159
operate mark because it's you have to be

1206
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:22,519
that in tune with your it's not only

1207
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:24,239
your tools but it's also your

1208
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:25,519
environment it's the things you bring

1209
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,959
into your environment the things that

1210
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,440
you're wearing during your during the

1211
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,960
time in your your environment and they

1212
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,519
all play a major role in how the your

1213
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:37,358
end product really comes out because we

1214
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:40,239
don't have these solvents and these

1215
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,440
these vessels to to keep this stuff

1216
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,118
contained we we very much deal with a

1217
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:48,039
lot of the still what I call the

1218
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:49,960
elements um even when we're inside so um

1219
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:52,000
totally well that that's just when you

1220
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,559
see that the company like Marcus's has

1221
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,159
made the commitment to gowning every

1222
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,798
employee and every employee in there has

1223
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:02,639
got booties on and they're gown from

1224
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:05,280
head to toe and a guy like me fuzzy

1225
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,920
beardy guy like me uhuh that's

1226
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,880
completely all covered up I'm completely

1227
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,838
covered up here you don't want to get

1228
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,960
any one bit of contamination into those

1229
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:16,558
rooms and that's it and the thing is is

1230
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,720
like when you look at when you look at

1231
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:23,359
GMP facilities you can tell because they

1232
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:27,000
have to be clean from from from floor to

1233
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:29,519
ceiling any horizontal surface that can

1234
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,639
collect dust so you could imagine like

1235
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:35,199
some of your Labs you see where they

1236
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:37,440
have like venting coming in or there's

1237
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,960
duck work coming in or there's

1238
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,519
electrical [ __ ] hanging from the ceiling

1239
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,199
uhuh that doesn't work in GMP that's all

1240
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:48,559
got to be enclosed it all has to be

1241
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:50,838
basically stainless steel bleach [ __ ]

1242
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,960
clean like it there's no there's no

1243
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:55,440
compromise in any horizontal surface

1244
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,079
like if you have like I don't know like

1245
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,760
let's say you just have like a cond it

1246
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:01,318
that comes through your lab and

1247
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,280
basically there's a you have to have a

1248
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:07,000
procedure on how to clean that surface

1249
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,000
and a record of how often that surface

1250
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,960
is clean because that surface could be

1251
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,400
the source of contamination down below

1252
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,559
you're so right and and it's you have to

1253
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,079
get that detailed Mark and and that's

1254
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,760
unbelievable like Marcus said we all

1255
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,440
wanted this for years I mean this is I'm

1256
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,880
excited to have these challenges it

1257
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,798
makes me better for it and it makes our

1258
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,280
process better for it and allows us to

1259
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:31,838
look at different parts of the process

1260
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,440
in ways that um we might not otherwise

1261
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,440
look at it well let's pass on some value

1262
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,280
to our to our viewers right now because

1263
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,559
there is one thing I can give you that I

1264
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,000
came across that I decided was not going

1265
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,680
to happen in my lab and it might it

1266
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,880
might surprise a bunch of people because

1267
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:48,358
I see people customizing these I see

1268
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,798
people doing this all the time and it's

1269
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:54,400
a conversation I've wanted to bring up

1270
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:56,039
for a while and this is of course the um

1271
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,480
the cozies that are placed on the

1272
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:59,400
outside of the the buckets on the

1273
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,559
outside of the washers on the outside of

1274
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,440
the 65 gallon stainless steel uh tubs

1275
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,960
that pure pressure cells these although

1276
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,400
can be cleaned unless you have someone

1277
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:13,519
who understands the Sops and Protocols

1278
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,240
of a GMP facility they will never get

1279
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:19,239
those things cleaned properly and if you

1280
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:20,679
simply do a swab test on your cozies

1281
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:23,239
that are sitting on the outside of your

1282
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:25,798
buckets you will find the microbial

1283
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:28,399
content is high higher than you want it

1284
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:31,000
to be and absolutely a vector for

1285
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,079
potential contamination in your final

1286
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,679
product you're folding your bags over

1287
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,920
top of that cozy and your bags are

1288
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:42,159
touching that cozy that is continually

1289
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,680
soaking TP Rich water in day after day

1290
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,960
after day after day if you don't think

1291
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:49,399
that is a breeding ground for microbial

1292
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,720
content you have not been thinking

1293
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,920
correctly do me a favor rip those cozies

1294
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,159
off if you're in a proper lab right now

1295
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,358
it's they're necessary they do not keep

1296
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,358
your buckets colder you can just put a

1297
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,159
little bit of more ice in it really

1298
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:07,519
doesn't make a huge difference when you

1299
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:10,480
pull them off versus the potential of

1300
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:13,199
contaminant that is there to contaminate

1301
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,159
your final end product to me that's

1302
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,598
something I would get rid of ASAP Marcus

1303
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,039
that's such a great suggestion I've

1304
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,318
always thought about that that was a

1305
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:24,079
point of contamination do do they start

1306
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:26,318
to smell like after a while like because

1307
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,359
if they're absorbing water and they're

1308
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,079
like drying out absorbing water dry do

1309
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:31,838
they start to smell after a while they

1310
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,720
would absolutely now keep in mind we

1311
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:37,838
were cleaning ours like crazy but it

1312
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:40,959
wasn't enough well with with special

1313
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,798
cleaning um uh like detergents that you

1314
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,559
could clean we also used ISO on the

1315
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:47,559
outside but it wouldn't soak in they're

1316
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,440
very thick so to me I just like the idea

1317
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:51,400
of getting rid of them they don't help

1318
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,119
they're not to all they are is a vector

1319
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,119
for potential contamination and that's

1320
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,440
my opinion but it's a gift to anyone

1321
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,358
listening today because you know if you

1322
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,318
just want to avoid a potent and if you

1323
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:04,880
don't believe me start doing swab tests

1324
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,558
on it you can get swab kits you can swab

1325
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,240
your your um everything in your room for

1326
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,240
microbial content and you and you should

1327
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,399
be doing this and having these things

1328
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,399
tested because if you were you would

1329
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,760
probably be ripping those cozies off

1330
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,000
ASAP so scum man I know that uh you're a

1331
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,079
big dry sift I know we're talking water

1332
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,599
here but you know we were talking

1333
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:30,480
patents so when does your dry sift

1334
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,960
patent expire so that you can share your

1335
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,119
dry sift secrets with the rest of

1336
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:40,240
us it is not a patent it's a proprietary

1337
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:43,920
information it's called a trade secret

1338
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:47,318
it's the Coca-Cola recipe but I did tell

1339
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,920
a few key people in the universe and I

1340
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:51,960
told them once I'm dead they're free to

1341
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,200
do whatever they want with the

1342
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,720
information but uh don't hold your

1343
00:53:54,199 --> 00:54:00,679
breath because uh I ain't going nowhere

1344
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:03,598
exactly and Sam I can concur you did

1345
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:06,039
absolutely say exactly that to me and I

1346
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,160
have held that respect and I've had

1347
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:11,880
people be pissed at me for for being

1348
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:14,960
loyal to a mentor and a friend if you

1349
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,838
can imagine which is fine I'm that those

1350
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,798
people play their cards early

1351
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:21,920
on I'm

1352
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:23,719
loyal I'm loyal when someone asks and

1353
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,318
it's not mine to tell them it's yours

1354
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:27,159
it's yours it's not you didn't give it

1355
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:29,599
to me you showed me and told me that if

1356
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:31,598
when I pass away you can share it until

1357
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,039
then keep it keep it to yourself which I

1358
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,440
have absolutely done I don't use the

1359
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:40,000
process at my company I've never shown

1360
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:43,039
the process to anyone um but it sure is

1361
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,760
um have asked it's an eye opener we have

1362
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,880
asked and you were like no and I of

1363
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,599
respect it's like actually even further

1364
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,440
John I asked you guys not to ask me

1365
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,599
anymore is what I actually asked because

1366
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,318
I felt like I said this I said do you

1367
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:55,599
really want to trick me out of this do

1368
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:57,679
you really want to get me into a

1369
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,440
conversation and trick me out of

1370
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,919
something that my that my mentor this

1371
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,400
person I have so much respect for that I

1372
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,358
that you can't imagine the the joy and

1373
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,639
pride I had when he showed that to me

1374
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,078
and it wasn't because I was going to be

1375
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,239
learning something that nobody knew it

1376
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:16,440
was because that that man decided to

1377
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:18,719
trust me and you think I'm G to let that

1378
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,358
go you think I'm G to like let that

1379
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:24,959
trust go what I was there you were like

1380
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:27,759
the happiest man in the world I wanted

1381
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:31,358
to make sure that the information was

1382
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:34,520
available to mankind if I wasn't able to

1383
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:38,159
me mechanical IE it like I would wanted

1384
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:40,159
to I wanted to automate the system but I

1385
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:44,679
I don't know if I'll be able to or not

1386
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:47,358
so uh but one day yeah lots of people

1387
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:49,399
can make pretty damn good dry sip

1388
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:52,920
nowadays

1389
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:58,240
so they're may be not making

1390
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,240
99.9 but they're making 95 pretty

1391
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:05,318
the varieties are getting better too so

1392
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:08,199
you know well they sure are do easier to

1393
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:10,318
collect and you know with with that said

1394
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:12,759
do you think Mark and even Sam do you

1395
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:14,639
think utility patents are something that

1396
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,680
could uh could hold up because they

1397
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:21,000
nuances of of just processes I mean what

1398
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:25,159
do you think about that Utility Patent

1399
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,838
does not last as long as I've held this

1400
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:31,000
Secret

1401
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:33,639
right I agree now now what if you have

1402
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
what if you're one of those guys like

1403
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:37,558
uh you

1404
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,400
know

1405
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:43,000
like try trying to do I think if you're

1406
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,559
trying to raise money and you trying to

1407
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
build perceived value filing patents

1408
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,359
could be a way of sort of I mean think

1409
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,079
of a patent is like a picket and a

1410
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:57,078
picket fence and a patent in and of

1411
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,200
itself he not as valuable as getting a

1412
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:02,720
bunch of patents to kind of like secure

1413
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,919
your little intellectual property Island

1414
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,879
but like Sam was saying you know the

1415
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:10,240
trade secret in cannabis is really I

1416
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,039
mean like there are successful products

1417
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:15,919
out there and they have successful you

1418
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,839
know the Genesis of the idea of how

1419
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,200
they're made and how they're put

1420
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:23,679
together and the notion that you want to

1421
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:26,719
protect that well if you file again not

1422
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:28,598
a utility but a process patent it

1423
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,038
difficult because your competitors

1424
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:34,039
aren't necessarily going to let you into

1425
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:37,240
their facility to know that their

1426
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:39,559
process infringes on your process you

1427
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:42,038
can buy their product in the store and

1428
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:44,079
you could do some type of analysis but

1429
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:48,160
at the end of the day they're extracting

1430
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:51,079
thca or THC or CBD or whatever can

1431
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,519
avonoid and and it's in a product okay

1432
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:54,039
well I mean those methods have been

1433
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:56,519
around for a long time so there's

1434
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:58,200
nothing really new about that I guess

1435
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:01,239
the companies who are filing who are

1436
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:03,598
coming out with new extraction processes

1437
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:06,399
or machines that are particular for

1438
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:09,280
their process so in order to run their

1439
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,920
process to make that kind of product you

1440
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,160
have to buy their machine so of course

1441
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,639
they want to patent that machine because

1442
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,598
they want to be the only machine

1443
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,078
manufacturer that could make that

1444
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,920
particular thing but I haven't really

1445
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:23,480
seen that too much in cannabis I mean

1446
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:26,159
mostly a lot of these extracts are you

1447
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,480
know is as good as the extraction meth

1448
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,719
method and you know a lot of the whether

1449
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,559
you're doing solvent based or not you

1450
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,118
know

1451
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,559
solventless you know the thing that

1452
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:37,920
we've always said here on hash Church

1453
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:40,440
which is you need high quality plant

1454
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,318
material that's not contaminated and if

1455
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,159
it starts with high quality plant

1456
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:50,279
material and your extraction method is

1457
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:52,598
proper you should get a very proper

1458
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:55,240
extract yeah I can coner with that you

1459
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:57,519
know I've gone through a great deal of

1460
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:00,118
material this past year alone and I've

1461
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:03,119
seen varying sizes of types of quality

1462
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:06,079
and yields and at the end of the day we

1463
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,160
have a specific Target to make full melt

1464
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,039
and there's things that we need to you

1465
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,199
always have to adapt to and it's about

1466
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:14,680
it be does become about your process as

1467
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:16,358
well as the material but there is there

1468
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:17,719
actually like you're saying there is a

1469
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:21,440
there's more sides to it it's not as

1470
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:23,639
black and white as as as you know as

1471
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,159
just the material versus the process I

1472
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:27,159
think more people need to focus on

1473
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:28,519
actually growing quality cannabis

1474
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:31,078
because the bottom line is if you

1475
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:32,679
haven't even grown great cannabis the

1476
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,200
processes none of these processes are

1477
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:36,159
going to work for you I'd also say that

1478
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:39,159
nothing's faster than large scale water

1479
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:41,558
extraction for isolating 99.99% gland

1480
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:43,480
heads you all have had access to it for

1481
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:45,039
20 plus years so what you just think

1482
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,240
you're going to get access to this new

1483
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,680
thing and it's going to change your

1484
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,118
world trust me the thing that will

1485
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:54,719
change your world is growing better weed

1486
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,760
focus on that that is important I agree

1487
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:59,038
Marcus 100

1488
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,400
like we were talking last week I mean

1489
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:03,799
having testing that we we can test the

1490
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,599
material now and have methods to say

1491
01:00:03,798 --> 01:00:08,358
okay what is the impact and you know

1492
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,280
when you look at yield and so some of

1493
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:13,000
the work that Johnny B did right here

1494
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:15,480
live on hash Church looking at LED

1495
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,679
versus you know high pressure sodium I

1496
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,480
mean where these things can actually

1497
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:24,199
have an incremental you know impact on

1498
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,400
the quality of the material that's grown

1499
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:29,439
and again venues like hash Church and

1500
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,280
other online things by the way Marcus

1501
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:35,639
speaking of online things I saw your um

1502
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:38,760
you're um curious about cannabis podcast

1503
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:40,679
very nice curious about cannabis podcast

1504
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,039
that a podcast with Marcus you all

1505
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:46,118
should check it out it was great Marcus

1506
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:48,640
tells his story but um you know there's

1507
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:52,200
so many things that I think that you can

1508
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:53,798
do like you know the dragonfly Earth

1509
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:56,598
medicine school of thought of

1510
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:58,838
regenerative cannabis you know kind of

1511
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:01,760
like what we were talking about with um

1512
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:04,199
with uh the guy from SC Labs I'm

1513
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,200
forgetting his name right now Alec right

1514
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:10,038
so having those analytical methods now

1515
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,838
not only at the third-party Testing Lab

1516
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:13,599
but at your production facilities

1517
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,679
themselves where you could actually

1518
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,599
follow the biomass you're getting in the

1519
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:19,440
building you could look at each

1520
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,200
individual fraction whether you're

1521
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,838
extracting and making distillate or

1522
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:26,759
making some type of solventless product

1523
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:29,038
all these things can be tested now to

1524
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,240
look at what the canono and tpine

1525
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,319
profiles are and translate that

1526
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:37,078
information into stuff that you can put

1527
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:38,639
on the label that customers can actually

1528
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:42,559
pay attention

1529
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:44,358
to so kind of cool yeah absolutely I

1530
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,920
almost forgot about that podcast

1531
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:48,440
actually um I haven't done that many

1532
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,119
lately but yeah I did tell the whole

1533
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:52,838
story on that one for sure yeah that was

1534
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,480
cool margus you did a great job

1535
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:56,920
congratulations on that that was great

1536
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,798
Jason's a nice guy we should get on on

1537
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,240
hash Church sometime absolutely anytime

1538
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:03,038
you guys have people you want to invite

1539
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:04,719
on to Hash Church please hit me up you

1540
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:07,640
guys are the core group I invite you all

1541
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:09,558
the time but I love M mixing it up new

1542
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:12,358
energy always creates new dialogue and

1543
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,319
new conversation doesn't always work out

1544
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:17,199
uh as good as we'd like it to but I'm

1545
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,798
always down uh with taking the chance uh

1546
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,439
even if it's just a matter of doing a

1547
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:23,119
sort of a little pre a hash Church video

1548
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,639
with people that we're thinking of

1549
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:30,559
bringing on it would be nice to uh to

1550
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,400
expand our hash group Core Group here so

1551
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,278
yeah we should do

1552
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,440
that asked question in the chat here

1553
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:39,480
about Delta 8 you want me to chime in

1554
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,639
just for a second about Delta 8 for a

1555
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,960
second a lot of interest in that these

1556
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:45,318
days yeah absolutely you guys sick of

1557
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:50,240
listening to me

1558
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:54,480
talk no talk it up bro yeah talk about

1559
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:56,558
so uh yeah um um so remember like when

1560
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,798
mulam isolated

1561
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:01,519
Delta 9 THC and the reason why we call

1562
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:04,079
it Delta 9 is because when you look at

1563
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,639
the molecular structure of THC right

1564
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,559
those thing that looks like chicken wire

1565
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,639
there's like three rings right and when

1566
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,039
you look at the North ring you'll see

1567
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:16,038
that there's a double bond which is a

1568
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,440
carbon each one of those angles is

1569
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,960
basically a carbon and and there's a

1570
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,400
double bond between two of the carbons

1571
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,119
and where that double bond resides is is

1572
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:29,400
is the Delta 9 configuration in the

1573
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:32,318
plant and mul's method was so mild in

1574
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:35,079
isolating it that he didn't isomerize it

1575
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:37,719
but previous researchers were frustrated

1576
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:40,200
because they were using acidic reagents

1577
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:42,558
and other methods that were uh in the

1578
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:45,399
isolation of the active ingredient was

1579
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:48,240
isomerizing the double bond and Confused

1580
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:51,760
the ultimate uh stereochemical

1581
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:54,879
elucidation so what what happens is if

1582
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,240
um so think of it like this way so if

1583
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,358
you if you're looking

1584
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:01,000
the structure of THC that North Ring The

1585
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:03,519
Ring at the topmost part of the

1586
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,278
structure you see the double bond is

1587
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:09,318
pointed towards the phenolic portion of

1588
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:11,440
the molecule which is where the Benzene

1589
01:04:09,318 --> 01:04:14,119
ring is right and so that's what's

1590
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,760
called the Delta 9 configuration and

1591
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:19,200
Delta 9 would rather be in Delta 8

1592
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:22,760
because when that isomerizes it it moves

1593
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:25,838
it one more carbon away from the rigid

1594
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:29,640
framework of the of the Benzene ring and

1595
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:33,679
when it moves it away it kind of lowers

1596
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:37,519
the energy of the molecule so Delta 8 is

1597
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:39,960
lower by a few kilo calories in energy

1598
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:43,119
than Delta 9 so I've given the

1599
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,838
opportunity Delta n which is what the

1600
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,880
plant gives us goes to Delta 8 now the

1601
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,519
other reason why this is important is

1602
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:54,240
because again because

1603
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:58,798
CBD is a um CBD can be chemically

1604
01:04:54,239 --> 01:05:02,038
converted into either Delta 8 or Delta 9

1605
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,759
THC right now a lot of hemp producers

1606
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:07,760
because of the price of

1607
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:10,760
CBD has tanked you know CBD isolate is

1608
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:13,240
like you know a year ago it was multiple

1609
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:16,119
thousands of dollars a kilogram now it's

1610
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:18,278
just hundreds of dollars a kilogram so

1611
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:20,559
it's really tanked part of that is just

1612
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:23,559
Supply demand economics there's so much

1613
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,798
of it available the FDA has not given

1614
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:27,960
the green light to for food

1615
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:29,880
manufacturers to be able to put this in

1616
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,400
into food products so there's a lot of

1617
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,160
production there's a lot of it on the

1618
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,838
market so that basically puts a downward

1619
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:38,278
pressure on the price of CBD so these

1620
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:40,239
manufacturers are looking to do

1621
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:43,639
something to make some money so they're

1622
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:47,558
converting it over into Delta 8 Now

1623
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:50,278
Delta 8 is less psychoactive than Delta

1624
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,720
9 I've seen a couple different papers

1625
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:56,159
where they looked at The Binding

1626
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:58,000
constant to the cv1 receptor but what I

1627
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,038
can tell you universally is I've had

1628
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,440
some delta8 this lit and it's it's

1629
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,599
headyy it gets you high but I've never

1630
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,798
been kind of like knocked over bold over

1631
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:10,318
like you do get like I think on on THC I

1632
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:11,759
think you could actually noticeably feel

1633
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:13,920
the difference I don't know if other

1634
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,640
people feel that way too but the last

1635
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,480
thing I'll say just about Delta 8 is

1636
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:21,318
that unfortunately it falls into the

1637
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,318
Tetra hydr

1638
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:28,798
canab all code 7370 of the controlled

1639
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:31,239
dous controlled dangerous substance act

1640
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:33,838
to get that out um which um even though

1641
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:36,399
it was derived from farm bill legal hemp

1642
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:38,838
you're now making an isomer that the da

1643
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,000
doesn't give a [ __ ] where they came from

1644
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:43,880
they issued something called an interim

1645
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,079
final ruling about six or eight months

1646
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,680
ago to try to harmonize the controlled

1647
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,318
dangerous substance act with the farm

1648
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:54,759
bill just to let people know that you

1649
01:06:51,318 --> 01:06:58,239
know THC and its isomer including Delta

1650
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:00,520
eight are all cut code 7370 covered

1651
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:04,078
under the under control dangerous

1652
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:07,719
substance act and again it's that quasi

1653
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:10,519
legal because you've you've you've made

1654
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:13,558
the hemp and you've made the CBD from

1655
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:16,119
which it's derived legal right so that's

1656
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:17,640
legal and people there's transactions

1657
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:21,278
that are happening where people are

1658
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:23,639
buying and selling CBD hemp biomass and

1659
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:27,159
people are actually smoking flour check

1660
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:30,358
this out people are actually taking CBD

1661
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:34,038
isolate converting it to Delta eight and

1662
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:36,440
then spraying it back on hemp to make

1663
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:39,440
midies yeah it's like the world needs

1664
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:41,119
more midies what you know but it's

1665
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,679
interesting because again it's just it's

1666
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,760
chemistry that actually mulam described

1667
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:49,278
and you know we were mentioning patents

1668
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:52,440
mulam actually patented this but I think

1669
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:55,599
that this is sort of a gray area right

1670
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:59,358
now Wade I don't really know whether or

1671
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,760
not you know the DEA has the muscle and

1672
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:05,318
the the enforcement to basically go

1673
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:08,400
after H manufactures who are flying the

1674
01:08:05,318 --> 01:08:11,519
you know Farm Bill flag saying hey we're

1675
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,798
processing hemp it's below three in THC

1676
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,560
when it comes in the building how we

1677
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:18,119
process it we're we're processing it

1678
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,440
we're turning it into products that the

1679
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:24,838
market wants a lot of the regulated

1680
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:27,358
Delta 9 markets those people who have to

1681
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:29,479
pay through the eyeballs to get licenses

1682
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,960
and get background checks on everyone

1683
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:34,399
and and do retinal scanners and have

1684
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:37,158
millions of dollars to they don't want

1685
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:38,719
the Delta a industry to happen right

1686
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:40,278
because they're gonna eat the market

1687
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,640
share they want these people to go to

1688
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:45,440
the dispensary and buy their licensed

1689
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,759
Delta 9 products so there's going to be

1690
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,039
some kind of thing that's going to

1691
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:50,880
happen going forward to try to harmonize

1692
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:54,158
these two things but that's where I'll

1693
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:56,600
end my little so if I

1694
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:59,759
could uh

1695
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,679
what I'm hearing you say is that uh the

1696
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,880
amount of delta8 products that are

1697
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:06,640
starting to show up across the country

1698
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:12,480
at this point it's really either folks

1699
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:16,880
moving CBD into Delta H isomerization or

1700
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:19,519
uh right other aggressive yeah let me

1701
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:22,640
thing way so it's either that or the the

1702
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,440
boys over at I think Guild noticeably

1703
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,560
The Guild extracts in in California but

1704
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:30,198
people who were using bleaching and

1705
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,000
decolorizing Clays first started

1706
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:35,559
noticing Delta H showing up in their

1707
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,560
distillates and some of the testing labs

1708
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,359
and Alec would be great to comment on

1709
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,798
this were like wait a second that's not

1710
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,798
Delta 9 that's Delta eight and it was

1711
01:09:41,798 --> 01:09:46,119
beautifully clear distillate because the

1712
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:48,198
bleaching Clays there is no bleach

1713
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:50,479
there's no sodium hypochlorite they're

1714
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:53,039
just called bleaching Clays because they

1715
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:55,639
remove color and these are standard

1716
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,198
things that remove color in the Essen

1717
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,320
oils industry and soybean oil and

1718
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:02,479
vegetable oil all that [ __ ] is

1719
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:04,719
decolorized and typically they use these

1720
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:07,359
type of bleaching Clays which is nothing

1721
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:09,840
more than M marinite clay but these

1722
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,519
Clays are acidic enough such that when

1723
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,199
they were adding clay to their

1724
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,679
distillation pot and then pooping over

1725
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:18,919
what they thought was a Delta 9

1726
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:21,440
distillate uhuh thermodynamics happened

1727
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:23,399
Delta 9 went down to Delta 8 and it

1728
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,678
doesn't go back to Delta 9 and so what

1729
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:27,279
they were getting was Delta 8 clear

1730
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,199
distillate and they're like oh oh we

1731
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,800
meant to make this so then they became

1732
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:34,198
the delta8 company and talked about how

1733
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,400
we were making clear Delta a distillate

1734
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:40,799
so I think that that actually predated

1735
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:44,039
people using the acid catalyzed process

1736
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,400
to convert CBD into Delta 8 which is now

1737
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:49,640
what you see mostly on the markets I

1738
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:52,319
think are coming from hemp producers out

1739
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:55,440
west yeah the first time I first time I

1740
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:58,599
ran into Delta 8 in a test result was

1741
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,599
was um one of our manufacturers was

1742
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,039
trying to clean up a batch of cannabis

1743
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,840
that had uh I think it was spinosad in

1744
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:07,880
it and he was doing a chlorine bleach

1745
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:11,440
and yeah what we got back it had a bunch

1746
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:13,359
of Delta eight and uh I couldn't find

1747
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:14,799
much science at that point on how Delta

1748
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:17,880
eight affects

1749
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:21,000
patients again you know uh but I'm I

1750
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,800
heard you reference earlier that uh you

1751
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,158
had seen some papers Rec feels like a

1752
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,320
THC wood but it feels less potent it

1753
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:31,559
just it doesn't it doesn't quite do it

1754
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,920
for me but I I know some people love it

1755
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,679
and certainly like I guess if you're

1756
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:39,199
used to smoking hemp flour and now you

1757
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,279
got hemp flour sprayed with Delta 8 it

1758
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:43,638
just took a circuitous way of getting

1759
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,960
back to the flower

1760
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:50,639
right thank you Mark Mark did you know

1761
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:55,600
that uh for the last uh few years people

1762
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:57,319
have been marketing High CBD 8

1763
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,280
uh

1764
01:11:57,319 --> 01:12:03,319
cannabis but the truth of it is as we

1765
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:06,800
both know cannabis does not produce

1766
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,519
Delta eight it's a degradation product

1767
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,880
yeah I I always thought that that was

1768
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,679
the case because if you look at the

1769
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:15,359
biosynthetic pathway the way the

1770
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:17,880
molecule comes together from cbga yeah

1771
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,719
it's it's an intermolecular cyclisation

1772
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:25,400
and it makes one particular one

1773
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:29,158
particular um configuration

1774
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:31,960
it would have a a plant uh synthase that

1775
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:33,559
would produce Delta eight but it does it

1776
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,319
was really it was really interesting

1777
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,600
what we found and I think I gave a talk

1778
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:40,840
on this at American Chemical Society

1779
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:47,800
national meeting a couple years ago

1780
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:52,920
which was we took Delta 9 thca that was

1781
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:57,079
purified and we uh we actually

1782
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:59,199
isolated the um Delta 8

1783
01:12:57,079 --> 01:13:03,238
acid by

1784
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:06,879
isomerizing the Delta 9 over to Delta 8

1785
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:08,839
without decarbox it and so we had some

1786
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,199
analytical data that supported that so

1787
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,600
that was kind of cool because there

1788
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:14,839
wasn't really too many reports of that

1789
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,039
so but I I I agree with what you're

1790
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,760
saying I think only Delta 9 is what

1791
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:26,960
occurs in the plant from what

1792
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:32,520
I you had Delta 8 a yes t

1793
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:35,760
a yes yeah cool Isn't that cool yeah

1794
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:37,159
it's way harder to find bed Delta eight

1795
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,800
yeah so I thought we were the first

1796
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:43,439
people to identify that but actually uh

1797
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,920
a came to my talk and pointed out that

1798
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:50,359
there was a a a Roger pery paper from a

1799
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:54,279
number of years ago where he and hus had

1800
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:56,559
actually um spectrally characterized it

1801
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:59,479
so but it's very it's buried in the

1802
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,800
middle of a tetraedron letters paper

1803
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:05,718
from the middle of the 80s you would not

1804
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:07,760
necessarily find it by looking for it

1805
01:14:05,719 --> 01:14:10,000
but man there's a lot of gems out there

1806
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,239
it's really cool I didn't even notice

1807
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,279
that Josh and Alec came into the room so

1808
01:14:13,238 --> 01:14:18,238
welcome to both of you and sorry for

1809
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:20,920
that for not welcoming you right

don't even know it you know how

1826
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:10,279
important I are me too I that all the

1827
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,000
time I just love the way that's

1828
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:15,679
important important but

1829
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,639
needy important but

1830
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:20,399
needy that's it oh yeah lots of

1831
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:22,480
mansplaining going on you know I got

1832
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:25,119
into a conversation with my friend the

1833
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,959
other day about mansplaining and she was

1834
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:29,840
going off on how she's like oh like men

1835
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,439
just constantly mansplaining to women

1836
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:35,719
and I said listen no offense but that's

1837
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:39,000
not a gender thing men mansplain to men

1838
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:41,439
as much as they do it to women it's our

1839
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,800
disease but isn't there women

1840
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:47,319
spting I don't know I just think of it

1841
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:49,360
as like the the voice of

1842
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:51,238
reason I just think of it as the voice

1843
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,158
of reason

1844
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:55,238
personally but nonetheless I know I

1845
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:56,960
really I really appreciate really

1846
01:15:55,238 --> 01:15:58,839
appreciate all of the talk I've been

1847
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,198
sort of in the background getting some

1848
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,520
stuff done and you know women explain it

1849
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:04,119
differently and I've been really

1850
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,320
appreciating the conversation this

1851
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:09,198
morning it's it's definitely got a

1852
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:11,119
tonality of masculinity but I think that

1853
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:13,359
that's really awesome and I appreciate

1854
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:16,719
that week after week so thanks so much

1855
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:18,679
everybody you guys for you know talking

1856
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:20,960
about the plans with such high regards

1857
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:24,119
and love hey I try to say you know there

1858
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:28,119
is a thing called male intuition male

1859
01:16:24,119 --> 01:16:31,079
intuition actually exists so you know

1860
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:33,960
you know be intuitive you

1861
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:35,600
know hey Mark I was wondering um have

1862
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,760
you ever done any extracting of

1863
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:41,159
endophytic fungi or bacteria from from

1864
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,400
Plants I haven't but more people are

1865
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:45,638
asking me about that every day you know

1866
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:48,439
we talked a little bit about this last

1867
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:50,400
week just because there's been more you

1868
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:54,559
know municipalities that

1869
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:56,519
are now making you know fungi you know

1870
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,560
or decriminalizing it or making it

1871
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:01,080
available and actually had a

1872
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:03,360
conversation with Alec on whether or not

1873
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:05,399
the analytical labs that are in place

1874
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,719
now for the Cannabis

1875
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:10,759
industry are going to start doing the

1876
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:14,000
analytical you know testing for some of

1877
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:16,440
these you know fungal type type products

1878
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,319
because as you know I mean having good

1879
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:21,279
analytical methods is really important

1880
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:24,079
for accurate dosing especially if you're

1881
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:26,639
talking about you know medicine for

1882
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,519
people who don't want the high of the

1883
01:17:26,639 --> 01:17:31,639
Psychedelic experience but perhaps

1884
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,960
needed to control depression or or other

1885
01:17:31,639 --> 01:17:35,880
things I had an old friend reach out to

1886
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,198
me who said you know cannabis just isn't

1887
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:44,000
doing it for my depression anymore and

1888
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:46,599
I'm not well enough vers to understand

1889
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,679
where um psychedelics can help but I'm

1890
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,440
reading up on it a lot and just finding

1891
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:53,800
a lot of just great work going on right

1892
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:55,359
now actually a lot of government funded

1893
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,960
work right now

1894
01:17:55,359 --> 01:18:00,158
on both

1895
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:04,279
MDMA and um and

1896
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:05,719
psilocybin for to treat all kinds of

1897
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:07,759
condition the the paper I was just

1898
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:11,679
reading yesterday Josh was really cool

1899
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:15,840
it was talking about stage four cancer

1900
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:18,800
um uh patients getting uh MDMA uh and

1901
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:22,279
having basically a MDMA experience to

1902
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:24,199
kind of help their body understand that

1903
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:26,800
what their medical conditions all about

1904
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:29,759
and and and trying to get their their

1905
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:33,159
mind to think about positive ways of

1906
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:35,199
healing themselves and it's just so just

1907
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:37,119
powerful and just yeah a lot of great

1908
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:39,719
work being done right now man it's so

1909
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:41,479
cool crystal ball right the scientific

1910
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:45,399
literature it's out there for everybody

1911
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:48,198
to look into yeah AB the more I go down

1912
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:50,638
the um the long roads of the microbiome

1913
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:52,559
the more that we're really realizing

1914
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:55,920
that health and well-being on emotional

1915
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:58,800
level physical level spiritual level is

1916
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:01,319
so intricately connected to the

1917
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,480
microbiome that you know I feel like

1918
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:06,198
we're just barely scratching the surface

1919
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:09,079
right now of where we really need to get

1920
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:11,119
for Humanity as well as for the health

1921
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:14,158
and well-being of the cannabis plants

1922
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:16,000
you know we're we're having a lot of

1923
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:18,279
these discussions but in five years from

1924
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
now we're going to be talking about the

1925
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:22,319
endic uh you know reactions that are

1926
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,238
going on within the plant and we're

1927
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,519
going to be counting bacteria and

1928
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:27,678
different species and that's going to be

1929
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,120
the way that we're going to be able to

1930
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:32,440
tell how healthy the plants are as well

1931
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:35,519
as how much medicine um the plant is

1932
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:38,599
providing for patients and also I mean

1933
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,960
and to say are you extracting Endo fidic

1934
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:45,440
fungi and bacteria from Plants isn't

1935
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:49,560
really a psychedelic question it's more

1936
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:52,439
there's there's you know 30 to to more

1937
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:55,480
there's different Endo fidic fungi that

1938
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:57,158
the plant pulls out of the soil right P

1939
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:59,959
bacteria and Fung out of the soil to

1940
01:19:57,158 --> 01:20:00,799
create its body as it's growing and

1941
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:04,840
those

1942
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,920
compounds are often medicinal and just

1943
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:09,440
like I don't know if I if I froze I

1944
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:11,039
couldn't tell but uh just like we and we

1945
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:15,039
may have discussed this on hash Church

1946
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:17,479
before but like taxol right cures cancer

1947
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:19,399
from the UT tree but and they and we

1948
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:22,319
said this before but they took all the

1949
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:25,000
bark off the off the tree you know all

1950
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,719
through the 90s and left the tree out in

1951
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,800
the woods because they were extracting

1952
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,639
taxol from the bark but after further

1953
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,119
studies and further scientific studies

1954
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:37,920
they realized it was the endophytic

1955
01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:40,158
fungi in the cambium layer that was also

1956
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,920
producing taxel and in some cases

1957
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:45,439
producing it more than what was in the

1958
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:47,800
bark so it was possible and this is you

1959
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:49,279
know more into the science realm you

1960
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,199
know more than where I'm at you know

1961
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:54,119
where we're at more intuitive nature

1962
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:56,399
lovers but in science you can extract

1963
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:59,920
these comp compounds and the plant is

1964
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:02,319
pulling up bacteria and fungi into the

1965
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,440
plant and putting it back into the soil

1966
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,639
it's it's

1967
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:09,559
replicating those organisms in its body

1968
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:12,039
and it's putting it back into the soil

1969
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,840
those compounds are also capable of

1970
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:18,359
producing secondary

1971
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:21,119
metabolites you know outside of uh I'm

1972
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:25,880
coming down with Rona someone just wrote

1973
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:29,319
me no I'm all good bro just

1974
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:31,400
but um but uh anyway I know the cannabis

1975
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:33,198
plant has these compounds and I don't

1976
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:34,839
and I don't see that we're studying them

1977
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:37,559
yet and it may be that you know there's

1978
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:39,520
a you know a thousand acres of hemp you

1979
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,960
know holding endophytic fungi and

1980
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,080
bacteria that we don't know about that

1981
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,600
we can extract and use for our health

1982
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:46,840
and well-being I feel like it's it's a

1983
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:50,039
new frontier you know there's a few

1984
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:52,560
universities that are studying it you

1985
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:55,000
know and then and then also you know

1986
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:58,000
there's psychedelic fungi and that whole

1987
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,439
entire realm of Breaking the Chain and

1988
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,198
you know stopping you know not having

1989
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:04,399
the boundaries and the chains that bind

1990
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:06,599
you and that's what I love so the nice

1991
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:08,719
thing about those compounds the nice

1992
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,239
thing about those compounds Josh is that

1993
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:15,000
they're water soluable so you know we're

1994
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:17,799
in cannabis everything is oil soluble

1995
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,679
not very water soluble you can use

1996
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,520
pretty

1997
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:26,520
conventional methods to make a mushroom

1998
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,520
tea for example blue juice right

1999
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:32,479
the blue juice oh I've looked at my 300

2000
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:33,479
liter Whistler reactor a few times and

2001
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:35,799
been

2002
01:22:33,479 --> 01:22:38,799
like probably whip up a nice batch of

2003
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,800
blue juice in that

2004
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,960
reactor yeah so Mark is that like a a a

2005
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:47,400
standardized product that you think like

2006
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,520
one of these markets like in Oregon

2007
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:52,679
that's legalized psychedelics could

2008
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:54,960
actually you can go and buy your little

2009
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:57,600
shot of blue juice at the convenience

2010
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:59,399
store someday or I well I sure hope so I

2011
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,600
mean my goodness listen cannabis has

2012
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:03,960
been amazing for the sort of I mean I

2013
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,920
don't want to say it hasn't been amazing

2014
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,520
for the mental as well as the physical

2015
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,279
but sort of on this plane and now we're

2016
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,960
bringing in the psychedelics which is

2017
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:14,359
going to help us in that sort of

2018
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,239
spiritual plane in that sort of you know

2019
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:18,880
the mental health plane people are

2020
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:21,879
hurting and people end up taking lithium

2021
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,960
and all sorts of drugs that [ __ ] with

2022
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,920
your brain chemistry that are created by

2023
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,920
companies and sold under the name

2024
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,600
pharmaceutical which if you drop the P

2025
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,399
it's got the harm right there in the

2026
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,960
word h RM like they're not even trying

2027
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:37,238
to hide it I think of that as one of the

2028
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,359
biggest things coming in the queue right

2029
01:23:37,238 --> 01:23:41,638
now is when people who are seriously

2030
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:44,319
suffering from mental health and mental

2031
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:47,600
illness can go and take these Journeys

2032
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:49,960
with these plant medicines and you know

2033
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,880
not have to not have to deal with it for

2034
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,840
the rest of their lives it should be an

2035
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:56,880
you know it should be like a trip or two

2036
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,600
or three not like 25 years of taking

2037
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,840
Lithium you know this is these are

2038
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,440
accelerators that don't that don't take

2039
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,800
25 years they happen immediately because

2040
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,678
once you have been and I take this from

2041
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:09,400
Brian and I can't even pronounce his

2042
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,800
last name the book that both Alec and I

2043
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:14,439
spoke about the immortality key he

2044
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:16,920
mentions a woman who was a full-blown

2045
01:24:14,439 --> 01:24:18,839
atheist still an atheist even after her

2046
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,679
trip but when it's asked about the

2047
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,600
mushroom and how she felt and she was

2048
01:24:20,679 --> 01:24:25,679
very she had deep deep depression she

2049
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:27,800
took mushrooms only once and and totally

2050
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,079
sealed the deal on her depression when

2051
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:33,199
she was asked what would you say the

2052
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:36,158
feeling was she said it felt like I was

2053
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:37,919
being in bathed in God's love and he

2054
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:39,559
said I thought you were an atheist and

2055
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,679
she said well I am but that's the only

2056
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:45,560
thing I can put into words that it felt

2057
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,560
like and so that's pretty

2058
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:53,238
potent I mean psychedelics has has just

2059
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,639
catapulted us to the level where we're

2060
01:24:53,238 --> 01:25:00,000
at right now you know I I think that the

2061
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:03,840
entrance of mushrooms allowed Humanity

2062
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,158
to think outside of Just The Agrarian

2063
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:09,600
sort of work that they were doing at the

2064
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:12,359
time and allowed them to create

2065
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,320
spirituality and now here we are with

2066
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:17,359
psychedelics coming out on a new realm

2067
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:19,880
of course I do believe that cannabis has

2068
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,479
opened the door for the psychedelics she

2069
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,039
the one that's holding the door wide

2070
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:25,839
open for people to actually recognize

2071
01:25:24,039 --> 01:25:29,479
that plant medicine is totally

2072
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:32,440
incredibly powerful and how like here we

2073
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:34,479
are now in this new Great Awakening of

2074
01:25:32,439 --> 01:25:36,519
you know psychedelics regular people are

2075
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:38,319
talking about it people are looking

2076
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,719
towards plant medicine to heal

2077
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:43,118
themselves more Pharmaceuticals than

2078
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:46,439
ever before and I think that if we just

2079
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:49,759
continue that action and percentage

2080
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:52,079
forward then we're really going to be

2081
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:54,440
catapulted into the next level of

2082
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:57,158
humanity and the next level of existence

2083
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:59,439
it's not going to come from just our own

2084
01:25:57,158 --> 01:26:02,279
Collective Consciousness there has to be

2085
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:05,198
some kind of a drop from outside of it

2086
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:07,719
so that our Collective Consciousness can

2087
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:10,118
you know build off of something like

2088
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:13,840
that and I think that you know we owe so

2089
01:26:10,118 --> 01:26:15,960
much to plant medicines as to why we are

2090
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:19,239
the human beings that we are and the

2091

against 5G listen yes it will melt your

2100
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:43,118
brain but in a very good way and when it

2101
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,239
precipitates back into a solid you'll be

2102
01:26:43,118 --> 01:26:46,920
better for it so just don't be afraid of

2103

McKenna did it actually happened I think

2112
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,679
it I thought it was fake I looked into

2113
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:18,639
it there was no movie it was just

2114
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:21,880
someone created like a like a an ad for

2115
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:24,199
it but I never actually saw any video of

2116
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:26,719
it yeah I thought it was a movie that

2117
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:29,960
was released in like 2017 or something

2118
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:31,840
like that is that not right I could

2119
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,840
never find it all I found was that it

2120
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,199
was like someone like a fan-based thing

2121
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,960
they took a picture of Jim with a beard

2122
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,039
and put it in and then covered him in

2123
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:45,520
mushrooms and plants and made this super

2124

affected me deeply he affected me very

2184
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:26,760
deeply I I got turned on to him almost

2185
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:28,679
as a teenager you know by his from his

2186

tapes from The esam Institute and some

2187
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:32,960
of these other tapes and people in our

2188
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:35,000
community in Winnipeg Manitoba they did

2189
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:38,279
not know who Terrence McKenna was it was

2190
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,960
very random that we somehow accidentally

2191
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:43,399
stumbled upon Him absolutely read the

2192
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,800
invisible landscape that's an amazing

2193
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:48,920
book read true hallucinations the

2194
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:50,840
archaic revival food of the Gods you

2195
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:53,039
know every article he ever wrote in

2196
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,719
every magazine all of his lectures

2197
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,560
including the ones with rert sheldrake

2198
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:00,399
and Ralph Abraham I went deep on

2199
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,760
Terrence he was probably you know one of

2200
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:04,679
one of the people that affected me a

2201
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,400
great great deal when I was younger and

2202
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:09,440
got you know we ordered our spores from

2203
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:11,118
him and his wife cat uh from that that

2204
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:13,519
the big island that you're talking about

2205
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:14,599
that's where those siy spores came from

2206
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,639
that him and his brother Dennis

2207
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:19,639
collected in the Amazon back in the late

2208
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:21,319
70s before they wrote the book uh the

2209
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:23,400
mushroom Growers guide on how to grow

2210
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:25,158
psychedelic mushrooms indoors so and

2211
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:27,839
that book was was the book we used with

2212
01:31:25,158 --> 01:31:31,439
the spores to actually grow these

2213
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:34,360
mushrooms and so for me I will always

2214
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:37,439
have a huge place in my in my soul for

2215
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:40,238
the information that Terence mcken

2216
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:43,118
Shar yeah I totally agree I feel like

2217
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:45,599
he's given um you know so much to me and

2218
01:31:43,118 --> 01:31:49,158
I feel like more than anything he's

2219
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:51,360
given me an incredible sense of humor on

2220
01:31:49,158 --> 01:31:54,039
psychedelics like I think of Terence

2221
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:56,839
McKenna when I'm on psychedelics

2222
01:31:54,039 --> 01:31:58,479
and for some reason just the hilarity

2223
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:03,119
comes out you know where you're just

2224
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:05,519
like wow this world is [ __ ] hilarious

2225
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:09,000
and I can't believe I was so serious

2226
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:13,679
about it last week he like really has

2227
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:16,880
you know opened up the doors to let go

2228
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:20,158
of uh what we don't laugh at ourselves

2229
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:22,560
about [ __ ] humans are hilarious yeah and

2230
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:26,118
Terence had that gift he had he was

2231
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:28,679
sharp and had the gift gab obviously and

2232
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:31,000
could just could just say things that

2233
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:32,920
just you know would you would erupt into

2234
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,639
laughter and I was the same way you know

2235
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:38,800
be tripping balls kind of like like

2236
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:40,760
almost like just uncomfortably high and

2237
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,560
then think of Terren and think of all

2238
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:45,079
the words that he prepared I'll tell you

2239
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,880
one thing that was the preparation for

2240
01:32:45,079 --> 01:32:48,760
largescale mushroom tripping because

2241
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,880
that whole Timothy L thing with the Book

2242
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:53,480
of the Dead and rep and like recording

2243
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:55,000
his voice reading it to himself like if

2244
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:56,599
any of you you ever listened to Tim

2245
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,960
you'd know that one of his worst trips

2246
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:02,360
ever was listening to the Book of Dead

2247
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:04,079
while he was tripping balls in his voice

2248
01:33:02,359 --> 01:33:05,359
his he had recorded it himself because

2249
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:06,760
he couldn't read the book and he thought

2250
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:09,479
well I want to read the book while I'm

2251
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:11,960
high so that was kind of the the the the

2252
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:14,759
the way to lead yourself to a bad trip

2253
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,800
whereas the Terren lectures and all of

2254
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:19,840
what he was sharing was just so

2255
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,480
inspirational and so you know and and

2256
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,840
putting himself out there and shipping

2257
01:33:21,479 --> 01:33:26,879
those spores around the world at a time

2258
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:28,639
when holy Christ like they could have

2259
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,600
easily hammered down on him and put him

2260
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:34,600
in jail for 10 years but you know he

2261
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:37,000
kept he still was doing it so no no

2262
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,480
doubt a huge props to Terence

2263
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,319
McKenna and McKenna yeah and and I need

2264
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:45,439
to give props for the bad trips too so

2265
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:47,599
you know absolutely bad trips have given

2266
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,719
me the most important lessons of my

2267
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,039
entire life and I don't know if bad is

2268
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:55,399
quite the word you know just

2269
01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:58,039
like felt yeah the intense trips the

2270
01:33:55,399 --> 01:34:01,920
ones that just don't compartmentalize so

2271
01:33:58,039 --> 01:34:03,840
easy human beings are such incredible

2272
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:06,039
compartmentalizes that if it doesn't

2273
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:09,079
compute and it doesn't compartmentalize

2274
01:34:06,039 --> 01:34:11,800
then maybe if it's an unknown then be

2275
01:34:09,079 --> 01:34:14,238
afraid of it and I think that you know

2276
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,320
that's that's something that uh

2277
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:17,799
hopefully we're going to be able to

2278
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:19,559
break down with the new entrance of

2279
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:22,199
psychedelics you know that need to

2280
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:24,199
compartmentalize human beings resistance

2281
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:26,158
creates strength and you know if you

2282
01:34:24,198 --> 01:34:28,158
don't believe it just lift weights like

2283
01:34:26,158 --> 01:34:29,920
if you lift weights that resistance will

2284
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:32,118
create strength in your muscles and it's

2285
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,039
really no difference for the resistance

2286
01:34:32,118 --> 01:34:36,920
of an intense trip and whether or not

2287
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:39,359
you know it's almost like a psychic

2288
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:42,719
puzzle that you're involved in and

2289
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:45,880
depending on you know not your ego but

2290
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:49,079
allowing your soul to project its true

2291
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:52,239
feeling it's that true like love

2292
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:54,039
experience if you can do that you can

2293
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:56,439
transform and that's what the budha bu

2294
01:34:54,039 --> 01:34:59,000
talk about transforming pain and anguish

2295
01:34:56,439 --> 01:35:01,238
you transform that when someone passes

2296
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,158
on you don't have to cry and be sad

2297
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:04,879
because you were happy they were here

2298
01:35:03,158 --> 01:35:06,319
and you know they're not actually gone

2299
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,199
they've just transformed it's a

2300
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:11,559
different filter of looking through and

2301
01:35:08,198 --> 01:35:14,719
so yeah huge huge

2302
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:16,600
prop and and you know it's like the big

2303
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:18,439
the big questions and the reason why we

2304
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,960
have science and the reason why we have

2305
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:23,399
all you know the Buddhists say that the

2306
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,319
greatest um disease of humanity is the

2307
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:28,638
need to know why and it's like I think

2308
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:30,960
that more than anything we're all just

2309
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:33,400
really wondering where did we come from

2310
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,960
and where are we going I mean really and

2311
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:38,359
truly everything else is noise and fluff

2312
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:40,920
in between everything that we're talking

2313
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:43,238
about is trying to give us little tiny

2314
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:45,399
tidbits of where we're going to go now

2315
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:48,519
that we're here and it's so beautiful

2316
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:52,479
that plant medicine really helped us

2317
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:55,119
align with either a giving us those

2318
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:57,519
answers or B helping us realize that

2319
01:35:55,118 --> 01:35:59,960
those answers are not important at all

2320
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:04,040
that we're here and that just being here

2321
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:07,079
is good enough yep and you know helps

2322
01:36:04,039 --> 01:36:10,479
open us to those possibilities and big

2323
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:13,000
up Alec Alec was wanting to say and and

2324
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:16,279
my man what's up ganja Gil in the house

2325
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,800
today welcome

2326
01:36:16,279 --> 01:36:20,118
guys see I just wanted to jump in real

2327
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,840
quick with on the Terence mechanic

2328
01:36:20,118 --> 01:36:24,118
conversation bless his soul and yeah

2329
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:26,199
Dennis mcken too those dudes are legends

2330
01:36:24,118 --> 01:36:28,799
but um yeah just uh it's fascinating how

2331
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:32,079
Terence Mna had um you know selected

2332
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:35,239
identified a choar of banister Opus

2333
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:37,920
Kappy um and brought it out to Hawaii

2334
01:36:35,238 --> 01:36:39,599
and they planted the iasa vine out in

2335
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:42,319
Hawaii and since then it's become

2336
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:45,360
essentially an invasive weed like or an

2337
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:47,559
invasive plant in this

2338
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:50,559
way and

2339
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:52,880
so it's it's it's actually to see how

2340
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,320
it's growing on Hawaii and uh you know

2341
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,560
the the vineet itself it's a it's a

2342
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:59,279
woody lyan which is like a or it's a

2343
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:02,039
lyana which is a woody Vine and uh and

2344
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:04,719
and it grows and stretches to kind of to

2345
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:06,039
to C catch the Sun and over its life i'

2346
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,800
I heard some really cool stories about

2347
01:37:06,039 --> 01:37:12,560
the plant um over it's you know in the

2348
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:14,279
jungle in in Brazil and the Amazon and

2349
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:17,159
per

2350
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:19,639
Peru the vine will kind of stretch up to

2351
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:22,238
kind of catch the sun it'll it'll um

2352
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:24,760
kind of it'll pull you know as it grows

2353
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:26,799
it'll actually pull trees down out of

2354
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,760
the ground to open up the canopy of the

2355
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,159
forest so that it can kind of open up

2356
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,480
light and then it brings in all kinds of

2357
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:35,638
other life in you know the below canopy

2358
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:37,399
um but but um the vine is is it's F it's

2359
01:37:35,639 --> 01:37:39,000
fascinating how much it's kind of uh

2360
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:41,479
kind of spreading on the island of

2361
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,520
Hawaii um you know and just similar to

2362
01:37:41,479 --> 01:37:45,399
like eucalyptus For Better or For Worse

2363
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,400
but as far as it goes on the global kind

2364
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:51,759
of conservation effort to you know plant

2365
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:54,359
more of the vine as consumption and um

2366
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,920
and popularity of iasa kind of you know

2367
01:37:54,359 --> 01:37:59,000
continues to to grow um you know just

2368
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:01,279
the whole concept of BR cultiv or or

2369
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,118
conservation You Know teren M kind of

2370
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:08,599
really has made a major effect in that

2371
01:38:04,118 --> 01:38:11,238
you know post uh you know post

2372
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:14,279
humus absolutely well said Alec thanks

2373
01:38:11,238 --> 01:38:17,879
for sharing uh Mark Rose my manufacturer

2374
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:20,359
who uh from in Nepal um says he grew the

2375
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:22,840
spores in cat MW back in

2376
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:24,920
1998 and then they went wild in the Rose

2377
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,840
Garden in the yard so he just shared

2378
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:29,039
that I just wanted to say one more thing

2379
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:33,239
before we give Gil the floor and let him

2380
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:36,639
uh come in and say hello which was that

2381
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:38,598
imagine if life itself is a

2382
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:40,719
disassociative we're not supposed to

2383
01:38:38,599 --> 01:38:43,159
know where we came from and we're not

2384
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:45,599
supposed to know where we're going we

2385
01:38:43,158 --> 01:38:47,519
can get little glimpses and little

2386
01:38:45,599 --> 01:38:50,039
flashes and this is the whole experience

2387
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:53,040
this is why this is so fun and so

2388
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:55,359
terrifying simultaneously here on planet

2389
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:57,519
Earth but I'm certain that we're not

2390
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:58,799
supposed to know where we came from and

2391
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,520
we're not supposed to know where we're

2392
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,520
going because if we did it would affect

2393
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:10,159
the experience and the experience is why

2394
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:10,159
we're all here so yeah welcome ganja

2395
01:39:11,479 --> 01:39:17,198

01:39:22,599 --> 01:39:27,079
not sure I have too much to contribute

2400
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:30,480
to the conversation at this current

2401
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:33,399
moment but again I'm just stoked to be

be recently it's been real warm still

2405
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:41,960
kind of waiting for winter to come

2406
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:43,959

like to actually sit here and relax this

2409
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:49,960
Sunday morning with you guys and smoke

2410
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:51,879
some hash and listen to the

2411
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:54,719
conversation well if that's not what

2412
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:56,199
it's all about right there in a nutshell

2413
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,520
I mean that if we had a mission

2414
01:39:56,198 --> 01:40:02,238
statement here at hash Church Gil just

2415
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:03,960
spit it out so there it is welcome

2416
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:06,959
welcome

2417
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:09,560
man oh we got the chat going on go go

2418
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:14,279
ahead Jo what are some of the uh strings

2419
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:14,280
you've been watching in the last uh week

2420
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:20,239
Gil I kind of took a different approach

2421
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:23,880
this year actually and like I grew a lot

2422
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:26,919
from seed um being in California I have

2423
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:30,279
access to a lot of desirable clone only

2424
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:32,440
genetics and uh this past year I grew

2425
01:40:30,279 --> 01:40:34,039
pretty much strictly seed I kind of like

2426
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:35,559
go back and forth it's funny you know

2427
01:40:34,039 --> 01:40:37,920
like one year you'll like grow all

2428
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:40,119
clones and then I'm like oh that was

2429
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,359
boring now I want to do seeds and then

2430
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:44,799
I'll do seeds and then crack like way

2431
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:46,639
more seeds than I need and like end up

2432
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:49,520
getting way more males than I thought I

2433
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:51,520
would or you know the roly pulley will

2434
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:54,199
eat all my seedlings or you know it ends

2435
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,520
up being always a lot of work so

2436
01:40:54,198 --> 01:40:58,399
sometimes after a SE season I get a

2437
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,800
little lit like oh man I'm G to put the

2438
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:02,679
training wheels back on and just get

2439
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:04,239
some clones and keep it easy you know

2440
01:41:02,679 --> 01:41:07,158
but uh the seed thing really worked out

2441
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:09,839
really well for me this year um I kind

2442
01:41:07,158 --> 01:41:11,598
of it's all mixed pheno washes because

2443
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:15,560
you know I don't have a very large

2444
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:18,480
garden and I chose to grow about 35

2445
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:21,599
different varieties not phenos but

2446
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:24,000
varieties so in a small garden you can

2447
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:25,440
imagine it's all small bat

2448
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,279
um but that's kind of what I wanted to

2449
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:29,960
do this year last year I only did like a

2450
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:31,800
handful of like big dumper hash drains

2451
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:33,439
and it was cool but it kind of like lost

2452
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:35,159
its interests after a little while you

2453
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:36,879
know after you wash so many barrels of

2454
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:38,839
the same strain it's kind of like oh I

2455
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,560
know what it's going to do you know like

2456
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:42,039
if you press the same strain over and

2457
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,599
over again you know what it's going to

2458
01:41:42,039 --> 01:41:46,760
do so this past year like I said I grew

2459
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:48,440
like 30 different varieties and it's

2460
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:51,520
been super fun just to do these little

2461
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:53,759
batches and see what they do and uh at

2462
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:56,040
first I was kind of like have mixed

2463
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,440
feelings about the mixed feno washes you

2464
01:41:56,039 --> 01:42:00,279
know like oh is it kind of generic you

2465
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:03,399
know you should really be selecting the

2466
01:42:00,279 --> 01:42:05,039
one and what not but I started to kind

2467
01:42:03,399 --> 01:42:07,039
of think about it more and I feel like

2468
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:08,840
you know when you look at like you know

2469
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:11,279
lets be real I cracked mostly 10 packs

2470
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:13,400
of seeds you know just small 12 packs

2471
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:15,158
whatever you know in a 10 pack you'll

2472
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:16,879
probably feel like you know half of them

2473
01:42:15,158 --> 01:42:18,559
will lean towards the mom half of them

2474
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,000
will lead towards you know the dad and

2475
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,560
you know a few come in between and I

2476
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,319
started to think about it and I'm like

2477
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:27,280
oh that's kind of a good representation

2478
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,799
of the actual the cultivar because it's

2479
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:30,319
like got a little bit of this got a

2480
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,599
little bit of that it's pulling from all

2481
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:35,079
of it you know so maybe it's not so much

2482
01:42:32,599 --> 01:42:38,239
generic as much as it's like a a pretty

2483
01:42:35,079 --> 01:42:40,800
good representation of it and uh it's

2484
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:42,598
been working really well yield wise um

2485
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,079
it's definitely interesting to watch the

2486
01:42:42,599 --> 01:42:47,000
different quality of resins interact

2487
01:42:45,079 --> 01:42:48,639
with one another in the same bag you

2488
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,238
know you can definitely see certain

2489
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:53,639
resins kind of starting to dissolve the

2490
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:55,638
other one but uh

2491
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:58,319
it's worked out really good and uh it's

2492
01:42:55,639 --> 01:43:00,920
been really fun and uh I've been doing a

2493
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:04,039
lot of papaya crosses papaya is really

2494
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:07,599
popular in California this year so uh

2495
01:43:04,039 --> 01:43:11,719
did a lot of papaya stuff um that Kim

2496
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:13,480
Masonic um down in Compton he just dusts

2497
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:18,480
everything with the same maale that

2498
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:21,039
Wilson mail he has Wilson is um papaya

2499
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:24,718
times banana OG cross with Tropicana

2500
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:26,760
cookie F2 and uh just a real solid male

2501
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,359
that he hits everything with and I

2502
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,960
definitely cracked a bunch of seeds from

2503
01:43:28,359 --> 01:43:33,679
him and they all did really well man

2504
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:36,960
they all we tropical island cocktail

2505
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:39,560
fruit pineapple banana turps you know

2506
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:42,158
which I like Funk myself I'm really into

2507
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:44,400
the gas stuff but it seems like my area

2508
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:46,638
California really likes that fruity turp

2509
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:50,079
stuff and I don't know you kind of keep

2510
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:53,840
the people happy and whatnot but uh yeah

2511
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:57,039
just uh this week I wash some chem D

2512
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:59,000
cross with daylow from someone out of uh

2513
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:01,479
Colorado was really really good did

2514
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,479
really great then I did the chmd to

2515
01:44:01,479 --> 01:44:06,279
Purple OG that one came out purple it

2516
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:09,439
was really cool to see the purple resin

2517
01:44:06,279 --> 01:44:12,519
but like didn't really yield well

2518
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:14,519
um uh what else do I got in the freeze

2519
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:17,560
dryer right now I got Wilson zero in

2520
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:20,560
there right now which is original Wilson

2521
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:23,400
from Anie noodles um which is just his

2522
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:25,520
original Wilson the banana OG papaya

2523
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:28,359
Tropicana that's in the freeze dryer

2524
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:31,639
right now looking really good is this a

2525
01:44:28,359 --> 01:44:34,279
fish head that's naming these strains

2526
01:44:31,639 --> 01:44:37,239
Wilson so that's so funny that you say

2527
01:44:34,279 --> 01:44:38,960
that because um it's not believe it or

2528
01:44:37,238 --> 01:44:40,919
not I always thought the same thing and

2529
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:43,560
I told them that I'm like you guys know

2530
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:47,239
about the Wilson tune and like most of

2531
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:50,119
them don't um what it is is it's again

2532
01:44:47,238 --> 01:44:52,718
banana OG papaya Tropicana cookie so it

2533
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:54,519
smells like a tropical island so I guess

2534
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:56,840
from that that movie Cast Away I never

2535
01:44:54,520 --> 01:45:01,159
saw it myself but it's got uh what's his

2536
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:02,639
name Tom Hanks in it wilon ball the

2537
01:45:01,158 --> 01:45:05,319
Wilson yeah so

2538
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:09,159
that's yeah that's where the Wilson

2539
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:11,920
comes from supposedly I guess um yeah oh

2540
01:45:09,158 --> 01:45:15,679
funny island chirs is that Wilson with

2541
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:18,279
19 L's

2542
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:20,039
Wilson I don't know about that Marcus as

2543
01:45:18,279 --> 01:45:22,639
far as I know like I said it's the one

2544
01:45:20,039 --> 01:45:26,359
from an noodles oh I was just being

2545
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:28,159
silly um like I said from what oh okay

2546
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:30,359
I'm sorry dude if you ever heard fish

2547
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:34,359
sing the

2548
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:37,639
song there's about 19 L's in

2549
01:45:34,359 --> 01:45:40,679
there well there you go now I now I

2550
01:45:37,639 --> 01:45:42,679
understand sorry they that way I wanted

2551
01:45:40,679 --> 01:45:44,880
to mention in regards to you talking

2552
01:45:42,679 --> 01:45:46,480
about mixed cultivars and kind of the

2553
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,400
difference and I'm I'm sure Sam will

2554
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:51,000
probably want to T tap in here at one

2555
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:53,158
point because back in the day and I

2556
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,840
don't know if this was pre 71 or what

2557
01:45:53,158 --> 01:45:57,920
when Sam but was there not like a time

2558
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,119
where in Afghanistan they were growing

2559
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:02,079
type one and type two plants you know

2560
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:03,880
having that sort of selection just it

2561
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:06,399
was reminiscent when he started talking

2562
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:09,118
about like mixing all the fenos from a

2563
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:11,920
seed batch in and how I can kind of see

2564
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:14,158
us getting there as we go into this

2565
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:16,399
isolating cultivars isolating resin

2566
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:18,158
gland heads to the point where we may do

2567
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:21,118
a full circle and now it's like you know

2568
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:24,238
what I want to run this whole field into

2569
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:26,479
hash and I want to create a profile you

2570
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:28,598
know probably one that's never going to

2571
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:30,879
be recreated but something that would

2572
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:34,400
still have its place and be considered

2573
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:36,000
special uh by any accounts uh I I would

2574
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:38,079
love to see that happen and as you were

2575
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
talking about throwing in multiple you

2576
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:42,800
know all the different fenos to really

2577
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,760
get an idea yeah full field full field

2578
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:47,119
fresh Frozen full

2579
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:49,440
field

2580
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:52,079
yeah be nice I'm

2581
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:56,039
shifting I'm G to shift argrow outside

2582
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:59,079
next year into uh more strain selection

2583
01:46:56,039 --> 01:47:00,519
Fen well just you know many fenos same

2584
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:02,158
thing we're talking about was

2585
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,080
interesting to hear Gil talking about it

2586
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:06,920
I could see getting bored with it also

2587
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:10,000
perhaps but I am interested to see whole

2588
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:13,800
bed sets just go to one strain type um

2589
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,960
from my breeding with my Sharp for sure

2590
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:18,679
and then some headband Shi that I just

2591
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:21,239
read too are just dropping um amazing

2592
01:47:18,679 --> 01:47:24,199
amounts of hash and really good quality

2593
01:47:21,238 --> 01:47:27,399
and I just want to lock in more on the

2594
01:47:24,198 --> 01:47:31,839
the you know tpping profile to match up

2595
01:47:27,399 --> 01:47:31,839
to it you know up to the dump

2596
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:36,719
so yeah I like that you're rocking the

2597
01:47:35,319 --> 01:47:39,479
headband

2598
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:41,869
still I mean that's such a beautiful

2599
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:44,969
strain you know over the years

2600
01:47:41,869 --> 01:47:44,970
[Music]

2601
01:47:45,158 --> 01:47:51,319
and yeah it's Holy Grail like a breeding

2602
01:47:48,079 --> 01:47:53,519
Cornerstone for even things like my gas

2603
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:55,559
mask completely lends to that you know

2604
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:57,440
the mac and the kosher don't hurt but it

2605
01:47:55,560 --> 01:48:00,000
definitely goes back to the headband

2606
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:01,839
grease that that we pull and then to go

2607
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,198
back to the Bubble Bags you know that's

2608
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:07,880
like just pulling this greasy greasy

2609
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:11,039
dank resin we just washed a couple whole

2610
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:15,000
plant from the greenhouse for um cured

2611
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:17,840
resin dry flour wash from sunr and the

2612
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:21,118
the it's air dry but the nug like the 90

2613
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:24,000
to 120 coming off is so goopy that it

2614
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:25,880
has more oxidization on the crust uh you

2615
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,599
know outside of the bubble you know

2616
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:30,079
nuggets you can barely do anything if

2617
01:48:28,599 --> 01:48:32,840
you look at them they

2618
01:48:30,079 --> 01:48:34,760
melt and it was both the diesel band the

2619
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:36,880
headband just dropped it like that the

2620
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:39,039
DB Band came out a lot lighter less

2621
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:42,760
oxidization seemed like a little bit

2622
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:44,439
more quality grow but yeah amazing for a

2623
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:46,119
fuel type in Maine actually into the

2624
01:48:44,439 --> 01:48:48,319
greenhouse and it wasn't the prettiest

2625
01:48:46,118 --> 01:48:51,639
on the Finish but even just tended well

2626
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:53,639
by hand hand cut dry Barn storage for

2627
01:48:51,639 --> 01:48:56,560
two to three months you know controlled

2628
01:48:53,639 --> 01:48:59,359
temp humidity in the bin really clean

2629
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:01,800
take down but we do large whole plant

2630
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:05,198
sections we don't take any LEF much Leaf

2631
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:07,199
off after defoliation from you know into

2632
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:10,118
flower where we're opening up sights

2633
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:12,198
getting air we don't take anything off

2634
01:49:10,118 --> 01:49:16,158
really thereafter until you know it's

2635
01:49:12,198 --> 01:49:18,799
time to trim it by hand dry so great

2636
01:49:16,158 --> 01:49:22,719
results whole PL fried flour you know

2637
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:24,480
dry cured resin bubble lately like crazy

2638
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:26,760
I feel if I had I feel like if I had

2639
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:28,678
less of Integrity than I do I'd have

2640
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,480
these really cheesy kind of like this

2641
01:49:28,679 --> 01:49:33,639
conversation is brought to you by Bubble

2642
01:49:31,479 --> 01:49:35,238
Bags you know and have this whole sort

2643
01:49:33,639 --> 01:49:36,599
of cheesy advertisement in the middle

2644
01:49:35,238 --> 01:49:38,879
but the whole time you were talking I

2645
01:49:36,599 --> 01:49:42,400
just felt like man you are definitely a

2646
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:44,599
professional grower and hash maker like

2647
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:47,479
even just the way you explain your

2648
01:49:44,599 --> 01:49:50,000
process it's just like damn this guy's

2649
01:49:47,479 --> 01:49:54,118
like a lifer he's in

2650
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,118
this like iation

2651
01:49:54,319 --> 01:50:00,079
oxidization you're adding an extra

2652
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:04,238
syllable in there so just say

2653
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:07,639
oxidation everybody say oxidation

2654
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:09,238
oxidation oxidation thanks Dr Mark

2655
01:50:07,639 --> 01:50:11,760
keeping us

2656
01:50:09,238 --> 01:50:14,559
smarter uh Brian those photos look

2657
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:16,360
really incredible man uh tiger stripes

2658
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,080
gas mask uh is that what you're you're

2659
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:19,920
working with right now yeah got get up

2660
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:22,198
there

2661
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,359
and check that out yeah I'd love to

2662
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:26,000
share you know I'd love to share out

2663
01:50:24,359 --> 01:50:28,799
some genetics too I've been meaning to

2664
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:31,399
as well I did like some really nice work

2665
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,279
from the gas mask out I'm I'm super

2666
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:36,839
impressed with that

2667
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:39,479
shark um kind of like a comic name on it

2668
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:42,760
but it's what it is is it's it hits that

2669
01:50:39,479 --> 01:50:45,519
it's a lime cush GMO triangle cush skunk

2670
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:47,119
on on the other end for the sh key so

2671
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,760
we've seen that do amazing things for

2672
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:52,118
hash already on its own and it was a

2673
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:54,159
nice dude that went in on it it selected

2674
01:50:52,118 --> 01:50:55,519
dude from the crew for that's a swamp

2675
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:58,679
boy seeds

2676
01:50:55,520 --> 01:51:01,960
genetic and yeah we got like this lime

2677
01:50:58,679 --> 01:51:04,199
to apricot tur on the gas this time with

2678
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:06,840
that one phenotype it's definitely GMO

2679
01:51:04,198 --> 01:51:09,719
skunk heavy you know shout out to skunk

2680
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:12,639
skunk man it's got skunk all over it's

2681
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:15,719
kind of like a baby pukey sweet really

2682
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:18,560
really runchy sharp cheddar type

2683
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:20,319
thing and uh we'll see how it washes

2684
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:22,320
haven't washed quite yet what's the

2685
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:24,479
water on on these things like and you

2686
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:26,599
have again same question to you that I

2687
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,479
asked Marcus earlier what do you do with

2688
01:51:26,599 --> 01:51:30,599
the water is there anything you could do

2689
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:34,000
with it or you just discard it

2690
01:51:30,599 --> 01:51:36,119
or we're discarding it we're smaller

2691
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,319
batch when we do like Gil when we wash

2692
01:51:36,118 --> 01:51:40,598
we're we're not a big setup we're so low

2693
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:43,279
Tech honestly it's it's kind of funny

2694
01:51:40,599 --> 01:51:45,639
even but we're you know we're learning

2695
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:47,759
to bump up our volume our water goes to

2696
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:50,520
waste at this point we compost

2697
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:52,719
everything else we just really really

2698
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:56,360
love our compost so I know I could tell

2699
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:58,840
on the farm we we give waste to that but

2700
01:51:56,359 --> 01:52:01,158
um yeah haven't I I haven't dabbled into

2701
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:03,480
the water we've talked about the water

2702
01:52:01,158 --> 01:52:05,118
like how to isolate it chill it almost

2703
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:07,118
how to serve it if somebody were

2704
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,880
interested in wanting to actually drink

2705
01:52:07,118 --> 01:52:11,559
some of these things the fruity ones

2706
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,920
smell kind of good at some certain scale

2707
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:14,960
and again Marcus I don't know if you

2708
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:18,560
could comment to this but can you you

2709
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:22,840
could almost steam to still that that

2710
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:25,719
Turing I know where you're going

2711
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:28,560
listen this this takes us back okay this

2712
01:52:25,719 --> 01:52:31,480
takes us back to about maybe 2014 how

2713
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:35,159
old is Hash church are we like six years

old old right what the hell okay so get

2715
01:52:35,158 --> 01:52:40,238
this K from triome Technologies hits me

2716
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:42,879
up one day and he's like working with

2717
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:46,919
Sasha shulan doing TPS and stuff and he

2718
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:48,719
says listen I'm gonna give you a gold no

2719

2720
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:52,198
won't even reply to me when I hit him up

2721
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:54,639
and say please let's be friends like I'm

2722
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:56,319
so story like he when I partnered up

2723
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:59,039
with Tony that was like the ultimate

2724
01:52:56,319 --> 01:53:01,198
slap in his face selling the turps but

2725
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:05,319
listen it gets this is how it starts

2726
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:07,439
this is why and Kenny are pretty close

2727
01:53:05,319 --> 01:53:10,599
yeah yeah absolutely I also don't speak

2728
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:12,678
with Todd anymore so neither n nther

2729
01:53:10,599 --> 01:53:14,400
there what I wanted to say was

2730
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:16,840
this

2731
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:18,078
so he calls me up he tells me listen I'm

2732
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:20,279
going to give you a gold nugget you need

2733
01:53:18,078 --> 01:53:22,559
to figure out a way to get the tpin out

2734
01:53:20,279 --> 01:53:24,519
of the bubble water and like put back

2735
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,920
into the hash that's it you figure that

2736
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:27,440
out you're laughing and I was kind of

2737
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,039
like okay yeah that sounds you know like

2738
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:32,000
not like I haven't thought of that you

2739
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:36,439
know but and realize that I don't have

2740
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:41,039
the tools to get such a thing done so I

2741
01:53:36,439 --> 01:53:44,118
phone two people and I tell

2742
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:46,840
Tony and I tell

2743
01:53:44,118 --> 01:53:48,279
Horatio and I say Hey listen like you

2744
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:50,840
guys need to figure out how to get the

2745
01:53:48,279 --> 01:53:53,158
bubble water the tpin out of the bubble

2746
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:56,639
water you guys got access to labs and

2747
01:53:53,158 --> 01:53:58,759
you can do this get her done well this

2748
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:01,639
is only my guess but my guess is that

2749
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:06,199
Tony at the time was at a pretty big lab

2750
01:54:01,639 --> 01:54:07,520
visiting in uh Florida and I suspect he

2751
01:54:06,198 --> 01:54:09,078
was standing next to a chemist that

2752
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,199
worked in that lab and said hey how do

2753
01:54:09,078 --> 01:54:12,799
how could I get tpin off of plants and

2754
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:15,279
the guy was probably like you can steam

2755
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,159
distill them or hydrovac diffuse them as

2756
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:20,399
long as you use a chiller to precipitate

2757
01:54:17,158 --> 01:54:23,479
your uh your um your Vapor it'll

2758
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:25,479
precipitate clear instead of yellow cuz

2759
01:54:23,479 --> 01:54:28,238
it's generally in that process that it

2760
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:29,718
goes yellow which I didn't know uh but I

2761
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:31,198
talk to a chemist myself and that's what

2762
01:54:29,719 --> 01:54:33,480
they said and I see Mark waving his head

2763
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:34,889
up and down not interrupting me so he it

2764
01:54:33,479 --> 01:54:36,519
must be

2765
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:40,520
[Laughter]

2766
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:44,159
correct anyway Tony had like okay yeah

2767
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:46,159
Tony had turps like a week later but

2768
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:48,279
from FL he didn't even bother with the

2769
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:50,000
water maybe it was even two weeks later

2770
01:54:48,279 --> 01:54:51,279
but it was like we'd have to go back and

2771
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,639
we could look at hash church because

2772
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:54,920
that's how we'll be able to figure f it

2773
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:56,679
out but it was quick and then I called

2774
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:58,078
Horatio one more time and kind of busted

2775
01:54:56,679 --> 01:55:00,000
his balls and I was like hey you know

2776
01:54:58,078 --> 01:55:03,238
Tony's got the turps what's going on

2777
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,760
Horatio and he had them like I don't

2778
01:55:03,238 --> 01:55:07,359
know two or three days later and that

2779
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,119
started a whole thing which actually

2780
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:11,198
helped both of those guys and I think it

2781
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:13,960
helped the Cannabis world and all of us

2782
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:16,519
to have access to those Tarpin and this

2783
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:20,239
dipping river right Mark it started Blue

2784
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:21,800
River absolutely 100% of course that was

2785
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:24,118
the start of Blue River so it was a

2786
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:27,039
really neat thing that all started here

2787
01:55:24,118 --> 01:55:29,359
through through hash church and with Kay

2788
01:55:27,039 --> 01:55:30,719
and so you know at that point Kay was

2789
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:32,439
feeling that he I I don't know he said

2790
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:35,560
he had a patent or something on all the

2791
01:55:32,439 --> 01:55:37,759
ways you could make tpin with cannabis

2792
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:39,239
and and it just was it it just all went

2793
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,800
bad I felt really terrible about it

2794
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:42,598
because now I don't really speak to any

2795
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,520
of those guys and I kind of had you know

2796
01:55:42,599 --> 01:55:46,319
I had love for all of them I enjoyed

2797
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:49,639
talking with Todd I enjoyed talking with

2798
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:51,920
Tony I enjoyed uh talking with all of

2799
01:55:49,639 --> 01:55:53,760
those guys and so Kay especially Kay I'd

2800
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:55,800
known for almost 20 years we wrote for

2801
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:58,440
Redeye magazine together back in the day

2802
01:55:55,800 --> 01:56:00,639
when Nick was still alive and and doing

2803
01:55:58,439 --> 01:56:02,839
that so sometimes life plays out the way

2804
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,760
it does you know you can only help to uh

2805
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:07,639
figure it out and heal so I'm sure

2806
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:09,520
there'll be a time in life where we can

2807
01:56:07,639 --> 01:56:11,560
hopefully come to that point where it's

2808
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:13,159
just like because I know I play a part

2809
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,880
in it I don't pretend to think that I

2810
01:56:13,158 --> 01:56:17,479
don't go ahead Colin you guys will come

2811
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,840
back together man you will you guys were

2812
01:56:17,479 --> 01:56:22,919
too close

2813
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:26,319
man yeah I was there for it he thought

2814
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:29,639
that somehow in in Indra had gotten

2815
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:33,078
together with um there's a group out in

2816
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:34,679
California that was selling a cold trap

2817
01:56:33,078 --> 01:56:37,238
that people were hooking up to their

2818
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:39,279
vacuum ovens because for a long time

2819
01:56:37,238 --> 01:56:42,359
people didn't realize that these tpin

2820
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:44,198
are fleeting fleeting meaning that you

2821
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:46,679
pull them with your vacuum they're gone

2822
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:49,078
they're out the exhaust and so if you

2823
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:51,480
cold trap that and I don't know if you

2824
01:56:49,078 --> 01:56:54,279
remember this episode Mark there was an

2825
01:56:51,479 --> 01:56:56,238
episode of hash Church where Tony was

2826
01:56:54,279 --> 01:56:57,800
sitting in the lab for that episode and

2827
01:56:56,238 --> 01:57:00,000
he had the cold finger in the back but

2828
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:03,239
he was like really kind of like Hush

2829
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,840
Hush about showing exactly how he got

2830
01:57:03,238 --> 01:57:07,879
this we see he had a couple vials in

2831
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:10,279
front of him that he was dabbing but he

2832
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:12,880
didn't want to show his Tech when you

2833
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:14,158
know we it was funny because you're

2834
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,719
you're absolutely right the way you

2835
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:19,078
recall this timeline was absolutely

2836
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:22,719
correct because I had had several

2837
01:57:19,078 --> 01:57:22,719
multiple hourong

2838
01:57:24,599 --> 01:57:29,719
discussion where didn't include Canada

2839
01:57:27,639 --> 01:57:32,239
but he can call me and talk for

2840
01:57:29,719 --> 01:57:35,639
unlimited time so he would call me and

2841
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:38,479
we talk six to eight hours at a time and

2842
01:57:35,639 --> 01:57:41,078
I describ you know basically vacuum

2843
01:57:38,479 --> 01:57:44,158
distillation and cold traps and all that

2844
01:57:41,078 --> 01:57:47,399
and he figured it out and and

2845
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:50,598
um we I shared a lot of this with Tony

2846
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:54,118
because actually my coming on to Hash

2847
01:57:50,599 --> 01:57:59,199
church was at Horatio's insistence

2848
01:57:54,118 --> 01:58:02,559
because Tony was trying to talk [ __ ] on

2849
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:05,359
this whole turpine isolation thing and

2850
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:07,719
and Horatio was sending me Facebook

2851
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:11,118
messages saying Mark you gotta come on

2852
01:58:07,719 --> 01:58:13,399
Tony's talking [ __ ] on half church again

2853
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:14,920
you gota come on and set him straight he

2854
01:58:13,399 --> 01:58:17,439
never said that to me he just said oh I

2855
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:19,639
want to invite this this chemist Dr Mark

2856
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:21,598
on and I said all right man it's yeah

2857
01:58:19,639 --> 01:58:23,239
that's that's how I came on so how

2858
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:26,078
interesting that all these episodes

2859
01:58:23,238 --> 01:58:27,959
later here we are talking about it again

2860
01:58:26,078 --> 01:58:31,319
but you know still even at you know best

2861
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:33,000
friend's Farm level I mean I always feel

2862
01:58:31,319 --> 01:58:36,439
like you know whenever you I've only

2863
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,719
done small scale water hash production

2864
01:58:36,439 --> 01:58:40,719
and I always feel like man I I want to

2865
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:43,760
do something with I can't just like what

2866
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:46,239
do I throw this away no there's [ __ ] in

2867
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:49,520
there there's stuff in there that I

2868
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:52,959
want what are the right methods to

2869
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:54,800
isolate it and and use it

2870
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:57,198
okay what's this we're looking at here I

2871
01:58:54,800 --> 01:59:00,599
don't really have a comment as far as

2872
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:04,598
isolating the tpin out but from a living

2873
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:07,679
soil situation or perspective I had the

2874
01:59:04,599 --> 01:59:11,119
pleasure of working with Steve cwell um

2875
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:14,480
in NADA out of green life Productions in

2876
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:16,920
the beginning of December and he was so

2877
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:18,919
excited to just put it back into his

2878
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:21,560
soil that's what he wanted to do with

2879
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:25,039
the water and totally makes sense too

2880
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:26,480
right organic we loaded it right in you

2881
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:28,719
know yeah you know what I'm saying the

2882
01:59:26,479 --> 01:59:32,158
plants the plants respond to it

2883
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:35,719
dragonfly Earth medicine I mean tpes is

2884
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:38,158
just lowly fruit bacteria is all over

2885
01:59:35,719 --> 01:59:41,439
that [ __ ] in hours and that stuff is

2886
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:43,960
gone metabolized mineralized call what

2887
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:45,319
you will it ain't tpin anymore as soon

2888
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:48,239
as you add

2889
01:59:45,319 --> 01:59:51,319
soil some of the some of the cannaboids

2890
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:53,118
are hydrophobic so I would imagine Mark

2891
01:59:51,319 --> 01:59:54,679
that you you know I I've done some

2892
01:59:53,118 --> 01:59:57,118
experiments where you you just you

2893
01:59:54,679 --> 01:59:58,760
distill some things you distill it down

2894
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:00,279
and try to collect that and then you can

2895
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:03,760
use a little bit of that

2896
02:00:00,279 --> 02:00:05,960
material um to go back into have no

2897
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:08,480
problem breaking down hydrophobic [ __ ]

2898
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:11,399
hydrophobic hydrophilic they could break

2899
02:00:08,479 --> 02:00:14,519
down everything except carbon bonded

2900
02:00:11,399 --> 02:00:16,719
Florine they can't figure that out just

2901
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:18,760
yet you know they'll figure it out after

2902
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,039
a few hundred million years so I think

2903
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:23,320
tinctures and and other formulations

2904
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:25,719
that require the water since in my

2905
02:00:23,319 --> 02:00:29,519
setting I use all Ro everything's clean

2906
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:31,239
so it's clean in clean out um so you

2907
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,679
could you could use it in those those

2908
02:00:31,238 --> 02:00:36,718
specific use cases such as different SKS

2909
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:37,960
that have drinks or teas or imagine a

2910
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:39,639
tea you know that that would be

2911
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:42,078
something that you could definitely look

2912
02:00:39,639 --> 02:00:43,440
into um there's there's a lot and then

2913
02:00:42,078 --> 02:00:46,399
obviously feeding it back into your

2914
02:00:43,439 --> 02:00:47,638
system if you um if it checks all the

2915
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:49,519
boxes and you can do that in your

2916
02:00:47,639 --> 02:00:52,319
respective

2917
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:55,360
environment but that's what I've seen

2918
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:57,039
but uh yeah I think um if we had someone

2919
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:58,880
develop a system to kind of catch some

2920
02:00:57,039 --> 02:01:01,000
of this stuff I think it could be

2921
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:02,960
helpful I would imagine that would have

2922
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,840
a limited shelf life like you couldn't

2923
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:07,800
just formulate it into say like a drink

2924
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,800
and again just to go back to the GMP

2925
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:12,880
discussion you know trying to

2926
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:15,000
standardize production on basically a

2927
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:17,880
waste product something that's going to

2928
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,399
vary from batch to batch have

2929
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:22,440
inconsistent level of tpin because some

2930
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:25,158
things are more tpine Rich to and others

2931
02:01:22,439 --> 02:01:27,279
so not only will the tarpine profile of

2932
02:01:25,158 --> 02:01:29,399
what's in the water is going to change

2933
02:01:27,279 --> 02:01:31,679
but the amount is going to change and

2934
02:01:29,399 --> 02:01:34,399
for most Farms it may not be worth it

2935
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:37,239
again just to return it back to the soil

2936
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:38,960
is just a great utilization for it I

2937
02:01:37,238 --> 02:01:41,879
just imagine that again if you try to

2938
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:46,078
store it without preserving it it's

2939
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:49,760
gonna foul pretty quickly so that goes

2940
02:01:46,078 --> 02:01:51,920
back to it's a c item to cozies around

2941
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:54,079
the cans that get soaked with this

2942
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,319
material are probably going to end up

2943
02:01:54,078 --> 02:01:58,960
smelling pretty foul unless you clean

2944
02:01:56,319 --> 02:02:01,279
them out on a pretty regular basis so

2945
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:05,840
again that would be something that GMP

2946
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:08,679
would want a regular record of how often

2947
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,719
does that cozy get taken off that can

2948
02:02:08,679 --> 02:02:12,118
how often is it cleaned what's the

2949
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:16,359
procedure how do you know that it's

2950
02:02:12,118 --> 02:02:19,519
cleaned and you know so GMP just affects

2951
02:02:16,359 --> 02:02:21,519
your production on whole different scale

2952
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,639
that you know you don't necessarily

2953
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:27,400
think about when you're just doing small

2954
02:02:23,639 --> 02:02:28,760
scale Artisan type production absolutely

2955
02:02:27,399 --> 02:02:30,519
yeah I think the the product would have

2956
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:32,199
to be cold chain through and through to

2957
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:34,280
your point otherwise yeah it's going to

2958
02:02:32,198 --> 02:02:36,678
ferment there's going to be well not

2959
02:02:34,279 --> 02:02:40,639
only that but it Dam straight better be

2960
02:02:36,679 --> 02:02:43,679
like fully organic and regenerative and

2961
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:46,039
sustainable and not like poisoned out at

2962
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,399
any point in time because that's uh I

2963
02:02:46,039 --> 02:02:48,760
wouldn't want to be pouring that into my

2964
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:51,078
plants I wouldn't want to be drinking

2965
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:54,039
that I wouldn't want to you know I mean

2966
02:02:51,078 --> 02:02:55,759
definitely it's drinkable like right out

2967
02:02:54,039 --> 02:02:59,359
of the thing you can just drink the

2968
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:00,960
water I mean in in a regenerative sense

2969
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:02,439
right like that's the whole thing you're

2970
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,560
just like oh my God I just made tea

2971
02:03:02,439 --> 02:03:06,638
thank you I'm gonna drink this you know

2972
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:09,880
but you can we've carbonated it before

2973
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:12,039
too and made like beautiful carbonated

2974
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:15,880
hash water out of it and served it up

2975
02:03:12,039 --> 02:03:18,800
and gorgeous little champagne

2976
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:23,039
flu it was awesome have you fed it the

2977
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:26,239
animals I'm wondering if

2978
02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:26,238
water I

2979
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:32,239
think you broke up on us there did did

2980
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:32,239
you say you

2981
02:03:33,158 --> 02:03:38,000
fed I know we put it under the

2982
02:03:35,359 --> 02:03:41,960
microscope in Vegas me and Steve and a

2983
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:45,078
Jeff hello no we've been hey is he still

2984
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:47,359
with us go ahead go ahead go

2985
02:03:45,078 --> 02:03:52,118
ahead if you can

2986
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:52,118
go you it to animals

2987
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:59,599
yes okay never

2988
02:03:56,439 --> 02:04:02,879
mind go ahead

2989
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:04,440
Gil oh no sorry sorry uh I'm still new

2990
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:08,239
to this guys I'm not I'm not used to all

2991
02:04:04,439 --> 02:04:11,479
the group conversation on I apologize

2992
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:13,238
to the listeners but uh yeah no Steve

2993
02:04:11,479 --> 02:04:15,598
was really excited like I said give it

2994
02:04:13,238 --> 02:04:17,279
back to the plants and I'll say one time

2995
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:18,840
we were kind of like lazy about it I'm

2996
02:04:17,279 --> 02:04:20,719
not trying to like uh we left it in the

2997
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:22,559
machine overnight you know like and then

2998
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:25,279
cleaned it out the next day and I'll say

2999
02:04:22,559 --> 02:04:28,119
the water was drastically different than

3000
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:30,479
when the next time we evacuated it right

3001
02:04:28,118 --> 02:04:32,439
away out of the large vessel into a tea

3002
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:33,839
Brewer you know it was still very very

3003
02:04:32,439 --> 02:04:37,039
very cold obviously you know we were

3004
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:40,159
using it for ice extraction um and

3005
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:42,439
overnight we brewed it we arated it and

3006
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:45,158
when we came in there was stuff going on

3007
02:04:42,439 --> 02:04:47,078
in there it was it was fairly Barren but

3008
02:04:45,158 --> 02:04:48,598
like you'd find these little pockets of

3009
02:04:47,078 --> 02:04:50,118
these like you know little communities

3010
02:04:48,599 --> 02:04:53,400
starting to develop and we definitely

3011
02:04:50,118 --> 02:04:55,639
saw you know bailus Rod shaped Backus

3012
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:57,279
some Oculus again not definitely I'll

3013
02:04:55,639 --> 02:04:59,199
never say definitely because like I'm

3014
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:00,880
not really great at identifying stuff

3015
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:03,158
you know you got to really stare there

3016
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:04,880
and watch it move around for a while but

3017
02:05:03,158 --> 02:05:09,479
you saw some things you know what I mean

3018
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:13,239
and uh to me it was proing and it was

3019
02:05:09,479 --> 02:05:15,399
cool um obviously you can't really see

3020
02:05:13,238 --> 02:05:17,399
um tpin under the microscope per se you

3021
02:05:15,399 --> 02:05:21,198
know you're just seeing the biology but

3022
02:05:17,399 --> 02:05:24,399
uh the plants respond to it um instantly

3023
02:05:21,198 --> 02:05:26,678
like when uh he foler sprayed it um you

3024
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:28,598
see the plants love it he watered it in

3025
02:05:26,679 --> 02:05:30,359
um I thought it was cool he was really

3026
02:05:28,599 --> 02:05:32,400
into it to me it's just a way to keep

3027
02:05:30,359 --> 02:05:33,880
you know the loop closed def do

3028
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:36,000
something with the water rather than

3029
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:37,800
nothing but uh again I'm sure Mark can

3030
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,479
tell us some more stuff or tell me what

3031
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:42,760
I just said was possibly wrong well I I

3032
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:45,678
would I would just add that you know

3033
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:47,840
like depending on the volume of hash the

3034
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:49,559
ear washing and the size of bed or the

3035
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:54,679
size of soil that you're working with

3036
02:05:49,559 --> 02:05:57,320
there is a level of residue that kind

3037
02:05:54,679 --> 02:05:59,158
comes with having you know this water

3038
02:05:57,319 --> 02:06:00,719
you know so we found like if there you

3039
02:05:59,158 --> 02:06:02,439
know if you were say doing it every

3040
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:05,158
single day and every watering you were

3041
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:07,519
using was hash water you would start to

3042
02:06:05,158 --> 02:06:10,039
see a little residue develop on the top

3043
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:12,719
of the soil and we really find that

3044
02:06:10,039 --> 02:06:14,760
that's the overdone part of it we find

3045
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:16,960
that you know for like outdoor sungrown

3046
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:19,760
Gardens and what we're doing is if we're

3047
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:22,359
washing our own hash then we're we're

3048
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:24,960
putting the right amount of hash water

3049
02:06:22,359 --> 02:06:27,719
back into the soil if we were to be

3050
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:29,439
taking other people's hash or or other

3051
02:06:27,719 --> 02:06:31,920
people's material and turning into hash

3052
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:34,439
water maybe it would be too much but it

3053
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:36,679
seems like in a garden Clos Loop

3054
02:06:34,439 --> 02:06:39,519
situation if you're washing your own

3055
02:06:36,679 --> 02:06:42,679
plants then absolutely got to put all of

3056
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:46,239
that water back into the soil we've been

3057
02:06:42,679 --> 02:06:49,639
like drawing thousand foot 2000 foot

3058
02:06:46,238 --> 02:06:51,279
hoses forever from our washing stations

3059
02:06:49,639 --> 02:06:53,679
just to make sure that every single

3060
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:56,880
green Greenhouse is hit we do it all

3061
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:59,559
year long even now we'll be gravity feed

3062
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,840
ho hoses will just go from our you know

3063
02:06:59,559 --> 02:07:04,679
hash station down to the next greenhouse

3064
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:07,639
and whatnot and we're just locking in

3065
02:07:04,679 --> 02:07:10,599
you know that water but I do I do agree

3066
02:07:07,639 --> 02:07:13,520
this that that water definitely needs to

3067
02:07:10,599 --> 02:07:15,840
be used fresh it's like it's like cold

3068
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:17,599
pressed juice you know it's not

3069
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:19,840
something that you you let sit around

3070
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:22,039
because it is it's living especially if

3071
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:23,880
you're using fresh Frozen if you're

3072
02:07:22,039 --> 02:07:26,519
using fresh frozen then you're getting a

3073
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:28,800
lot of that bacteria and fungi and

3074
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:32,320
things that are in the plant you know in

3075
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:34,360
the water and and then when you use it

3076
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:36,960
uh I think that would be really smart to

3077
02:07:34,359 --> 02:07:39,078
to maybe use keer crystals and do some

3078
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:41,520
kind of a keer water fermentation with

3079
02:07:39,078 --> 02:07:44,359
that um another thing I would say is

3080
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,400
that we tried to use the leaf afterwards

3081
02:07:44,359 --> 02:07:49,198
because it's really easy to put the leaf

3082
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:52,158
back into a compost system or some kind

3083
02:07:49,198 --> 02:07:53,519
of you know top dress and a beautiful

3084
02:07:52,158 --> 02:07:56,679
thing but then I was like oh we should

3085
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:58,760
try and make bokashi from it um you know

3086
02:07:56,679 --> 02:08:01,039
so let's try and ferment it with lactic

3087
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:04,639
acid bacteria so that we can lock in

3088
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:06,399
this green living nutrient you know with

3089
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:07,279
this lactic acid but then we found it

3090
02:08:06,399 --> 02:08:10,519
got

3091
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:12,679
really uh sour fast and there was a lot

3092
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:14,440
of water in it so then we said oh let's

3093
02:08:12,679 --> 02:08:17,920
take the leaf and let's put it in an

3094
02:08:14,439 --> 02:08:20,359
apple press and press all the water out

3095
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:22,880
of it to try and get it as dry as

3096
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:25,719
possible so we making these like Leaf

3097
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:27,800
Pucks in the in the Apple press and then

3098
02:08:25,719 --> 02:08:29,679
pulling them out and then erating in it

3099
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:31,719
and it was like oh it was really nice

3100
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:36,199
but then we found we still needed to use

3101
02:08:31,719 --> 02:08:39,679
like half organic brand or some kind of

3102
02:08:36,198 --> 02:08:42,279
uh sawdust in with the green leaf in

3103
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:42,279
order to

3104
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:48,199
get fermentation because once you

3105
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:50,960
started putting that leaf back into a a

3106
02:08:48,198 --> 02:08:52,078
a a closed system some type of bag or

3107
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:56,118
some kind of

3108
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:58,319
and try and ferment itashi for future

3109
02:08:56,118 --> 02:09:00,479
fermentations it would just sour off

3110
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:02,558
because too much water it would it would

3111
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:05,279
have an an the Anor robic Anor robes

3112
02:09:02,559 --> 02:09:08,079
would come and overtake so you needed

3113
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:10,519
that that dryness and then a little bit

3114
02:09:08,078 --> 02:09:13,558
of like either sawdust or some type of

3115
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:15,440
brand some kind of brown material and

3116
02:09:13,559 --> 02:09:18,159
then saturate that with some kind of

3117
02:09:15,439 --> 02:09:20,118
lactic acid bacteria or em or some kind

3118
02:09:18,158 --> 02:09:23,000
of fermenting and that was the way we

3119
02:09:20,118 --> 02:09:26,759
had success from turning the Leaf into a

3120
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:29,479
bokashi and bokashi is just any brand or

3121
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:32,360
any Leaf fermented that's just a blanket

3122
02:09:29,479 --> 02:09:35,158
term for you know locking lactic acid

3123
02:09:32,359 --> 02:09:37,198
bacteria earlier ear you guys were

3124
02:09:35,158 --> 02:09:40,439
saying you know how is it that we can

3125
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:42,039
really save these tpin well we feel like

3126
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:43,719
as cultivators the way that we can save

3127
02:09:42,039 --> 02:09:46,359
the Tarpin is just give it back to the

3128
02:09:43,719 --> 02:09:48,359
soil because we've definitely noticed

3129
02:09:46,359 --> 02:09:50,759
you know since we've been doing that for

3130
02:09:48,359 --> 02:09:52,439
the last 15 I don't even know we've

3131
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:55,480
always given Back the Water it just

3132
02:09:52,439 --> 02:09:57,839
always made sense to us our tpine

3133
02:09:55,479 --> 02:10:00,558
profiles and our breeding and everything

3134
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:03,520
is just really well especially in a hug

3135
02:10:00,559 --> 02:10:05,679
hugle culture carbon Rich carbon

3136
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:08,920
sequestration bed system you're just

3137
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:11,000
like saturating it's this green turp

3138
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:13,880
water and this green turp water just

3139
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:17,279
wraps around all these rocks and sticks

3140
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:19,559
and stuff you're just like oh hell yeah

3141
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:22,359
that's my system you know what I mean

3142
02:10:19,559 --> 02:10:23,920
and it just turns into future crystals I

3143
02:10:22,359 --> 02:10:27,039
mean hopefully we have crystals in the

3144
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:30,000
soil to charge up the crystals in the

3145
02:10:27,039 --> 02:10:31,760
plant because they're all crystals and

3146
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,679
so that's the thing now we're going to

3147
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:37,920
start seeds really soon we should really

3148
02:10:34,679 --> 02:10:40,440
think about starting seeds on

3149
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:42,960
crystals feeding it with your hash water

3150
02:10:40,439 --> 02:10:44,598
right from the very beginning so right

3151
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:46,880
from the germination a little bit of

3152
02:10:44,599 --> 02:10:48,599
hash water because then you get to teach

3153
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:52,679
the plant where it's going to go later

3154
02:10:48,599 --> 02:10:55,800
in life why not well you're teaching the

3155
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:59,118
bacteria that's in between these

3156
02:10:55,800 --> 02:11:00,760
chemicals and the plant where it's going

3157
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:03,558
right

3158
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:06,280
right so yeah it's like the people who

3159
02:11:03,559 --> 02:11:08,079
germinate their seeds by you know

3160
02:11:06,279 --> 02:11:12,000
putting them in their mouths first and

3161
02:11:08,078 --> 02:11:15,880
letting the Amala enzymes and their

3162
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:19,279
saliva kind of like be the first you

3163
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:22,039
know moisture that actually gets inside

3164
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:23,960
the seed when it germinates people think

3165
02:11:22,039 --> 02:11:27,479
that again that's a way of sort of like

3166
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:29,679
personally putting your you know sort of

3167
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:31,198
thing on the plant but you know the

3168
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:33,559
thing that I always like about like what

3169
02:11:31,198 --> 02:11:36,919
you guys say is that everything you say

3170
02:11:33,559 --> 02:11:42,079
is that what you're you're sort of

3171
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:44,078
feeding this this chemical biome or this

3172
02:11:42,078 --> 02:11:46,439
chemom or whatever it is I mean it's

3173
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:48,840
like there's these chemicals and these

3174
02:11:46,439 --> 02:11:52,678
nutrients that are being

3175
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:56,400
supplied by the fungi by the bacteria

3176
02:11:52,679 --> 02:11:59,559
and fungi again just plays such a huge

3177
02:11:56,399 --> 02:12:02,198
enormous role in everything that we do

3178
02:11:59,559 --> 02:12:04,360
in this living world fungi are just

3179
02:12:02,198 --> 02:12:06,638
everywhere everywhere right and the

3180
02:12:04,359 --> 02:12:10,238
bacteria is just everywhere so it's like

3181
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:12,960
they play such a vital important role in

3182
02:12:10,238 --> 02:12:15,718
life itself and if we think again that

3183
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:18,000
we could somehow you know use

3184
02:12:15,719 --> 02:12:20,840
antimicrobial agents or disinfect

3185
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,520
ourselves to be completely clean we're

3186
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:25,039
we're were dreaming and that's just

3187
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:28,480
again a

3188
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:30,719
misnomer of you know people who want to

3189
02:12:28,479 --> 02:12:33,238
you know take an antibiotic as soon as

3190
02:12:30,719 --> 02:12:34,880
they get a sore throat because they

3191
02:12:33,238 --> 02:12:36,319
think that whatever they have it's

3192
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:38,319
something that's going to be cured by

3193
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:42,198
some pill and it's an antibiotics so I

3194
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:45,158
can take it that's no

3195
02:12:42,198 --> 02:12:47,960
good anyway I think if we're using the

3196
02:12:45,158 --> 02:12:51,238
hash water and the T TP water because we

3197
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:52,679
do it for the turps like Steve cwell um

3198
02:12:51,238 --> 02:12:55,879
I think that we're maybe feeding the

3199
02:12:52,679 --> 02:12:57,800
ganja terpenome I mean it's a biome you

3200
02:12:55,880 --> 02:13:01,319
know but it's a ganja terpenome because

3201
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:03,279
we're just recycling TPS but it's more

3202
02:13:01,319 --> 02:13:06,000
than that of course different than a

3203
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:07,920
misnomer a

3204
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,679
Tome

3205
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:15,000
maybe and maybe it's a TP

3206
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:17,760
gnome potentially you know on side notes

3207
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:20,158
on a side note I did watch Chile's son

3208
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:22,039
again the other day go through his tpes

3209
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:23,679
language I just like randomly cracked it

3210
02:13:22,039 --> 02:13:26,880
open and showed a bunch of people in my

3211
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:29,440
lab and they were just like whoa that is

3212
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:31,639
ridiculous who is that guy classic

3213
02:13:29,439 --> 02:13:33,719
Moment In Time classic Moment In Time

3214
02:13:31,639 --> 02:13:36,480
classic shout out to the

3215
02:13:33,719 --> 02:13:38,679
tpn is

3216
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:42,919
that Chile chil are you talking about

3217
02:13:38,679 --> 02:13:44,319
young turp young turp I am yeah yeah no

3218
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:46,199
that's awesome you know what's really

3219
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:48,719
funny about that you know I just cracked

3220
02:13:46,198 --> 02:13:51,719
up so much kind of uh you know whenever

3221
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:53,719
that is just going off um but you know

3222
02:13:51,719 --> 02:13:55,880
over um over the last many years we've

3223
02:13:53,719 --> 02:13:58,480
been uh kind of aggregating all our TP

3224
02:13:55,880 --> 02:14:00,480
data and we we've created uh what I've

3225
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:02,319
been joking we referring to as uh

3226
02:14:00,479 --> 02:14:03,238
Rosetta Stone to learn how to speak and

3227
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:05,599
teach

3228
02:14:03,238 --> 02:14:07,638
terpanes um you know which is a like a

3229
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:10,279
classification system that essentially

3230
02:14:07,639 --> 02:14:12,679
sorts tping by primary mono and sasco

3231
02:14:10,279 --> 02:14:14,198
tping content you know into the groups

3232
02:14:12,679 --> 02:14:16,000
that we see out there it's actually how

3233
02:14:14,198 --> 02:14:20,238
the emerald cup

3234
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:21,639
is going to be um judging flow this year

3235
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:23,439
so all all flower entries that are

3236
02:14:21,639 --> 02:14:25,319
entered the emerald cup are going to be

3237
02:14:23,439 --> 02:14:28,399
um chemotype right tested for Canabis

3238
02:14:25,319 --> 02:14:30,000
and turps and pre-sorted um into their

3239
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:31,920
primary turbing groups like all mine

3240
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,319
together mine all lmon together limine

3241
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:36,199
all tpine with terpinolene and then

3242
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:37,799
judges are going to get uh entries

3243
02:14:36,198 --> 02:14:40,118
anonymized that they're going to be

3244
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:42,679
judging within each class and kind of

3245
02:14:40,118 --> 02:14:44,880
choosing Best in Class um so it would be

3246
02:14:42,679 --> 02:14:47,480
top one two and three of each tpine

3247
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:49,400
group and then those Advan to the top 20

3248
02:14:47,479 --> 02:14:52,718
that essentially would be uh judged

3249
02:14:49,399 --> 02:14:54,439
heads up

3250
02:14:52,719 --> 02:14:58,000
wow how cool is

3251
02:14:54,439 --> 02:15:01,158
that that's pretty [ __ ] cool right

3252
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:03,840
that's super cool I want access yeah

3253
02:15:01,158 --> 02:15:06,439
we yeah we're stoked to kind of uh you

3254
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:09,679
know work with em Cup on that because uh

3255
02:15:06,439 --> 02:15:11,479
you know we see you know it's you um you

3256
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:13,078
know of the six primary groups you know

3257
02:15:11,479 --> 02:15:14,839
once you start seeing how all the data

3258
02:15:13,078 --> 02:15:17,238
sorts you start really identifying kind

3259
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:20,159
of what defines what what actually

3260
02:15:17,238 --> 02:15:22,118
defines Rarity versus overabundance you

3261
02:15:20,158 --> 02:15:24,598
know beyond just the hype strain of the

3262
02:15:22,118 --> 02:15:26,399
day name type kind of way that it goes

3263
02:15:24,599 --> 02:15:29,078
you know describing things as exotic

3264
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:30,598
this and that but um you know by you

3265
02:15:29,078 --> 02:15:32,639
know we're we're hoping that by sorting

3266
02:15:30,599 --> 02:15:34,078
it and kind of having judges judge it in

3267
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:36,679
that way you know we're helping to kind

3268
02:15:34,078 --> 02:15:38,719
of pay pay tribute to the real diversity

3269
02:15:36,679 --> 02:15:40,840
of what the plant has to offer you know

3270
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:42,920
because you see then kind of are able to

3271
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:45,078
give tribute to to these you know Ultra

3272
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:47,679
obscure rare profiles that you know not

3273
02:15:45,078 --> 02:15:48,960
only aren't really identified as rare

3274
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:51,039
but they're not even really they're

3275
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:53,039
they're kind of just masked you know in

3276
02:15:51,039 --> 02:15:55,760
in kind of the the way that the strain

3277
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:58,840
name name game goes you know all that

3278
02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:02,239
certain like aome take on the take on

3279
02:15:58,840 --> 02:16:05,000
the popularity of of March Madness you

3280
02:16:02,238 --> 02:16:08,078
know how people get all all excited

3281
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,599
about about that college basketball

3282
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:14,399
tournament that happens every March [ __ ]

3283
02:16:10,599 --> 02:16:16,679
that tournament dude T yeah and you can

3284
02:16:14,399 --> 02:16:18,479
almost have like teams rooting for

3285
02:16:16,679 --> 02:16:22,199
different Tes you know you have like the

3286
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:25,238
mercing team and the

3287
02:16:22,198 --> 02:16:28,919
T I'm on team tpin I don't know about

3288
02:16:25,238 --> 02:16:32,199

3291
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:39,840
but again Alec again Alec just not to

3292
02:16:38,359 --> 02:16:42,040
interrupt this is going to be quick I

3293
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:43,840
literally was thinking osine right

3294
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:46,519
before you said it and I know we had

3295
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:50,120
this happen last uh episode as well so

3296
02:16:46,519 --> 02:16:51,639
go go ahead and mention Michael book

3297
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:53,319
yeah

3298
02:16:51,638 --> 02:16:56,920
um yeah no I appreciate appreciate the

3299
02:16:53,318 --> 02:16:59,718
Mind meld we got going um but yeah o

3300
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:01,318
osine I like calling it aamine um you

3301
02:16:59,718 --> 02:17:03,159
know it's it's like a kind of sub

3302
02:17:01,318 --> 02:17:06,718
turpine that we see either track with

3303
02:17:03,159 --> 02:17:08,959
mirene or we see track with terpinolene

3304
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:10,919
you know and so so usually it's masks

3305
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:12,879
like there'll be like a huge mirr scene

3306
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:14,638
Peak you know and then like a third of

3307
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:17,438
the com third of the profile of the

3308
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:19,000
mirring peak will be awesom me you know

3309
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:21,359
but that profile all of a sudden makes

3310
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:24,040
up super

3311
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:25,880
Gunk mango papaya Dream Queen Green

3312
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:27,519
Crack In the Pines pineapple you know a

3313
02:17:25,879 --> 02:17:30,039
lot of that subtropical fruit type

3314
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:31,840
pineapple is what I associate it with

3315
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:35,040
yeah totally totally you know but it's

3316
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:38,478
really rare pineapple whenever I smell

3317
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:40,319
Pine yeah totally and uh and so we but

3318
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:44,438
we see it like less than one% of the

3319
02:17:40,318 --> 02:17:47,799
data um um we we'll see aamine as the

3320
02:17:44,439 --> 02:17:50,840
primary dominant tpine and there'll

3321
02:17:47,799 --> 02:17:52,879
be an absence of mirene you know and so

3322
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:54,840
so so we see certain you know kind of uh

3323
02:17:52,879 --> 02:17:56,000
you know recessive fenos isolated from

3324
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:57,960
certain things like in the Pines

3325
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,040
pineapple um just like you're describing

3326
02:17:57,959 --> 02:18:02,318
that will be yeah awesome and dominant

3327
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:03,920
without mirene um and then we you know

3328
02:18:02,318 --> 02:18:07,318
like uh in the emerald cup a few years

3329
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:09,799
ago um green shock farms uh gentleman

3330
02:18:07,318 --> 02:18:11,558
named Mark he he won a most unique turp

3331
02:18:09,799 --> 02:18:13,599
Award with a stream called tropical

3332
02:18:11,558 --> 02:18:15,679
sleigh ride and it was an awesome IND

3333
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:17,040
dominant Peak um but yeah so that

3334
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:18,280
represents you know because we see what

3335
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:21,960
the way we see it all kind of sort and

3336
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:24,000
break down is Mir scene

3337
02:18:21,959 --> 02:18:26,279
you know like is the most overabundant

3338
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,280
turpine it's like it represents like 43%

3339
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:30,719
of all the profiles of what we see um

3340
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:33,800
you know so a lot of mering in that way

3341
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:38,879
um and then um then we see Cara offing

3342
02:18:33,799 --> 02:18:42,079
is about 23% of the data um uh um loning

3343
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:43,358
is about 16 177% of the data but and but

3344
02:18:42,079 --> 02:18:46,718
what what you'll notice is lmon and

3345
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:48,800
kopling usually track together so a lot

3346
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:52,199
of the most

3347
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:54,638
popular TRS right now now the gelato

3348
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:57,040
kind of wedding cak TR dessert type Prof

3349
02:18:54,638 --> 02:18:59,159
it en lening and Carling but together

3350
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:01,439
those turs are Up Is Down about 37% of

3351
02:18:59,159 --> 02:19:04,200
the data um so they're getting close to

3352
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:05,559
me and you know I I speculate that this

3353
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:07,319
year you know because you see it happen

3354
02:19:05,558 --> 02:19:08,879
with the name game the way it happens

3355
02:19:07,318 --> 02:19:10,799
you know a certain strain like gelato

3356
02:19:08,879 --> 02:19:12,598
will get incredibly popular and then a

3357
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:14,358
few years later everybody's growing 10

3358
02:19:12,599 --> 02:19:17,599
acres of it you know or I mean in

3359
02:19:14,359 --> 02:19:22,239
literally like I guess literally in this

3360
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:22,239
new licensed world

3361
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:29,199
you know and so so

3362
02:19:26,159 --> 02:19:31,239
so in this hard you know the market as

3363
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,359
that profile you know it better be

3364
02:19:31,239 --> 02:19:35,519
really exemplary you know kind to even

3365
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,719
be able to be sold you know and so so

3366
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:38,079
you know kind of we're trying to hope

3367
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:39,598
we're hoping that you know the way that

3368
02:19:38,079 --> 02:19:41,599
we we're coming to understand the way

3369
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:44,040
Turing sword can help in diversifying a

3370
02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:45,840
portfolio to not get stuck in this like

3371
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:48,040
you know narrow game of you know kind of

3372
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:49,680
getting caught up in the floods but yeah

3373
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:52,280
so so anyway so sorry so there's miring

3374
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:54,840
43% of the data kopling lyine together

3375
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:57,640
is about 37% of the data then

3376
02:19:54,840 --> 02:20:02,040
terpinolene um is represents 10% of the

3377
02:19:57,639 --> 02:20:04,358
data um um Alpha pining so turpening

3378
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:08,439
like the Jack train re Sage Durban you

3379
02:20:04,359 --> 02:20:11,200
know uh Super Lemon Haze like the

3380
02:20:08,439 --> 02:20:14,398
very a t type

3381
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:16,800
turp um and then P Alpha Pine smell

3382
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:18,159
represents about 6% of the data and

3383
02:20:16,799 --> 02:20:20,199
that's really rare oftentimes people

3384
02:20:18,159 --> 02:20:21,920
will confuse pining with turpening tpine

3385
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:24,280
kind of smells little piny but you know

3386
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:25,520
all those strains kind of the Jack train

3387
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:28,000
Rec

3388
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:29,680
Sage don't have any pining at all in

3389
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,398
them pretty much but but then there's

3390
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:33,439
actually true Pine smell where it's

3391
02:20:31,398 --> 02:20:34,959
similar to the aamine it'll be you know

3392
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:37,000
because usually when pining is present

3393
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:38,919
similar to aamine um it's it's in the

3394
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,760
ABS or it's it's it's masked by the

3395
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:41,879
amount of Meine so there a lot of Meine

3396
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:44,120
and a little bit of pining and that's

3397
02:20:41,879 --> 02:20:46,599
like blue dream and streams like that um

3398
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:48,800
but it's really it's like less than 6%

3399
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:51,000
of the data when it's pining dominant

3400
02:20:48,799 --> 02:20:52,519
without miring so we'll see C trains

3401
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,680
that'll be like the top three turbin

3402
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:56,520
will be Pine Alpha pining lmon beta

3403
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:58,880
pining you know that's a really

3404
02:20:56,520 --> 02:21:00,720
fascinating profile too because pining

3405
02:20:58,879 --> 02:21:02,358
when together with THC helps to decrease

3406
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:05,159
the negative memory impairment effects

3407
02:21:02,359 --> 02:21:06,960
that THC has in short term um so you

3408
02:21:05,159 --> 02:21:11,398
know that's just a rare profile overall

3409
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:11,398
so like six% and then there's the aamine

3410
02:21:12,159 --> 02:21:16,600
Prof which is 1% you know when so but

3411
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:18,640
that's you know we we pretty much see

3412
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:21,318
you know from the 160,000 tping tests

3413
02:21:18,639 --> 02:21:23,559
that we've done since 2013 2013

3414
02:21:21,318 --> 02:21:25,318
um when we sort worked to sort it all

3415
02:21:23,559 --> 02:21:27,279
and uh with with some bioin from

3416
02:21:25,318 --> 02:21:29,719
mattis's help uh we came to see that

3417
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:31,439
there's yeah six primary tping groups

3418
02:21:29,719 --> 02:21:34,239
that really are defined by the mon monot

3419
02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:36,559
Turing content um beta care offlin is

3420
02:21:34,239 --> 02:21:40,159
the only dominant tping that's a that's

3421
02:21:36,559 --> 02:21:41,398
not a monot A tes turpine um but but so

3422
02:21:40,159 --> 02:21:42,719
we see six primary groups and each

3423
02:21:41,398 --> 02:21:45,358
primary group has like two to three

3424
02:21:42,719 --> 02:21:48,358
subgroups but we really see about like

3425
02:21:45,359 --> 02:21:48,359
yeah like 13

3426
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:52,319
to archetype profiles pretty much

3427
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:54,279
dominate everything we've ever tested in

3428
02:21:52,318 --> 02:21:55,318
California and Oregon you know across

3429
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:57,960
our data

3430
02:21:55,318 --> 02:22:01,920
set but

3431
02:21:57,959 --> 02:22:06,239
um yeah go ramble on about

3432
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:08,200
that which one is a canabo anot

3433
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:13,079
turpine

3434
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:16,760
um beta yeah yeah beta caropine is

3435
02:22:13,079 --> 02:22:19,600
a antagonist but that doesn't mean it's

3436
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:21,280
a I I guess you know again you should

3437
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:24,280
draw the distinction

3438
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:26,200
not based on what biological receptors

3439
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:28,520
molecules bind to but what the

3440
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:31,640
structures are themselves and just

3441
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:35,520
because you know beta copyline has

3442
02:22:31,639 --> 02:22:39,079
activity on CB2 doesn't mean it's a

3443
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,880
canono it's canono receptor antagonist

3444
02:22:39,079 --> 02:22:42,719
but you know yeah yeah it's the only

3445
02:22:40,879 --> 02:22:46,079
turpine that's known to bind to an endoc

3446
02:22:42,719 --> 02:22:47,959
canabo receptor I think so I think so I

3447
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:51,639
think there's some other analoges that

3448
02:22:47,959 --> 02:22:54,559
are related to bet caropine so humulene

3449
02:22:51,639 --> 02:22:57,439
I think also has some activity like that

3450
02:22:54,559 --> 02:22:59,000
and I think that the other oh uh it's a

3451
02:22:57,439 --> 02:23:01,559
kopine

3452
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,159
oxide which I think and isn't yeah

3453
02:23:01,559 --> 02:23:06,039
totally and isn't isn't

3454
02:23:03,159 --> 02:23:08,600
talene like the isomer of beta car did

3455
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:11,760
you just say that yeah hum yeah yeah

3456
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:13,640
humulene and beta kopine are related to

3457
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:15,719
each other in the fact that exactly

3458
02:23:13,639 --> 02:23:19,039
right Alec they're isomers of one

3459
02:23:15,719 --> 02:23:21,639
another and beta copyline has a very

3460
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:24,680
peculiar four meem ring with a very

3461
02:23:21,639 --> 02:23:27,559
large other ring where huming itself

3462
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:29,720
just as one large ring so it's the same

3463
02:23:27,559 --> 02:23:31,879
atoms it's same Tinker Toys just

3464
02:23:29,719 --> 02:23:35,760
connected at different spots Mark

3465
02:23:31,879 --> 02:23:38,639
doesn't it have three uh isoprene units

3466
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:42,000
yeah which makes s yes yeah yeah it's a

3467
02:23:38,639 --> 02:23:44,559
it's a it's a CES turpine I think Al

3468
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:48,920
properly said that yeah so SES Turpin

3469
02:23:44,559 --> 02:23:51,559
are c15s not c10s right and

3470
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:53,840
what's what's really

3471
02:23:51,559 --> 02:23:56,519
fasinating

3472
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:57,719
about from what we see is kind of point

3473
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:59,279
over station's been going you know the

3474
02:23:57,719 --> 02:24:00,679
tpes are precious and they they're

3475
02:23:59,279 --> 02:24:01,720
fleeting you know kind of depending on

3476
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:03,559
how they're car they're they're cared

3477
02:24:01,719 --> 02:24:05,959
for and preserved and you know the most

3478
02:24:03,559 --> 02:24:07,680
of the primary attributes that

3479
02:24:05,959 --> 02:24:09,159
contribute to the secondary metabolite

3480
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:11,720
expression of the turpine content in the

3481
02:24:09,159 --> 02:24:14,520
strain you know are the monot Turpin so

3482
02:24:11,719 --> 02:24:16,920
Li so loning Meine pining terpinolene

3483
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:18,520
and aamine and like Len I mean there you

3484
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:20,040
know which are some subt Turpin and

3485
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:22,399
they're they're all monot Turpin and so

3486
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:23,800
those are the quickest to go away at the

3487
02:24:22,398 --> 02:24:24,879
lowest temperatures even at room

3488
02:24:23,799 --> 02:24:28,959
temperature they

3489
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:31,000
can monoid though right so little rule

3490
02:24:28,959 --> 02:24:33,000
is the exception to what you said right

3491
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:37,559
totally thank you I appreciate that

3492
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:42,639
turine because it has a oxygen on it

3493
02:24:37,559 --> 02:24:44,439
it's reacted with water so it it's a uh

3494
02:24:42,639 --> 02:24:47,559
it's what we call a

3495
02:24:44,439 --> 02:24:50,920
turpenoid because you could call it a

3496
02:24:47,559 --> 02:24:54,519
tpol alloid t turpo

3497
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:58,600
so geraniol is also another example C

3498
02:24:54,520 --> 02:25:02,000
camper yeah um uh uh eucalyptol these

3499
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:05,439
are all alcohols that are derived from

3500
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:08,159
tpin reacting with water and now

3501
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:11,398
incorporating the water molecule into

3502
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:13,920
the structure of the compound to create

3503
02:25:11,398 --> 02:25:17,599
a what's called a hydroxy group which is

3504
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:21,398
notably an alcohol right well and and

3505
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:24,680
and and you so so and and

3506
02:25:21,398 --> 02:25:25,639
to to kind of wrap that you know so so

3507
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:29,159
you know really you know so we're

3508
02:25:25,639 --> 02:25:33,159
testing for like 36 uh tpin um and

3509
02:25:29,159 --> 02:25:34,879
terpenoids U um at SC labs and you know

3510
02:25:33,159 --> 02:25:36,840
essentially across our entire data set

3511
02:25:34,879 --> 02:25:38,959
we really see about five to nine turpins

3512
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:41,760
to find you know

3513
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:44,000
95 percent of the profile of every

3514
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:45,760
turpine test we've ever ran right and so

3515
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,920
you know we test for eucalyptol and kind

3516
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:51,800
of geranial and certain things um but

3517
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:53,920
you know um they're

3518
02:25:51,799 --> 02:25:56,119
you know tpin you'll signy amounts kind

3519
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,879
of that complement the pro profile but

3520
02:25:56,120 --> 02:26:00,399
most of these tpin you show up in pretty

3521
02:25:57,879 --> 02:26:01,759
much non you know non-detect amounts um

3522
02:26:00,398 --> 02:26:03,719
so it's really fascinating to be able to

3523
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:05,398
start to characterize you know kind of

3524
02:26:03,719 --> 02:26:07,000
and sort you know kind of everything

3525
02:26:05,398 --> 02:26:08,680
we've tested by these you know really

3526
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,600
five to nine turpins that Define the

3527
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:12,960
primary and subgroupings and how it

3528
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:15,159
happens but but kind of um just to kind

3529
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:17,039
of wrap the point on how precious tpin

3530
02:26:15,159 --> 02:26:19,239
are you know um we see really like from

3531
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:21,439
the time of

3532
02:26:19,239 --> 02:26:22,600
harvest you

3533
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:23,720
know

3534
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:25,760
[Music]

3535
02:26:23,719 --> 02:26:28,318
through you

3536
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:30,600
know you know kind of harv like from the

3537
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:32,439
time of dry to or harvest to cure you

3538
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:33,880
know so it's like what time of day are

3539
02:26:32,439 --> 02:26:35,279
you harvesting you harvesting the middle

3540
02:26:33,879 --> 02:26:36,639
of the sun you harvesting in the middle

3541
02:26:35,279 --> 02:26:38,040
of the night kind of around the full

3542
02:26:36,639 --> 02:26:40,478
moon kind of thing you I think I was

3543
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:43,319
hitting on this before um on uh you know

3544
02:26:40,478 --> 02:26:44,639
I think last week maybe um but then but

3545
02:26:43,318 --> 02:26:46,359
then what are the conditions that are

3546
02:26:44,639 --> 02:26:47,959
being pres that that are taken to

3547
02:26:46,359 --> 02:26:50,040
preserve these monot Turpin because

3548
02:26:47,959 --> 02:26:52,559
they're the ones that are so fleeting

3549
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:56,000
and um and how they been being extracted

3550
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:59,039
and all that but but but just um I did I

3551
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:03,079
did I mention schwag flag last

3552
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:04,760
week no all right cool right so so so

3553
02:27:03,079 --> 02:27:06,840
yeah I didn't want to be very redundant

3554
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:08,439
so so it was fascinating because when we

3555
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:11,359
started aggregating all this turpine

3556
02:27:08,439 --> 02:27:13,960
data that we've tested over the past um

3557
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:15,680
you know kind of since 2013 um you know

3558
02:27:13,959 --> 02:27:17,799
there was you know everything was

3559
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:20,239
sorting in the primary kind of secondary

3560
02:27:17,799 --> 02:27:22,438
groupings that we saw everything you

3561
02:27:20,239 --> 02:27:25,478
know kind of very um predictably Sor

3562
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:28,398
into and um and and then we we had like

3563
02:27:25,478 --> 02:27:30,478
an outlier Trigger or like or an outlier

3564
02:27:28,398 --> 02:27:32,760
flag so if anything if there was a

3565
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:35,119
profile that didn't match kind of these

3566
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:37,680
these very predictable groupings then it

3567
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:39,800
would be flagged for secondary review

3568
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:41,559
and and that's where I was most excited

3569
02:27:39,799 --> 02:27:42,759
to kind of really dive into the data

3570
02:27:41,559 --> 02:27:45,478
because I was like oh man that's where

3571
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:48,680
the most trippy land race obscure like

3572
02:27:45,478 --> 02:27:52,639
turpine profiles are going to be

3573
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:58,559
and and um and like in within that you

3574
02:27:52,639 --> 02:28:00,358
know that that that dat that I was um

3575
02:27:58,559 --> 02:28:04,119
you know there there was a tiny

3576
02:28:00,359 --> 02:28:08,359
percentage of that data that were super

3577
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:11,399
defined aamine or pining Ling

3578
02:28:08,359 --> 02:28:13,840
ping type like really rare Pro Data in

3579
02:28:11,398 --> 02:28:16,318
there is was the artifact of what we've

3580
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:18,439
come to determine a schwag right and so

3581
02:28:16,318 --> 02:28:20,239
so so basically when all the monot

3582
02:28:18,439 --> 02:28:23,479
Turpin and cesco Turpin that really

3583
02:28:20,239 --> 02:28:27,000
Define the value of the profile have

3584
02:28:23,478 --> 02:28:29,079
gone away and volatilized or or degraded

3585
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,840
then the only Turpin that remain are

3586
02:28:29,079 --> 02:28:35,079
these highest of boiling point turpins

3587
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:38,680
that end in an O so like neurol bisol

3588
02:28:35,079 --> 02:28:42,159
guol FAL right so so so we came to

3589
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:45,680
create this like um this this this

3590
02:28:42,159 --> 02:28:47,840
uh yeah well so so so basically

3591
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:51,559
whenever I love it the swag I want to

3592
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:55,159
see the swag yeah swag swag flag so so

3593
02:28:51,559 --> 02:28:56,439
so yeah so so we so basically um yeah

3594
02:28:55,159 --> 02:28:58,239
whenever all the mono and cesco turbines

3595
02:28:56,439 --> 02:29:00,159
are gone there's a condition that we see

3596
02:28:58,239 --> 02:29:02,159
and it's basically the pro it'll be tot

3597
02:29:00,159 --> 02:29:05,000
less than half a percent total tpine

3598
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:07,520
content in the material and the only

3599
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:09,639
tpin that are high or kind of you know

3600
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:11,840
showing in the expression of the tpping

3601
02:29:09,639 --> 02:29:13,840
profile are these tping so yeah so

3602
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:16,159
that's just so so but we just thought

3603
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:18,079
that was really fascinating because you

3604
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:21,110
know it just kind of really dug into

3605
02:29:18,079 --> 02:29:25,690
just uh

3606
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:25,690
[Music]

3607
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,359
discover I mean it's always how precious

3608
02:29:28,639 --> 02:29:32,039
the turpins are and how they are really

3609
02:29:30,359 --> 02:29:34,040
what Define quality you know the

3610
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:36,120
presence of them with THC and the

3611
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:37,520
cannaboids and the relation the ratio

3612
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:39,600
but whenever the tpin I mean it could

3613
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:42,640
test 35% THC but it could have the swag

3614
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:45,000
flag turpins and guess

3615
02:29:42,639 --> 02:29:46,959
what that's like a 90 to1 turpine to

3616
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,120
canabo cannaboid turpine ratio that's

3617
02:29:46,959 --> 02:29:49,679
like that to me that's what defines

3618
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:51,359
biomass you know like there's no more

3619
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:55,279
value to represent that material in the

3620
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:59,200
market other than than to distill it

3621
02:29:55,279 --> 02:30:01,520
right know and so but if it's like THC

3622
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:02,960
but it was like harvested it was if it

3623
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:04,479
was grown in living soil and

3624
02:30:02,959 --> 02:30:06,398
regenerative conditions and the

3625
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:08,679
secondary metabolite production doubled

3626
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:10,599
and there's like 5% tpin in the dry

3627
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:12,800
flour because it was you know harvested

3628
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:15,159
around the full moon at night and dried

3629
02:30:12,799 --> 02:30:17,799
cured preserved immaculately you know

3630
02:30:15,159 --> 02:30:20,959
that's like 5% turps and dried flour so

3631
02:30:17,799 --> 02:30:27,519
like 15% that's a 3 to1 canab Turing

3632
02:30:20,959 --> 02:30:29,799
ratio right now how how does play a ro

3633
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:32,600
offer and

3634
02:30:29,799 --> 02:30:35,719
nothing totally I mean you know they're

3635
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:37,120
definitely having a role in the flavor

3636
02:30:35,719 --> 02:30:39,398
um and you know kind of you know the

3637
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:41,760
overall kind of bouquet I I guess like

3638
02:30:39,398 --> 02:30:43,760
um for your I guess your you know your

3639
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:46,880
your that type that area of your sensory

3640
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:48,880
system um but we we are starting to

3641
02:30:46,879 --> 02:30:52,879
develop some testing for additional tpin

3642
02:30:48,879 --> 02:30:58,559
and um some Trace compounds like

3643
02:30:52,879 --> 02:31:00,119
flavonoid and th and um but um but yeah

3644
02:30:58,559 --> 02:31:03,318
it's it's interesting because you know

3645
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:05,279
we see you know like of everything we've

3646
02:31:03,318 --> 02:31:07,600
tested you know we're like we're we're

3647
02:31:05,279 --> 02:31:09,239
we're separating and identifying the

3648
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:11,200
primary majority of everything that's

3649
02:31:09,239 --> 02:31:13,039
there in the chromatogram you know but

3650
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:15,120
but time you will see these little

3651
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:16,279
unknown kind of tiny Peaks you know in

3652
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:18,079
the chromatograms of these certain

3653
02:31:16,279 --> 02:31:20,239
things that we're not testing for you

3654
02:31:18,079 --> 02:31:22,200
know because each tpine it each time we

3655
02:31:20,239 --> 02:31:25,000
test

3656
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:27,319
tures you know we we we have a runtime

3657
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:29,520
you see Columns of over 90 minutes per

3658
02:31:27,318 --> 02:31:32,119
test per sample you know and we do that

3659
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:33,720
so we can get as much separation of each

3660
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:35,960
compound so that we can see all the

3661
02:31:33,719 --> 02:31:37,760
trait you know so we have no Co illusion

3662
02:31:35,959 --> 02:31:39,398
and then we can make sure that each Peak

3663
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:41,079
and each you know is is what we're

3664
02:31:39,398 --> 02:31:42,439
actually testing for but you know from

3665
02:31:41,079 --> 02:31:44,760
time to time yeah we do see these little

3666
02:31:42,439 --> 02:31:46,398
certain Trace peaks of certain compounds

3667
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:48,639
you know and my my one of my partners

3668
02:31:46,398 --> 02:31:50,799
Jeff Gray he kind of it's interesting

3669
02:31:48,639 --> 02:31:52,559
because he Likens it to

3670
02:31:50,799 --> 02:31:53,478
you know if you if you're making a soup

3671
02:31:52,559 --> 02:31:55,519
you know and you have all these

3672
02:31:53,478 --> 02:31:57,879
ingredients and spices you know it's

3673
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:59,159
like you c c there all things aren't

3674
02:31:57,879 --> 02:32:00,478
created equal because you know you can

3675
02:31:59,159 --> 02:32:02,600
take a teaspoon of salt and throw it

3676
02:32:00,478 --> 02:32:04,639
into the soup and maybe barely affect

3677
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:06,520
the taste but you could take a teaspoon

3678
02:32:04,639 --> 02:32:08,000
of cumin and throw it in the soup and it

3679
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:10,120
just completely changed the overall

3680
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,819
profile right you know and so so even

3681
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:12,960
though these certain Trace kind of

3682
02:32:11,819 --> 02:32:15,879
[Music]

3683
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:18,358
compounds might not like make up the

3684
02:32:15,879 --> 02:32:20,639
profile you know clearly they are having

3685
02:32:18,359 --> 02:32:22,079
huge contributions to the overall you

3686
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:23,760
know flavor and Aroma you know certain

3687
02:32:22,079 --> 02:32:27,600
things like you know there it's believed

3688
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:30,318
that like the the gas the fu gas skunk

3689
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:32,479
turp are are in fact skunk turps you

3690
02:32:30,318 --> 02:32:34,278
know like like thols are skunk T are

3691
02:32:32,478 --> 02:32:36,199
Turpin from skunk and so you know

3692
02:32:34,279 --> 02:32:38,040
because you could take the OG kush or

3693
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:39,680
gorilla glue or what have you profile

3694
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:41,399
headband profile and you know you could

3695
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:42,960
recreate that you know mixing Botanical

3696
02:32:41,398 --> 02:32:47,199
turps or what have you you're not even

3697
02:32:42,959 --> 02:32:50,839
getting close the smell of of that gas

3698
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:53,319
fely kind of type Prof

3699
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:56,559
right yeah I've never so it's certain

3700
02:32:53,318 --> 02:32:59,439
things maybe you know that are doing

3701
02:32:56,559 --> 02:33:02,000
that so it sounds to me like your your

3702
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:04,120
your correlation between Harvest times

3703
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:06,398
uh temperature relative humidity in

3704
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:09,279
which you're you're uh you're drying and

3705
02:33:06,398 --> 02:33:10,920
your Cur is um play a major role in all

3706
02:33:09,279 --> 02:33:13,239
the different varietal that you're

3707
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:15,559
seeing come through and all the

3708
02:33:13,239 --> 02:33:17,799
different test that you're seeing um

3709
02:33:15,559 --> 02:33:20,239
across the board through the years it's

3710
02:33:17,799 --> 02:33:23,438
now I have a question are are certain

3711
02:33:20,239 --> 02:33:25,879
varieties uh historically just speaking

3712
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:28,439
Broad Leaf and narrow Leaf uh are you

3713
02:33:25,879 --> 02:33:30,559
seeing the hybrids or certain varieties

3714
02:33:28,439 --> 02:33:32,200
that come through um test higher

3715
02:33:30,559 --> 02:33:34,799
consistency because I would imagine that

3716
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:36,920
you're seeing many different types of

3717
02:33:34,799 --> 02:33:39,438
quote unquote headbands come come

3718
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:41,079
through um and many different types of

3719
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:43,398
test results come through because of all

3720
02:33:41,079 --> 02:33:45,478
these said you know points that you

3721
02:33:43,398 --> 02:33:48,119
you've brought up such as you know the

3722
02:33:45,478 --> 02:33:51,278
medium when you actually Harvest it how

3723
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:53,160
long you know it went for um is there

3724
02:33:51,279 --> 02:33:57,960
anything that you you can share that

3725
02:33:53,159 --> 02:33:59,799
you've seen um that may point to uh uh a

3726
02:33:57,959 --> 02:34:02,278
more hey you should do more of this and

3727
02:33:59,799 --> 02:34:02,278
less of

3728
02:34:03,279 --> 02:34:09,040
that um well so on the on the expression

3729
02:34:06,959 --> 02:34:12,639
side of things of

3730
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:15,600
within the plant you know I mean that's

3731
02:34:12,639 --> 02:34:17,318
where kind of I've so much like love and

3732
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:20,120
respect you know for the reality of the

3733
02:34:17,318 --> 02:34:23,119
soil food web and Dr laning gam and and

3734
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:25,720
and just how much kind of cannabis

3735
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:28,399
Farmers have really put you know organic

3736
02:34:25,719 --> 02:34:30,478
farming potential and how to grow the

3737
02:34:28,398 --> 02:34:32,159
how to grow plants optimally by

3738
02:34:30,478 --> 02:34:34,000
understanding the soil microbiology it's

3739
02:34:32,159 --> 02:34:35,520
like that I mean we I feel like ganing

3740
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
gums kind of received like Saint status

3741
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:38,640
from you know cannabis Farmers that have

3742
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:40,200
now brought her so much more legitimacy

3743
02:34:38,639 --> 02:34:42,239
as

3744
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:43,880
a microbiologist in the world of

3745
02:34:42,239 --> 02:34:45,639
microbiology than she's ever had you

3746
02:34:43,879 --> 02:34:46,719
know and is helping to elevate the

3747
02:34:45,639 --> 02:34:48,159
potential of farming you know and she

3748
02:34:46,719 --> 02:34:51,000
shows that through you know when you

3749
02:34:48,159 --> 02:34:53,359
find the right fungal bacteria

3750
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:56,159
ratio you know that you're cultivating

3751
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:58,040
the plan under you know then you can I

3752
02:34:56,159 --> 02:35:00,559
you know it seems like cannabis is one

3753
02:34:58,040 --> 02:35:02,200
to one in that way from the little I

3754
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:04,119
remember you know from kind of you know

3755
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:05,840
how deep I was on it back in the day but

3756
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:08,200
you know she's been showing side by side

3757
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:09,279
by you know with hydroponic kind of or

3758
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:10,680
whatever other type of cultivation

3759
02:35:09,279 --> 02:35:12,040
method you know she's been showing and

3760
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:14,680
substantiating the ability of you know

3761
02:35:12,040 --> 02:35:16,560
farming to produce um and influence

3762
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:18,040
secondary metabolite production so you

3763
02:35:16,559 --> 02:35:21,639
know with tomatoes she's been able to

3764
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:21,640
see like doubling of secondary metab

3765
02:35:22,760 --> 02:35:26,760
content from lopine you know whenever

3766
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:30,398
you have this

3767
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:33,680
soil microbiome you know like really

3768
02:35:30,398 --> 02:35:35,680
respected and worked out expression is

3769
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:38,200
going to you know the whole conversation

3770
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:39,318
around appalachi of origin you know is

3771
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:41,720
going to it's not just going to come

3772
02:35:39,318 --> 02:35:42,959
down to regionality or you know it's

3773
02:35:41,719 --> 02:35:44,760
going to come down to the farm

3774
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:46,799
conditions specific and how the plants

3775
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:48,079
are being grown or how the you know soil

3776
02:35:46,799 --> 02:35:50,278
conditions are

3777
02:35:48,079 --> 02:35:51,680
being created

3778
02:35:50,279 --> 02:35:53,760
um it's because there's that side of it

3779
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,359
and then you know there's you know then

3780
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:56,478
there's the preservation side of it you

3781
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:58,479
know we're working with certain groups

3782
02:35:56,478 --> 02:36:01,639
that are doing live resin live resin

3783
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:03,559
like live rosin uh harvesting right so

3784
02:36:01,639 --> 02:36:04,559
they're you know they're they have the

3785
02:36:03,559 --> 02:36:06,159
teams and they're going out in the

3786
02:36:04,559 --> 02:36:07,439
fields and they're you know harvesting

3787
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:09,159
the plants and prepping them and kind of

3788
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:10,639
getting them in freezers immediately you

3789
02:36:09,159 --> 02:36:11,760
know and kind of where you know we've

3790
02:36:10,639 --> 02:36:13,000
been worked with them to where they're

3791
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:15,040
harvesting kind of in the middle of the

3792
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:17,398
night or you know early in the morning

3793
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:19,880
right before the sun comes up as opposed

3794
02:36:17,398 --> 02:36:24,119
to you know in the middle of the you

3795
02:36:19,879 --> 02:36:26,239
know Peak heat of the afternoon and you

3796
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:29,640
know we're you know just from kind of

3797
02:36:26,239 --> 02:36:32,159
the return in the extraction process

3798
02:36:29,639 --> 02:36:34,000
turn is difference on the Turing content

3799
02:36:32,159 --> 02:36:35,719
itself you know whenever there's these

3800
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,639
certain considerations around you know

3801
02:36:35,719 --> 02:36:39,599
Harvest Time of you know around the moon

3802
02:36:37,639 --> 02:36:41,959
cycle around the you know these you know

3803
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:43,318
these what you know just ensuring that

3804
02:36:41,959 --> 02:36:46,519
the temperatures that you're exposing

3805
02:36:43,318 --> 02:36:48,639
the plant to during time of harvest and

3806
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:51,120
then throughout the process of drying

3807
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:52,239
caring yeah you know ever you know

3808
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,560
reaching these certain temperatures

3809
02:36:52,239 --> 02:36:54,799
where you're going to be compromising

3810
02:36:53,559 --> 02:36:57,278
the

3811
02:36:54,799 --> 02:37:00,159
Turks yeah I always see you know you

3812
02:36:57,279 --> 02:37:03,640
need to be around 68 relative humidity

3813
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:05,639
55 or you know or or Andor throttling it

3814
02:37:03,639 --> 02:37:08,959
really paying attention to the materials

3815
02:37:05,639 --> 02:37:12,840
is super super key um there's no Silver

3816
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:15,119
Bullet to dry cure it's all very very

3817
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:18,439
specific to that time and that varietal

3818
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:20,439
or that variety I should say so hey

3819
02:37:18,439 --> 02:37:22,720
there was a question for you Sam have

3820
02:37:20,439 --> 02:37:26,600
you ever smoked isolated novel phyto

3821
02:37:22,719 --> 02:37:26,599
canabo like 331-8358

3822
02:37:50,959 --> 02:37:56,839
right I figured I it sounds like it is a

3823
02:37:53,879 --> 02:37:59,239
synthetic cannaboid Alec and uh you know

3824
02:37:56,840 --> 02:38:02,398
what that [ __ ] scares

3825
02:37:59,239 --> 02:38:04,279
me it scares me too kind of I kind of

3826
02:38:02,398 --> 02:38:07,760
like certified by Mother

3827
02:38:04,279 --> 02:38:10,159
Nature cou with synthetics is people

3828
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:12,279
haven't taken them very long and we

3829
02:38:10,159 --> 02:38:16,719
don't know if they're safe maybe they

3830
02:38:12,279 --> 02:38:21,159
are maybe they're not but uh yeah I only

3831
02:38:16,719 --> 02:38:24,719
have one brain to play with so try to be

3832
02:38:21,159 --> 02:38:28,879
as we say by safe go ahead as we say

3833
02:38:24,719 --> 02:38:28,879
yeah I mean I think Deno factor is

3834
02:38:29,239 --> 02:38:32,680
large what's that

3835
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:36,760
Alec um I was I was just gonna add like

3836
02:38:35,159 --> 02:38:38,760
you know in the world of like these like

3837
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:41,680
synthetic compounds or analog compounds

3838
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:43,239
off of the original molecule you know

3839
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:46,079
synthetic canabo do scare the [ __ ] out

3840
02:38:43,239 --> 02:38:48,478
of me but it's

3841
02:38:46,079 --> 02:38:50,239
fasting you know how something like the

3842
02:38:48,478 --> 02:38:52,478
compound of mesculin and then the the

3843
02:38:50,239 --> 02:38:54,600
compound of 2 CB you know 2 CB is

3844
02:38:52,478 --> 02:38:57,000
incredible incredible medicine and gift

3845
02:38:54,600 --> 02:39:00,640
of Alexander shulan

3846
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:03,318
blesses so um you know and you know and

3847
02:39:00,639 --> 02:39:05,079
that's you know seems incredibly you

3848
02:39:03,318 --> 02:39:07,239
know safe and effective and you know

3849
02:39:05,079 --> 02:39:09,639
kind of controlling dose and you know

3850
02:39:07,239 --> 02:39:11,039
effect um but but you know it's it's

3851
02:39:09,639 --> 02:39:13,079
fascinating how these Endo these

3852
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:15,040
synthetic cannaboids you know that are

3853
02:39:13,079 --> 02:39:18,159
largely

3854
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:20,240
untested just they have such rate of

3855
02:39:18,159 --> 02:39:23,079
effects that can be half hazardous or

3856
02:39:20,239 --> 02:39:23,079
negative to

3857
02:39:23,478 --> 02:39:30,039
use I think often with those compounds

3858
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:33,279
they have a potential long-term

3859
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:38,840
degenerative effect if overused in the

3860
02:39:33,279 --> 02:39:42,439
case of MDMA and 2cb that their um micro

3861
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:44,680
doing capabilities and they're euphoric

3862
02:39:42,439 --> 02:39:48,079
and they're they they're dips into you

3863
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:51,800
know a calm you know meditative placees

3864
02:39:48,079 --> 02:39:55,318
as except Ally beneficial and it's

3865
02:39:51,799 --> 02:39:59,159
amazing medicine in the in the overuse

3866
02:39:55,318 --> 02:40:01,439
of it or say the non you know

3867
02:39:59,159 --> 02:40:03,478
pharmaceutical ways that you may get it

3868
02:40:01,439 --> 02:40:06,279
can definitely have a degenerative

3869
02:40:03,478 --> 02:40:09,639
effect on your neur neurological system

3870
02:40:06,279 --> 02:40:12,960
so I think it's always safe to say that

3871
02:40:09,639 --> 02:40:15,278
the the the the plant compound itself is

3872
02:40:12,959 --> 02:40:19,839
going to be the one that's going to be

3873
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:22,600
healthy for your you know corrective you

3874
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:29,079
know therapy that you're looking for

3875
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:32,640
well apparently the 33 whatever 18b was

3876
02:40:29,079 --> 02:40:35,398
isolated by Dr DD Mary Mii from a plant

3877
02:40:32,639 --> 02:40:38,239
in technician lab

3878
02:40:35,398 --> 02:40:41,358
Israel so it wasn't a synthetic one it's

3879
02:40:38,239 --> 02:40:44,760
isolated from a plant it's hermesa ucin

3880
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:46,760
who's in the chat room talking about 140

3881
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:48,880
different conoids been found in the

3882
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:50,318
plant is my understanding Mark probably

3883
02:40:48,879 --> 02:40:52,438
has better

3884
02:40:50,318 --> 02:40:54,318
number actual but yeah there's all kinds

3885
02:40:52,439 --> 02:40:56,960
of different conoids that the cannabis

3886
02:40:54,318 --> 02:40:59,600
plant makes and I want to throw out that

3887
02:40:56,959 --> 02:41:01,438
I think that uh the real beauty of the

3888
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:03,840
cannabis plant is that it comes with

3889
02:41:01,439 --> 02:41:06,439
this whole soup of Tarpin and other

3890
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:08,760
canono and that's where some of the

3891
02:41:06,439 --> 02:41:12,200
benefit and magic of the plant really

3892
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:14,920
resides Blessed

3893
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:16,760
Be yeah and things like MD I totally

3894
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:18,439
agree with that you know the other the

3895
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:21,800
other compounds that we were talking

3896
02:41:18,439 --> 02:41:23,840
about before the the hallucinogenic

3897
02:41:21,799 --> 02:41:27,559
compounds and so like if you're familiar

3898
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:30,120
with Sasha shulan's books so the P book

3899
02:41:27,559 --> 02:41:35,079
so the phenethylamines that I have known

3900
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:38,680
and loved and so um the the

3901
02:41:35,079 --> 02:41:42,559
phenethylamines are similar to things

3902
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:45,200
like elopa which naturally exist in your

3903
02:41:42,559 --> 02:41:49,079
brain and and

3904
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:52,880
epinephrine and related compounds and so

3905
02:41:49,079 --> 02:41:56,879
the there are are natural enzymes in the

3906
02:41:52,879 --> 02:41:58,519
brain that regulate these these

3907
02:41:56,879 --> 02:42:01,759
compounds and you'll know that like

3908
02:41:58,520 --> 02:42:03,760
people who are who are diagnosed with

3909
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:06,880
clinical depression will be giving

3910
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:11,359
something that are called MAO inhibitors

3911
02:42:06,879 --> 02:42:13,959
and so Mao stands for monoamine oxidase

3912
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:15,920
and monoamine oxidase is an a regulatory

3913
02:42:13,959 --> 02:42:18,679
enzyme that exists in the brain to

3914
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:22,318
basically degrade these compounds and to

3915
02:42:18,680 --> 02:42:25,120
regulate how much exists in critical

3916
02:42:22,318 --> 02:42:28,478
synaptic Junctions that are responsible

3917
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:30,040
for the underlying causes of depression

3918
02:42:28,478 --> 02:42:31,519
and so the other thing that you have to

3919
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:34,279
think about like we were talking about

3920
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:37,800
MDMA before and micro doing it's

3921
02:42:34,279 --> 02:42:39,319
interesting because micro doing seems to

3922
02:42:37,799 --> 02:42:43,639
tap

3923
02:42:39,318 --> 02:42:45,920
some different level and function of

3924
02:42:43,639 --> 02:42:48,920
these compounds in the brain that's not

3925
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:51,239
quite well understood as opposed to the

3926
02:42:48,920 --> 02:42:53,879
guy who goes to the Rave every weekend

3927
02:42:51,239 --> 02:42:56,439
and just takes as much ecstasy as he

3928
02:42:53,879 --> 02:42:59,079
could possibly swallow I mean at some

3929
02:42:56,439 --> 02:43:01,398
point again you're saturating your

3930
02:42:59,079 --> 02:43:03,719
body's ability to basically degrade

3931
02:43:01,398 --> 02:43:06,639
these compounds and because they look

3932
02:43:03,719 --> 02:43:08,959
like compounds that are related to

3933
02:43:06,639 --> 02:43:12,879
things that are naturally in the brain

3934
02:43:08,959 --> 02:43:16,358
they're metabolized and then reuptake

3935
02:43:12,879 --> 02:43:19,119
pratically and so the whole basis of the

3936
02:43:16,359 --> 02:43:21,279
whole acid flashback which is where some

3937
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:24,399
somebody just took so much psychedelics

3938
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:26,720
and now pre synaptically they've sort of

3939
02:43:24,398 --> 02:43:29,159
reincorporated these compounds which at

3940
02:43:26,719 --> 02:43:32,559
one point flooded the synapse is now

3941
02:43:29,159 --> 02:43:35,840
coming back and sort of again the basis

3942
02:43:32,559 --> 02:43:38,278
of the whole acid flashback is the

3943
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:41,520
reincorporation and utilization of these

3944
02:43:38,279 --> 02:43:45,159
molecules that you can definitely alter

3945
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:47,720
your brain chemistry incredibly I mean I

3946
02:43:45,159 --> 02:43:49,639
Used to Know kids on on dead tour who

3947
02:43:47,719 --> 02:43:51,920
just took way too much

3948
02:43:49,639 --> 02:43:54,680
of these things and they just

3949
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:56,680
became like walking vegetables like they

3950
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:59,318
had no like they were more like a meth

3951
02:43:56,680 --> 02:44:01,760
head than like somebody who just smoked

3952
02:43:59,318 --> 02:44:05,119
weed or did psychedelics they they

3953
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:08,120
became more kind of like of what you

3954
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:10,359
would see for somebody who had a real

3955
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:11,439
methamphetamine addiction as oppos they

3956
02:44:10,359 --> 02:44:14,960
got Sid

3957
02:44:11,439 --> 02:44:18,040
bared the inability to to have emotion

3958
02:44:14,959 --> 02:44:21,278
or show emotion it just became so

3959
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:23,160
vanilla you know very strange yeah I

3960
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:24,520
notic and I think your body begins to

3961
02:44:23,159 --> 02:44:27,639
depend on this almost there's a

3962
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:30,880
dependency that um is probably underp

3963
02:44:27,639 --> 02:44:32,799
underpins the addiction to them but I I

3964
02:44:30,879 --> 02:44:35,119
don't think cannabis I I think cannabis

3965
02:44:32,799 --> 02:44:37,639
is kind of like again for that to me is

3966
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:39,960
like the exit drug it's like you can

3967
02:44:37,639 --> 02:44:43,199
still get the euphoric feeling that you

3968
02:44:39,959 --> 02:44:47,000
get on psychedelics without completely

3969
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:51,640
losing your [ __ ] by just having the

3970
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:53,920
right type of cannabis I think cannabis

3971
02:44:51,639 --> 02:44:55,840
product and I know it's a completely

3972
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:58,398
different set of molecules but it's

3973
02:44:55,840 --> 02:45:00,799
acting on the same it's a different set

3974
02:44:58,398 --> 02:45:03,680
of uh software but it's acting on the

3975
02:45:00,799 --> 02:45:07,239
same computer you know it's you're

3976
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:09,279
you're you're not doing things that are

3977
02:45:07,239 --> 02:45:11,959
the thing with psychedelics and again

3978
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:14,079
it's so interesting how when you look at

3979
02:45:11,959 --> 02:45:16,318
the chemistry of psychedelics how

3980
02:45:14,079 --> 02:45:18,719
they're very often these phenethylamine

3981
02:45:16,318 --> 02:45:21,159
type derivatives if you look at the if

3982
02:45:18,719 --> 02:45:23,358
you look at the structure of LSD itself

3983
02:45:21,159 --> 02:45:25,879
you could actually see in in the case of

3984
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:28,520
LSD there's an indle ring which

3985
02:45:25,879 --> 02:45:31,839
basically defines the molecule itself

3986
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:34,279
but you could basically map a molecule

3987
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:35,680
of phenethylamine right over the top of

3988
02:45:34,279 --> 02:45:38,279
those and you could see where they could

3989
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:40,960
fit in the same same receptors kind of

3990
02:45:38,279 --> 02:45:44,279
like as you know puzzles puzzle pieces

3991
02:45:40,959 --> 02:45:47,519
fitting together so it's really

3992
02:45:44,279 --> 02:45:50,120
cool interesting conversation no doubt

3993
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:52,479
we've got uh we've got 15 minutes left

3994
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:53,840
I've got a hard stop at noon today I'm

3995
02:45:52,478 --> 02:45:55,760
going to be hiking up the mountain

3996
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:59,318
behind my house and going and seeing the

3997
02:45:55,760 --> 02:46:01,398
Enchanted Forest that's up there we had

3998
02:45:59,318 --> 02:46:03,840
uh a little girl in our neighborhood

3999
02:46:01,398 --> 02:46:05,639
here some years back now who was hiking

4000
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:08,799
in the forest with a bunch of people and

4001
02:46:05,639 --> 02:46:11,079

4161
02:53:23,959 --> 02:53:28,199
you know both you know from from flower

4162
02:53:25,639 --> 02:53:28,199
you know grown

4163
02:53:28,559 --> 02:53:33,119
indoor cross but just to kind of compare

4164
02:53:31,279 --> 02:53:35,079
some of the around turpine canav

4165
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:37,319
expression compared to the mean across

4166
02:53:35,079 --> 02:53:38,879
all the other data um and yes super

4167
02:53:37,318 --> 02:53:40,000
stoked to connect and share more about

4168
02:53:38,879 --> 02:53:41,879
that I'd love to show you some more on

4169
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,318
this Turing

4170
02:53:41,879 --> 02:53:49,358
system so I'm super into seeing some

4171
02:53:45,318 --> 02:53:54,119
like Alex Gray style sacred G

4172
02:53:49,359 --> 02:53:57,359
like meta turine canabo art you know

4173
02:53:54,120 --> 02:54:02,399
where we start seeing where the tpine

4174
02:53:57,359 --> 02:54:05,600
profile file over fire whoa but anyway

4175
02:54:02,398 --> 02:54:08,478
the uh the tpine profile overlapped over

4176
02:54:05,600 --> 02:54:10,880
the canabo and how that creates the

4177
02:54:08,478 --> 02:54:13,318
effect because it's not just you know a

4178
02:54:10,879 --> 02:54:15,318
high terpinolene makes you feel a

4179
02:54:13,318 --> 02:54:19,119
certain way because it's mixed with the

4180
02:54:15,318 --> 02:54:22,159
canabo so really it's like this total

4181
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:24,160
shamanic fractal medicine that we're

4182
02:54:22,159 --> 02:54:26,359
dealing with because like in in Gil's

4183
02:54:24,159 --> 02:54:28,799
case for someone who's you know say

4184
02:54:26,359 --> 02:54:30,318
growing from all seed you know every one

4185
02:54:28,799 --> 02:54:33,478
of those plants are going to have some

4186
02:54:30,318 --> 02:54:36,079
fractal epigenetic difference you know

4187
02:54:33,478 --> 02:54:38,679
and it would just be really cool to be

4188
02:54:36,079 --> 02:54:41,478
able to overlap the two I don't know you

4189
02:54:38,680 --> 02:54:43,800
know and then also breed with uh you

4190
02:54:41,478 --> 02:54:46,478
know the real putting tpin out front

4191
02:54:43,799 --> 02:54:48,478
breeding in accordance with tpin because

4192
02:54:46,478 --> 02:54:51,760
I think it's really interesting that

4193
02:54:48,478 --> 02:54:55,599
took our two highest lemon SL

4194
02:54:51,760 --> 02:54:58,000
terpinolene strains on the property and

4195
02:54:55,600 --> 02:55:03,238
it came out like

4196
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:06,879
so not lemony just like aamine really

4197
02:55:03,238 --> 02:55:08,559
earthy gassy every single time no matter

4198
02:55:06,879 --> 02:55:11,318
what so it would be really awesome to

4199
02:55:08,559 --> 02:55:14,000
talk about like the marriage of the tpin

4200
02:55:11,318 --> 02:55:16,439
and then what they turn into but maybe

4201
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:19,000
that's the great unknown genetics and

4202
02:55:16,439 --> 02:55:21,398
breeding it's the great unknown but it's

4203
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:24,040
also you're kind of creating the Cheta

4204
02:55:21,398 --> 02:55:27,039
Stone you know for us to be able to

4205
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:29,560
speak chines you know so we look to you

4206
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:32,319
for guidance yeah thank you for being

4207
02:55:29,559 --> 02:55:35,719
there for us Alec we love

4208
02:55:32,318 --> 02:55:35,719
you yeah that's

4209
02:55:39,318 --> 02:55:43,359
awesome

4210
02:55:41,680 --> 02:55:47,318
tpes

4211
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:49,960
um Kelly I I noticed a difference um

4212
02:55:47,318 --> 02:55:53,799
from growing a lot of these uh East

4213
02:55:49,959 --> 02:55:56,639
Coast you know chem dog sour indoor and

4214
02:55:53,799 --> 02:55:59,759
outdoor um a major difference in

4215
02:55:56,639 --> 02:56:01,398
profiles from outdoor to indoor um Sour

4216
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:04,279
Diesel might be one of the hardest

4217
02:56:01,398 --> 02:56:06,680
varieties to actually grow well

4218
02:56:04,279 --> 02:56:09,640
indoors um from growing a lot of it over

4219
02:56:06,680 --> 02:56:11,479
a long period of time and I prefer the

4220
02:56:09,639 --> 02:56:15,519
outdoor to be honest and Greenhouse

4221
02:56:11,478 --> 02:56:18,358
grown um version of it it's um there's

4222
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:22,760
nothing else quite like it to be honest

4223
02:56:18,359 --> 02:56:24,559
and I I I stand behind that I have to

4224
02:56:22,760 --> 02:56:28,719
try that

4225
02:56:24,559 --> 02:56:29,959
then yeah it's it's fascinating but I

4226
02:56:28,719 --> 02:56:33,519
see

4227
02:56:29,959 --> 02:56:35,358
it I see it well I say it's been a

4228
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:37,600
wonderful show I sure appreciate
