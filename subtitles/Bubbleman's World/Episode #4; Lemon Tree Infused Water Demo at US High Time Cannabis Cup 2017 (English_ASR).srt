see you so today I was going to kind of

9
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:45,959
demonstrate a few things um a lot of

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,160
people know we run tpin for you and I

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,399
saw that you had a water and you gave me

12
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,718
like an ounce of Bud the other day and

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,198
said see what you can do with it and I

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,120
handed him back this jar and he was like

15
00:00:54,198 --> 00:01:00,119
oh yeah that's great doesn't even know

16
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,959
what it is what it does and it smells

17
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,518
like lemon tree you're just like not

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,280
really sure what it is and so you know

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,159
you don't you can't smell it at home but

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,560
smells exactly like lemon tree well it

21
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,439
came from the lemon tree bud and if

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,118
you've ever had lemon tree it smells

23
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:20,118
exactly like a lemon tree y people think

24
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,438
it's fake people think that shit's like

25
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,118
not real big lemons let me see that jar

26
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,239
I'll tell you I'm big Buddha I'll tell

27
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,280
you that shit's real n so this is lemon

28
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,478
tree right

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,000
here translates

30
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:38,879
well translates really well so what this

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,078
is is we took the rosin from this and we

32
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:45,879
made it into a water suspension but we

33
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,959
also binded it to a xylol from Birch so

34
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,199
what it is is a sweetener with the lemon

35
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:54,199
tree flavor with

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,240
thca and so what makes this a lot

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,118
different than anything else this is

38
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,158
yours right you have been using it a

39
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,599
little bit a little bit put a little bit

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
so let's open this up so this is lemon

41
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,659
tree water doesn't taste no just regular

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
regular Spring Water regular Spring

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Water I consider this the holy grail for

45
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,359
people that are in your water business

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm just on the ingredient

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,080
side so we're going to put I they're a

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,360
little longer a little bit in that was

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,840
probably a little less than a

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,120
gram that's about I would say 10

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
milligrams now here's what makes the

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,719
difference now this is what called a

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,159
water suspension you're going to watch

54
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,400
this thing move around and over a course

55
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,759
of a few

56
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,360
minutes we're going to get all of

57
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,919
the all the rosin to actually absorb

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,159
into the water you see it right

59
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,679
happening right there you can see it

60
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,280
already happening and while it mix that

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,280
up while that's

62
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:54,399
happening going to show you what it

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,959
looks like in a course of a few minutes

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,480
you'll see it that this has been hours

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,239
like fully like uh soluble instead of

66
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,560
solubility s suspension so that way it

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,878
never falls out so that means every

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,680
every single

69
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,798
taste and it's ACR dosed which is hard

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,719
to do and to do it

71
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,719
organically so watch what will happen is

72
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,959
real science right

73
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:24,719
here what'll happen is it's almost done

74
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,840
it'll literally hold everything in play

75
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,639
now think about this from another

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,959
standpoint now this is just water

77
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:37,000
so before we get fancy with it why don't

78
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,000
you try that now yeah sure I'd love

79
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,759
to now check this out we want to add a

80
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,039
sugar so people are asking me what the

81
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:59,798
hell is this this doesn't it's so good

82
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:03,438
right just on its own like this is tpin

83
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,599
no THC or CBD made into made into a Jack

84
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,878
Frost sugar so smell

85
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,039
that okay totally Jack man getting

86
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,479
everybody

87
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:17,358
involved oh yeah so now we're going to

88
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:20,480
make a lemon Jack Lemon Jack and

89
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,548
get shake that

00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:31,719
Ro wow

93
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,680
torado all right now try it okay now

94
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,600
you're going to get

95
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,280
little Jack Frost is a little sweetener

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,240
it is

97
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,839
yeah you taste both of them right which

98
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,840
is important so one doesn't overd

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,959
dominate it's pretty crazy so hopefully

100
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,478
uh this will kind of like every cup I

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,478
try to do something new and release

102
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,199
something usually takes a little bit for

103
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,599
people to get what's happening but

104
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,759
coming from somebody that's you know

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,320
you're trying to create the lemon life

106
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,680
and everything lemon tree right so I can

107
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,199
tell you that our lemon tree lemonade

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,840
was the first thing that sold out K just

109
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,560
gone people coming back today asking for

110
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,799
more of it I wish we had more next time

111
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,199
we need to do a lemon stand and just do

112
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,918
it in bulk let's talk about cultivating

113
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,038
in

114
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,279
California people are failing pesticides

115
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,038
left and right

116
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,359
you know 80% of the industry is on that

117
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,279
and they don't really truly value

118
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,319
organic growing and what that means why

119
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,038
don't you to tell us a little bit about

120
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,080
the lemon life and what you goes into

121
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:45,000
growing lemon tree well since day one

122
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,478
we've been about the uh organic soil

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,038
soil-based biology uh of growing you

124
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,279
know I worked in a Hydra shop for a long

125
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,439
time and I sold a lot of uh nutrients

126
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,478
and stuff but you saw the bud that came

127
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,079
from all the stuff that you sold so it

128
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,879
was clear that you know Organics was

129
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,199
always such a superior product in the

130
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,478
the hollow uh

131
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,759
synthetic nutrients and we really Pride

132
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:08,038
oursel on stain with organic soil based

133
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
biology in our growing yeah I see on my

134
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,079
side when somebody tells me they're an

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,199
organic Greenhouse grower that doesn't

136
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,758
use pesticides or sprays in particular

137
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,680
because even even in the second Leaf it

138
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,680
already has tricomes forming and

139
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,720
so the potential of the plant Under the

140
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
Sun is really in control of the is in

141
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,360
control of the cultivator but when it

142
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,198
gets to our end and we have to process

143
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,639
it for rosin or we have to process it

144
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,038
for full melt or into uh Tarpin or into

145
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,720
pens yields of tpin and yields of canono

146
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:43,800
now play an huge huge part but it's all

147
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,960
worthless if there's pesticides y

148
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,639
because then it's just medicine that

149
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,198
nothing we can do it so I hope that uh

150
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,478
you know as people Advance into the

151
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,038
industry they realize and and respect uh

152
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,639
and really give credit to the farmer

153
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,120
where needs to be done so that's why I

154
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,240
like working with you cuz every time we

155
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,730
do man

156
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:12,810
unbeliev quity so appreciate it
