00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,439
Hey guys, welcome to Bubble Man's World

3
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,839
and welcome to the Mothership review.

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,480
Um, I was probably going to do in the

5
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,960
in, you know, in the in the future, uh,

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,558
potentially a review on each piece, but

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought I got all three. People are

8
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,519
asking me the differences between this

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
one and that one. And if I were to do

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
this one, the Taurus, I might end up

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,120
comparing it to the egg in some way and

12
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,558
then comparing it to the straight fab.

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,038
So, I figured I would just do a quick

14
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,799
little review here for you guys. Um, I

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,200
only have two dn nails, a sub a

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,799
dabinator and a dnail. Uh my third one

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,199
is not plugged in right now, but what I

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,519
figured is we would try the titanium,

19
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,599
the silicone carbide, and the quartz and

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,039
give them sort of a test. And what I

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,640
could do is uh hit the Taurus first, hit

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,159
the straight fab second, and hit this

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,118
one last and simply, um unplug this

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,439
particular whip and plug in this whip.

25
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,118
So, I'm using this unit for two nails.

26
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,959
Uh so, we'll probably be a little bit

27
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,719
bound by the time that it takes to heat

28
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,759
that up, which isn't so bad. Uh if you

29
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,039
know the D nail, particularly the 2.0,

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,478
which is the unit that we're working

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
here with today, as well as the

32
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,920
Dabinator from Germany. Um this is a

33
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,359
customized titanium nail that D nail was

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,118
working on a while ago. I'm not sure

35
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,280
they still have it. It breaks off in the

36
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,640
middle. Sort of has a round dish for uh

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,239
collecting claim. Uh I've got the I dab

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
drop down. Got the Corey um cotum uh

39
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,920
drop down, the raastic colors. Thank

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,159
you, Flav, for that kick down. And this

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
is on the silicon carbide hybrid nail.

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
We're not going to be using the Sapphire

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,880
today, but I figured we would try all

44
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,959
the pipes with sort of a different

45
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,798
uh a different bowl in each one. And how

46
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,679
I'm going to test them is this. I'm

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,439
going to hit each one with uh the

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,439
sapphire uh with the quartz. And then

49
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,959
I'm going to heat each one with the

50
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,799
titanium and then I'm going to hit each

51
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,038
one with the silicon. And we'll see what

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,040
the differences are. Turn this phone off

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,039
because that'll be uh some endless

54
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,280
interruptions. So, we've got all sorts

55
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,199
of D420K sift in the house today for

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,039
doing dabs. So, I figured we'd start

57
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,318
with a little bit of that. And I guess

58
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,318
we will start

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,800
with let's start

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,280
with let's start with titanium. I think

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,719
that's a good start. You kind of figure

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,199
that titanium to quartz to silicon are

63
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,280
sort of the ways of preservation. I find

64
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,598
the silicone carbide preserves tarpen

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
just a little bit more than the quartz.

66
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,280
So, let's start off over here with the

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,039
big guy. We got a big tall straight fab.

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,560
It's got to be close to a foot tall, if

69
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,199
not more. There was my dab rag. I should

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,199
have used something a little

71
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,479
more

72
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,000
sturdy to keep that from blowing away.

73
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,560
It is a little bit of a windy day, which

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,039
is kind of good that I'm not testing out

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,840
lighters. I'm testing out motherships

76
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,359
with demons. So, all right, here we go.

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,280
Oh, we're just going to go for a dunk on

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,280
this

79
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,280
one. Boom.

80
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,519
Yeah, it's tasty. Got a little bit of a

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,680
grab. I don't hit off titanium as

82
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:00,399
much. And I haven't been hitting out of

83
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,479
the straight fab as much. A lot of room

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,039
for

85
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:08,798
air. A big pull.

86
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,400
Quite different from the Fab Egg and the

87
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
Taurus. Quite quite different. I would

88
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,360
say out of the three, this one hits the

89
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,000
most

90
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,919
open, the least

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,240
restricted. And of course, the titanium

92
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,159
to me made the hit just a tiny little

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,680
bit hot. Probably could have turned the

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,680
nail down, gone to 600 and something.

95
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,280
So, give that a little clean out, which

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,479
is uh real easy to do and and makes it

97
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,799
for uh nicer next

98
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,800
hits. Scratch it out. And always close

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
your eyes when you're blowing uh any

100
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
type of the residual out. This stuff

101
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,439
gets very hot. And uh from those of you

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,879
that know that watch the videos, I got a

103
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,560
little piece of it in my eye on my last

104
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,879
trip to Jamaica and it stung like the

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,918
dickens. All right, so that was the

106
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,600
titanium through the straight fab. Jeez,

107
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,799
I kind of want to be able to do this

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,600
full review, but nine big dabs. Well, I

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
guess I'm in for the long haul here,

110
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,840
guys. We're going to take this guy out.

111
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,879
Uh, it's not hot, but we'll lean that

112
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,119
down nice and

113
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,399
carefully. Here we

114
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,560
go. Let's try the same

115
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,719
nail, the same heat source, uh, through

116
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
a different pipe. I'm going to take a

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
little bit of a smaller rip because that

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
one was uh seemingly endless. All right,

119
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,279
so now we're going to hit the straight

120
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,560
fab or sorry, the Fabra egg. We just hit

121
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,079
the straight fab and uh right off the

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
bat, it's a much lighter piece in your

123
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,599
hand. Feels a little bit more well

124
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
balanced just because it's smaller and

125
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,840
round. This one's very tall. The base

126
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,720
alone on this one is monstrous. It's the

127
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,879
biggest mothership base I've ever seen.

128
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,880
Quite big. Uh, this one just fits a

129
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,399
little nicer in the hand. Uh, compared

130
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,038
to the Taurus, I would still consider

131
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,279
this a big pipe, but compared to the

132
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,120
straight fab, it's kind of in the medium

133
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,239
in the medium area. So, let's drop

134
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
another dab onto

135
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,599
there. Oh, yeah.

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,919
Well, I can say right off the bat that

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,680
there was more of an intense flavor in

138
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,000
this in the fab egg compared to the

139
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
straight

140
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,560
fab. I'm hitting OG

141
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,160
Kush made from bud turned into dry sift.

142
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,199
So, it's literally an unadulterated

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,960
canabonoid uh profile. Let's make sure

144
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,759
that GU is going. Yeah. And

145
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:53,120
so, you know, it it is an unadulterated

146
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,120
canabonoid profile. And because of that,

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
I can really taste the subtle

148
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,639
differences from this piece to this

149
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,639
piece. Even hit off the same nail. The

150
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,120
filtration on this one, the way it uh

151
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,800
filtered the smoke compared to this one

152
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,879
is obviously different. They're

153
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,639
different structures, different makeups,

154
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,839
and I really tasted a flavor enhancement

155
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,560
on the Fab Egg from the straight fab. I

156
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:21,119
also found the hit uh was almost more

157
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,879
evenly uh distributed in the in the

158
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Fabrajet egg than the straight fab.

159
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,000
However, the straight fab really

160
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,879
reminded me of that old school kind of

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,120
meets new school. It's like a tube, but

162
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,439
it's not. It's got that Swiss Perk sort

163
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
of action in there and it's just uh

164
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,800
yeah, it's really cool. The the

165
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,478
obviously the laser perforated flower of

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,038
light life disc perk is also adding to

167
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,199
that. Um Nate Dizzle who does the Swiss

168
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,639
perks, he does a sort of a frit fritted

169
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,079
holes on the bottom. I'm not sure if

170
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
he's still doing that, but when I first

171
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,038
met him he was doing that and it was uh

172
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm certain that Nate Dizzle and his

173
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,800
Swiss perk design was uh inspirational

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
in these designs. So, right on. Shout

175
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,639
out to Nate Dizzle. I'll never stop

176
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,598
using my Swiss perk. So, little hit of

177
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,879
the lemonade and then we're going to

178
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,680
move on to the

179
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,080
Taurus. Move on to the

180
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,959
Taurus. All right.

181
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:22,279
So, this little guy

182
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,279
is he's on

183
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,838
All right. So, yeah,

184
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,599
just same heat source once again through

185
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,120
the different pipe. Now, the Taurus, if

186
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,039
you haven't ever hit one, a lot of

187
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,479
people say it's the most flavorful. I

188
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,319
haven't hit them all personally. Well,

189
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,440
maybe that's not true. Maybe I have.

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
I've definitely hit a Klein. I've

191
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
definitely hit a ball rig. Well, maybe I

192
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,919
have hit them all. I haven't owned them

193
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,919
all and I haven't got to know them all.

194
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
So, I couldn't really say for the Klein

195
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,679
or the Ball Rig, but I can speak for the

196
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,000
three that I own, even though I've only

197
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:03,199
had the Taurus for the last four or five

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
days. So, let's get this down and find a

199
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,080
little rip with that

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,919
D420K. Such a nice hash. I'm really

201
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,920
tempted to hit a different flavor, but

202
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:16,559
this review is really going through I

203
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,479
want to discuss the flavor enhancements,

204
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,919
the flavor differences from the three

205
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,240
perks. I mean, of course, I can give you

206
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,719
my personal opinions on how they feel in

207
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,680
the hands and how I like them to for,

208
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,480
you know, sight to how they look and how

209
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,799
they photograph, how they hit. But, uh,

210
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,600
also wanted to majorly talk about how

211
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,519
they affect flavor hitting the same.

212
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,120
That's why we're going uh, you know,

213
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,200
rather than have each one with a

214
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,320
different source, you can really change

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,720
the flavor from titanium to quartz to

216
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,360
silicon carbide. So, what better way to

217
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,440
try it than all titanium, all quartz,

218
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
than all silicon carbide. So, here we go

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
for our last hit with the Taurus. I'll

220
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,799
let you know the difference from the

221
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,799
straight fab and the fab egg in about 1

222
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,799
minute.

223
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:28,919
that carb cap literally locks into

224
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,920
place. It's really nice.

225
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,440
You want to start stop your coughing

226
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,600
while you're removing the the drop down

227
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,800
from one piece and about to drop it into

228
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,079
another joint. Probably a good idea to

229
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,799
halt on

230
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:59,719
the because you don't want to be

231
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,319
chipping

232
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,480
glass. So there we go. That was the

233
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,879
Taurus. And I'll tell you the Taurus.

234
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,720
Okay, I'll I'll say it. It sounds like

235
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,799
it feels like um a fab egg that's been

236
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,639
silenced. That's literally if you put a

237
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,359
silencer on a gun, that is the

238
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,199
difference. It's it's restricted, but

239
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,200
restricted in the strangest of ways

240
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,320
because this is Scott's version, Scott

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,920
Deppy's version of the

242
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,360
recycler. It just recycles so perfectly

243
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,120
and beautifully that it creates a

244
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,519
restriction that just to me seems like a

245
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,759
silencer. The Taurus is the mothership

246
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,360
silencer. uh you could literally give

247
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,958
someone a monster rip with this piece

248
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
and they may not know they're getting

249
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,799
it. Whereas when you feel the chubble

250
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,559
and the chuggle of this piece and you

251
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,399
watch the smoke come up through the tube

252
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,078
and into the stem, you're pretty much

253
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,240
sure that you're going to be getting a a

254
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,639
really monstrous rip. Whereas with this

255
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,560
little guy, these little mini Tauruses,

256
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:59,199
you know, 8 to 9 in um tall with the

257
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:02,039
seed of life disc perk in the bottom and

258
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,480
the recycler in the top. It's just

259
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:09,599
really a cool little

260
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,360
pipe. So, yeah. I guess uh next up we

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,159
will

262
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:18,240
try the deep dish. Let's go for the deep

263
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:21,159
dish. Careful. Now, let's get that back

264
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:27,159
over there. We'll go deep

265
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:27,159
dish. Start with this guy.

266
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,119
All right, let me get this guy put away

267
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,759
here for a

268
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,560
second. We got mad

269
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,529
pipes going on

270
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:45,629
here. All right, that's what we want to

271
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,629
[Music]

272
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,919
do. Oh, yeah. It's ground and it only

273
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,839
goes in a certain amount of the way. I

274
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,479
was a little confused thinking that

275
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,000
uh it was sticking out a little

276
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,240
bit. Okay, so let's change up the flavor

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,519
profile this time around. I want to go

278
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,919
for a little bit

279
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,639
of the great gardener's newest creation,

280
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,078
the CBD Renee. This is a Canatonic cross

281
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,519
with the uh with Renee, and it of course

282
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:20,078
created his CBD Renee. He won the

283
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,959
Cannabis Cup this year for highest CBD

284
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:26,120
content of any entry. So, here's to you,

285
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,119
great gardener.

286
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,920
that has such a great flavor that the

287
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,839
minute you finish hitting

288
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,000
it, you really want to hit it again. It

289
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,519
really is that

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,120
tasty. It's uh it's wild. And it's not

291
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,360
Renee tasty because you would assume

292
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,720
when you say, "Oh, the Renee CBD, it's

293
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,639
so tasty." You would assume right away

294
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,800
if you knew Renee, that it was going to

295
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,360
be tasty because of the Renee. And it

296
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,958
very well may be because of the Renee,

297
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,159
but the profile is substantially

298
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:22,000
different from the actual Renee. So,

299
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,799
that was the straight fab. Let's get

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,360
this back over

301
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,359
here for the egg.

302
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,958
Booya. Got to be so so careful with

303
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
these mother ships. Really want to be

304
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,559
thinking as you're moving them around,

305
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,320
especially I'm taking one rip after the

306
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,359
other and moving them all back and

307
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,440
forth. You're probably all watching

308
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,039
like, "Oh, bubble man, don't give me a

309
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
heart attack." I'll try not to I'll try

310
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,078
not to give me a heart attack. A little

311
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,040
bit of more more lemonade ought to uh

312
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,039
ought to relax both of us.

313
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:04,198
Okay. So, Fabra

314
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,879
Egg, CBD

315
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:09,278
Renee, Fabra Egg, Deep Dish Banger

316
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,480
Quartz. So, okay, let's talk a little

317
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,198
bit about the difference between the

318
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,039
quartz. Right off the bat,

319
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,319
um, I felt like the quartz hit was

320
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,559
substantially cooler in the sense that

321
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,680
it didn't sharpen my throat and it felt

322
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:26,159
more preserved in the tarpine

323
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,159
content. Now, obviously, I didn't hit

324
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,240
the same strain. I hit a very different

325
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,078
strain, but I know them both very well.

326
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,039
They're in my stash. I smoke them daily.

327
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,759
I smoke them off of a multitude of of uh

328
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:41,278
of heat sources. So, I can say with with

329
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,958
assurityity that the titanium, and these

330
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,320
are all at the same temperature. I'm

331
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,799
trying to basically do all these things

332
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,399
at the same temperature. So it's within

333
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:54,240
uh you know even if it's 10 or 20° the

334
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,240
real difference is is how the substance

335
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
holds heat and releases heat how the

336
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,278
tarpine profile is preserved or

337
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,759
destroyed when it comes in contact. So

338
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,759
CBD Renee

339
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,839
Yep. Very nice. Very

340
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,759
nice.

341
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,360
So, that one tasted very very on on

342
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,839
point. The the flavor profile in this

343
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,399
one is a much stronger flavor profile.

344
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
Not as subtle as the

345
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,078
OG. So, I would have to say this, the

346
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,000
egg and the straight Fab had a similar

347
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,479
taste. The only real difference was in

348
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,320
the

349
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,800
um in the restriction that the Fab Egg

350
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,120
offers and also the equal I don't even

351
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,519
know how to describe it. Just the way

352
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,519
the water comes up through the piece

353
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,600
equally on all four sides. If you've

354
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,240
ever seen a Fab Egg, it's two pieces of

355
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,320
an egg that are attached by four points

356
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,560
and then there's these rectangular slits

357
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,639
that go around the center of the egg and

358
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,958
that really splits the egg from the top

359
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,798
to the to the bottom. Really nice unit.

360
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,240
I have to say obviously there's a ton of

361
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:15,038
hype on the eggs and uh you know it is

362
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,599
what it is. I I really like mine. It's

363
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,599
uh it's a really nice piece of glass and

364
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,318
I feel that it's right on point all of

365
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,599
these pieces with being welld deserved

366
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:28,639
of hitting the hashes the quality of the

367
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,240
hashes that I'm often hitting here. So a

368
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,160
mad shout out to Matt the Great

369
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,640
Gardener, D420K, John Burfello, Horatio

370
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,960
Delbert. These are all good friends that

371
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,679
have uh learned these processes uh

372
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,240
adapted them uh enhanced them and are

373
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,798
now making beautiful products. So, right

374
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,880
on guys. I guess uh one more hit of the

375
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,960
CBD Renee. This time we're going to do

376
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,000
it out of the

377
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,919
Taurus. Looking forward to this one

378
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,480
because this Taurus generally, you know,

379
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,559
it's it's pretty much accurate that most

380
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,120
of the things I've hit out of it have

381
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:04,558
had an increased taste, have had that

382
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:08,038
more preserved tarpin profile. So, let's

383
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,038
give it a shot.

384
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,200
hands down that was the most flavorful

385
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:40,399
of the three. Hands down.

386
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,558
The rip was I tasted it deeper in my

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,840
throat and even though I just took that

388
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:48,480
sip of lemonade and it's a very strong

389
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:51,038
lemonade, I can still uh taste the

390
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,000
powerful flavors of that CBD Renee right

391
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,759
on my lips and even down my

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,679
throat. That out of all three of those

393
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,359
rips is the rip that I want to go back

394
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,640
for. Taurus Quartz Club deep dish

395
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,159
Banger. Two thumbs up from the bubble

396
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,520
man.

397
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:11,519
So, I guess what we'll do now is we'll

398
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,519
do a quick switch on our

399
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:17,440
nails. We'll plug in our silicone

400
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:19,918
carbide and we'll get him into the egg.

401
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,120
Actually, we'll get him over into I'll

402
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,400
I'll keep my order. I like the order.

403
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:29,199
And we'll start

404
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,720
with the straight fab. So, the silicone

405
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,240
carbide nail uh is a new uh nail that D

406
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,759
nail has come out with recently. I don't

407
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,798
even know if it's available yet. You can

408
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,558
check out

409
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,599
d-nail.com. Use the bubbleman 10 code

410
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,879
for your discount if it's available.

411
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,558
It's a hybrid with a titanium base. And

412
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,720
they're now making a small shelf that

413
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,000
screws into the top to the bottom of the

414
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,319
nail. And then you can put a sapphire

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,079
dish right on top of it. So, that's a

416
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,119
nice combo I haven't yet hit. and we'll

417
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,319
talk about that in another review. But

418
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,599
today, we're going to hit the silicon

419
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,678
carbide uh hybrid with the titanium base

420
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,279
through the drop down through all three

421
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,000
of the mother ships, the straight fab,

422
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,000
the fabra egg, and the Taurus. And we've

423
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,160
already hit the titanium and we we've

424
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,079
already hit the quartz. I've hit I'm six

425
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,558
rips in right now. Three OG full melt

426
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,439
dry sifts and three full melt dry sift

427
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,599
uh Renee CBDs from the Great Gardener.

428
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,360
Other dry sifts from D420K. So, we're

429
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:31,038
going to finish it off with a little

430
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:33,038
Horatio Delbur sevenst star. So, I've

431
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,200
got a little sevenstar, and it's from uh

432
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,679
My Little Pony, if you can imagine. A

433
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
little My Little Pony sevenst star. So,

434
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,440
that's what we're going to do our our

435
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,159
carbide nail with. Got a nice big chunk

436
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,200
that I'm going to break into three here.

437
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,919
And uh yeah, what better way to honor my

438
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,600
good buddies than uh you know, smoke

439
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,200
some of their beautiful hash that they

440
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,759
were so kind to leave with me. I'm never

441
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,038
uh never shy away from a hash gift.

442
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,759
Telling you, that's the gift. The gift

443
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,000
of gifts. The best thing to give some

444
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,079
your friends. Little hash. My goodness,

445
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,440
it's just wonderful. All right, so we

446
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:14,158
got some sevenstar broken into some

447
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,679
rips. We got our nail at about 600°

448
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,400
Fahrenheit right now. We got the sun

449
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,840
going down right behind us

450
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,840
here. Just another epic day in British

451
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,199
Columbia. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm

452
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,558
going to jump on a plane, fly to

453
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,240
Toronto, and then I'm going to get off

454
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,918
that plane, jump on another plane, and

455
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,519
I'm going to be in Jamaica. And Jamaica

456
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,360
is really exciting. This next week,

457
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,679

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,240
happening to announce that industry in

460
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,600
Jamaica in Kingston on the 5th. Uh then

461
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
we're going to be heading to Negril for

462
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,719

466
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,759
Ya Media is putting that on. So, we're

467

have an amazing time all around. Uh

471
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,880
after that, we literally have to zip

472
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,200
back to Kingston on the at the on the

473
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,520
8th, halfway through the day, and

474
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
there's going to be a soccer game,

475
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,119

476
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,119
artists versus the St. Catherine

477
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,558
artists. I've heard Beanie Man and

478
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,839
Chronics and some other well-known

479
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,720
artists are going to be dawning the

480
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,798
jerseys and playing playing the game and

481
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,360

482
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,639
Ukan CRD canabonoid research and

483
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,158
development and we want to be present

484
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
for that as well. So of course I'll have

485
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,520
the camera there and I'll bring you guys

486
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,679
all along. Uh I think we're up to

487
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,679
temperature. Let's get this job done.

488
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,679
Start with a little sevenstar Horatio

489
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,679
Delbert.

490
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
Unbelievable tarpine content right off

491
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,159
the

492
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,880
bat. A heavy tarpin content. Almost

493
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,119
overwhelming. Still learning the recipes

494
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,200
of how much to put in. And I I bet you

495
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,719
will end up putting in much less in the

496
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,720
future. But wow, is that

497
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:14,079
turppy. like really nicely turpy, always

498
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,480
uh I mean almost uh more turppy than the

499
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,759
My Little Pony has ever been and I guess

500
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,279
that was his whole purpose, you know,

501
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,038
recapturing those tarpen that have been

502
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,359
lost in the drying process, potentially

503
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,319
lost in the water extraction process of

504
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,719
water-soluble tarpen being lost. So the

505
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,879
silicone carbide nail with the sevenstar

506
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,839
top-notch even through the straight fab

507
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,480
which is for me I say that because it's

508
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,079
very big and it's a very open space and

509
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
I'm thinking more and more as I go

510
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,319
through the mother ships and I learn

511
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,559
about what piece I I I'm going to love.

512
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,599
I'm digging these smaller and more

513
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,440
restricted pieces. So still a great

514
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:55,759
piece but probably about as big as I'll

515
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,759
ever go. All right. So, next up, let's

516
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,960
go. Fab

517
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:06,519
Egg. Put this over

518
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:09,159
here. Top of Zid nail. Put this over

519
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,639
here. Oh, this is almost a test in

520
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:14,600
itself to just

521
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:18,080
uh be moving around this

522
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:21,519
piece. A little slow dab there. Still

523
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,519
smoking a little bit.

524
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,480
All right. So, another sevenstar dab.

525
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,480
This time

526
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,200
through this time through the Faber egg.

527
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,038
Well, I'll tell you one thing that that

528
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,158
t melt does right off the bat is or t

529
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,240
sift, sorry, or sevenst star. It just

530
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,400
goes forever. The tarpen seem to enhance

531
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,359
it the same way a joint a hash in a

532
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,759
joint makes it burn longer. You just

533
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,759
keep getting rips.

534
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,240
I'm not putting any more in. Then I put

535
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
in the other stuff and it just keeps

536
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,278
going and going and going and that's

537
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,278
just a nice

538
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,519
treat. Tasted pretty pretty damn good

539
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,439
through the Fabra egg. Um, once again,

540
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,278
main

541
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,360
differences a deeper chubble in this.

542
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,599
This is more of a I don't even know how

543
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,678
to explain it. It's it's it's a louder,

544
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,439
but this one's deeper and almost a

545
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,278
little more silenced from this version.

546
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,600
I guess I'll use that term. And compared

547
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:49,038
to the Taurus, which is an even more

548
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,639
silenced version of the Fab Egg, which

549
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:55,919
we're going to get to right

550
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,919
now. All right, this guy's all turned

551
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,400
off. Might as well just get him out of

552
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,720
the

553
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,240
way,

554
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:09,319
right? Safety

555
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,319
first. All right.

556
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,719
Last

557
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,480
one. The last one. Some of you probably

558
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,400
saying, "Damn, Bubble Man just took down

559
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,079
like nine rips of full melt dry sift."

560
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,720
Actually, eight. I'm about to do my

561
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:33,599
ninth right now. So, without further

562
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,600
ado, this pan a little

563
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,880
cleaning. Also, the dish seems to be

564
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,400
more stained with the wetness of a

565
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,760
tarpin, even though the hash itself is

566
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,320
completely dry. Like completely dry.

567
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,200
Here we go with the Taurus. And the

568
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:56,200
final end hit of my review. See how we

569
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
go.

570
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,399
Yeah, that's tasty. Once again, deep

571
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,639
deep in the throat. That's the Taurus.

572
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,159
The Taurus has this restriction on it.

573
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,600
You're kind of pulling harder, but by

574
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,720
the time you exhale, you're hit, you

575
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,000
realize there's some sort of

576
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,000
preservation going on

577
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,080
there.

578
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:39,000
Awesome. So, there it is.

579
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:42,480
the Taurus, the Fabraier

580
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,599
Egg, and the Straight Fab. All three

581
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,599
with titanium nail, deep dish bucket

582
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,759
quartz from Puking Beagle, and the good

583
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,719
folks at D nail. And of course, the

584
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,798
silicon carbide titanium hybrid nail in

585
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,440
the Cory Cottonum dropdown and the

586
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,440
Taurus from Mothership. I want to thank

587
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,759
everyone that was involved in making

588
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,360
these products from the Dabinator to the

589
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:09,038

for producing these, uh, cool little

596
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,520
products that I'm able to put these

597
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
pipes on and not worry about the base of

598
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,960
them.

599
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,199
chipping on me. So, if you guys have any

600
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,440
questions, throw them up in the comments

thumbs up if you thought this video was

604
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,079
enjoyable. I hope you tried to take a

605
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,398
rip each time I did. And, uh, if you

606
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,319
couldn't keep up, don't feel bad. Uh, if

607
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,759
you could keep up, right on, man. You

608
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,000
guys are popping tough out there. So,

609
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:54,440
