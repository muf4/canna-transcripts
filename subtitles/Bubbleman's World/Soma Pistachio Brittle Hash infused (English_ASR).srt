[Music]

2
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:26,278
we're rolling all right so I got organic

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,720
coconut oil and a little bit of organic

4
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,599
butter in here and then I'm taking these

5
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,439
organic pistachio on

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,439
oh yeah and I'm taking

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,000
this m Rock Murray River salt and that

8
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,718
looks like the Himalayan rock salt but

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
it's River salt I like it better than

10
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,000
the Himalayan so I should probably

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,878
mention that I'm here at SAS and what

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,079
he's doing is he's producing some of his

13
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,599
unbelievable I guess it would be called

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,759
not almond Roa but it would be peanut

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
brittle but pistachio brittle pistachio

16
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,599
brittle or pistachio Roa and it's

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,600
unbelievable caramel that he medicates

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,760
up and in Spain they call it Cosmic

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,800
candy Som is Cosmic Cy in Spain I call

20
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:05,239
it about a 3-hour

21
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,239
siesta in Amsterdam I call it almost

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,478
didn't get home one of the things it

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,759
does it's like food

24
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,079
incense it it

25
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,118
it it's definitely obvious that you're

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,519
using high quality concentrates to make

27
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:22,159
it cuz there's really not a ganja taste

28
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:24,798
but like a turp taste well I I mean like

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm using like my favorite things to

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,040
smoke to me so hashes and concentrates

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,799
basically

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,520
yeah I feel you there so how long you

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,880
been making this stuff for S well it's

34
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:40,280
like seeing as I use cannabis as

35
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,280
medicine I discovered when I got with

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,000
Jesse she was eating space cake a lot

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,200
and I go how how do you eat space cake

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,840
so often man I go when when I eat Dave's

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,680
candy or something I go those are insane

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,118
I go I I can't function those are

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,200
nonfunction functionable candies but but

42
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,840
I can do that stuff way better now cuz I

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,759
eat hash three times a week at least

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,240
Little Dave ones I I mean like it makes

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,039
me feel so good eating hash it relaxes

46
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,438
my

47
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,640
body sleep better it's very good it

48
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,159
makes me produce more melatonin I swear

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,639
to God man a lot of the older dudes I've

50
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,318
been talking to out here they're they're

51
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,000
having some health ramifications and

52
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,518
every single one of them I asked are you

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,598
consuming cannabis they're like yeah I

54
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,680
smoke it I'm like yeah you know you got

55
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,280
to eat it you got to eat it you really

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
have to eat it man you have to I love to

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,318
smoke it but you got to eat it too

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,360
especially if you need it for medicine

59
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:32,759
smoking it's great so right there I got

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,560
I got the pistachio nuts roasted a

61
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,439
little bit right right I'm going to put

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,039
those

63
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,719
aside and then we'll do the next step in

64
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,280
couple of minutes all right may just

65
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:46,318
will kill it

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,919
and your before we hit the next step I

67
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,598
think we should hit a nice bowl of Tony

68
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,598
V's turt

69
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:59,559
melts the Mother Ship excellent like a

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,560
professional

71
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,519
boom

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,799
aesome step two all right kill it cuz

73
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm going to tell everyone to and then

74
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,159
Adam gave it to me wow and I used it in

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,360
my court case I went in there cuz they

76
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:24,439
busted me with 14.3 kilos here in 2004 I

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,439
wasn't here I had St I had a stashed in

78
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:30,759
the walls in the roof you know and so I

79
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,959
had 11 plants up there

80
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,959
and so they're so dumb I said look I

81
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,158
grew all that on my

82
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,719
roof and they go how can you grow that

83
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,399
much and then and then I had expert

84
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,199
weaknesses coming first of all the bay

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,640
when I walked into the court he says you

86
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,560
can't bring that in they were like you

87
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,639
going to hit the judge with that one and

88
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,318
so they took it from me and then when I

89
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,199
finally got to speak they gave it back

90
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,798
to me so I could speak and and I said to

91
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,639
the expert witness who was James Burton

92
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,040
who grew all the weed for the

93
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,919
begin legal

94
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:10,598
medicine I said Mr Burton how much can

95
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,559
you grow on a plant like this and he

96
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,639
said about 2

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,639
kilos and I had 11 plants on my roof

98
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,159
dude and honestly da Dave probably

99
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,519
pulled all right let's see what we got

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,759
where's what are where we at here we

101
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,159
got three kinds of full melt let's get

102
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,319
that into the light right there there it

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,400
is right there that's that's that's

104
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,599
going in

105
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:38,120
this cacao butter cow butter and organic

106
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,960
coconut oil all all organic nice and and

107
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,519
how much did you use just like a little

108
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,879
dollop of each sort of thing or did you

109
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,719
measure that up no it's five G five G of

110
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,439
each of the hash yeah of hash and what

111
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,199
about the coconut and no I don't measure

112
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,399
that I do it by eye cool you've been

113
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,400
doing it long enough so here's a

114
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,120
question like like all the time I've

115
00:04:53,399 --> 00:05:00,319
been cooking and when I had my bakery I

116
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,079
always I always um do everything I

117
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,959
except for measuring the hash CU I want

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,359
to know exactly how much I got in there

119
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,560
okay now I don't want it to burn so once

120
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,800
I get melted like that first goes

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,038
in ra organic raw sugar holy Moses and

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,038
then is that why that stuff so good well

123
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:22,719
that's just like sugar if you look at

124
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:24,918
homeopathic medicine it's almost always

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:31,479
in your sugar carryer of course yeah

126
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:31,478
okay so then after that I got um

127
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,360
this slamon organic vanilla syrup oh

128
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,360
nice from

129
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,280
Madagascar and so that goes

130
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,439
in also just a sort of guesstimation

131
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,799
yeah of what you and then this organic

132
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,319
maple syrup from Canada ooh the Canadian

133
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,000
maple

134
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:59,439
syrup well that's nice that got things

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,439
rocking didn't it and then

136
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,800
Sal I shitload more of the Murray River

137
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,759
sea salt because it's really I find that

138
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,199
the salt also activates the hash going

139
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,560
into your system interesting not just

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,840
the I guess the the the the the salt

141
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,680
will also sort of react the opposite of

142
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:23,519
the like it it's just amazing how like

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,639
when you use sugar as a carrier like

144
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,719
this I think it's the best way you could

145
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,199
think of using like as a med medicine

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,360
carrier right you can see why all the

147
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,960
homeopathic medicines are all on a sugar

148
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,080
base because they figured out that it

149
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,079
goes into your system really easy with

150
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,279
this and I find the same thing with this

151
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,879
hash candy does this turn into a liquid

152
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,679
eventually or oh watch I'm going to

153
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,918
caramelize it that's what I'm saying in

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,519
a little bit I'll add the nuts back in

155
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,680
but I don't want the nuts to get too

156
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:56,399
cooked so I just wait a little bit and

157
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,280
that that five grams of hash totally

158
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,079
gets absorbed by this in the most

159
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,399
homogeneous way

160
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,359
you don't have to worry about too much

161
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:07,719
of it going one spot

162
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,120
because I mean I've done it many times

163
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,919
and it really works yeah like you can't

164
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,879
see any spot where there's a

165
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,079
concentration of too much hash because

166
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,400
it's thin out it's thinn out in the

167
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,959
whole thing and the more it melts the

168
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,638
more it homogenizes and you didn't even

169
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,198
have to filter out any of the hash

170
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,680
chunks that were left over they just

171
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,079
will dissipate no because it's full melt

172
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,959
it's

173
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:34,839
gone and I find like full melt hash

174
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,918
mixes with fats mhm like they hug each

175
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,159
other yeah they like each they bond man

176
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:40,159
they sure like each other don't

177
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,520
they this stuff has to get hot I mean I

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,319
have it on the highest heat and it takes

179
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,079
it takes quite you know like maybe about

180
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,319
5 minutes before it actually gets hot

181
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,680
enough but once it reaches that

182
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,520
temperature it goes fast see it

183
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,560
liquidating yeah you can see it's

184
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,279
starting but you don't want it to burn

185
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,079
too so you have to it's um it got heated

186
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,598
and it co so is this hash is this full

187
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,839
melt hash the whole thing yes this this

188
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:15,240
your Legends entry yeah this is s he's

189
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,359
put 300 G I'm sending this to Colorado

190
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,360

booty sister oh there it goes that makes

196
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,569

now it's out the door I can't hardly get

212
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,958
it fast enough you know what I mean

213
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,359
jeez was that on no was that on

214
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,959
pour more into your

215
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,078
sugar so what's your thoughts on this um

216
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm pretty excited about it I personally

217
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,879
never made caramels or almond roas but I

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,680
have gotten into the feeding of my endoc

219
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:55,278
canabo system via a coconut oil infused

220
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,399
uh I use dry sift and sometimes hash I

221
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,278
mean I'm amazed how small of amount of

222
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,720
this I need to do to get a nice Buzz cuz

223
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,838
I'm a full-time smoker but when I eat

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,519
this it's it's amazing how small amount

225
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,160
I eat and it does what I wanted to do

226
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,159
and how many grams did you put in again

227
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,360
five gr a half five gram so I do about

228
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,919
four four gram per cup of coconut oil

229
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,879
but I think this might even be a higher

230
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,958
dilution in the sense that it is a

231
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,159
higher dilu much more than a cup but but

232
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,679
but I'm telling you somehow this

233
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,919
combination well you don't have to tell

234
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,439
meat even even the eugenol and the

235
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,039
vanilla yeah have something to do do

236
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,160
with the Synergy yeah I believe it

237
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,199
there's definitely something going on

238
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:38,600
it's different than the coconut

239
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,278
oil um it's an unbelievable tool for

240
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,399
insomnia oh my God it it is it's it's

241
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:46,879
the insom fibromyalgia fibromyalgia man

242
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,919
you don't have fibromyalgia when you eat

243
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,360
this candy so now I'm putting the

244
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,679
pistachios back in which you you you

245
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,919
umast those you don't have sleep

246
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,958
problems no and you're definitely going

247
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,958
to the bathroom when you need to

248
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,240
imagine that this delicious treat can

249
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,200
regulate your biological functions

250
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,799
through your endoc canabo system so you

251
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,759
got four fats you got the fat from the

252
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,278
pistachios you got the fat from the

253
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,759
coconut oil you have the fat from the

254
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:21,838
cacao butter and the fat from the cow

255
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,838
butter so I find that with four fats

256
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,800
like that it goes into system better

257
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,519
than if you just use coconut oil or

258
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,319
something excent just use multi fat

259
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,200
tactic

260
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,079
and so this will eventually just turn to

261
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,639
liquid yes like it goes slow fast and

262
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,078
then all of a sudden it just it's like

263
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,440
overnight and you s FP this is almost

264
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:47,120
like waiting to watch full melt melt in

265
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,760
the bowl yes it is I'm literally excited

266
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,879
waiting for s's concoction here to melt

267
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,919
into a caramelly almond Roa peanut

268
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,480
brittly goodness it's close too cuz it's

269
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,240
doing it on the edge of the pan whenever

270
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,240
you

271
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,920
excellent tasty

272
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,120
treats just one great way I'm sure you

273
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,958
have a variety of ways that you canum

274
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,078
this yeah Tuesday I'm going to make a a

275
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:18,479
p colad smoothie at my talk oh nice yeah

276
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,359
cuz that's a really nice way too I think

277
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,079
I've seen you do that before yeah I have

278
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,879
that's good yeah I've seen that maybe at

279
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:28,439
the the I find that at the Cannabis cups

280
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,838
it's a nice way to to share some it is

281
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,040
absolutely and everybody gets such a

282
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,680
little taste it's the only tasting it

283
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,399
really my friend used to do it at like

284
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,559
Grateful Dead shows and stuff he brought

285
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,879
like a a 10-speed bicycle that he took

286
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,799
apart and he set up the chain on the

287
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,919
back wheel so it went to a blender and

288
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,479
it was blender uh it sounds like a

289
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,120
friend I used to have yeah his name was

290
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,639
Brad he owned a hemp store I know a guy

291
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,759
named Michael did something like that

292
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,278
with a juicer yeah yeah this was a

293
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,198
similar thing but a blender and he would

294
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,519
make uh you know petal Blended drinks

295
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,519
petal power you could even make your own

296
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,440
juice you know he wouldn't pedal at all

297
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,440
okay so I say in the next 3 minutes it's

298
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,920
going to flip yeah it's sure a nice

299
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,920
color right

300
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,278
now oh yeah starting to bubble on the

301
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,359
edges so you get this into a liquid

302
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,799
state and then I guess pour it out on a

303
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,440
pan or something yep using this uh

304
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,439
silicone

305
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,199
spatula Jee this is just delicious

306
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,759

323
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,319
pretty good made me not worry so
