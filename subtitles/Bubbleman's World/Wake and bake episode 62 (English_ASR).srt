emails have you that don't make any

14
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,350
sense and like talk about aliens and

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,820
getting some crazy emails from this dude

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,989
hey what's going on Martin Gillis from

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,600
Ireland

18
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:41,189
sir globs lot slipped streams old-timer

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,649
big t the grow green show whoredom at

20
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,628
anthropods a CLE Danny Moe natural

21
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,030
alternatives obviously I could keep

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,530
going like this all day but I suspect

23
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,910
we're gonna get another 100 or 200

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,640
people in the room so I'll probably just

25
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,919
stop right now but really [ __ ] good to

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,600
see everybody we're definitely gonna get

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,448
our wake-and-bake on and we're also

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,010
gonna give away another dab mat now the

29
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,539
reason I've given away the oil slick dab

30
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,859
mats for the last three days in a row is

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,750
because I'm not writing anything down

32
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,228
it's a little bit confusing to try and

33
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,900
do work while you're away on a camping

34
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,810
trip but we've given away too so far

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,400
we've got the third one going right now

36
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,030
I guess I'm gonna do a simple pick a

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,950
number it's going to be between 1 and 50

38
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,349
you guys can start guessing right now if

39
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,549
you would like and we'll be given a DAB

40
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:32,569
mat away nice labor of love that's what

41
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:39,950
I like to hear 511 love the clouds 842

42

phones and the computers are a little

71
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,750
bit different but don't worry it's just

72
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,439
a $10 dab mat and it's really nothing to

73
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,080
be upset about

74
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,849

00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:12,330
screen and it didn't show up on mine it

84
