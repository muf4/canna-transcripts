lounge upstairs and [ __ ] handle

57
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:36,349
availa G one of the pioneers against

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,719
that pioneer I'm told by split

59
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,859
underscore dabs on Instagram this is his

60
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,859
piece as a collector

61
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,360
all right that's very cool try to show

62
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,269
you guys following me of that little

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,560
piece really a small amount of water it

64
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,560
comes with a really nice dome

65
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,839
can't really see good in it so we put in

66
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:05,080
a gel form I saw it for me

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,080
we're gonna hit a little sweet scum

68
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:13,619
the great gardener he's trying to

69
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:15,509
remember all these things the shout out

70
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,009
simultaneously doing a little torch and

71
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,009
something you don't see me do very often

72
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,860
once again you see that it was like you

73
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,199
know

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,759
and the perk on this one particular it's

75
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,759
just so he'll tell you

76
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,259
there really is something to be said to

77
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,779
that smallest amount of water almost

78
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,269
like nothing is there at all but I think

79
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:52,069
one of the things

80
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:55,479
that he pushes up the bottom a slight

81
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:56,920
bit definitely give more access to the

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,600
water

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,550
