support the guy's company go spend 10

115
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:38,658
bucks it's worth it I'm hitting a little

116
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:38,658
bit of a mix of rosin here

117
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:00,129
sixteen there you go well within your

118
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:03,939
reach yum yummy oops

119
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,889
you droppin torches droppin torches you

120
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,540
know I lost the bottom on this thing and

121
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,370
it just constantly fall so it's probably

122
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,590
best to just leave on its side luckily

123
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,590
all it fell on was one of my old bangers

124
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,079
hey PA

125
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,579
we're still waiting unfortunately our

126
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,310
license never came in in the first

127
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:26,918
twelve that was received I guess some

128
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,780
pretty big players were we're involved

129
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,209
but we're still hoping on getting our

130
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,039
second application and we're gonna

131
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:35,979
reapply for the first one as well in the

132
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,319
sense we it's a grief group that I'll be

133
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,870
a part of if they acquire their license

134
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,240
to do processing for so the unique thing

135
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,519
about the processing aspect is is we

136
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,680
ourselves are not actually applying for

137
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,979
licenses the groups that we've created

138
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,579
partnerships with are so in the end even

139
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,560
if our groups didn't get licensing I

140
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,300
suspect what we would do as processors

141
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,000
is we would approach those who did

142
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,949
receive licensing and we would suggest

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,069
to them that potentially we create a

144
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,659
partnership so it used to be 25 on

145
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,189
Amazon the first time bubbly I mentioned

146

156
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:01,079
what to talk about today I guess we

157
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,629
could talk about dry sifting a little

158
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:08,848
bit I've been asked to do a one-gallon

159
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:11,539
video of many at times it's really all a

160
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:14,639
matter of it falling together having us

161
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:17,009
that uncomfortable enough within running

162
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,579
and cleaning and and shooting the whole

163
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,229
thing because when you do these videos

164
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:25,699
they really need to be done properly and

165
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:28,348
simply I think what's going to happen is

166
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,989
I've been writing the blogs for the dry

167
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:33,360
sifting and the wet washing our top lab

168
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:35,549
is obviously in California with Tony

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,889
right now so I think the photography and

170
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,568
the video will be done there so I'll

171
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,399
have him run the one gallon the five

172
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:43,620
gallon and the 20 gallon I'll be on the

173
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,179
Skype explaining exactly how I want it

174
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,078
to be done and then that SOP that

175
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:51,568
information will go on to the website

176
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:53,938
and then of course people who want to we

177
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:56,639
kind of want to have it as such that you

178
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:58,769
can purchase from the brand but if you

179
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,990
have your own abilities you're a home

180
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,129
grower and you want to buy the kit and

181
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,649
you want to be able to make the best

182
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:08,100
possible hash possible we want that to

183
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,500
be a reality as well and I'm sure Blue

184
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,149
River will probably even be you know

185
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,019
doing a variety of things like maybe

186
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:18,839
potentially selling the the phils

187
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,188
which we make for our pens that are

188
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,280
going to be released if you've looked at

189
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:24,009
bubbleman brand

190
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,769
recently on Instagram it said bubbleman

191
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:29,649
Trinity coming soon and those are the

192
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:32,350
Trinity carts that were designed by Gary

193
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:36,329
from Omicron and the good people who

194
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,620
designed the Hercules pen cartridge

195
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,420
reusable non you know not something that

196
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,580
you just toss and throw away and so

197
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:44,589
that's coming here in the new in the

198
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,360
near future pretty excited about it

199
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,920
actually pretty stoked to get one and

200
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,320
fill it up with Terps and try it out

201
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,579
myself

202
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,900
can't believe Lindsey Snyder did not

203
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,730
pull a license in PA that's what I'm

204
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,490
saying drew it's pretty crazy a lot of

205
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,269
people applied all sorts of people

206
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,310
supplies

207
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,899
yeah the Hercules is great the Hercules

208
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,269
is what inspired us to want to create

209
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,819
this other cartridge that we're going to

210
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,490
be creating that's why I got in touch

211
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,310
with Gary the team was myself Gary and

212
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,529
Tony and we created this this trinity if

213
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:17,769
you will a trilogy the three of us and

214
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:19,360
thus the Trinity cart was born and so

215
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,939
yeah we're pretty excited about it it's

216
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,509
gonna be good it's safe it's it's

217
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,610
inexpensive but it's not disposable we

218
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:29,740
want to we'd rather sell you reusable

219
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,169
syringes where you can just plug into

220
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,690
the cartridge and fill it back up rather

221
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:35,979
than puff a half gram and toss it and I

222
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,780
think we're gonna make our cartridges a

223
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,789
little bit bigger than a half gram as

224
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,588
well yeah I think it's gonna be just

225
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:45,000
under a gram Nicholas I think it's gonna

226
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:48,210
be about three-quarters of a gram 20.8 I

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,909
think point eight is what we decided on

228
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,190
all right yes MD 73 in the house PK

229
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:56,409
brewer John Maddox sir globs a la luster

230
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,930
burn chillin like a villain octo Tom and

231
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:00,699
melty heads and Lois Lane kind of feel

232
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:02,739
like I'm getting to know you guys like

233
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,110
here we go we got a hundred and fifty

234
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:09,460
people in the room on a Wednesday at

235
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:11,019
9:21 and the bake is on and did you say

236
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,690
that that will be available in the US

237
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,370
yeah it's gonna be sold out of

238
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,770
California Tony will be moving those

239
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,860
down I'm sure through places like

240
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:23,199
Harborside places like Berkeley patients

241
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,330
group and hopefully a whole bunch of

242
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,950
other places as well and then it would

243
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,080
be cool to be able to sell them here in

244
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,820
Canada if I can get you know I'm gonna

245
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,770
continue to do the terpenes if I can

246
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,180
sell them you know thirty percent

247
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,250
already filled with the terpene Pro

248
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:41,299
file then you know all you really need

249
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:44,179
to do is dump that you know emulsify it

250
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:45,829
into your whatever your product is and

251
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:48,259
then you can do your own refills with

252
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,830
them as well not just be forced to

253
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,240
purchase from someone else

254
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,590
yeah me too Nikolas I'm not sure what's

255
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,080
going on there I'll have to figure it

256
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,490
out I guess really in reality the state

257
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,410
thing is difficult right because you

258
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,850
can't really cross lines so it's all got

259
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:06,559
to be produced in each state and that's

260
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,480
yeah the shirt the Terp sugar is going

261
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,459
to be available for Canadians for sure

262
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,620
I'm getting it and putting it up for

263
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,389
retail for sure I want people to be able

264
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,730
to have it and try it and say they've

265
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:19,549
been able to you know experience it I

266
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,200
myself want to experience it and so

267
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:24,949
absolutely I'm gonna be making that

268
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,970
available sounds good David for Kerr

269
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:31,520
thanks for coming in yes sir globs lot

270
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,220
you know I used to have an emoji years

271
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,710
ago when a chat room called true stoners

272
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,050
and it was my fingers holding up a

273
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,490
little piece of hash up to the Sun so it

274
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:43,370
looked like it was blowing yellow

275
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,820
instead of the closer to reddish amber

276
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,500
color that it was anyway somehow my

277
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,240
friend Steppenwolf who owned the site he

278
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,850
cut it into a tiny little picture and he

279
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,549
turned it into a little he actually did

280
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,909
it for all of us there was was Towe who

281
00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:01,039
had a big tow truck emoji and we all

282
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:02,509
kind of had our own emojis but let me

283
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,839
tell you I was pretty stoked on that

284
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:07,580
emoji that was a long time ago like I

285
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,889
want to say that was potentially in like

286
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:16,040
1999 or 2000 it's going back for sure

287
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:17,899
mmm I don't know when dr. Bob is gonna

288
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,360
come on hash Church next to be honest I

289
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:25,069
thought what I might do with dr. Bob is

290
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,139
do a private seating with him maybe with

291
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,430
one or two other people but different

292
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,039
than hashed Church I found that whenever

293
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:33,709
he comes on hash Church he's so out

294
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,230
there that the panelists can't just not

295
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,379
criticize and critique what he's saying

296
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,480
before he even says it and it's made me

297
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,179
fairly uncomfortable I'm not interested

298
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,509
in having people argue his perspective I

299
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,120
want to hear his perspective

300
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,909
afterwards I don't

301
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,830
having a discussion but with dr. Bob you

302
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:55,439
really need to hear what he has to say

303
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,990
and that can take up to two hours before

304
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,450
it's done so if you spend the first hour

305
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,149
arguing with what he's saying and he can

306
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,129
never just get it all out then you don't

307
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,350
really hear it as the way it should be

308
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:08,759
heard at least in my opinion the way I

309
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,259
want to hear it and the way I want to

310
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:14,100
offer it up to my audience yeah there

311
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,319
you go

312
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,450
dr. Bob was next level yeah I think dr.

313
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,260
Bob is amazing I really really enjoy it

314
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,270
really enjoy it

315
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,519
yeah indras pictures for sure I always

316
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:27,960
liked indras stories in the beginning

317
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,730
when he first came on hashed Church he

318
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,339
always told some pretty awesome I love

319
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,620
hearing about old Indian stories India

320
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,570
and traveling and generally you know I

321
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,789
love that from Sam as well when he talks

322
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,910
about his trips to Afghanistan and other

323
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:45,028
hash producing countries of the world

324
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:47,100
both super awesome for sure but I just

325
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:49,320
you know and all the hashed Church guys

326
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:55,500
are amazing but I just I think dr. Bob

327
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:58,200
requires his own you know two-hour to

328
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,500
three-hour block of just maybe just an

329
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,629
interview maybe myself and him or maybe

330
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,159
one or two other people maybe Todd wants

331
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:07,679
to sit in on it he's always got good

332
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:14,699
questions but dr. Bob's a tough one

333
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:17,579
because you gotta really let him finish

334
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,200
his thoughts before you jump all over

335
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,100
them and so when I saw him recently

336
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,540
speak he said listen please don't try to

337
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,430
attack right away just listen to what

338
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:34,949
I'm saying and then we can have the

339
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:38,099
discussion so yeah yeah I will I will I

340
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,980
will yeah I don't know if it'll be a

341
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,120
morning wake and bake I'm not sure but

342
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,920
definitely some type of a show exactly

343
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,330
Andrew you said it dude and you know how

344
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,009
we all are we're all [ __ ]

345
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,450
interrupting each other on hash Church

346
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:54,240
like mother [ __ ] it's just our

347
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,250
passion we're into it but you know both

348
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,409
times I had dr. Bob on I can't it was

349
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,940
kind of Mara one time and I can't

350
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,649
remember

351
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,370
was the second time but it was basically

352
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,720
like just constantly all over him like

353
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,850
what about this what about that no no

354
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,470
this is that was just like oh [ __ ] you

355
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,909
need to just be we need to just let this

356
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,670
man talk I for one feel of a true like I

357
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:20,269
feel truth when dr. Bob talks I feel

358
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:22,219
like it's a valid discussion well you

359
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,049
know what Spock durometer it's hard we

360
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,440
don't we try not to begin to become a

361
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:29,779
pissing contest but we're all very kind

362
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,360
of alpha personalities we've all been

363
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,039
involved for a long time and you're

364
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,190
absolutely right in the sense that we

365
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:40,099
all absolutely have our own insecurities

366
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,410
and those insecurities come up through

367
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,690
the show when we feel the urge to tell

368
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:47,329
people that you know that we're

369
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,800
responsible for this or that or that we

370
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,509
are though you know when we when we get

371
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,219
into the pissing contest and I'm I've

372
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,620
been responsible for it for sure I'm not

373
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,690
gonna lie I have insecurities and I've

374
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,879
jumped into the pissing contests for

375
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,970
sure what hashed Church is teaching me

376
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,210
slowly but surely is that the profit for

377
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,759
MS bigger than me and that I sometimes

378
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:11,210
just need to sit down shut up and look

379
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,910
inward at myself as I expect all of my

380
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:17,990
panelists to as well that this has

381
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:21,230
become bigger than any of us that if we

382
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,329
replace the whole panel me included hash

383
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,819
search could continue it could it could

384
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,039
continue on because there's great people

385
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,710
in the cannabis industry have I picked

386
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,869
and chosen some amazing ones absolutely

387
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,000
oh my goodness we have some incredible

388
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:36,619
panelists each and every one of them

389
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,470
were special in their own right at the

390
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:41,809
same time you know if we all went down

391
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,569
tomorrow in a plane we would be replaced

392
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:46,519
quickly and wonderful incredible

393
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:48,349
information would continue to flow and I

394
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:53,240
think that's the magic of the platform

395
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:55,789
and yeah it's interesting it is one big

396
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,710
trip I see you know sometimes I realize

397
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,170
how much of an inspiration it's had on

398
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:03,049
so many people all over the world how

399
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,810
much it's helped educate people how much

400
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,819
it's helping people educate the people

401
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:10,579
in their lives because they know the

402
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:11,939
information but after watching all of

403
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:13,678
this dialogue back

404
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,440
fourth and listening to it you've become

405
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,538
extremely educated in these

406
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,250
conversations and it's okay that

407
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,538
sometimes we'll repeat things and that

408
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,298
we'll go into things that we've already

409
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:25,558
said before because it's an ongoing

410
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:27,569
conversation and certain people are

411
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:32,158
tuning in that weren't tuned turn tuned

412
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:35,398
in before so it's what's that what would

413
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,139
be sad oh yeah yeah of course us all

414
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:38,459
dying in a plane would be ridiculous it

415
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:40,258
was more just like a metaphor of the

416
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,840
importance of showing that life would go

417
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,179
on without all of us the platform itself

418
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,609
is the most important factor and yes us

419
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:50,580
feeding our passion into it is very very

420
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:53,099
very important but I see a lot of great

421
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:56,939
people doing it now I see sub pools got

422
00:18:53,099 --> 00:19:00,079
his channel going I see the gentleman

423
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,759
with the round table the Diago daegil

424
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,319
all sorts of great things are happening

425
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,808
and it makes me happy I actually got an

426
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,808
email and recently I wish I could check

427
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:12,960
my phone because he invited me on his

428
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:15,450
show the round table and absolutely I'm

429
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,278
gonna reply and go on his show he even

430
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,019
wrote in it that he thought maybe there

431
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:21,089
was some animosity and that he had heard

432
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,370
I was upset about him and his showed a

433
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:24,959
go yes of course not

434
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:27,239
of course not and when he told me that

435
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,579
he he was inspired by hashed Church to

436
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,200
start his show and it made me super

437
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,259
happy that's awesome you can never

438
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,090
listen if what we we're a part we're

439
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,798
like a step in the ladder hash stretch

440
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:40,230
is a step in the ladder and if we get to

441
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,690
be a couple of more steps that's amazing

442
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,519
and great but I'm not connected to it if

443
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,558
someone else comes out with the next

444
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:49,950
amazing show that everyone's focused on

445
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,298
and paying attention to wonderful that's

446
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,940
just great

447
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:56,278
I mean honestly I can't I can't support

448
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,350
it anymore and you will see me on that

449
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:01,079
show because I just got an invitation

450
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:03,589

451
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,849

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,940
it was up there with Kibaki

464
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:44,100
free from chains those two were my

465
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,960
anthems for a while while I was in

466
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:48,689
Kingston I would just wake up and listen

467

mainstream you can almost see what they

488
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:45,840
were going for but it's got a great beat

489
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:47,909
and it's uplifting and I mean [ __ ] maybe

490
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,798
we could listen to it should we listen

491
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:52,320
to it don't want to get in trouble

492
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,898
yeah dub syndicate is dopes Big Ups

493
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,108
James Smith from the UK for to the UK

494
00:21:54,898 --> 00:22:01,138
from Canada we got her on our money too

495
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,878
for sure for sure for sure she's on our

496
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:06,209
money there she is

497
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:09,418
yeah can't get away from it maybe in

498
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:13,730
Canada but that Queen is all over our

499
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:16,919
cash let me tell you let me tell you

500
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,589
so what else what else can we say yes

501
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,299
the shape-shifting reptilian absolutely

502
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:23,209
there you go I guess I heard recently

503
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:26,200
that the guy

504
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:29,358
the the MIAA gentoos on his deathbed

505
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,788
announced that he killed all sorts of

506
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:33,288
people for the crown for national

507
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:35,358
security whatever their version is

508
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:36,739
pretty crazy story you never know what's

509
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:38,329
real and what's not real anymore so I

510
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:41,960
take everything with a grain of salt you

511
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:46,218
know kind of just listening to it as

512
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,469
information I kind of like the way David

513
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:50,808
David Icke who's a completely not Vulcan

514
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:52,429
conspiracist for most perspectives but

515
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:54,858
one of the first things he said in his

516
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,629
book was not to listen or or believe

517
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:59,478
necessarily anything that he was writing

518
00:22:56,628 --> 00:23:01,368
about but see if it rings true to you

519
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:04,879
see if any of it throughout your daily

520
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:07,999
life rings true and unveil certain

521
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:10,158
things and there definitely was levels

522
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:12,038
of that I would say hey what's going on

523
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,039
silly Simon sly

524
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:17,749
yeah double-oh-seven stuff for real am i

525
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:19,700
planning to visit the island sooner than

526
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:20,989
later well which island are you talking

527
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,249
about trichomes City because I'm not

528
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:26,989
gonna lie there's a few of them out

529
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:31,069
there well I never sold CBD that was

530
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:33,950
Tony down in California I am not

531
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:35,388
convinced that CBD is legal to sell I'm

532
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,369
not really willing to practice that

533
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:39,648
level of civil disobedience I don't sell

534
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:42,108
any cannabinoids up here in Canada I do

535
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:45,288
sell cannabinoids or at least my brand

536
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:49,278
is branded down in California selling

537
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:52,098
cannabinoids and terpenoids oligo

538
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:56,778
mechanism for me to do so so I have been

539
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:59,058
unable to do so I'm waiting for for you

540
00:23:56,778 --> 00:24:02,450
know Canada to allow extracts I can

541
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:05,418
create extracts for myself I have mines

542
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,460
inclined from from so long ago the first

543
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:10,820
one was actually catalytically altered

544
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,588
water now thanks to Mitch we've been

545
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:14,358
doing and he's the one that would have

546
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:17,509
to explain this better than me but some

547
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:19,699
type of molecular manipulation

548
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,950
something's going on you're activating

549
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,038
the waters of more living water I

550
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:28,190
believe was the was the quotation but

551
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:31,460
yeah we have it on one of our hoses in

552
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:34,278
Jamaica right now Mitch would be the one

553
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,500
to break that down hey welcome from

554
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,049
Rainey Scotland it's usually rainy here

555
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,390
- but today it's sunny actually might go

556
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:43,609
get my boat thinking of driving out to

557
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,310
the WAC and get in my boat it's a long

558
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,049
drive I'm not gonna lie but would be

559
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:50,119
nice to have the boat all of a sudden

560
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:52,819
it's that responsibility of course you

561
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:55,309
know a hundred days or so of it sitting

562
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:58,429
out on the front lawn

563
00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:00,049
etc being responsible do have a video

564
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,480
taking you through the tert making

565
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:04,519
process no that's Tony's information and

566
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,289
he doesn't share that openly and I I

567
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:09,470
don't really doubt him you know it's a

568
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:12,440
pretty major thing the way he's doing it

569
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:15,500
it's of a high value at the same time

570
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,779
you know I was all I show I've always

571
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,390
showed everything that I've learned over

572
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:21,789
the years I've never kept anything to

573
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,700
myself as a secret

574
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:28,099
other than skunk man Sam secret which is

575
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,080
you know not my secret to share so it's

576
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:32,990
it's easy not to share your own secrets

577
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,720
to just to not share your mentor secrets

578
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:39,470
but for myself I don't have any I share

579
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,759
everything I just share everything it

580
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,200
seems to be the good way it's how my

581
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,730
business was built you know it made

582
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,410
sense to just tell everyone how they

583
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,180
could do it the best way they could do

584
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,150
it and then people would hit me up and

585
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,490
go yeah but can you uh can you tell me

586
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,390
you know some tips that you don't share

587
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,029
with anyone else

588
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:58,670
and I'd be like I don't have tips that I

589
00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:00,589
don't share with anyone else I just

590
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,930
share everything that's the way it's

591
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:06,309
always been

592
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:10,480
dab time I don't have a dab went on

593
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:12,440
let's have a go it's a wake and bake

594
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,539
Wednesday afternoon I've got some

595
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,750
friends coming in from out east today so

596
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,529
that'll be nice to see those guys see

597
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,210
what they're up to

598
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:25,670
my dads are shattering didn't want to

599
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,200
cross that line that's right I don't

600
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,120
think well there you go it might be

601
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,670
legal in some states but we can all

602
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,689
agree especially that the federal law is

603
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,830
for sure

604
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,100
because the federal law for all

605
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:39,289
cannabinoids is this is illegal so it

606
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:41,719
just gets dangerous it's one thing if

607
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:44,509
you're protected in a state it's another

608
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,529
if you're shipping over state lines and

609
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:48,809
in particular international

610
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:50,849
Alliance now you also have people who

611
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:52,379
are selling pure isolate and feeling

612
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:54,179
comfortable about it because they go on

613
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,030
Amazon and see people selling an oil

614
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,980
that they call CBD oil and they're

615
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:01,859
shipping it over the border but that CBD

616
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:06,480
might be point zero one percent which is

617
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:09,119
the legal limit of hemp seed oil to have

618
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,289
as a natural contaminant not as

619
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,209
something that they're actually it's

620
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:13,889
snake oil salesmen there's not it's not

621
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,319
really medicine they're selling it as

622
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,970
basically like they're legally allowed

623
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,369
to have a little bit so they can put it

624
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,920
on the on the on the container and right

625
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:25,279
CBD oil and ship it and that's a pretty

626
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,450
shitty thing to do if you ask me

627
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,559
nobody's testing that accustoms that's

628
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,990
what I'm saying but the guys who are

629
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,339
selling isolate are getting confident

630
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,039
because of these guys who are selling

631
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,899
hemp seed oil that has tiny bits of CBD

632
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,869
contaminant in it and they're snake oil

633
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,759
salesmen selling it as CBD I'm saying

634
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,199
don't let that make you comfortable to

635
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,589
think that you should be able to sell

636
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,779
isolate over borders over state lines

637
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:51,049
and over international borders I would

638
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:53,160
be wary I would be careful of that

639
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:55,519
especially with Jeff Sessions trying to

640
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,519
be nasty

641
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:03,240
oh yeah we'll be doing boat dabs maybe

642
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:09,389
old goat wake and makes in the very near

643
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:13,710

644
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:16,709
suspect Oh Diane 73 yes you absolutely

645

days ago yeah that's pretty much the way

650
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:39,538
to do it MD some of the best I've ever

651
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:42,058
made was her best I've ever had was

652
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:44,158
myself as well but probably the best I

653
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:47,190
ever had was skunk man Sam's I'd have a

654
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,610
hard time beating that that [ __ ] was

655
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:54,749
from another planet seriously

656
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:57,109
sift Kotik its sift Kotik we just feel a

657
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:57,110
pump

658
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:28,309
yes I twelve ah there you go

659
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:38,640
well Indra I grew up with a French

660
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:41,460
family and french grandparents they

661
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,680
spoke fluent French around me and I went

662
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,529
to French immersion school it quoted SEK

663
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,350
Tycho in Winnipeg Manitoba and I'll tell

664
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:52,470
you I'm glad that I did it's very

665
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:54,029
helpful when I go to Europe and I'm

666
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,180
speaking with people whether in

667
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:59,849
Switzerland or Germany or Amsterdam or

668
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,590
wherever where they don't speak English

669
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:03,269
but they will speak a little bit of

670
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:04,980
French and so when you speak a little

671
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,170
bit of French I mean at least one other

672
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,779
language I wish I spoke seven or eight

673
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,580
languages just never really had the

674
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,009
energy to put into it maybe something

675
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:18,480
I'll do as I get older I'm not sure but

676
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:25,339
I think it's a huge bonus a huge

677
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:28,500
advantage to be able to speak French in

678
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:30,329
Spanish Italian you know other languages

679
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,730
a multitude of languages over your

680
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:35,279
mother tongue so for me I think that's a

681
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,759
huge advantage to ever let pump no I

682
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,430
think that is a false a very cool silly

683
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,829
Simon that's awesome props to you very

684
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:47,340
cool I once met a sadhu in India who

685
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:49,500
spoke over 50 over 50 languages and

686
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:52,289
self-taught you know he'd sit on the

687
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,569
Ganges we were at the Maha khumba mela

688
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:56,730
and he would just pull people out that

689
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:58,319
he saw walking by and he would call them

690
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,210
over and then he would speak to them in

691
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,309
their language if they were Korean or if

692
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,900
they were Chinese and it was pretty

693
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:05,909
impressive to say the least

694
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,160
at one point he said he had probably a

695
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,920
dozen of us sitting around him all from

696
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,210
a different place you know place

697
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,950
speaking different languages to all of

698
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,500
us and how

699
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,850
us communicate with one another because

700
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,680
we didn't all speak each other's

701
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:22,039
languages and it was just a pretty

702
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,230
amazing experience the main I guess

703
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:25,909
connector if you will was hashish we

704
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,430
were smoking Chilam so that's why we

705
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,529
were sitting with him the Chilam was

706
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,210
really the main thing that was going

707
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,980
around and then the conversation the

708
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,990
dialogue much like these waking baek's

709
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,509
where we get together we have a little

710
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:41,470
bit of cannabis and cannabis seems to

711
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:47,029
sometimes really create a wonderful

712
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:49,160
dialogue amongst people yeah very cool

713
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:50,809
very cool Indra you ever had Frenchie

714
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:55,060

00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:40,430
people that are being you know I won't

730
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,379
even give them a platform the thing

731
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:45,110
about social media is is that you build

732
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,700
your platform so that's why that's why

733
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:48,649
there's this certain thing that you

734
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,569
don't go and do on other people's

735
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,630
platforms you don't go use other

736
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:56,269
people's platforms to spew hatred

737
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:58,820
vitriol and and and negativity you don't

738
00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:01,490
promote your self promote yourself too

739
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:03,710
much with posters and website links and

740
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,569
links to your groups and pages that's

741
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,970
another thing I'm always choked at in

742
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:10,309
hash Church where people will post like

743
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,990
hey you know this is my event or

744
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:14,450
whatever I'm like man come and start a

745
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:17,000
conversation don't just post your thing

746
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,890
I want to start conversations so there

747
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,589
are etiquette that we don't do we don't

748
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:25,070
go and [ __ ] do weird porno links on

749
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:25,819
on people's social media platforms I for

750
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:29,299
one love

751
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:31,039
the fact that we've moved away from you

752
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,809
know large-scale websites where you

753
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,000
could make a post and then anyone could

754
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:37,009
write anything they wanted to because

755
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,319
those things really take direction and

756
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:41,299
they they redirect the energy of which

757
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:43,639
you've built this incredible platform

758
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:45,649
whatever your social media attraction is

759
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,720
you build this great audience and then

760
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,340
you don't want people to abuse it you

761
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,500
know particularly like the last guy who

762
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:53,629
was spewing racist comments that I just

763
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:58,130
had to block out of the room it's like

764
00:33:53,630 --> 00:34:01,550
what the heck are you doing man your

765
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:03,230
order has already been fulfilled Felix

766
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:05,240
your order got sent out the other day

767
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,190
I'll send you your tracking number I

768
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,260
have to go into the website for whatever

769
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,960
reason there's a disconnect there and we

770
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,760
send them out long usually when I go in

771
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,679
I have to click that it's been shipped

772
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,080
and that's why you're seeing that it is

773
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,690
not shipped as of yet but don't worry

774
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,989
boss it's coming to you we got it and

775
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,860
yeah 200 people there you go ok Bubba

776
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:26,689
man did you notice any difference

777
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,610
between regular THC strain and high CBD

778
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,139
strain water extracts well other than

779
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,840
the fact that you tend to get a lower

780
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,300
amount of the CBD at least from the

781
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,579
cultivars that I've run in the past not

782
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,440
too much you got to hit that bubble when

783
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:42,769
it needs to be bubbled yeah that was

784
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,500
classic I can hear him saying and it

785
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:47,000
makes me smile actually vets do need

786
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,398
free weed I'm surprised that the US

787
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,360
government isn't producing it for them

788
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:57,019
oh absolutely mines Inc inclined I will

789
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:04,309

797
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,360

rub and make some water hash

805

and I'm glad that it never took away

811
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:56,058
from that you know it was a sort of it I

812
00:35:52,998 --> 00:35:57,948
didn't I was being a little wary in the

813
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:01,749
sense of like I'd hate to just change

814
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:04,699
the way someone's been doing something

815
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:06,409
do I have any Milla screens I'm not even

816
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:09,949
sure what that means no why would I have

817
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:13,578
Milla screens screens that Miele sold I

818
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:15,619
have a bubble man bubble bag screens all

819
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:16,880
my screens are of my own have you ever

820
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:18,650
heard of Graham Hancock and his theory

821
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,869
of an ancient lost civilization I was

822
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,209
hanging out with Graham Hancock just a

823
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:25,430
month ago talking about his theory of

824
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:28,188
ancient lost civilization with him

825
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:30,288
personally chase we both spoke at the

826
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:31,909
cannabis and hemp conference that Salome

827
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:35,089
put on here in Vancouver at the

828
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:37,608
University of British Columbia and yeah

829
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:38,900
he was a keynote speaker and I have

830
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:40,489
heard of him I've read his books from

831
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,588
many years past and would you believe

832
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,900
cannabis was a huge inspiration for him

833
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:47,778
to go and do all that research big

834
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,630
inspiration to Graham so very cool had

835
00:36:47,778 --> 00:36:53,268
not known that when Psalm and it was

836
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,739
enjoyable it was funny because I was

837
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:56,988
sitting next to Chris Bennett and Chris

838
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:59,358
Bennett and him kind of like bump heads

839
00:36:56,989 --> 00:37:01,818
a little bit so hey that's good to hear

840
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,708
Mitch get on those bubble bags let me

841
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:06,018
know what happens it's better hash rosin

842
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:08,058
or dry sift well that depends you know

843
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:09,978
for me the highest resolution the

844
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:12,380
highest possibility the best expression

845
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:14,598
of both bubble hash and dry sift are my

846
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,979
favorite now if you took both of those

847
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,359
and squished a little rosin well that

848
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:19,368
would be lovely too you could put all

849
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,768
three of them on the plate I'm always

850
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:24,769
yeah Rupert Sheldrake more for genetic

851
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:26,659
resonance theory I first read Rupert

852
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:28,669
when I got turned on to him via Terence

853
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:30,949
Mckenna I also was lucky enough to meet

854
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,599
Rupert once in my life now Rupert

855
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,519
Sheldrake and Ralph Abraham never

856
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:36,769
Terence Mckenna though unfortunately

857
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,808
which is really a bummer but I did get

858
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:40,698
to meet his son Finn at a psychedelic

859
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:45,650
conference where I had a booth where I

860
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:48,769
actually a very cool look Louis yeah

861
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,010
Rupert's cool I I loved his books really

862
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:53,009
kind of opened my mind

863
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:55,230
that was interesting theory and it made

864
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,210
it rang true you know it was one of

865
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:00,000
those things that just rang true and

866
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:03,119
then of course fractal chaos mathematics

867
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,539
interesting Ralph Abraham fractal

868
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:10,079
mathematician great in a book with all

869
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:13,380
three of them try logs at the edge of

870
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,539
the West both with Rupert and Ralph as

871
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,640
well as Terrence and it was maybe one of

872
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:19,559
the most inspiring books to me as a

873
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:21,839
young person I was only maybe 20 years

874
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:26,429
old or 22 years old when I read that

875
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,090
book and it really really really blew my

876
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,059
mind

877
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,829
yeah yeah Finn I met Finn and another

878
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:33,659
really cool dude the psychedelic

879
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:35,190
gatherings that travel around and have

880
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:36,750
these little events where the different

881
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,950
people that have written books speaking

882
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:44,159
etcetera are really small small

883
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:47,549
communities and you can really meet some

884
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,409
amazing people at those events I'd say

885
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,900
if one is coming to your city absolutely

886
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:55,279
go hit it much smaller community than

887
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,820
than the cannabis community for sure

888
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,430
yeah

889
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,870
any thoughts on introducing regenerative

890
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:02,159
land techniques to your farm in Jamaica

891
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,259
maybe a stable and providing for

892
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,539
Jamaican economy Freddie oh yeah Ian

893
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,860
holla absolutely the whole nine yards

894
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:10,500
I'm personally not going to be the

895
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,050
grower but you can bet your ass for the

896
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,650
project in Jamaica that everything we do

897
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:18,810
we're going to want to have some form of

898
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:21,630
philanthropy that goes towards the

899
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:24,179
island and the people that just has been

900
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:27,269
from day one whether it's producing and

901
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:31,049
helping clean and recycle fill potholes

902
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:33,960
pay taxes build schools build hospitals

903
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,539
build other types of things I I would

904
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,059
suspect that in the success of the

905
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:41,639
company that you will see many things

906
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:44,759
like that it seems like it's the only

907
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:46,440
way that it could be really almost

908
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,570
hitting an hour long wake-and-bake that

909
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,490
is true probably gonna cut it short I

910
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,930
actually have a few things to do today

911
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:55,969
especially if I'm going to be doing this

912
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:58,440
a long drive to go get the boat but

913
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:59,889
thanks everybody for tuning in I really

914
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,320
do appreciate it and

915
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:03,940
Mich have a great time at the event I

916
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,010
guess that you're gonna be going to next

917
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,809
week or even closer or sooner it might

918
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:12,160
might be right around the right around

919
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:14,019
the corner do you have any do you have

920
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,960
do you I don't even know what that

921
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:18,940
question said I think it's best to write

922
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,610
the whole question with no abbreviations

923
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,260
sometimes if you want me to answer it

924
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:25,809
how often does it to make a flood jeez I

925
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,430
don't know I'm not always there but we

926
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:28,900
definitely had a good one recently thank

927
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:32,379
God we were able to pump the water out

928
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:35,230
of our fields nicely because we have

929
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,990
such a huge area to put water there it

930
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:41,230
is ancient cannabis a channel there it

931
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:43,089
is they hate us cuz they anus anyway

932
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,039
everybody thanks so much for tuning in

933
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,079
to this wake-and-bake we'll have another

934
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:52,529
one tomorrow as we do will the next day

935
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:57,610
and may the foe melt

936
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:59,970
bless your bowl sooner than later peace

937
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,970
