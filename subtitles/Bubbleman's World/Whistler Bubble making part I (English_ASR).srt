what a funny name I know we're going to

168
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,359
get a lot of great comments on yoube

169
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,240
YouTube for this but John has a string

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,879
called the My Little Pony it is very

171
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,038
unique in its flavor and its and its

172
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,439
taste and when you close your eyes

173
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,240
someone say it smells like My Little

174
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,919
Pony and hence that's how the name came

175
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,600
about that is kind of how the name came

176
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:47,720
about was that not in uh in Toronto in

177

just really excited to be up in Whistler

231
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,200
man this is the first time we've been up

232
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,200
here filming you know it makes me want

233
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,079
to hit another Bowl would you like to

234
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,920

235
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:15,120
will not say no you will not say no John

00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:18,199
is the fresh frozen King well you showed

237
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,799
me something that just utterly totally

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,360
helps me so much for with all my

239
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,078
conditions and one thing I've realized

240
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,680
is actually the fresh frozen is what

241
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:27,519
helps me the most for sure well you know

242
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,239
what it's not just the showing John uh

243
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,320
it's your humility in the way you accept

244
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,639
being shown and that that I'll tell you

245
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,480
guys something it goes a long way to

246
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,079
have someone tell you something show you

247
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,399
something and for you to listen to them

248
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,919
to a point where you benefit from it and

249
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,679
I'll tell you John from the get-go from

250
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,958
the dry sift cleaning 11 months ago and

251
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,199
then to the fresh frozen wet washing

252
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,039

hazy cooky

266

Skillet tool oh yeah I love my gold

273

tool I'm hang on to this CU I God is

275
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,519
that beautiful the color of that is

276
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,559
absolutely I mean that's just

277
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,240
it's it's the infamous white lady and of

278
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,000
course what he's done is he's gotten I'd

279
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,000
say 90% of it into pure perfect powder

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,120
and then the tiny little chunks that

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,879
aren't pure perfect

282
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,639
powder they have a different color

283
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,639
they're a little more caramelly a little

284
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,320
deeper and you can tell that they have

285
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,959
the tiniest bit of moisture in them the

286
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,519
the the the dry parts are bone

287
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,119
dry but the little other part and I'll

288
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,000
show you that while I'm talking about it

289
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,600
you'll see these photos appear and um

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,320
yeah this one piece in particular really

291
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,120
nice little kind of almost a little hot

292
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
dog yeah I kind of left that in there

293
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,360
for a reason I keep watching and looking

294
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,838
at it and yeah it's nice we'll take a

295
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,480
photo of that uh and did you this is

296
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,519
microp PL definitely microp plane and of

297
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,680
course Dy it on cardboard great well I'm

298
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,278
looking forward to photographing it

299
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,559
there's been rumors of people discussing

300
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:56,679
um oh people always assume that certain

301
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,679
things damage Tricom heads squeezing

302
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:02,838
them um grinding them um all these sort

303
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,319
of variations of things that could

304
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,720
potentially damage a tricol the macro

305
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,278
camera lens really shows what's going on

306
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,240
so I like the idea I'm going to

307
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,600
photograph all John's microplaned bubble

308
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,480
we'll get in really close and we'll see

309
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,120
if we can see any heads that have been

310
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,120
you know damaged or or broken du from

311
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,519
the color which it's pretty much white I

312
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,440
would guess that there's no damage

313
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,839
because if you breach those heads in any

314
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,600
way and you let oxygen in uh the color

315
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,880
turns really fast

316
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,120
yeah faster than say leaving it out to

317
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,919
be exposed to oxygen and or uh just

318
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,759
light you know what I mean those two

319
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,958
things exposing it to those two things

320
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,278
will darken it as well over time but if

321
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,879
you breach the head and let oxygen

322
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:51,078
actually get and touch those oils they

323
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:54,278
go red faster or

324
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:57,799
darker definitely um great things to we

325
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,958
learn yeah I can't believe how beautiful

326
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,758
it is there's I can just see the peak to

327
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,399
Peak Gondola going from Whistler to

328
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,278

oh yes yes kind of some new things going

356
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,399
on in our world and how did they do that

357
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,079
now what is it it's just a kind of a

358
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,799
it's just we just playing we're just

359
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,318
playing people ask for different things

360
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:21,758
and so there's like a couple prototypes

361
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:23,599
trying to get some opinions on it and

362
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,720
stuff like that so having fun you know

363
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
new colors new

364
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,719
things bubble B lights something else

365
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,958
new that's coming

366
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,120
in yeah they've been doing

367
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,559
well I mean people have been waiting for

368
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,120
them for them for years people had been

369
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:45,039
waiting for those for years yes so now

370
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,039
they have them and that's

371
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,399
good I think I could let this dry out a

372
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,800
little bit quicker but I was eager to uh

373
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,159
smoke

374
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:59,639
it tastes nice it's a very um subtle

375
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,919
thing to learn as a hash SM smoker the

376
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,919
difference between a cured hash and and

377
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:08,318
a properly dried and cured hash as

378
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,439
opposed to wet hash I mean really wet

379
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,438
hash is pretty easy for most people to

380
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,558
decipher depending on how they're

381
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,839
smoking it as well cuz it's one thing to

382
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:20,038
use a beine it's another to drop

383
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:23,119
something into a onto a d nail well this

384
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:25,000
has changed everything it definitely has

385
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,279
this is this is a whole new level now

386
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,679
yeah these electric nails are game

387
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,839
changers for sure I'm really uh for for

388
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,679

plans don't we yeah we're going to go

410
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,080
make some plans we're going to figure

411
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,759
out where we're going to go next I kind

412
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,279
of want to take you guys up the mountain

413
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,558
show you guys around a little bit I'm

414
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,759
not sure how much I'm going to be able

415
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,798
to do that I of course have a seasons

416
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,960
pass and have a snowboard but I'm

417
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,400
hanging out with John for the day and

418
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,480
he's not going to be going snowboarding

419
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,080
and whatnot so we'll probably if

420
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,319
anything make it up to one of the free

421
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:00,279
parking lots of on black home at base 2

422
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,678
you know drive around somewhere and find

423
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,200
uh find a little place that we can just

424
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,798
walk out of the parking lot onto the

425
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,558
mountain give you a little visual of

426
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,679
what's going on up there I even get a

427
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,000
lift pass and jump on the ground like we

428
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,240
yeah yeah we could potentially do that

429
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,759
too get get you a lift pass either way

430
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,079

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,640
haven't seen in like a decade so that

450
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,798
was pretty incredible and uh we turned

451
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,960
them all on

452
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:24,158
to the

453
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,480
denail so this morning John and I are

454
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,159
trying to figure out where we going to

455
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,480
make bubble with you guys we got this

456
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,000
beautiful fresh Frozen nugget that John

457
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,798
cut down just beautiful

458
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,038
plants um we've got our bags and our

459
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,558
buckets we've even got a bubble now if

460
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,158
we have power but we're kind of trying

461
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,720
to give you something a little bit more

462
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,679
than just a hotel session so we're

463
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,319
thinking we're going to go out on the

464
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,320
mountain somewhere either near the

465
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:51,639
chamus river or up on Whistler uh

466
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:55,879
Creekside we're not sure exactly where

467
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,120
but we figured we'd do a couple of dabos

468
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,960
before

469
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,959
we before we

470
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:08,839
start

471
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,839
so a little dabble do you D do

472
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:15,240
you maybe we'll do the uh the little

473
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,558
GoPro

474
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,720
uh the GoPro dab cam go GoPro dab Camp I

475
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,720
like

476
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,079
that that's dabin fresh

477
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,278
Frozen not that shatter or butter we're

478
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,798

479
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:34,880

482
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,798

589
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,319
while smoking it for the first time the

590
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,600
gentleman there is where I got the beans

591
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,278
from were laughing and like it smells

592
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:08,639
like My Little Pony and we joked about

593
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,319
it and there's three of us in the room

594
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,278
and when we went to Ty we uh well I

595
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:14,720
actually started saying that to people

596
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,278
like well we called it My Little Pony

597
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,960

598
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:23,519
their eyes and smell it like yeah it

599

601
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,200
about it where is where is it right

602
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:31,000
right here we should maybe smoke some I

603
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,759
think we should I was just about to load

604
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,679
up a dab of the OG but um here we go

605
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,960
right on top right want take a little

606
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,159
this what I made on Christmas Day

607
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,159
actually the

608
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,959
dab going to get a half H there's

609
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:48,038
definitely some smoke in there for him

610
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,519
so that's

611
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:51,879
uh always pay attention to your tool you

612
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,120
never know what you're leaving behind

613
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,120
right it's all good

614
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,319
medicine

615
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,480
just enough to heat this up and give it

616
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,480
a

617
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:12,918
wipe all right so that's

618
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,359
clean that's um also fine with the real

619
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,440
real mouy stuff especially dry sift if

620
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,918
you've got your hit on the pan on the

621
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,038
little scooper and you hold it above the

622
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,038
denail for too long the resin melts

623
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,640
almost immediately onto the spoon and

624
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,079
now you've actually got to like press it

625
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,919
against the center piece rather than

626
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:33,678
drop it I prefer dropping

627
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:36,120
it if I can you know oh yeah no the

628
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,038
dropping that's why I like to roll it up

629
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,038
a little bit too

630
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,120
sometimes so that was um Christmas Eve I

631
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,120

go the carb cap

733
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:15,679
AI couple of quick rips before we go do

734
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,320
a little adventuring I'm going to drive

735
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,800
up the Camus River and find a nice spot

736
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,440
where the snow is falling where the

737
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,159
rains turn to snow freezing

738
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,639
level and uh hopefully we'll be able to

739
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,760
get a quick batch done up there I think

740
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,200
with four of us we should be able to you

741
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,919
know have a couple of guys pull two bags

742
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,719
each you could pull two bags he can pull

743
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,878
two bags he could pull two bags I can

744
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:40,078
pull a bag and we'll just each literally

745
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:42,480
have enough spoons and enough pressing

746
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,839
screens that the bubble can I've never

747
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,878
actually done a batch where you could

748
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,759
almost pull all the bubble out at once

749
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,838
rather than one guy pulling a bag at a

750
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,560
time I've never thought seven guys each

751
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,078
we each just pull the bag right away

752
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,960
scoop it's like out in one shot it would

753
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,240
be uh it's kind of like an assembly

754
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,559
preserving those flavor noids preserving

755
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:08,959
the turs exactly keeping them Less in

756
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,960

00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,280
the first rip you know what look at that

780
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,519

781
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:27,720

00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,639
that it smells

785
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,599
crazy oh what you look hang

786
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,199
there so the best thing about the medy

787
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,680
haze is that in the beginning giv you

788
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:55,838
that zing and the flavor in the end is

789
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,519
just so like wow it's well we're trying

790
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:01,119
to name the flavor

791
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:04,400
and it's it's it's like a I would say

792
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:08,119
more like a like a a fruit Lo but there

793
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,680
is that small Haze on the it is it is a

794
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,280
little bring your tongue a little bit

795
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,440
it's kind of there you can kind of tell

796
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,519
it's

797
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,960
there as you were saying last night

798
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,719
there's a little bit of little bit of

799
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,720
that Haze that's actually present

800
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,280
there [ __ ]

801
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,599
lovely lovely

802
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,640
like yeah the salivation factor is kind

803
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,480
of imminent the 120 is I always say is

804
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,679
the most flavorful it's the most more

805
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,039
poent oh my goodness is that ever just

806
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:47,039
the most candyrific and then smells like

807
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,838
a fresh nug that's the closer to smell

808
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,559
the fresh the fresh but itself Oreo

809
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,000
wants to smell it yep because it's just

810
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:56,358
one of those gulp

811
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,639
ready just because his valuable heads

812
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,639
just on the lid that's

813
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:07,959
why it's definitely a reasonable request

814
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:10,800
John to keep the lid on your full melt

815
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,159
hash particularly when people are

816
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,960
looking at it put the lid back on it

817
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,920
that way when you knock it over a couple

818
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,358
minutes later when you're too

819
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,159
high it's just a mild second of

820
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:25,400
uncomfortableness instead of oh my God I

821
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,719
just dropped oh my God three months

822
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,440
worth the work and everything that I've

823
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,559
been doing for the last three months all

824
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,920
over the floor and because it's so

825
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,519
sticky it's now full of fibers and

826
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,559
you're just G to do what with it well

827
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,358

828
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:41,799
back into a bag try to get that out not

829
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,799

830
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,318

831
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,079

1026
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,880
uplifting settle right in well the

1027
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:33,159
watermelon is usually a racy High that's

1028
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:36,519
what I was very this gives people

1029
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:38,358
anxiety it does it does truly normally

1030
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:41,039
but now it's a year old and it's acting

1031
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:44,119
different yeah I like that and I I'm

1032
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:47,039
cons convinced it has to do with

1033
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:50,240
the the modulating effects of the T of

1034
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,920
the tpes being affected by their

1035
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,199
volatility the fact that they're

1036
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,440
evaporating and

1037
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:59,679
changing more so than the canabo

1038
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:04,200

1039
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:07,879
