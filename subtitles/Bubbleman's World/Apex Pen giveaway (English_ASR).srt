18
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,159
them not having to focus as much

19
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,158
attention on making sure he's okay and

20
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,159
having jod go visit him I think they're

21
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,759

23
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,799
know taking down the the conservative

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,880
government in the least and as always

25
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,920
promoting uh ethical cannabis laws which

26
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,319
would really pretty much be no law at

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,118
all if we're going to go the ethical way

28
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,398

29

00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,479
short interview I know he's going to be

46
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,759
ridiculously busy and I almost hate to

47
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,399
do it to him but uh things have changed

48
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,239
in the last 5 years and that's something

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,560
that now I'm doing and I know my

50
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,840
audience is going to want to hear from

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,080
Mr Emery So I'll make a point on having

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,598
a denail dab session with him some dry

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,360
sift and we'll we'll get a few questions

54
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:03,639
out of him otherwise uh this particular

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,680
video today is funny enough directed

56
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:10,679
back at a gentleman I met in Jamaica

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,519
through uh giddyup from Colorado uh who

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,799
I met through Tony uh from River Rock

59
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,560
and so giddyup introduced me to his

60
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,360
friend bird while I was in Jamaica

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,318
recently bird was just an awesome

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,879
all-around character super fun to hang

63
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,598
out with and it turns out we actually

64
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:29,158
have some business to do as well he

65
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,560
gifted me one of these um Apex

66
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,679
electronic

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
cigarettes uh I've talked about it a few

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,640
times I couldn't believe it he told me

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,680
it had a 4-day battery I didn't believe

70
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,598
him it actually had a 5day battery for

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,040
me using it quite often I really enjoyed

72
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,518
it and liked it showed it to quite a few

73
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,318
friends we had uh some pretty good hits

74
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,200
in regards to for a pen it was giving me

75
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:52,000
hits that were more attuned to a to a

76
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,399
rig or a pipe uh so I told them I was

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,158
going to order some and put them on my

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,840
store on my shop and of course you know

79
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,719
bird being the topnotch guy that he is

80
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,719
he sends me

81
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:08,000
this so I thought it was my order even

82
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:13,798
though it didn't look like it could

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,040
possibly be 100 pin so this is what bird

84
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,798
sent all right so got the Apex

85
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,879
bags those are just basically a real you

86
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,239
know standard swag bag so at first I was

87
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,519
kind of confused as to why he was

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,759
sending me these then he sent me

89
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,439
let's see if we can get this all in here

90
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,960
got a great desk with these pull out

91
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,519
drawers they sent me another bag it's

92
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,478
basically

93
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,959
full of let's see what we got here I

94
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:45,959
haven't even opened this stuff so I

95
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,560
don't really

96
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:52,719
know this is like a cigarette roller

97
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,240
joint roller I guess a bunch of them I

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
guess just kind of little schwaggy dag

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,879
kick down that's interesting I guess if

100
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,000
you're not going to and he's got the

101
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,959
Apex hat which I'm wearing right here

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,478
looks like he gave about 10 of those and

103
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,680
then he put in 10 Apex

104
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,279
t-shirts 10 Apex

105

t-shirts

106
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:18,918
so uh and then of course he put

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,680
in 10 Apex

108
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:24,159
pens and uh there's one right there you

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,800
can see the little oh my light is

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,319

this one is

114
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,478
pink oh I guess that

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,199
one's for the ladies or for the

116
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,000
gentlemen that like pink

117
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,680
whatever and he sent a bunch of

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
different other colors there's gold in

119

122
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,639

124
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
version that he's got going going on and

125
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,758
then a whack load of these little Apex

126

show guests and friends of mine and then

137
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,279

138
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,719
exactly sure how we'll do this but we'll

139
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:43,318

188

is about to get a lot more fun with the

194
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,159
idea that you could win some pretty cool

195
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,799
things just by watching and uh sharing a

196

you know what I I'll hit the

199
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,680
Apex I as well hit the Apex one of the

200
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,720
things I like about the Apex is that I

201
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,838
can really pack it you know I was always

202

very gentle with uh my Trippy Stick

203
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,440
because of course you don't want to mess

204
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,919
with the element which I I would suggest

205
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,279
that you are very careful with these uh

206
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:36,240
it's just cool that one of the things

207
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:39,159
that bird decided to do is make his

208
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,039
element so strong that digging around or

209
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,879
messing with it you know with your

210
