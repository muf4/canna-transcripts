5
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,000
aside from hash churches i haven't been

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,359
doing too many videos i have

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,480
just left my lab about 30 minutes ago

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,840
and i drove across town to broadway

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,279
and alberta street in i guess

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
i guess this would be considered east

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,760
vancouver to my good friends dom

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,920

got shut down so many times

18
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,919
uh they're really just dealing in memes

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,759
over there now but i think the memes are

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,640
quality and you may enjoy them

21
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,198
but today i'm here actually i am buying

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,320
a first

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,399
gram of hash hash that my lab

24
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,519
produced this is our first hash that

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
we've gotten to the market

26
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,438
i haven't been able to test it so you

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
can imagine uh that i'm a little bit

28
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,959
nervous to make sure that it's all good

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,118
and tasty and wonderful

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,719
um not sure what kind of star rating

31
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,759
we're gonna see from this i'm hoping for

32
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,599
a five but

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,519
it could come in at a four you never

34
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,438
know um

35
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,239
lower terpenes than i would have liked

36
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,239
in this particular hash but

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,519
very nice cannabinoid profile the

38
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,798
terpenes are still

39
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,640
you know they're still about a four

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
percent terpene range i would love to

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
have seen it double that in and around

42
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,199
the eight range

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,118

00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,519
there

171
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,720
bc tax stamp and then this is a child

172
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:44,159
label so we got to figure out a

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,960
i guess pinch here

174
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,720
oh yeah there we go so you can see it

175
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,478
opened on the front it's like a child

176
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,639
uh safety thing where you got to grab

177
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,959
these two things and pull them off so it

178
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,598
opens so it opens not on the top

179
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,878
but it opens right across the middle the

180
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,639
jar is nice and cold

181
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,039
still there's our big crazy label that

182
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,240
we had to put on hank this is uh this is

183
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,800
basically the government

184
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
uh you know making sure that you have

185
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
your thc

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,598
warning you can have your your logo

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,598
right there which you can see the hank

188
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,279
logo right there

189
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,918
and then it's going to tell you um you

190
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:23,038
know your total thc

191
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,680
total cbd and then some funny warnings

192
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,079
about

193
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,598
toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found

194
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,000
in tobacco smoke

195
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,279
it's like okay well this isn't actually

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,879
tobacco smoke but

197
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,879
we put it on there anyway there's the

198
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,320
bar codes on the back that they need

199
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,918
and then of course it talks about uh

200
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,680
the lot number that it came from the

201
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,639
date that it was packaged on this was

202
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,838
packaged

203
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:49,439
on uh at the end of 2020

204
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,839
so not too long ago i'm gonna crack the

205
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,399
jar

206
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,080
open a little bit here kind of excited

207
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,720
for this i'm not going to lie 30 years

208
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,720
in the making

209
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,240
and there we go a little bit of hashish

210
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,560
so there it is it's got a decent nose on

211
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,440
it for being cold

212
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,278
generally resin will get a little bit uh

213
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
see if i can kind of

214
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,519
move this around a bit oh it's

215
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,159
definitely wanting to have self-pressed

216
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,919
a little bit

217
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:23,120
in the jar oh yeah

218
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,278
that's good sign right there i like that

219
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,679
so you can kind of see this nice scooper

220
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,759
that i got from d-nail

221
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,439
nice little scooper what i wanted to do

222
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,000
with you guys was i wanted to put a

223
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,720
little bit

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
inside parchment hit it with a hair

225
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,200
straightener to see if we can't make

226
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
some dabs

227
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,920
out of it so i think we're gonna do that

228
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
right off the bat i'll just put

229
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,519
a little bit of the gram in here not the

230
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,679
whole thing you can see that i had to

231
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,360
scrape it off to get down

232
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:54,079
and it's kind of self-pressing itself so

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
let's check this out we'll turn the old

234
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
hair straightener on

235
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
incredible to be a part of a system like

236
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,159
this that it does not allow me to

237
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,240
test or do any of these things from a

238
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,719
smoking perspective but

239
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,120
that's why i'm here with you guys today

240
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,759
and uh kind of happy to uh

241
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,600
to to to do this with everyone to show

242
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,360
everyone what's going on

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
you know show everyone the quality of

244
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,839
what we produced here

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,600
see if we can't get a nice little okay

246
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
turn that off because that got for those

247
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,399
of you that don't know this

248
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,799
hair straightener hasn't been used since

249
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,839
2014 or 2015 sorry

250
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,479
when i did my rosin video with the dry

251
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,680
sift

252
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,680
so that is the last time that i did that

253
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,759
all right so that's what we got

254
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,199
i did hit it a couple of times just to

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,639
make it a sort of

256
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,278
dabbable product we'll see what we can

257
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,278
do here

258
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,919
okay

259
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,240
i guess we'll probably heat this up a

260
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,278
tiny bit

261
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
just a little bit in order to pick this

262
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,639
dab

263
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,239
up i am outside so there's my first dab

264
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,919
that i'm gonna try

265
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,440
of the hank that's what the hank looks

266
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,759
like after you hit it with a little bit

267
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,720
of heat and pressure

268
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,720
so it looks like

269
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,799
the quality is there i'm just hoping

270
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
personally for a five star i know this

271
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,240
isn't six star

272
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,159
but i want to get up to that five star i

273
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
wouldn't be completely disappointed if

274
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,399
it turned out to a four star and for

275
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,000
those of you

276
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,000
of you that are wondering this is really

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,120
um in relation to

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,120
the melt factor i'm sure we're gonna see

279
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
some chas left over on this which means

280
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,078
it's not going to be a six

281
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,159
but let's hope we can fit it into that

282
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,679
five and if it is into a four

283
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,600
i'm going to be honest about it this is

284
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,359
the first hash that we produced i'm very

285
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
proud of the entire team

286
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
we worked our butts off it was

287
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,599
incredible hoops to jump through

288
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,320
just finding cannabis that was grown in

289
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,639
enough

290
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,800
weight and numbers that we could produce

291
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,879
enough so that provinces if they sold it

292
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,719
and sold out of it we could re-up

293
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,039
them because there's a penalty if you

294
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
can't so many different hoops to jump

295
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,240
through not just for us but the people

296
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,919
who are selling it as well

297
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,399
that it's kind of a miracle that i'm

298
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,240
here now able to finally smoke

299
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,799
the hank hash and uh let's light up that

300
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
banger

301
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,559
we're hitting a jp holy grail banger out

302
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,240
of a

303
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,000
klein actually what i just noticed was

304
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
i don't have water in my bubbler so

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,879
we're going to do a quick little

306
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,559
fill up on that we'll take this out

307
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,360
because we haven't filled it uh gotten

308
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:42,799
it too hot yet

309
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,120
there we go gotta give it a little tap

310
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,479
we give this some water out of my new

311
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,639
memo bottle for those of you that are

312
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,680
wondering why i have this square bottle

313
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,360
the company is called memo bottle go

314
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,159
check them out they're in australia

315
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,759
they make these really cool square water

316
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,879
bottles that fit in bags go in your

317
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,639
laptop bag

318
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,958
lay on tables really nice they're pretty

319
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,959
awesome

320
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,879
they're big supporters of water.org

321
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
which is also a great organization that

322
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,759
helps get clean water to people

323
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,959
that need it and so every time you buy a

324
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,958
bottle you support that

325
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,240
love to see hank and embark find similar

326
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,360
things to do in the future when we can

327
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,399
get to a positive

328
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,839
and be producing and making sales

329
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,360
you know for more than just a couple of

330
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,200
weeks because this is literally our

331
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
first product that we brought to market

332
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:39,439
all right so we got the temp tech here

333
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,919
we're gonna have a little dab a little

334
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:47,120
dab of the

335
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:49,039
of the hank product we'll check it out

336
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,519
all right i'm pretty excited i'm not

337
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,198
gonna lie i've been waiting for 30 years

338
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,839
to be able to make hash sell it in the

339
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,319
store

340
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,360
and then go and buy it so i'm excited to

341
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,278
try the hash

342
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
i suspect you guys will be excited as

343
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,639
well um

344
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,120
i'm looking forward to hearing what

345
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,799
everyone's thoughts are you can get hank

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,120
uh on the bc cannabis stores.com

347
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,639
but more importantly you can get hank at

348
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,799
some of the legacy stores here in

349
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,440
british columbia like thc

350
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,799
like up in smoke shops that transferred

351
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,240
over to the legacy market

352
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,240
brought all that great knowledge and are

353
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,519
now in the legal market and

354
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,519
i felt uh compelled to sort of help

355
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,679
those those guys out because they've

356
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,959
been doing it for for so long

357
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,958
so here we go time for a little bubbly

358
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,240
bubbly

359
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,240
all right

360
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,759
well that definitely melted and bubbled

361
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:57,198
but

362
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,720
i don't know if it's gonna make a five

363
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,519
star we'll have to see i'm gonna heat it

364
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,480
up a little bit more on the side here

365
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:13,039
looks like it could be more like a four

366
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:15,278
let's see what happens

367
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,759
it's got that deep afghan flavor for

368
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:17,759
sure

369
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,958
there it is

370
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,799
i put just the tiniest bit too much

371
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,799
water in so what i want to do is

372
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,879
pour a little of that out

373
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,719
[Laughter]

374
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,480
and go for another little rip so we're

375
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
going to clean this out

376
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,519
definitely have a little bit of chas

377
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,519
here there's no doubt about it

378
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,359
not too too bad on the q-tip there but

379
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,278
definitely some chas

380
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,278
i'm gonna hit another bowl

381
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,879
and really kind of give that full i

382
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,879
definitely felt it it's strong

383
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,519
it has a strong fla head space to it you

384
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,278
can feel

385
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
immediately after the first rip that you

386
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,958
are indeed getting high

387
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,639
second one took me right to where i

388
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,239
usually like to be

389
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,919
i normally wouldn't probably take

390
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,198
another one right after the first one

391
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,240
like this but because we're doing a

392
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,838
review

393
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
i think it's probably pretty important

394
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,560
that we do it so i'll break a tiny

395
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,480
other piece off right there of some of

396
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,039
the hank

397
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,240
so you know it was a real joy to run

398
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,439
this material

399
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,320
and um just know everything from start

400
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,199
to finish

401
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,759
and now to be here kind of as you know

402
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,159
my own bubble man guy now

403
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
doing a review on product that a company

404
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,319
has produced so

405
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,240
i was close to buying some hash in the

406
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,440
legal market over the course of the last

407
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,039
couple of months

408
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
of course johnny b and i went and got

409
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,399
the gram of whistler

410
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,559
medical's hash rosin for 150 a gram

411
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,679
this is less than half the cost of that

412
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,159
this was 70 dollars a gram with tax

413
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,159
and so

414
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,480
nice that we could be coming in at a

415
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,480
good price i'd love to see it even get

416
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,759
to a better price

417
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,360
um but with the amount that the province

418
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,400
puts on it and the amount that they

419
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,479
force us into packaging and regulations

420
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,360
and all the framework it's just been a

421
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,400
really sort of

422
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,318
cool thing to be a part of and i just

423
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,880
can't tell you how

424
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,798
absolutely excited i am to be sitting

425
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,840
here now with the high

426
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:34,960
coming on very nicely now and just

427
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:37,439
realizing that you know my team

428
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,480
they made this happen like we did this

429
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,519
it took

430
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,960
years of our our hard work and i just

431
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,400
really want to shout out everyone on

432
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,319
that team because

433
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,480
you know this did not come easy and

434
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,558
shout out to you know to to the growers

435
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,000
of course as well

436
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,000
um we couldn't do it without them

437
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,880
oh this one bubble and melted nicely you

438
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,840
can see that in there it's bubbling up

439
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,840
good you know

440
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,480
yeah that dab was nice

441
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,279
not gonna lie that one i really enjoyed

442
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,038
i think i

443
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,399
let the banger cool down a little bit

444
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,558
too much for the last one

445
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
so i got a really nice low temp hit i

446
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,839
heated it up a little more

447
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,079
and i just didn't get the bubbling

448
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,599
effect like i did off of this one this

449
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,558
is definitely between a 4 and a 5 star

450
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,199
i want to give it a 4.5 because i don't

451
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,279
want to

452
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,880
you know be biased but the way that was

453
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,839
bubbling and melting i'd say that's

454
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,799
probably

455
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,720
between a 4 and a 4.5 i will try to do a

456
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,960
macro video so you guys can see it

457
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,720
close up bubbling and melting it's

458
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,720
definitely leaving some material behind

459
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,519
and this is 120 micron 90 microns 73

460
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,759
micron and 45 micron

461
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,798
all mixed and homogenized uh nicely

462
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,558
together so

463
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,440
it'll be nice to see how long a gram

464
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,440
lasts me i don't generally buy hash by

465
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,279
the gram so this is kind of new to me as

466
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
well this is my first experience with

467
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,798
purchasing for in the legal

468
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,640
uh regulated framework i've had a

469
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,759
license and been able to grow my own and

470
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:25,840
produce my own for quite some time

471
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,839
i'm gonna give this another little hit

472
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:42,480
all right beautiful a beautiful

473
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
so we'll clean that up yeah you can see

474
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,759
here i'll show you guys more of the

475
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,079
chass here so

476
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,960
a little more of the jazz on that one

477
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,079
you can kind of see

478
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,759
chunks of leftover material uh certainly

479
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,279
not the six that we're always looking

480
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,960
for but the fact that we got

481
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:02,399
a melty dabbable bubble to market

482
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,079
during a global pandemic um shout out

483
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,440
to the team at embark shout out to

484
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:11,918
hank whoever you are wherever you are

485

thanks for the good times buddy you can

486
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,080
pick that up at any of the bc stores

487
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,640
but i would urge you if you can and

488
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,639
you're local go support the guys that

489
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
have been legacy you know there's some

490
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,600
beautiful stores don't get me wrong i i

491
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,159
really did enjoy

492
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,519
a lot of the um vancouver shops that i

493
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,200
went and visited to

494
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,279
but i am a little biased to want to help

495
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,120
out the the legacy people that

496
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,798
that were doing it and pushing the

497
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,000
envelope and practicing the civil

498
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,558
disobedience

499
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,960
that really allowed us to get to where

500
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,720
