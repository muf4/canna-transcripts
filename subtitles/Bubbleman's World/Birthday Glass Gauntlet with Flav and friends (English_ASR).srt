28
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,640
through we have the honey Queen which is

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,799
a banjo Joe Peters collab now this piece

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,920
is

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,960
incredible I can't even explain to you

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,599
the quality of this piece video and

33
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,798
photos really don't do it justice the

34
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,438
amount of water that fits in the bottom

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,040
chamber is the tiniest tiniest little

36
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,718
bit gives the most incredible rips the

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,960
whole back end of the pipe when you turn

38
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:58,280
it around um all the dripping honey

39
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:01,599
that's dripping over the honey queen's

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,159
chair uh from the top of the bowl is

41
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,879
actually a recycler so you've got it

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,719
covered in these little bees you have

43
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:13,719
these amazing patterns inside of

44
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,959
Honeycombs and the whole dripping honey

45
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,959
uh up through the base as you climb up

46
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,800
through the top um that is the recycler

47
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,000
that big bar of Dripping honey goes up

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,080
and loops around under the bee and and

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,239
that is basically the recycler so thumbs

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,080
up to Joe Peters and banjo for the

51
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,080
absolute

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,598
stunner next up we have the Corey um

53
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:44,518
skull piece with the brain perk uh

54
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,919
reminiscent of the Scott deppy skull

55
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,239
piece from some years ago Corey uh put

56
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,439
his own style on it really added some

57
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,158
intricate colors um it's very unique

58
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,439
although you cannot see the bowl as

59
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:58,840
you're puffing out of this piece um the

60
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,878
mouthpiece is at the bottom base neck of

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,000
the skull and the bow is up through the

62
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,878
top at first glance you really don't

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
realize how beautiful the work on this

64
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,479
piece is until you get in through the

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,878
sides and you look at that brain perk

66
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,479
the the tightness of his wraps and it's

67
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,639
just really quite beautiful it's a

68
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,439
beautiful piece to hold and it's an

69
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,039
absolute beautiful piece to smoke and I

70
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,079
would say it's one of the most unique

71
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,359
pieces I've ever smoked and I have

72
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,879
smoked out of quite a few pieces so

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,159
we're happy to have the Corey brain perk

74
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,158
skull piece here for the birthday bash

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,158
Gauntlet well last but certainly not

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,200
least we have the Marcel braa Chris

77
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:46,239
Carlson collab look at that air trapping

78
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,359
work by Marcel and look at that basket

79
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,200
weave done by Chris Carlson absolute

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,079
stunner little Marcel marble on the one

81
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:58,959
side and Carlson marble on the other

82
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:02,159
side this piece hits like an absolute

83
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,519
champ love its Simplicity yet when you

84
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,840
look at it closely you kind of can't

85
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,480
believe how intricate it is so

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,438
Simplicity and intricacy all wrapped up

87
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,000
into one for absolute Wicked rips one of

88
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,159
my favorites by

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,639
far it's always such a mouthful to

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,240
explain who blew these pieces isn't it

91
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,759
epic we're not going to talk about the

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,120
different per or such but because that

93
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,199
no but we're going to hit them all and

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,959
we're going to do it basically like boom

95
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,919
boom boom boom boom um I guess the one

96
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,719
thing that we had to that we have to

97
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:39,240
figure out is that the two d nails will

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,560
require quick dabbing maybe you can give

99
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,038
them a quick kind of I'll sort of hold

100
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,959
this we'll start with them that way you

101
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,478
can lean over without going too far in

102
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,120
front of the camera if you can lean from

103
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,839
right there and load both of them then

104
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,680
that way once they've done their hit

105
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,519
we'll go right to John we'll have him

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,000
preloaded we'll have me pre-loaded and

107
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,959
we'll have you pre-loaded so I say we

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,279
start

109
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,638
with the Barb

110
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,638

114
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:15,478
of the great Gardener was the man and so

115
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,240

116

give him some Barb John likes to be a

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,800
little overzealous when he's

123
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,639
how I stuck in an extra hit there that's

124

207
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,078
hitting pipes out of the the five or six

208
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,919
that are on the table particularly for

209
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,799
hash and particularly whether I've done

210
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,120
it I think one time with a dil but even

211
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,838
particularly with that beine rip big you

212
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,879

it's time for it's not like we always

00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,159
say though it's not enough to have heady

287
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,560
glass you need to have heady hash

288
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,319
absolutely so I mean headyy glass

289
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,359
without headyy hash is just kind of in

290
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,240
my opinion a darn shame it is yeah it's

291

as far as they're going to go

441
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,400

py OG yeah I'm good with that yeah okay

458

that's accept that's acceptable we we

459
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,959
did that a dry sifting just the other

460
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,960
day and we were commenting and I think

461
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
they were parent on that one was uh 39

462
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,279
or

463
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,919
41 from he has to explain 12 from yes

464
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:06,639
please out of the sift we made which was

465
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:10,080
12 g y we got 40% of that was heads when

466
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:15,278
I cleaned it nice so it's not 40% return

467
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:20,839
it's not 40% THC it's not 40% heads it's

468
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:23,319
40% of our initial sift was heads yeah

469
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:25,759
and the 60% just ended up being a I

470
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:28,599
guess smaller heads and some

471
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:33,038
contaminant it sure was nice all of it

472
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:35,759
was almost 40% yeah we had 37 39 and 41

473
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,720
yeah was there one as low as 37 yeah I

474
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,400
thought it was like that was the two

475
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,640
kushes oh

476
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,880
okay that was just probably because it

477
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,559
was just less um buds

478
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,679
mhm so this was your handiwork FL yes

479
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:54,399
awesome I love the smell of it it's got

480
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:58,640
that real hazy seedsman Haze I guess you

481
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,759
and I could just do dunks yeah totally

482
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,799
of a little dunk there or a dab from the

483
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:07,079
slab for that matter a dab from the slab

484
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:09,200
with flab slab slab dabbing is good

485
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,038
that's turning into a slab that's which

486
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,440
one's that that would be the number four

487
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,119
oh that's the number four that's what we

488
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,038
you

489
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,879
