2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:12,419
all right we're here in Barcelona at the

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,329
spannabis 2019 we're actually in the

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,519
city right now at the W Hotel

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,519
we're here with Kelly Blackwell who has

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,309
practiced sadi Pleven of civil

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,320
disobedience in order to I guess maybe

8
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,439
originally give her son a higher quality

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,320
of life but also to actually extend his

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,659
life and and bring him out of out of a

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,119
near-death experience so Callie I'll

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,179
leave it up to you two to tell the

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,488
viewers here on bubbleman's world what

14
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:46,378
how this all transpired okay thank you

15
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:49,949
very much I'm Katie back well and I got

16
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,179
into cannabis because in 2010 my son was

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,829
diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic

18
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,329
leukemia and then two years later he was

19
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,359
diagnosed with a much rarer form of

20
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,920
cancer called even cell sarcoma this

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,149
left him to be the only person in the

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
world to have the two colors together

23
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,280
and because there was no protocol for

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,590
him doctors this idea to give him a bone

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,478
marrow transplant

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,490
now unfortunately Darren had four bone

27
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,650
marrow transplants in ten months because

28
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,989
each one subsequently failed - from the

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,240
donut one from himself and then the last

30
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:25,819
and final moment transplant was his own

31
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:28,109
cells Darren had been through

32
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:31,109
radiotherapy five years or four years of

33
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:33,180
radiotherapy chemotherapy say because

34
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,290
there's no protocol there words where we

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,970
will give him everything the kind

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,770
without killing him so you had adult

37
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:42,569
doses of everything and then three days

38
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,859
after he had his final transplanting

39
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,508
Travis fingers down the side of his

40
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,118
hospital bed and picked on put to

41
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,530
catastrophic infections in his hands now

42
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,899
with the brand-new bone marrow

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,409
trying to kick in and it usually happens

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,759
within 21 23 days but it was just

45
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,590
struggling far too much with these

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,118
catastrophic infections you also have

47
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,359
one in his mouth as well which was a

48
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,599
kind of portion of his tongue so he was

49
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,849
in a really bad way

50
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,799
told us that nobody has ever engrafted

51
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:11,229
with a bone-marrow transplant after 50

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,760
days hasn't happened by 50 days it's not

53
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:15,909
happening there's nothing there there's

54
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:17,649
no chance so day 46 came we'd always

55
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,849
have many many conversations running up

56
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,340
to there saying you know we've only got

57
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:25,479
one chance left this so we knew it was

58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,840
coming but on December the 8th 2013 they

59
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,879
said to us ok there is nothing else left

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,819
now you need to go to a hospice when do

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,269
you want to go and I said well how long

62
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:38,560
are we talking I saw his antibiotics and

63
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:42,039
the only things that were keeping him

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
alive apparently I saw them as a

65
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,568
conscious life-support machine because

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,980
Darren was very aware and and he was

67
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,568
part of the conversation I was always

68
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,310
very open with him about every part of

69
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:55,208
his journey because I it's his body's

70
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,039
his his life right so they told us that

71
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,989
once they unhooked him from hounds of

72
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,389
politics we were looking at 3 days a

73
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:05,230
week at most these infections ravaged

74
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:07,509
him and when did we want to go sorry

75
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:09,939
December the 11th question yeah three

76
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:12,159
days when would you like to go your

77
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:14,229
child yeah they say he was in a bad way

78
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,859
but what about mum I mean you were with

79
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:19,419
him the entire time you were basically

80
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,040
experiencing this horror yeah the other

81
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:23,139
side of the coin it was a roller coaster

82
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,030
board I never bought ticket to you and I

83
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:28,089
couldn't get off and I couldn't get up

84
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,250
from that from July the census 2010 I

85
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,409
was on that roller coaster and from that

86
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,269
day that very first day that they told

87
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,400
me have leukemia I knew there was a

88
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,079
chance we could lose him so fast forward

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,299
four years and the roller coaster I've

90
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,219
been on I had already grieved him we'd

91
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,680
already accepted it was it was very

92
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,269
matter-of-fact everything that happened

93
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,099
at the time and I think for me

94
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,280
especially it was a guarded way if I'd

95
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,449
have allowed my emotions to take over

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,219
nothing would have got done you know

97
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,108
it'd have been four years of hell I

98
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,519
think you know we don't have a choice of

99
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,070
what happens to us but how we react to

100
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,539
it that's everything we have that yeah

101
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,969
that's everything I mean as a parent I

102
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:06,209
just picture yeah fetal position corner

103
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:09,248
it's how you are in your head

104
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,949
like when you're on your own and crying

105
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:13,658
but I found writing very cathartic and

106
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,949
so because therein was so bad when he

107
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:17,139
was the only one in the world to have

108
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,629
these two cancers the only one in the

109
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:22,090
world why my book is called 2.7 billion

110
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,310
because he was the only one and I

111
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:26,258
started a journal I started writing and

112
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,439
blogging about him in hope to find other

113
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:31,120
people with the same cancer in it and

114
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,848
and because of that by the time we got

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,889
to the hospice he had twelve thirteen

116
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:38,620
thousand followers on social media so I

117
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,360
was finding every day I was writing what

118
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,399
was happening and I was getting feedback

119
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,080
from people saying I'm she was scared to

120
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,959
check on Facebook in case he's dead you

121
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,430
know and it's like but by far the way

122
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,698
cathartic at the end of David that was

123
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,579
my therapy um so we went to the hospice

124
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,800
and Darren didn't go was in the first

125
00:04:54,579 --> 00:05:00,339
three days this was December the 11th he

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,189
just turned 14 on December the first so

127
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:05,529
we went and I say he didn't go anywhere

128
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:07,240
we had Christmas on December the 14th

129
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:08,829
then we had another Christmas on

130
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,038
December the 25th then we have New

131
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:13,598
Year's and Darren was still here but his

132
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,339
organs were slowly shutting down his

133
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:17,469
stomach was producing a pint of bile

134
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:20,500
every couple of hours I was having to

135
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,060
draw out of a nasal gastric tube because

136
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,228
if I didn't eat vomit and the tube would

137
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,769
come up he'd have to have another one

138
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:28,180
put down and ask for a tramatic so um

139
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,339
you know who having to do all this and

140
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,620
it was just the case of waiting and

141
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:36,069
Darren started to get very anxious

142
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,079
because he just wanted to go now he

143
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,240
plans we sat down and we planned his

144
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,490
funeral he plans the venue the hearse

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,740
the music the costumes because it was

146
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,750
fancy dress don't have an idea be fancy

147
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,629
dress and he picked some very

148
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,610
tongue-in-cheek uniform was full for

149
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,168
many of his family members he can have

150
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,650
the last laugh that this was one of the

151
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:57,339
things that really grabbed me about this

152
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,560
story

153
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,819
watching the interview about with both

154
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,918
of you sitting there and talking about

155
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:06,550
planning his funeral and just the

156
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,500
positivity you know in his in his eyes

157
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,569
while he was explaining it in the smiles

158
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,218
and it was just like wow like this is

159
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:14,680
this is the thing that most of us on the

160
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:16,129
planet er are the most afraid of you

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,038
know people are terrified

162
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:21,259
death and here have a child you know

163
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,838
facing it yeah he couldn't wait he was

164
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:25,580
he he was looking forward to and the

165
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:26,928
planning of every hero will I mean

166
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:28,488
hearing have a Playstation a couple of

167
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,558
watches to give away but you know he did

168
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,688
it and he also wrote letters to family

169
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:34,338
members picking them up on their

170
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,899
behavior and literally giving them

171
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:37,668
advice the saying look if you carry on

172
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,860
in this way this you know life is too

173
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:42,139
short for this you know he really did it

174
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,709
was incredible quite something to have a

175
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,329
child who's on his way out use that term

176
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:50,300
you know life is too short

177
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:51,618
yeah it's like well okay no denying man

178
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,179
exactly exactly

179
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:58,879
listen yeah um so yeah days 69 came

180
00:06:56,178 --> 00:07:00,618
around and Darren was still alive and

181
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,209
kicking although bit he was you know I

182
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,409
say things are slowly shutting down and

183
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:05,629
the doctors were saying to me this is

184
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:08,118
the beginning now it's this is this is

185
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:11,718
what we see and Darren starts get very

186
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:15,199
anxious now sort of two-three months

187
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:17,468
previously because Darren had the

188
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,179
catastrophic infections in his hands

189
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:21,860
basically his fingers here down were

190
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:23,478
black them an aquatic they were

191
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,740
literally dying on the end of his hand i

192
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,949
I've been crying about this this morning

193
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,050
an immediate life or how did he feel I'm

194
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,848
crying over one day of this and he was

195
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,429
like this for couple of months no

196
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:36,319
literally feeling his hand died so they

197
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:37,818
wanted to amputate I stopped them from

198
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,829
amputate and I said look I don't him

199
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,689
means he's dying just I wanted to die

200
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:43,189
pain-free that's all I don't want to die

201
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,199
on morphine because he didn't want to

202
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,669
die on morphine you know he'd written a

203
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,379
death plan saying that they'd taken

204
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:50,868
everything they're not taking his death

205
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:54,709
and he wanted to die conda's mentis he

206
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:56,360
wanted to experience it so I talked them

207
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,949
into giving them here and you reacted me

208
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,408
here when they took out the nerves they

209
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,879
actually cauterized the nerves so that

210
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:03,259
he never feed his hands again and they

211
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,149
said look you'll never feed his hand

212
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,479
he'll never use it and I said I don't

213
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:10,728
care his diet doesn't matter you know um

214
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,318
but previously to that I'd ask them for

215
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:14,359
he was on the fence and oh he was on

216
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,598
morphine nothing was touching his pain

217
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,600
so I have a look up alternative

218
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:20,339
treatments for pain

219
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,350
Petric hand came up which is a cannabis

220
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,939
based product available in Holland and

221
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,040
I've read an article about a guy who got

222
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,199
it on prescription he gone over and so I

223
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,330
I said look we can do this I'm willing

224
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,360
to go toilet no it's not licensed for

225
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:34,949
children you can't have it okay but it

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,930
could work it works very well on your

227
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,720
Pathak painting it works yeah but you

228
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,259
know so I thought okay well I'll do it

229
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,879
myself

230
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,220
main ingredient cannabis I can get some

231
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,769
of that so I've got some from friends

232
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,840
who had met I'm a just a vegetable

233
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,879
glycerine teacher with the with the

234
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,310
plant plant out left with this honey

235
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,960
kind of stuff and I put it in a vape pen

236
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,159
theme because he was in hospital and I

237
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,290
thought if he can have a vape pen it

238
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,449
might work on his but it didn't but he

239
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,649
liked it he felt quite cool sitting in

240
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,890
the hospital room like this plume of

241
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:05,909
smoke

242
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:10,500
no it felt naughty but in his how old at

243
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:12,569
this time and 13 for not attending 14 so

244
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,700
to me was like what I tried or failed

245
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,040
I didn't think any more of it so fast

246
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,430
forward now a nice business day 69 and

247
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,519
he's very anxious so they start upping

248
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:25,109
the morphine and I'll ask for bone

249
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,120
marrow aspirate to be done when they go

250
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,009
into the main ball joint and they take

251
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,060
out a piece of bone marrow and then they

252
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,980
can look at it and tell you exactly

253
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:35,009
what's going on it's it's much more

254
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,960
accurate than a blood test now when we

255
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,189
gone there his neutrophil count which is

256
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,600
the white blood cells that fight

257
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,210
infection were naught point naught

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,159
naught naught v which is nothing there's

259
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,930
nothing there so obviously still alive

260
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,459
so I said look please do another test

261
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,839
tell me that it's tough definitely

262
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,090
nothing there because he's still here

263
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,690
you know you should be dead so they did

264
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,769
a test they 69 it came back nothing

265
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,690
nothing there I remember the nerves

266
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,460
coming to me with a piece of paper and I

267
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,310
opened it and I'm so sorry there's

268
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,780
there's nothing but both me and Darren

269
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:05,879
had talked about this and we both hoped

270
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,009
that there was nothing because as sad as

271
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:09,600
it was I didn't want to I didn't want to

272
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,860
see him suffer anymore and I mean it

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
gets to the point you know when you when

274
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,149
your dog is poorly and you have to make

275
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,269
that decision right this is exactly the

276
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:20,370
same thing but it's it's a child and so

277
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,409
I was we both look at each other when

278
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,700
good it's just a matter of time now you

279
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,110
know it's the end of the podding and the

280
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,640
poke

281
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,610
and of the hospital visits and of all

282
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,069
that um I say they starts giving

283
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,509
morphine he started to be in and out of

284
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,640
consciousness and this wasn't what he

285
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:38,000
want ends so they took the morphine away

286
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,588
he still very anxious about when am I

287
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,328
gonna die thinking he's gonna you know

288
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,990
die in this he just didn't know when it

289
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:44,419
was coming

290
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:48,259
so the sleeping tablets obviously made

291
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:50,838
him very in and out again so I just

292
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:53,328
thought well as a mother I have to give

293
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,980
him what he wants in his end of life I

294
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:57,139
can't do anything else for him other

295
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,920
than ensure that he gets his very last

296
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,819
dying wish

297
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:05,328
that's my only duty now right so I just

298
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,649
thought I saw this tincture and I

299
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:08,500
thought I just got I'm just gonna give

300
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,730
him a load in his mouth and just get

301
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,429
chills people out right kind of his

302
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:16,430
chills people out so I gave him five mil

303
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:18,049
under his tongue sublingually and within

304
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:22,069
half an hour his whole demeanor I

305
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:24,740
literally saw the relaxation could

306
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,500
literally see it in him now about half

307
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,360
an hour after that a nurse came to the

308
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,190
door with a drug called cyclers in now

309
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,230
Darrin had become incredibly addicted to

310
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,089
this drug so much so that he would

311
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,940
scream at the nurses if you couldn't

312
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:40,970
have it every few hours and the way they

313
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,279
had administered to him had had caused

314
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,810
it was almost like care of him and he

315
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,639
was before it was incredibly addicted to

316
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:50,299
this drug and I saw the nurse come to

317
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,578
the door and I thought what if I've now

318
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:54,078
caused some contraindication and I can't

319
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,969
tell them what I've given him an arm God

320
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,739
and I didn't need to worry because he

321
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:02,259
turned to her and he said I don't want

322
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:04,669
it she's left her one dose and countless

323
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,850
other things I made a vegetable crisp it

324
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:10,698
wasn't even feet I you know it's just a

325
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,560
whole instruction and so I look and she

326
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:14,419
said well and I said go go before he

327
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,429
changes his mind and she took it and he

328
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:18,919
and I said you sure you don't you don't

329
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:21,469
want that and he said no this is enough

330
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,349
he said cannabis has given me everything

331
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,879
about drug gave me but without the he

332
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,329
was off his face when he was on that you

333
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,879
know

334
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:30,469
he said I don't want it sleeping tablets

335
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,749
stop the morphine stopped everything it

336
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,249
was an exit drug straight away and for

337
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,509
me it was already a miracle because this

338
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:38,209
was going to give him the death that he

339
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:41,028
wanted right so for me this was already

340
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:43,188
a miracle so he continued to give it to

341
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,808
him and over the following few days he

342
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:47,480
was really chill was really had a really

343
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:47,868
kind of he became very introspective as

344
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,789
well

345
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:51,980
he became very quiet in himself and

346
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:54,498
really started to think about things and

347
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,879
he really accepted death then and he was

348
00:12:54,499 --> 00:13:00,860
really ready to go there was no more

349
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:02,480
panicking Oh five days later we sat in

350
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,159
the in the lounge and Darren had a

351
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
heavily bandaged Terrence I mean he's

352
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,159
like Mickey Mouse he was and they said

353
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,199
don't take those bandages off because

354
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:12,558
underneath it's down to the bone and

355
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,419
it's surgically just you know so he's

356
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,159
there with his hands like this me asleep

357
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,748
when he woke up he pulled his hand out

358
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,659
and the bandage in the middle was off

359
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:23,329
and Martin won't look at my hands

360
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:25,879
what's wrong with your hand I didn't

361
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:28,488
even register that there was a third

362
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:32,058
bandage missing he said my finger look

363
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:34,220
at my finger so I went oh my god and it

364
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:36,198
looked like mine but much much thinner

365
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,339
that's not care but was no nail but it

366
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:42,378
was pink it was healed I was I was no

367
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:44,809
hang on this is wrong because you can't

368
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:47,058
even create skin cells without

369
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:49,428
functioning bone marrow you can't so I

370
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:50,749
said to the doctors we need we need

371
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,828
another test and they were running

372
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:53,899
around you know we need to do a blood

373
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:56,508
test massively he literally five days

374
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:59,418
ago there's nothing there and they said

375
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:02,058
we need to do a test and they did a

376
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:03,948
blood test an hour later it came back

377
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:07,698
and his neutrophil count was naught

378
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:11,778
point two five well so he had almost I

379
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:14,539
don't know how many hundred higher it

380
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:16,610
was a lot it was there anyway and so the

381
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:18,379
nurse the doctor was like well so what

382
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,610
you want us to do as I don't know what

383
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,499
you mean what do what I want you to do

384
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,928
and she said to Derek well you know

385
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:25,399
usual protocol is now if you get a

386
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:27,259
temperature we will give you antibiotics

387
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,659
you know what you wants to do nice it's

388
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:30,678
I want you to leave me the [ __ ] alone

389
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,659
and the doctor said well I swear we

390
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:33,819
flippin and I said

391
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:35,409
10 seconds ago he was dying and now

392
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,940
you're telling him he's not when you ask

393
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:39,819
him what he wants to do as far as

394
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,660
medical procedure come on please you

395
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,400
know so it was there so I continue to

396
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:46,929
give and his account just got more

397
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,629
higher and higher and higher and he

398
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:53,319
officially engrafted on day 104

399
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:56,439
holy smokes 55 days after the length of

400
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,870
the maximum yeah has anyone ever grafted

401
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,120
at that time no nobody after 50 days it

402
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,220
really is the the one in seven billion

403
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,519
boy yeah yeah but unfortunately got

404
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,009
worse after that his mental health

405
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,620
deteriorated oh just chronically because

406
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:13,860
now he didn't die and the hospital was

407
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,720
because I couldn't tell anybody why done

408
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,490
the hospital we're now saying well we

409
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,080
don't know if he's gonna live we don't

410
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,250
know where and they actually said in

411
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,570
front of him where he could drop down

412
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,470
dead next week we don't know

413
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,330
so this limbo he was now in limbo and he

414
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,040
explained it to me he said mom it's like

415
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,139
there's a door open and everything if

416
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,519
everyone adds is behind that door and

417
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,080
you get to the threshold and someone

418
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,259
slams it in your face and says not today

419
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,480
and you have to turn around to hospitals

420
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:42,639
and needles and drop and he just went I

421
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,170
don't want this anymore so for a period

422
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,439
of six months he tried to kill himself

423
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:49,959
mmm I took shoelaces away from him right

424
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,770
up outside all of these things we were

425
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,480
evicted from the hospice I I also took

426
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,949
the cannabis away because I wanted to

427
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,600
make damn sure that it wasn't a

428
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,070
coincidence and when I took the cannabis

429
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,440
away his blood count halfed

430
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,180
when I gave it back it doubled and I did

431
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,600
that over a six blood test period so I

432
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,849
knew I knew that it was that we always

433
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,950
loved to tell you it wasn't well done

434
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,210
clinical trials well the same to me we

435
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,670
can't say that it works

436
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,560
they called him a miracle they'd rather

437
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:20,979
say it was a miracle done anything else

438
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,379
you know even now but so for the next

439
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,789
six months trying to sleep and the the

440
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:27,580
room he chose to kill himself with

441
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:29,980
through starvation so he would literally

442
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,210
refuse to eat anything for six months

443
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,860
and he got down to about 24 25 kilos

444
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,290
which i think is about four stones and

445
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,060
pounds I think that's not a lot he was I

446
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,649
so showed you picture means he was

447
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:43,719
skeletal I've never seen anything like

448
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,570
it except for on documentaries of

449
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,660
Auschwitz and things like man it was

450
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:52,060
skeletal and it was the most horrendous

451
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:53,259
six months because cancers one thing and

452
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,149
treatment is one thing almost the

453
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,819
passenger to that but this was now

454
00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:00,909
Darren and I was trying to encourage

455
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,890
Darren to eat and he was no because I

456
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:03,699
couldn't I couldn't give him a future to

457
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,369
look forward to

458
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,250
so that was devastating so they wanted

459
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:11,588
to section him sedate him and force-feed

460
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,410
him I asked for some mental health care

461
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:17,168
and was told he didn't qualify so he

462
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,970
never saw anybody for that so his left

463
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:22,120
to me in my pop psychology trying the

464
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,370
game to E and and then I got involved

465
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,659
with some local communist cops cuz also

466
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:27,639
had seen what countless have done so I

467
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,380
started to branch out and look and I

468
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,450
found a very local characters club some

469
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,100
lovely people who kept telling me you

470
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,569
need to meet this guy projected fields

471
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:36,459
you need to meet Jeff ditch fields and

472
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:39,939
Ron Stovall who's Japanese I google him

473
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,620
okay Wow so a friend of mine said look I

474
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,450
have a villa in Spain taken to Spain

475
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,349
taken on holiday you haven't been away

476
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,600
for years and years

477
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:48,308
get away I managed to talk the hospital

478
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,168
and to let me take him and I said look

479
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:52,329
if I take him on holiday and I come back

480
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,250
and he's still refusing to eat I'll sign

481
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:57,579
him over to you I haven't actually cycle

482
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:01,109
whatever you need to do so you took him

483
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:04,149
to Spain and that was in July 2014 and

484
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:05,469
met Jeff the following day only wanted

485
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,450
to say hello to me thank him for his

486
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,829
work really but he then looked at Darren

487
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,220
and said my god he looks like he's dying

488
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:14,289
I said yeah it kind of is you know and

489
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,539
he said I think I can help with this and

490
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,940
I was like well you know he's because I

491
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,649
again didn't think about the eating

492
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,410
sorry I didn't even curse me about the

493
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:26,280
munchies you know yeah and he said look

494
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:29,930
he's a syringe of oil it was

495
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:32,609
Nevin Hayes I believe it was Graham and

496
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:35,250
took him back to the apartment and the

497
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:38,369
following day I gave him a tiny tiny

498
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,890
little bit on a on a crisp and I said

499
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:42,929
don't eat this and he did yeah it's it

500
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,970
because drugs he'll try anything

501
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,950
you know he's I've seen him on cats and

502
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,789
I've seen them on everything so kind of

503
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,710
it I had no qualms and giving him this

504
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:54,089
and so half now an hour later I was

505
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,220
prepping lunch and he was down by the

506
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:57,629
pool with his brother and I I shouted

507
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,420
down here do you want anything to eat

508
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,160
expecting the same gun to come back and

509
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:07,350
Darren shall we don't make me loads I'm

510
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,690
starving so straightaway food gave him

511
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:11,250
food he ate for 12 hours yeah for 12

512
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,269
hours the next day and the next day

513
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:17,339
other next day and he just his life came

514
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:19,589
back into his eyes he was very very thin

515
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:21,779
people in Spain were looking at him like

516
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:24,149
he was dying but to me he looks

517
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:27,539
incredible because I'd seen him with you

518
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,950
at home so far yeah I see this the scene

519
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:31,349
a piece in my book the light in his eyes

520
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,960
kept just switched back on and he was

521
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:36,000
back in the room you know so we came

522
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,880
back after 12 days in Spain we came back

523
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,130
to the UK and the doctor took me to one

524
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,320
side and said my god he's his mental

525
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:47,760
health is improved by 300% I said I know

526
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:49,349
it happens when you eat food yeah you

527
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,029
know and she said he doesn't want to die

528
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:53,459
I said I know and she said he's put on

529
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:54,960
four kilos I said I know she said the

530
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,029
holiday demon worlds are good I mean yes

531
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,680
it's not today yes we'll leave it

532
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,079
they'll accept that they'll accept that

533
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,600
yes anciens you know they'll accept that

534
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,730
and again I had to stay quiet because I

535
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,799
was terrified of social services coming

536
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,170
in taking my children not only with

537
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,819
Darren you know be taken in scabby who's

538
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,100
one thing that now clearly was working

539
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,750
for him again cannabis now this is the

540
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:19,049
second time cannabis is brought him back

541
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:22,519
from the brink and so he's been on oil

542
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:24,859
every single day since July 2014

543
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:27,849
every day without fail 150 micrograms

544
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:31,869
milligrams say micrograms a milligram

545
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:36,109
milligrams 122 milligrams every day and

546
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:37,729
the things I have seen since that so it

547
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,199
was a miracle the first incidence the

548
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,470
second time was a miracle in my eyes

549
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,580
what's happened since is miraculous his

550
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:49,160
hand he can feel only the tips of his

551
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,629
fingers he can't feel about two weeks

552
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,490
after he came back from Spain he starts

553
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,600
seeing mom my hands hurting this is your

554
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,130
hand can't hurt me

555
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,569
you have no nerves your hand corner

556
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,860
we're telling you mommy said it's like

557
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:00,529
electric shocks coming down my fingers

558
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:02,928
it's a pain for me wiring the nerves

559
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:05,690
Regenesis neurogenesis was rebuilding

560
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,480
neural pathways in his hands from around

561
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,130
the damage and I say now he he has he

562
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,769
has problems he has to pick things up

563
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,559
like this mhm but he has full range of

564
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,509
movement he wants to be a chef he oh

565
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:19,519
it's incredible you know and I literally

566
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:22,099
slapped his hand on his oncologist s and

567
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:26,329
go-to thing that I can't economist but I

568
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:28,129
can own a better one here he has a

569
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:30,769
basket necrosis in his right femur which

570
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,450
was basically an inch of bone at the end

571
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:34,490
of his femur which was dead necrotic and

572
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,440
that was due to steroid use while he was

573
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,480
climbing and the blood couldn't get to

574
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,549
the bone so it died and they told me

575
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,130
that within five years he would need a

576
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,480
knee replacement if he were to survive

577
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,630
because this is irreparable you can't

578
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,789
repair dead bone right so I think it was

579
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,650
about six or nine months ago now he had

580
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:53,599
an MRI scan because his left leg is very

581
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,720
twisted the bones are physically

582
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,219
deformed so so he had an MRI scan and I

583
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,470
started the oncologist office and he

584
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,910
said I believe you are under the

585
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,130
impression that Darren had a vascular

586
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,509
crisis I said no I wasn't under the

587
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,960
impression I had the scan would you like

588
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:10,970
to see them well um you know because I

589
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,350
believe you must have been under the

590
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,390
impression I saw you're gonna tell me

591
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:16,639
it's gone and he said well yes but

592
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,590
that's impossible and I said well kill

593
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,150
it's not because it's happened and he

594
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:21,678
said well I don't see any if I don't see

595
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,620
this in any of my other patients and I

596
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,960
said none either

597
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:27,029
from cannabis and he said I knew you'd

598
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,019
say that word and I said I'm going to

599
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,670
keep saying it because you're the reason

600
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,230
why my son's still alive and you've got

601
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,279
60 people out there that could benefit

602
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,710
from it and you'd rather put your

603
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,690
fingers in your ears I said this is

604
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,039
happening the a Baskin coasters is gone

605
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:43,049
the near ectomy it's been fixed he's now

606
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,909
six years post his last trial in almost

607
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,919
six years process last transplant so

608
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,058
they are saying that he should have

609
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,279
cataracts by now

610
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:52,529
he should have a heart murmur at least

611
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,549
he should have issues with his internal

612
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:55,349
organs because the amount of

613
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:57,419
radiotherapy and chemotherapy they blast

614
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:59,849
in it he should be having now it's

615
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,519
called long term side effects if you

616
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:04,409
live longer than five years if because

617
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,269
that's all they go for is five years if

618
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,350
you get past the five-year mark they

619
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,359
don't start looking for these long-term

620
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:12,029
side effects so Darren's going in

621
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,159
regularly and there's nothing there's

622
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:16,619
not even a sign of any long-term side

623
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,509
effects and they are bamboozled they're

624
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,699
they can't understand and he sits and

625
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:22,740
goes kind of this kind of pest cannabis

626
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,330
you know and then and he's had it

627
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,829
written on all of his medical records he

628
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:28,079
stood over his oncologist and said I

629
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:29,519
want me to write what I did and what I

630
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,109
was taking on what I'm taking now

631
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,179
because I'm still taking it I want on my

632
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,649
notes but I don't take any of the full

633
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,600
pharmaceutical drugs that I'm supposed

634
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,610
to take the knife I don't take any of

635
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:43,199
them he's had maybe two colds in the

636
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:44,909
last five years he's been honestly he's

637
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,960
one of the most healthiest people I know

638
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,340
and he's he's supposed to the infertile

639
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,130
so I think next month he's going for

640
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:55,649
fertility because he's 20 this year it's

641
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,360
gonna be 20 in December so he's gone for

642
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,190
a fertility test because he wants to

643
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,539
know him and I said yeah don't rest on

644
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,980
your laurels with that I can guarantee

645
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,279
anyway you know he's gonna end up having

646
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,319
means of children you know it's like

647
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:10,410
it's just been it's nice night and day

648
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,269
from thee I mean it doesn't help from my

649
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,160
perspective when you have the word harm

650
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,769
in the first five letters of the word

651
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,710
pharmaceutical you know that's a strange

652
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:21,629
thing to have that word harm of all the

653
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,029
words you could have in the word that's

654
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,070
supposed to represent medicine and to

655
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,319
think of all of the things that just

656
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:30,269
kept going wrong as they continue to go

657
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,009
down that road I mean just the story

658
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:34,859
that you told that is so incredible and

659
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:38,819
then you just you know cannabis

660
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:40,619
truly is just unbelievable yeah and the

661
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:42,389
fact that there are people in this world

662
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:44,129
that would rather like you said put

663
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,549
their fingers in their ears and not hear

664
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,770
it it's it's it's criminal yeah it is

665
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:52,139
it's crazy it's actually beyond

666
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:54,119
negligence it's is sickening to allow

667
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,490
parents and and the loved ones of these

668
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,678
sick people and the sick people

669
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,679
themselves to go through that and and

670
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,929
just when it's it's how can we not use

671
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,940
the plant-based medicines as the first

672
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:08,220
line of defense why do we always have to

673
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,980
wait till three days before death yeah

674
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:14,120
and I know in the UK you know like I see

675
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,400
what's going on there in the UK is it's

676
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,989
it's not good not with cannabis you know

677
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,880
what they're doing and the way I mean

678
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,500
the southern little guy who they were

679
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,110
took his medicine away at the border

680
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,109
like this is this is like what you would

681
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:31,229
expect a demon to do if you ever came

682
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:33,959
across a dinos you know okay so that's

683
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:37,589
yeah it's completely just really evil

684
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,019
yeah evil oh it must be a miracle no

685
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:42,839
you're under the impression yes I mean

686
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,629
yeah this is exactly why I feel that I

687
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,250
do what I do now is that obviously since

688
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,400
since all those followers that Darren

689
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,960
had they all saw this miracle and then I

690
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,059
started to get inundated with people who

691
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,829
wanted the same miracle and so I'd tell

692
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:57,119
them I would what I did and many of them

693
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:59,939
would say oh no I can't do that it's

694
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:02,069
illegal and which is sad but I respected

695
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,230
that and so for the last five years

696
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:06,720
because I wrote a book and I've been in

697
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,339
television and I've been very open and

698
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,079
out about this and I've been in

699
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:10,859
Parliament I've told the chief of police

700
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,678
what I do

701
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,649
I told specific MPs what I do I was

702
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,850
arrested outside Parliament not long ago

703
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,710
probably test their nice dresses our

704
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:21,389
suffragettes as well so it's kind of it

705
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,160
was the public I didn't intend to get

706
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,230
arrested but it just happens we've make

707
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,860
very good photos mien kampf stress as a

708
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,360
suffragette hundred years later fighting

709
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,509
for the right to give my child cannabis

710
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,979
now and 100 years

711
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:34,990
I couldn't vote but I could give my

712
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,539
child Cadmus and their tables have

713
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,630
turned right so so now I'm inundated

714
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:42,369
with people who come to me again

715
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,870
at the end of their life such a shame

716
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:47,529
that it's usually at the ends of their

717
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:50,409
life but so now I've seen I've seen this

718
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:53,500
plan for perform miracles hundreds and

719
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,300
hundreds of times since then hundreds of

720
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,579
people have come off pharmaceutical

721
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:00,220
drugs and onto cannabis because they've

722
00:26:57,579 --> 00:27:04,750
come to me and so now I will now

723
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,880
introduce today say the JJ is she's my

724
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,990
right-hand lady she's we've known each

725
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,940
other for a few years

726
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:14,109
we've both been working in cannabis but

727
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:16,120
it was came a very natural organic join

728
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:18,819
with we're having a pairing yeah really

729
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:20,289
between us that the people come to me I

730
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:22,509
do a lot of consulting I talked them

731
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:23,829
through cannabis and because many of the

732
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:25,000
people who've never touched cannabis and

733
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:27,579
their life when they come to me to you

734
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,440
right so I have to I'm giving them their

735
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:32,710
first hire on helping them I'm talking

736
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,420
them through and and then JD mixes up

737
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,529
the oils to the preparations to the may

738
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,509
shows that we need

739
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:39,129
she sources the oils we make sure that

740
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:41,289
we know where it's coming from so JD has

741
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,360
very good content absolutely our

742
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:46,389
standards are so high because this is

743
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,069
medicine this is not a joke if there's

744
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,330
alcohol in there that's not supposed to

745
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:51,309
be in there or if there's all this

746
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:53,679
contamination or we don't know what the

747
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,750
will the profile is every single piece

748
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,580
that everything to the ghost trust is

749
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,650
tested so we know exactly the profile

750
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:01,000
and because it's the only way that you

751
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,759
can administer medicine properly when

752
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,680
you know what's in it so we have this we

753
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,529
have this little relationship going

754
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,820
where we work very very well together

755
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:12,099
and it's yeah it's beautiful and I

756
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:14,679
couldn't do what I do without JJ you

757
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:16,779
know it she's been a godsend to me we

758
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,840
can now help far more people than just

759
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:21,369
me on my own you know so we've got other

760
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,289
people he's starting to get other people

761
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,409
on board but it's very difficult because

762
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:28,659
I guess our standards are so high but

763
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,160
not many people can meet those standards

764
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,570
unfortunately I have a lot of people

765
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,440
saying I haven't no Deval here do you

766
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:34,659
want me to do

767
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,029
you get rid of it through me I'll help

768
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,640
you and I say what is it tested Oh No

769
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:40,899
well I'll get some tested oh yeah but by

770
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,250
the time the test goes back it'll be

771
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,750
sold so you know you either have it now

772
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,190
or not Isilon I'm having not all then

773
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,049
thank you very much yeah of course I'm

774
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,259
not doing that I'm not peddling you all

775
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:52,539
you know so that makes it difficult if

776
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:54,129
we often have people sitting waiting for

777
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:56,019
test results to come back we will not

778
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:59,110
release the oil until test results come

779
00:28:56,019 --> 00:29:02,170
back so we are very stringent like that

780
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:04,209
um but yeah it's incredible and actually

781
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,850
I in the UK all those things aren't good

782
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,160
on the public side of things public

783
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:11,079
opinion is very good excellent the

784
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,580
public half I before I wrote my book

785
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,980
while I was writing my book before I

786
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:16,750
decided to publish it I used to look at

787
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,519
public opinion and whether one eye would

788
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,829
be safe coming out as a mother giving my

789
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,500
child an illicit drug because I was

790
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:25,059
watching people be very very angry about

791
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
mothers over in America who were giving

792
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,909
their children cannabis illegally no I

793
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,710
was just for pot heads and why are you

794
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,300
giving that to a child and you know

795
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,150
doctors know what they're doing it was

796
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,190
very much that kind of rhetoric and it

797
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,220
scared me too much to come out so I

798
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,840
wrote my book and I left it a few years

799
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,569
then I look to public opinion again and

800
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,889
I have changed dramatically - well

801
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:46,149
obviously we know that cannabis works

802
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,550
you know there was more of those

803
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,440
comments so I felt safe so I came out

804
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:52,659
when on a television I was one other

805
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,370
fact well I was the first person to ever

806
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,259
go on television and admit to breaking

807
00:29:54,369 --> 00:30:00,279
the law and actually give yeah yeah

808
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:02,500
there are a lot of other mothers in the

809
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,609
UK who really do their children needs

810
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,019
our Congress right now and they're

811
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:09,039
begging the government's given what they

812
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:11,349
need but um I wasn't going to beg to be

813
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,069
a lawful customer I my son's helps was

814
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:16,779
there paramount you know so I I was the

815
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:20,159
first one to come out on the television

816
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:20,160
and say that actually breaking the law

817
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,290
yeah oh my god there's absolutely Leah

818
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,119
yeah there was a lot of stigma and a lot

819
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:29,470
of fear and even now there's a lot of

820
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,559
stigma and or fear that are stopping

821
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,880
these parents from embarking on this

822
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,409
I'd since then since going on the

823
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,570
television I watched public opinion

824
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:42,259
again now sway and we are now at a point

825
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:45,079
where 99% of people on comments

826
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:47,599
especially are or yes campus works my

827
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,789
nine uses it all my even if they are

828
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,379
ready resources oil you know there's the

829
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:53,329
mass confusion at the moment with CBD or

830
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,310
in the UK and of course because there's

831
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:59,619
snake oil salesmen and it's there's all

832
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,619
sorts of sort of yes information about

833
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,869
the media push out CBD all has cannabis

834

all cure the media use the word cure in

835
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:09,259
the same sentence to see video so we

836
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,089
fighting against the misinformation the

837
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:14,629
propaganda the reefer madness everything

838
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:16,549

839
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,410

good for you you know so things have

843
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,769
really changed we just need the

844
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,330
government but the government are doing

845
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:28,599
what they're doing they're lining their

846
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:32,329
duct I've been a rotor that they can be

847
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:34,490
personally profiting from this it's not

848
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:35,929
about you know many people in the in the

849
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,970
UK we say we look at America like how

850
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:40,160
much money they've made that they've

851
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:42,529
paid Colorado paper schools health care

852
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,970
this they don't be great if I'm

853
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,319
fortunate in your care government don't

854
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,120
care about how much money they can put

855
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,889
in the public purse only care about what

856
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,389
can go in their pockets and when you've

857
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,310
got a prime minister whose husband is

858
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,350
the biggest investor in 2gw pharmacy

859
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:57,109
it's cool and our drugs minister who's

860
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:59,389
husband owns the land that 220 tons of

861
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:01,879
skunk is growing on every year in the UK

862
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,770
and yet has no medicinal benefit and

863
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,140
we're not allowed to have access to mass

864
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,539
hypocrisy' well it makes you psychotic

865
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,240
that's that that's the UK's media for

866
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,980
the last 15 years and we're actually but

867
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,400
we'll be able to sell it as a medicine

868
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:19,220
and are three good benefits back so your

869
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,009
son must be absolutely blown away and

870
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,200
inspired by how his experience has led

871
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:26,420
you guys down this journey now of

872
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,799
helping all of these other people what

873
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,840
does he think of that like he must see

874
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,719
that he sees it but I think he's quite

875
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,329
much

876
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:37,359
he's very Darrin lives in the moment and

877
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:39,218
he bet he does he always has he's he was

878
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:42,418
diagnosed with autism eight years old

879
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:45,580
and he's also has Tourette syndrome so

880
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,559
he's also seen that be treated very well

881
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:48,489
with with cannabis you can tell that he

882
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:49,749
has not ended the world for a little

883
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:51,519
while because you autistic trade start

884
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:54,460
coming out and you see it again with him

885
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,739
but so he is although he's very proud of

886
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,629
me I'm sure I'm sure I say that because

887
00:32:56,739 --> 00:33:00,308
he's never told me so I have to presume

888
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:02,368
that he is but this is Darrin I know I

889
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:04,418
know there and I don't expect any

890
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:07,088
anything like that from him but I know

891
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:08,440
that I know that he must be proud in

892
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:10,479
what I'm doing that I'm going on in

893
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,429
helping other people he knows now that

894
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:14,649
he comes second to cannabis he knows

895
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:17,649
that and so does my other son because

896
00:33:14,648 --> 00:33:20,319
this is far bigger done their day Darrin

897
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:22,058
has put me on a journey and now his

898
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,499
journey is to carry on whatever he wants

899
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:26,440
to do with his life this is now my

900
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:28,899
journey and he has firmly put me and he

901
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,548
knows that so he he's you know he's

902

904
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,829

905
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,928
still breathing

906
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:41,019

money for your for your group you know

912
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:54,729
generally in the story in the time when

913
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:55,899
we're online and we're talking that's

914
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:58,048
when really people are the most

915
00:33:55,898 --> 00:34:00,758
susceptible to be able to just hit that

916
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:02,168
donation they want people want to be

917
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,878
able to help especially with Nathan

918
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:05,979
especially when they hear a story that's

919
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:08,078
so incredibly inspirational like this

920
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:13,019
one it's just like what a journey this

921
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,019
was how many years from 2010 to

922
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,829
[Music]

923
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,658
place with your with your child where

924
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:24,118
you actually want them to die and where

925
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:26,940
a child has been through so much the 14

926
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,039
years that they want to die you know and

927
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,260
then cannabis turns it all around

928
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,969
completely isn't why isn't this

929
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,530
available to everybody that's what

930
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:36,059
drives us to carry on really I mean

931
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,340
Kenny's experienced she knows exactly

932
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:41,369
how it is for mom to be in that

933
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,659
situation when you actually want to

934
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:46,608
release your charge you've been

935
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,960

normal one just cut back well I have a

948
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,710

949
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:27,299
Callie Blackwell count at UK I don't get

950
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,920
to update that very often unfortunate

951
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,930
it's more like a holding page but you

952
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,789
can be directed to all of my social

953
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,899
media pages I have a donate page on

954
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:36,239
there as well it's very straight for you

955
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,579
to my PayPal which I don't expect people

956
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,098
to donate but if they want to then it it

957
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,108
will directly go to help because this is

958
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,359
a completely not-for-profit thing you

959
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:47,789
know we don't make any money on top of

960
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,579
what we do we know because you have a

961
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:52,529
sore yes I can't formally I can't

962
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,000
morally take I think you gotta make the

963
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,250
money from the sick P we can't morally

964
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,719
make money from someone that I know how

965
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,639
I feel like from the journey that you

966
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,849
just took financial burden

967
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:05,650
I mean not to say that hey we do need

968
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:07,599
companies that are going to come out and

969
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,220
make it accessible in a mass scale and

970
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,170
those companies will require to profit

971
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:13,449
to make profits so they can continue on

972
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,010
but it doesn't have to be this this

973
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:17,230
pharmaceutical model where it's ten

974
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,300
thousand ten thousand times the price

975
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:23,320
and it's only our product because it's

976
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,150
patented and it's some yeah like I say

977
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,120
that I was saying someone epidural X

978
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:30,849
which is the GW pharmaceutical CBD oil

979
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,469
that they bought out in November of the

980
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:34,509
for children who have been lucky enough

981
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:37,719
I say lucky enough to be prescribed in

982
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,460
the UK three of them now are I've gotten

983
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,529
completely backwards in fact have gone

984
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,619
worse than they were ever and he

985
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,540
literally like zombies and it seems to

986
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:49,329
be there's in the I think it's in the

987
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:51,000
insert of the epital X he says about the

988
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:53,980
strawberry flavoring causes severe

989
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,750
degeneration one of the main nerves so

990
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,579
the delivery system that they manage to

991
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,039
pager because they can't actually patron

992
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:03,489
cannabis so it's done reaching the

993
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:05,559
junior you know because of greed they

994
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:07,059
want to yeah control it well they're

995
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,710
nice to be side effects right there has

996
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:11,049
to be repeat customer otherwise John's

997
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,880
company goes our business if there's no

998
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,370
repeat customer then the drugs company

999
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,960
will come out its its business sense if

1000
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:18,699
you look at it on a business sense its

1001
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,440
it makes no sense to make something

1002
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:21,939
actually works otherwise he's got to the

1003
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,800
end of their business it reminds me of

1004
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,840
this young girl from Sweden who's been

1005
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,350
standing up for the environment grip

1006
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,400
Greta

1007
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:32,110

1008
