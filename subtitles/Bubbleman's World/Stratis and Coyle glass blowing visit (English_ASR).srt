11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,558
pretty fun little day with some pretty

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,000
beautiful eye candy I hear these guys

13
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,049
have been doing a really great job the

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,640
last few days they've got some

15
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,349
interesting things in the kiln and

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,320
they're probably gonna be busting it out

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,239
all day today from 12:00 to 5:00 so I'm

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,039
hoping on catching some of that magic

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:51,269
for you guys here a bubble man's world

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,939
and yeah I just whipped over I'm almost

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,590
out of breath because 20 minutes ago I

22
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,619
was at home I woke up a little late

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,449
jumped on my Harley ripped down to the

24
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,769
ferry for those of you that don't know

25
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,988
when you're on a motorcycle you get to

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,140
pass all the traffic pass all the line

27
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,489
ups there was a huge line up and

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,260
basically I made it on the ferry first

29
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,509
because I'm in the motorcycle group they

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,740
put you right to the top and that's

31
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,450
really the only reason I was able to

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,589
film this without a bunch of other

33
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,329
people here at the front of the ferry

34
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,978
so I'll probably film a little bit of

35
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:26,379
the trip there and share some of that

36
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:29,408
with you guys but otherwise look forward

37
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:32,649
to seeing Stratus Phil Segal and coil

38
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:37,289
condenser absolutely crushing it here on

39
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:37,289

put it

70
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,990

78
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,879
guys are here on the Sunshine Coast

79
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:23,789

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,990
Martin just kind of hit me up and needed

108
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,550
some people to come that's awesome so

109
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,879
the collaboration kind of was inspired

110
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:31,259
in a way through martin through you to

111
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,610
bring these groups together awesome and

112
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,958
how long have you guys spent like here

113
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,209
you've been here the last four or five

114
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,069
days or something okay I arrived on

115
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:44,849
Monday me and Phil both got here on

116
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:54,000
Monday yeah I heard you guys saw some

117
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:55,889
orcas yeah no that's just happening in

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,879
my areas well of lions Bay my

119
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:58,529
brother-in-law was

120
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,360
sitting on the beach first time in years

121
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,819
coming he's just like oh look there's

122
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,570
some orcas going by the beach like we

123
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,820
never see that cool so you guys are

124
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,840
working on a few pieces here in Canada

125
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,900
first and then you're gonna are you

126
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,879
gonna use those pieces as well as in we

127
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,559
kind of wanted to get together just to

128
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,169
brainstorm what we were going to do at

129
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,119
our demo since we're gonna be in in

130
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,579
Europe and we wanted to kind of bring

131
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,090
have a game play yeah bring a game plan

132
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,259
not just kind of wing it so we

133
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,670
definitely spent a good amount of time

134
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,519
just like thinking and drawing up

135
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:34,049
different designs and then do as much

136
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,699
work as we could on those designs

137
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:39,629
because we have to leave some work there

138
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,340
for the demonstration so glassblowing is

139
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,220
fun we just decided to make a few extra

140
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,899
pieces while we were hanging out so I

141
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,399
guess because Martin is sort of holding

142
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,049
down Europe you guys don't have to bring

143
00:10:47,399 --> 00:11:04,529
too too much equipment he's going to

144
00:10:49,049 --> 00:11:06,209
supply the torch it was my next question

145
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:09,569
I was going to say have you visited the

146
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,769
Herbert Arnold Factory dude listen I

147
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,330
walked through there with hops and

148
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:14,329
dizzle and they were like kids in candy

149
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,340
listen even for someone that just

150
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:23,360
appreciates glass myself who's never

151
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:38,389
blown any glass that place is next level

152
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:43,590
blow your mind the wall of hand-tools

153
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:46,500
all those different hand tools we had to

154
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,310
pull hops and is there any one of these

155
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,509
in one of these and one of these that's

156
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,829
cool so you guys are gonna go check out

157
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:55,200
the factory you guys are gonna do this

158
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,389
so one of those particular drawings that

159
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,590
you showed will probably be the project

160
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,559
that you guys put together they're

161
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,700
probably do two pieces maybe yeah we're

162
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,888
gonna try to get some work done

163
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:10,119
Martin's place awesome

164
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:12,489
some stuff there and then and then the

165
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:13,778
the glass pieces in the end where where

166
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:15,609
will those end up seeing their way

167
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:17,739
they'll probably get bought up right

168
