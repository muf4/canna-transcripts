88
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,938
he's doing really well apparently his

89
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,009
cancer that was the size of a golf ball

90
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:17,219
that card is still soft like a sponge

91
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:19,949
and I'm amazing that's the medicine I

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,019

mean I said thirty days he goes I got 29

94
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,978
for you 55 percent THC 20% CBD rate for

95
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,370
patients great for cancer I'm like

96
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:36,000
awesome awesome absolutely totally like

97
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,199
better go ahead he goes okay we have

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,300
these suppositories that are working

99
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,098
extremely well and we have someone have

100
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,689
this ovarian cancer and it kind of

101
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:44,129
really went and it was something they

102
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,089
don't understand why it's working so

103
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,829
well because once you take the

104
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,750
suppository it doesn't show up in your

105
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:50,008
system you have cannabinoids in it well

106
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,839
because they're doing all kinds of

107
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,788
testing and he's like I want to gift you

108
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,339
the suppository that was really nice say

109
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:57,930
I had no idea what type of condition

110
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,049
that are found was suffering from or

111
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,030
where the cancer was and just so ironic

112
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,579
that I think that this is gonna be the

113
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,989
key well I can tell you right off the

114
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,699
bat and I was talking to my friend

115
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,110
earlier and sort of mentioned he was

116
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,639
getting excited you think this could

117
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,080
really work and I was like of course I

118
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,939
do it's worked for lots of people why

119
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,759
wouldn't it it started creating this

120
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,740
hope first in him then in his cousin

121
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,139
then in his auntie and and in you know

122
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,389
you could feel it before we left we

123
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,668
dosed her a small amount it was it was a

124
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:30,129
little bigger than a small amount drop

125
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:33,399
yeah it was it was a mill and so

126
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:37,240
that's good it was nice to see her in

127
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:39,370
the 30 to 45 minutes afterwards okay the

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,990
change was very noticeable she was

129
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,060
leaning into her conversation she was

130
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,769
paying more attention you could you

131
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,110
could see physically her pain levels

132
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:49,089
were going down and she was actually you

133
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,470
know she had hope and she kept

134
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:52,899
mentioning it over and over again and I

135
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,730
told my friend you know hope is like a

136
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:56,229
big part of putting cancer into

137
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,670
remission obviously you need the right

138
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:04,030
tools but hope hope is the beginning and

139
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:07,629
we left there Johnny B we left some hope

140
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:13,089
there Oh a big box of it a huge box of

141
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:16,000
it yeah really good I want to thank your

142
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:20,079
friend for helping out obviously he's

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,230
doing this in it's amazing to me in this

144
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,789
day and age appear crop dogs yeah

145
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,410
pure crop dossier we'll put it in the

146
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,550
we'll put it in the bottom there where

147
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,560
you can look at these products but it's

148
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,660
amazing to me that legal companies are

149
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,600
still not allowed to make this product

150
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,189
available to me John's friend is a hero

151
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,680
for practicing the level of civil

152
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:41,529
disobedience that's necessary to get

153
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,720
people like the woman we just saw she's

154
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,789
the hero taking the medicine that rakaat

155
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,500
is required why are we not making this

156
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,840
accessible why are we worried about the

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,550
bottom lines of companies so I'm

158
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,099
personally very very excited to have

159
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,620
been a part of this today we'll follow

160
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,740
along the story we really hope that the

161
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,240
story continues on with with a you know

162
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,460
there's not going to be an ending to it

163
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,319
but there'll be a continuation and as

164
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:07,329
long as that continuation is successful

165
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,360
and the quality of life is increased for

166
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:12,849
for this woman and the quantity of life

167
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,220
is increased then cannabis has once

168
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,439
again done its job and do its job right

169
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,110
away so we need to have a bowl I know

170
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,579
do it hey let's do it this was that was

171
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,500
a little that was a good thing we did up

172
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:28,089
there your highness I love teaching

173
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,699
people about how cannabis saves lives

174
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:32,739
and and like you know I would say I'll

175
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,930
talk to her about the decarboxylated and

176
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,970
how of minds of receptors and the work

177
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,340
that we did with dr. Paul Harvey back in

178
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,280
the days and how I got off on my opioid

179
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:45,069
drugs using just a natural gaba and

180
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,679
converted forms of THC and really it's

181
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:50,620
it's it's come so far now and we're

182
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,769
going back 15 years ago and now is today

183
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,149
is like we're still fighting for it to

184
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,889
be access

185
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:07,899
I know true they they just baked those

186
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:11,919
things so hard pretty crazy the pressure

187
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:14,019
I had to use let me tell you anyway very

188
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,300
nice very nice experience I'm really

189
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:17,680
looking forward to you know and enduring

190
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,509
this she was like we need to make these

191
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,879
things available to people like it so

192
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,079
it's so contagious the the vibe of

193
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,279
wanting to help people I can already

194
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,500
picture this woman getting better

195
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,209
creating her own little groove here that

196
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,100
starts singing everywhere you go for

197
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:32,079
information getting this information out

198
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,250
there like all of you who do the same

199
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
thing you know these people who do that

200
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,690
they're always sharing and talking and

201
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,968
we talk about making it normal by just

202
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,719
sitting here out in the open doing to us

203
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:46,379
we're loud too

204
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:49,770
did you bring a dabber I took a poke at

205
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,769
you gotta have one

206
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,320
gotten up will you say that's one thing

207
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,970
I forgot husband you know we got your

208
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
keys very key we can make this work we

209
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,649
could do dunx dogs we're doing donk

210
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,778
sometimes you have to make the best of

211
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,149
it dude exactly the worst-case scenario

212
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:07,338
when you don't have a dabber is you need

213
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:09,709
to take a DAB that's about 10 times the

214
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,940
size of the one you make it's okay it's

215
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,990
really okay right there look at that

216
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,089
okay you know what I have to do

217
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,669
so one thing happened last time on this

218
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:23,779
is how'd you can season get clean that

219
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:26,208
well so we got some DC cleaner there

220
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:30,338
fired up

221
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:30,338
bring out a nice little business card

222
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:38,539
even a business card in my entire wallet

223
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,399
no I like to fold them and then use it

224
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:47,178
to drop the resin in but so that's okay

225
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:48,769
I can do it another way I love it you

226
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:51,860
know if i sat here and tried to burn all

227
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:53,419
this off I'd actually chose my Banga so

228
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,149
you're gonna bear with me guys here I'm

229
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:58,428
doing the quick clean too but you know

230
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,078
the best thing about this lady was let

231
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:01,639
me do it for you why is she she was

232
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:08,778
going on about how she had a kidney

233
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:10,549
removed and how she was and her pain was

234
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:13,068
getting so bad and you know what do they

235
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:16,068
have on hydro morphine it's like all

236
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:17,778
this bad stuff and she's telling me

237
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:19,669
about all the pharmaceutical drugs she

238
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:22,039
was on and then I I date back and like

239
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:24,049
we know go right back to you Mike

240
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,969
you know talk about a good good neighbor

241
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:29,539
Mike Martin and I says well Michael

242
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,069
Michael is also on a like a cocktail of

243
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:32,149
drugs and when I said you have to get

244
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:33,798
rid of these egos but that's what keeps

245
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:35,928
me alive so this is what's killing you

246
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:37,789
actually it's just like it's like

247
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:40,009
certain things are killing you the

248
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:42,828
opioid drugs are killing you those heavy

249
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:45,110
heavy narcotic drugs are clearly causing

250
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:47,149
more pain and even talking with Elaine

251
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,289
chasey paint she looked me in her eyes

252
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,120
she goes you know what I'm talking about

253
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:51,709
oh yes and the only person who knows

254
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,179
about chasing pain of the people who's

255
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,710
truly in pain because you can't explain

256
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:56,149
that to anyways who have done it and

257
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,960
then then she looked at me she goes you

258
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:01,819
know what I'm talking about I know what

259
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,129
the pain and I know how I deal with it

260
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,900
and I use cannabis she doesn't want to

261
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,090
get rid of the pants and you can't get

262
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,850
rid of pain pain is what we call

263
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,870
manageable but when you're using opiates

264
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,250
you get rid of it that's why you're

265
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,870
chasing paper because pain never goes

266
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,450
away when it didn't with something

267
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,009
that's chronic and and something it's

268
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,780
called being able to manage your pants

269
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,309
and that's what cannabis does for me

270
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,990
every day and you guys see it all the

271
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:27,349
time it's amazing dude

272
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:31,100
you've trashed the [ __ ] out of this bowl

273
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,840
John and I said I said it was dirty so

274
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:38,120
what happened is I needed to do a DAB

275
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:40,129
no DC cleaner no nothing so it got a

276
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,200
little dirty but I see I didn't I didn't

277
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:43,970
chose it Susan pretty good it's there's

278
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,570
some Chas but it's in the weirdest place

279
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,399
it's at the top of the bowl but it's

280
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,100
good we're a huge town we're gonna get

281
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,799
it all along and then worry about your

282
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,899
chairs even opening up the container of

283
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,879
hash mode these are the terpenes and and

284
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,529
our eyes letting up she's looking at me

285
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm like that's what took my pain away

286
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,620
when you showed up in the hospital it's

287
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,509
true they took hope I can't believe I

288
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,500
was three years ago three years ago and

289
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,350
I want like that like oh that's what

290
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,789
held me in her eyes lit up they really

291
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,970
made her daughter look at me she goes I

292
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:15,379
can see that I'm go this is what's so

293
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,690
important when it comes to pain

294
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:18,939
management and fighting disease and

295
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,720
conditions

296
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:26,340

00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:33,399
for you

299
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:41,500
how is it only 23 degrees Fahrenheit it

300
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:44,230
is active if we put this about you know

301
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:49,509
it's more like a tea fern I don't

302
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,620
actually have a cow that's Kate we got

303
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:55,200
that class cool right here you don't

304
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,200
have a carb cap okay well here you go

305
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,908
[Applause]

306
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:06,610
yeah we can move it around a little

307
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,940
better how about for the low temp for

308
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,940
the win

309
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,159
there you go

310
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:21,269
we can hit you got put a little bit more

311
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,269
[Music]

312
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:32,708
I don't understand why it's reading the

313
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:38,259
temperature so incorrectly it shouldn't

314
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:40,949
be reading it at 24 degrees Celsius 92.9

315
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,950
Fahrenheit

316
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:50,720
91 degrees Fahrenheit okay clean it

317
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,790
how was that you know how I was just

318
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,639
talking about pain control and how the

319
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:57,259
flavors up and the flavonoids in the did

320
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,789
you can without post that they just

321
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:00,528
recently found out that they have found

322
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:03,079
out that the flavonoids in cannabis

323
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:04,789
certain flavonoids a and B or I can't

324
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,009
think of an April is known about that

326
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,458

327
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,620
they've now put it on paper it's 800

328
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:15,559
times more stronger than an aspirin

329
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,440
like a whole [ __ ] painkiller coming

330
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,028
on the market Oh natural I know we get

331
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,130
very little from cannabis but I

332
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:23,789
guarantee with the massive amounts of

333
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,799
cannabis

334
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:27,549

495

that's the waterfront beside this is

507
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,579

don't know

512
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,529
all in all kind of a good day I'd say

513
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,349
this was kind of like a little pup

514
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:33,240
Wednesday we had a couple of pups we we

515
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:35,309

516
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,039
out we helped change we gave a whole

517
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:39,569
different life to look at well that's

518
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,909
what cannabis does you know like if here

519
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:43,679
if you if you know the information that

520
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,500
you have access then it's kind of like

521
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,720

help so many people yes and that's the

525
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,669
best thing about it is once you it's

526
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,019
like once you show someone what's going

527
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,550

528
