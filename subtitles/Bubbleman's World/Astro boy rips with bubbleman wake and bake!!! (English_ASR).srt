hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:07,798
just uh figured I would rip up a little

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:10,519
dab of some fresh frozen Astro Boy from

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,440
TGA with you guys today I'm gearing up

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,679
for a Jamaica trip here so I got my

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,039
colors on we're going to be heading down

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,839
there with Tony from River Rock and

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,118
potentially Scott from rare dankness and

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,399
some other cool folks and we're going to

10
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,439
do a little bit of filming there towards

11
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:28,959
the end of April but for now I figured

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,740
we would do a little dabbing Mothership

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:47,359
denail

14
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:49,439
