76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,480
April Wilcox Ben

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,120
Warden yeah this is a good swing so I

78
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,280
ordered tpin from Blue River extracts it

79
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,360
says it's from Colorado did I order from

80
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,919
the right place uh not if you order yeah

81
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,319
you probably ordered from America I'm

82
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,000
the Canadian version but they won't send

83
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,318
to you so if you ordered from them in

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,719
America you'll get them from them in

85
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,719
America if you tried to order from them

86
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,959
in Canada they would point you over to

87
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:34,359
to me so you probably ordered from the

88
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,560
right place all right here we go

89
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,080

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,519
um I almost have to show it to you just

96
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
to see the color of it look at the the

97
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:22,280
dab mat it's the same color as the

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,280
ofc golden heads kind of got lost in

99
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:37,159
there let's clean it up shall we

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:40,000
all right so a quick Q-tip

101
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,199
cleaning all right and then the next

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,279
Q-tip oh I blew that out my nose I'm

103
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,879
probably going to sneeze a few times I'm

104
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,758
going to do this new cleaning solution

105
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,759
that just cleans these bangers so

106
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,839
good I love it cuz it steams it steams

107
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,758
it right out and it kind of lifts any

108
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,079
little bit of material that's still left

109
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
in the Banger

110
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,439
so been pretty much digging that there's

111
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,959
an anxiety that goes along with smoking

112
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,639
on these motherships with these

113
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,918
beautiful swings and whatnot because if

114
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
you get it dirty it becomes a real

115
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,000
challenge to clean and if you get it

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,280
dirty to a level where you can't clean

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
well it's just not quite the same

118
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,399
anymore and it's a bummer Q-tips for the

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,720
win as well as as always The Dark

120
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,359
Crystal glass

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199

torch time of about 25 seconds for those

205

kangi but it's very citrusy it's got

208
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,399
this real nice light kind

209
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,759

the Dabber so I can't really give you an

211
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:05,480
an accurate description just there but

212
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,920
if I open the vial and smell

213
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,879
it yeah it's Unique there's all sorts of

214
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,599
different things going on in there that

215
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,958
I can't even really describe just yet

216
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,720
but let me have a big dab of it and then

217
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:19,078
I'll do some smelling after the dab and

218
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,639
we'll see what we can find 55 seconds on

219
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,599
the cool down uh this is a megapot so

220
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,399
it's a very big quartz that's why I do a

221
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,040
55 second cool

222
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,399
down and I hope you guys are ready

223
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:33,000
because you got about 40 seconds

224
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,240
left yeah Ron exactly that's what I'm

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,958
saying it's good to have a few tips and

226
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,278
I of course got my tips from Phil uh the

227
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:42,518
one of the people who popularized and

228
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,759
created this particular unit so it's

229
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,039
always good to get your advice from the

230
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,319
person the most connected to it I

231
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,599

253
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,399
something but I smoked the resin off of

254
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,799
the flow so don't get me wrong I love

255
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,320
the flour for all sorts of different

256
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,319
things I

257
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,320
just I prefer to smoke the medicine in a

258
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,519
pure form is

259
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,720

stability in it uh no fog whatsoever it

284
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,519
hasn't buttered out in any way shape or

285
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:26,198
form as of yet but that could change in

286
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,879
the future for sure right now it's just

287

will literally do things just like that

328
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,799
just like that sure I'll go down to the

329
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,039
US for the for an afternoon jeez I might

330
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:29,319
miss this 420 this snail is heating up

331
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,799
slow I got about 20 seconds left I think

332
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,560
I'll get some of it in it'll just be a

333
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,838
nice low temp

334
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:40,919
hit all right who's hitting it with me

335
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:45,120
we ready Rebecca C casses

336
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,120
reacted Give Love here we

337
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,679
go

338
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,079
that was like the super lowest temp

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,078
Barb dry sift rip

340
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,159
ever smells like fuzzy peaches those

341
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,600
candies fuzzy peaches that's what it

342
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,600
tastes like too good

343
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,120
morning I don't think I have

344
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,799
kery my God that was like the lightest

345
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,480
craziest like that

346
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:43,000
just that was insane that was like 400°

347
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,800
my 420 rip super tasty but I didn't even

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,958
barely get a rip compared to the last

349
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:51,599
two rips that uh that were quite

350
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,359
well uh eventually originally probably

351
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,480
from the great Gardener but no this was

352
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,000
grown and sifted by some other people in

353
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,600
Vancouver this is uh this is it right

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
here

355
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,318
see

356
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,919
that little little dry sift piece this

357
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:09,198
was done by Van City

358
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:11,879
extracts can check them out on Instagram

359
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,318
Van City extracts uh doing some great

360
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,958
things they got their [ __ ] together they

361
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,318
know how to dry sift they're following

362
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,278
the the static Tech and they do I think

363
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:22,679
they do some wet wash as well and some

364
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,919
rosin so yeah couple of the guys in town

365
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,599
that are doing it proper there are a few

366
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:28,599
people out there that aren't on the oil

367
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,120
bandwagon and are you know really

368
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,199
focusing their attentions on producing

369
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,318
full melt resins which I think it's a

370
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,120
good idea you know it's kind of like I

371
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:42,198
tell people all the time the full melt

372
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,360
resin is to the hash maker as the hand

373
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:46,719
shooting is to the photographer so um

374
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,480
you know Andrew was mentioning the other

375
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,199
day on hash church that Todd was telling

376
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
him about the rail systems that you can

377
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:56,318
get that can move your camera like a

378
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:58,198
mill millimeter at a time perfectly take

379
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,198
get it into perfect Focus every time

380
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,439
which is is don't get me wrong

381
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,958
incredible but you don't want to learn

382
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,640
how to take pictures like that you'd

383
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,438
want to really learn how to hold your

384
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,160
breath and your camera and take these

385
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,120
great shots and I feel the same way with

386
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,480
um with solventless resin with

387
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:17,279
mechanical screen separations either wet

388
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,439
washed or dry even with rosin to that

389
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,838
level to be able to learn how to do

390
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,839
these solventless methods produces this

391
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:26,558
mentality in your mind like okay I'm

392
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,678
getting away from the solvent so

393
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,639
throughout that whole process you're

394
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,240
probably going to avoid solvents like

395
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,600
even if it comes to oh we need to clean

396
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,759
these screens well let's come up with

397
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:39,599
some methods like what be what's the

398
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,720
best way we could clean our screen so

399
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,000
pretty cool welcome James buzel just

400
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,000
something that I saw as a a little uh a

401
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,599
little sort of connection there as to

402
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,759
you know the the differences between

403
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,439
when I tell photographers look for macro

404
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,200
especially learn how to shoot with your

405
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,000
hands like take the picture before you

406
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,919
get the tripod and the button and the

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,279
rail system you know to the point where

408
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,080
it's a robot taking your uh picture for

409
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,639
you and you're programming it that's

410
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:07,879
awesome but do that later once you've

411
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,360
learned the old school method and I say

412
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,520
the same thing with hashes and stuff

413
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,000
learn these simple uh solventless

414
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,200
methods and you can go on to play with

415
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,720
some intense oil extractions and you can

416
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,880
do some monomolecular you know uh

417
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,759
molecular short path distillation or you

418
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,600
can do Roto vaing or you can do whatever

419
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,919
you can even do thca and cbda

420
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,918
crystallization so there's lots of way

421
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,720
you can just keep take taking this plant

422
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,480
as far as you want to take it but uh

423
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,120
it's interesting it's kind of like the

424
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,960
same way I say to people you know if

425
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,439
only everyone drove a motorcycle for the

426
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,679
first year of having a license they

427
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,880
would learn how vulnerable they are and

428
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,840
how scary it is to be outside of cars

429
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,440
without a car that once they got their

430
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,759
license and they were able to drive a

431
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,360
real car I think that that would have a

432
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,440
profound effect on people and you'd

433
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:00,359
maybe see less pedestrians get hit just

434
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,360
a different way to to go about learning

435
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,558
things I

436
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,000
guess yeah there you go that's what

437
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,119
makes a true OG good evening bubbl man

438
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,440
good evening to you Tom aderman senior I

439
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:16,479
hope you're having a wonderful

440
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,159
evening in on this boxing day that we're

441
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,720
having quite lovely we woke up to a

442
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,600
snowstorm snowing big snowflakes just

443
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,000
all the kids playing on the driveways in

444
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,879
the mountain it was very good I also

445
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,279
thought hash Church Santa was awesome I

446
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,159
put it on on Facebook and I posted it on

447
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,960
um Instagram as well just the little

448
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:39,559
clip of Santa coming and having a dab

449
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,480
and d420 K going [ __ ] I think Santa

450
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:45,038
needs a TP dip it was just pretty

451
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,640
awesome it's going very well Cooper and

452
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,558
the powpow is extremely deep I'm putting

453
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,400
my sled on my truck tomorrow and I'm

454
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,279
going to be getting up there in the near

455
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,720
future so obviously if I can I will do

456
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,879
some live videos while I'm up there and

457
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,839
if not I will make sure I bring my video

458
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,320
camera and uh everything else that I

459
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,439
bring and make a nice uh make a nice

460
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,038
video for you guys to share if you guys

461
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,000
haven't seen my snowmobile videos on um

462
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:15,679
oh welcome Selena uh on uh YouTube you

463
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,519
should definitely check out bubbleman

464
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,440
snowmobile Brandy Wine and Bubble Man

465
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,200
snowmobile I can't remember what it's

466
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,919
called but there's like four or five of

467
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,319
them where there's some pretty epic

468
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,880
snowmobiling they've got very low views

469
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:32,119
I don't think people know the videos are

470
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,960
up but uh I I uploaded them like a year

471
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:35,839
or two ago and they're definitely worth

472
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,000
checking

473
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:42,678
out yeah yeah thanks Tavy Tavi Gonzalez

474
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,558
respect to your pops I get that

475
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,480
reference with motorcycles yeah I don't

476
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,359
know if I have usually my pops is Right

477
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,759
nearby me here it's weird that he's not

478
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,158
I must have put him away somehow or I

479
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,759
put him over there somewhere I always

480
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,080
have a picture of my dad nearby of

481

course I lost my father to a motorcycle

482
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,240
accident about 11 years

be oh nice Spencer I'm glad you've seen

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
those snowboard uh snowmobile videos

492
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:25,320
because uh a couple of them are pretty

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,519
epic like it's sort of some of the most

494
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,240
I always wanted to make like footage and

495
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,519
I've done it with my Drone footage that

496
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,200
was just as nice a footage as that you

497
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,079
could you know like go on YouTube and

498
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,400
look up epic footage I find all sorts of

499
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,079
amazing footage but some of like that

500
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,840

00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,480
mountain on my snowmobile and there's no

504
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,798
tracks at all that's like as beautiful

505
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,839
of snowmobile footage as you can find

506
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,158

507
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:57,038
anything that's out there right now

508
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,600

542
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,159

horrific like I can't even really talk

547
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,799

550
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:43,079
vibrations towards you and your son uh

551
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:45,119
he's a

552
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,798
trooper uh to be going through what he's

553
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,678
going through right now with his jaw and

554
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,960
his teeth and it's just uh I'm just a on

555
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,519
the side I'm not super close with Chris

556
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,519
we've hung out on a few occasions I've

557
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,158
met him and uh I we're definitely sort

558
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,960
of Kindred Brothers in a sense but I

559
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,880
don't engage with him a ton on social

560
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,519
media but uh I have been secretly

561
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,320
sending my most positive um of thoughts

562
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,639
to him because

563
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,759
that's that's some serious [ __ ] that

564
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,960
he's going through right now really feel

565
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:16,158
felt bad for

566
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,919
him but you know whatever doesn't kill

567
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,960
us really does make us stronger in that

568
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,600
sense it's incredible the things that

569
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,519
humans can go through and pass through

570
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:29,240
the other side make it right through the

571
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:31,278
whole experience it's pretty wild

572
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,519
anyway guys I think I'm going to head on

573
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:37,038
over I hear my son um crying for dadada

574
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,879
on the other side of the door so I

575
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,440
should go see what he's up to maybe go

576
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,840
play Spider-Man or some other awesome

577
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,880
thing with him he's two and a half so

578
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,079
