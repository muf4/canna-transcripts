at ten having them but like myself when

74
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm having them like I feel for Etienne

75
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,600
when you just want to be heard and you

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,339
cannot be heard I'm sure he'll figure it

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,139
out

78
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:36,619

remember trying to buy a good a good

85
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:56,449
video webcam for a computer is not as

86
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,399
easy as it would I thought there would

87
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:00,050
be way better versions of them and

88
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,969
they're just kind of they kind of tap

89
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:07,610
out at around a hundred and a bit and

90
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,440
just not that great all right well

91
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,870
what's in the world of cannabis this

92
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,209
week what have we been hanging in the

93
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,370
world of cannabis this week hey so what

94
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:18,649
was that with discussion about hash

95
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,259
versus oil where did that come from

96
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:23,929
was that know what that was really I saw

97
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:26,149
Addison had made a post yeah you know

98
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,949
I'm sick of arguing with hash makers and

99
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:29,719
I just the minute I saw it I was like

100
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:32,329
he's not arguing with hash makers he's

101
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,550
arguing with oil makers and I guess

102
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:36,740
maybe it's semantics maybe it's just me

103
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,389
because most people weren't in agreement

104
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,610
at all but I also think most people who

105
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:43,728
are oil smokers want their oil to be

106
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,620
hash but hash smokers never call their

107
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:47,139
hash oil

108
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,728
so it's this very strange thing now for

109
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,250
me I have nothing against oil we're

110
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:54,370
selling turb oil in the bubble man pen

111
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,899
it's literally designed for oil you know

112
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,610
you have to make oil out of the hash

113
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:01,418
before you can get it in there type of

114
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:05,110
thing but not only that but you're

115
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:07,439
taking the dry sift and making rosin out

116
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,780
of it which is practically bucket oil

117
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,910
well it is oil to me I mean oil to me is

118
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:18,969
just dissolved heads that have been

119
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:20,860
extracted to me and I've always just you

120
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,199
know from the book hashish is from I've

121
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,879
always considered it's my sister she's

122
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,669
not gonna stop shell foaming like 25

123
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,560
more times it'll be fine I've always

124
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:32,288
thought that oil and hash are different

125
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,209
thus the wording I guess these people

126
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:36,069
have decided that oil and hash are not

127
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,810
different and that's cool we can

128
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,509
disagree it's not really the end of the

129
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,180
world by any means but in my opinion and

130
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,310
that's maybe all it is there's a reason

131
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,319
why we call oil oil and why we call

132
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,360
hashish hashish and they are different

133
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,668
and that's just my opinion maybe it's

134
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,470
not a fact for everyone but I couldn't

135
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:57,538
believe the conversation mark I was just

136
00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:00,639
shaking my head completely I mean yeah

137
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:03,310
yeah I think that's what it became a

138
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,848
personal attack but it's always kind of

139
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:10,478
like I think yeah it's semantics in a

140
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:12,788
way but I remember growing up that there

141
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,918
were there was hash and then there was a

142
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:16,750
hash oil so there were two different

143
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:20,379
there were two different categories and

144
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,180
but there was also eat oil right right

145
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,569
but it didn't matter that it came from

146
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:28,150
the same you know plant or that you know

147
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:31,000
basically if it's the oil you know from

148
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:34,029
the secretory gland itself and you're

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,160
somehow milking the oil out in an

150
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:39,009
extraction process or whatever process

151
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,460
you have a way of basically making a

152
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,649
liquid extract which I guess is oil so

153
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,899
to me oil or as a chemist you would

154
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:49,929
think that oil has got to be a liquid

155
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:53,049
right like what was that one comet if it

156
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,728
doesn't bounce it's not

157
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,530
that was this guy Sam Wayne Smith he's

158
00:07:54,728 --> 00:08:00,579
like if he doesn't bounce in 72 degrees

159
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:02,709
but they completely counter contradicted

160
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,418
himself and oppose prior to that well he

161
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:06,459
also said something about extracting

162
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:10,029
cellulose and we all know that these

163
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:12,279
these cells the the secretory cells and

164
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:16,209
the dis cells from the great work of

165
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,888
palma berg is all lipid based those are

166
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:22,598
lipid structures and those are not

167
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:24,848
cellulosic structures at all and so to

168
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,128
bring cellulose into the game is just I

169
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:29,649
don't understand that but yeah the whole

170
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,180
bouncing thing I mean yeah it depends up

171
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:33,658
what temperature because you could make

172
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,860
oil bounce at a really low temperature

173
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:38,019
for me it wasn't about bouncing it's

174
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,709
super simple if you have dissolved the

175
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:44,229
heads and they are now liquefied it's

176
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:46,958
right and if they are micro encapsulated

177
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,810
resin glands resin heads this is hashish

178
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:53,109
so I mean as a chemist do you consider

179
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:55,179
hash and yeah to be the center no no III

180
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,399
understand your distinction which is

181
00:08:55,179 --> 00:09:00,189
sort of like one is mechanically removed

182
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,589
in place micro encapsulated and the

183
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,079
other is just completely dissolved and

184
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:07,630
scrambled into this mixture of c1

185
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:11,049
putting one above the other I think when

186
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:13,208
people say hash is not oil it's because

187
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:16,359
they it's funny I see the oil community

188
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:18,399
want oil to be hashed so badly they're

189
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,459
making it so they're just saying it's

190
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,610
all it's hash and I'm saying hash has

191
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:28,059
always been something you know you can

192
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,649
yeah what's your opinion on this because

193
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,239
let's be honest I guess in the end it's

194
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,220
all really just opinions

195
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,250
Wow did it ever turn into a total

196
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:42,129
personal attack on me because I said in

197
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:46,600
my opinion hash is not I agree with you

198
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:49,720
Marcus except for rosin is kind of I

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,990
mean is it really an oil or because not

200
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,959
all rosin is totally some rosin is not

201
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:59,409
oily so right some is buttery etc uh I

202
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:01,299
can I call it hash oil I mean because

203
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:04,000
we're just looking for a designation for

204
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:06,039
where the concentrate therein lies the

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,190
closest we can come to his hash we

206
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,230
haven't separated it

207
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,780
into his own separate category of

208
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,850
extraction or extraction methodology as

209
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:17,149
much as we're just kind of all lumped

210
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,670
everything into what the concentrate is

211
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:23,629
so we we refer to him as concentrates I

212
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:25,039
mean in all reality but I mean first

213
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:27,200
things we came up with when we can't

214
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,699
when it came out was what do we call

215
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,440
this stuff because it looked really

216
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,110
weird so we started call it earwax

217
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,620
because that's the closest it looked to

218
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,360
it color and consistency etc so it's

219
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,179
more of nomenclature that's come across

220
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,300
the board then anybody sit there sitting

221
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:46,579
there dictating this is you know hash

222
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:49,429
this isn't hash and I agree with you I

223
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,350
hear you in principle but I still refer

224
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:55,819
to it as hash oil because of back in the

225
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,740
90s when I originally started to see it

226
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,900
through through extraction methods there

227
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:05,990
was this one cat here in the Bay Area he

228
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:08,149
used to wear a Cat in the Hat hat all

229
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,149
the time and he was an old cat and he

230
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,220
came around with hash oil originally

231
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,709
that I had seen in very small vials and

232
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,570
back then it was like a thousand dollars

233
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,780
or something vile he was talking about

234
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,340
and I tried it once and it knocked me on

235
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,980
my ass it was the highest I'd ever

236
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:28,730
gotten and it was I want to say it was

237
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,980
93 93 94 it was dark

238
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,050
but it was closer to golden than it was

239
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,680
a black oil and that's the first time he

240
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:38,329
had ever seen a kind of a golden oil but

241
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,799
this guy would only show up at rallies

242
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:45,920
and he was very kind of much a dick and

243
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:48,349
exclusionary he passed away I do believe

244
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,509
in the 90s as well and I didn't see

245
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,519
anything close to that until we started

246
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:55,069
to see what we called honey bud and

247
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:58,850
that's because early on there was no way

248
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:01,400
for us to deal or nobody was really sure

249
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,339
how to handle this wax substance so they

250
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:07,549
basically liquefied it and sprayed it on

251
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:10,010
to lower to mid grade buds so the buds

252
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:13,250
were saturated and so that way we could

253
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:15,409
put it into a bong and smoke it because

254
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,480
again you have to understand kids there

255
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:19,399
was none of this dabbing technology this

256
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,050
all kind of really creeped out in the

257
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,329
2009

258
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:26,159
and right so it was hot knifing or in

259
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,660
our case we would use the old coals

260
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,459
where you'd have to wait with the

261
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,379
Gunpowder in the coal and you'd have to

262
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,200
wait for all the Gunpowder to burn off

263
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:37,200
first and then scrape away right the

264
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,390
smelly room take we would take a dot of

265
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,070
it and put it on aluminum foil then hold

266
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:49,350
a lighter underneath the aluminum foil

267
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:50,940
and chase the dragon these differences

268
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,590
one of the things I said in that thread

269
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,780
was that you know I said I grew up in

270
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,780
the 70s in the 80s and we had weed oil

271
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,439
and we had hash oil and hash oil was

272
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:04,289
simply hash oil that was made from hash

273
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,880
weed oil was boiled it was made from

274
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,259
herb and then some guy came in and he

275
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,090
laughed at me and he said oh so you're

276
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,069
gonna say that you know it's different

277
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,320
from this from that I'm like well it was

278
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,150
I it just was it was back then it was

279
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,750
different like hash oil was much thicker

280
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:20,909
and stronger and heavier then the same

281
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,129
oil made from herb this is well not to

282
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:25,289
mention it was Messier stickier and you

283
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,659
didn't have any tools or any way to

284
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:28,919
figure out there's no way if you had

285
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,679
both of them there was no way you

286
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:34,759
couldn't see the strong differences so

287
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,739
for me you know I also would say that

288
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,629
making why I think hash and oil are so

289
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,879
different is because extracting with a

290
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:44,039
polar or a non-polar solvent is

291
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,689
extracting different things than when

292
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,579
extracting with mechanical screen

293
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,740
separation you're not extracting the

294
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,580
same things exactly yes

295
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,259
by nature different and may get attacked

296
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,790
by a lot of people that think they know

297
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:59,100
what they're [ __ ] talking about in

298
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:01,319
that thread I wish I could invite them

299
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,690
all in to sort of speak their piece

300
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,670
because well it's a Val it's a valid

301
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,310
discussion because it's one that needs

302
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:10,289
an Amber casein from where we are

303
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:11,909
because existed you know common

304
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:14,429
knowledge is a type of hash oil we

305
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:16,949
listed under concentrates so for me I

306
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:18,959
think it is a concentrate yeah we think

307
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,379
that's a property evident clay Chur more

308
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:27,150
than just hash sort of qualifying like

309
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:30,000
what a material is it's more hash to me

310
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:32,519
anyway says more about how it's made

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,879
right it's more about the process by

312
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,639
which it's made and not in this is

313
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:39,429
so the end product you'd say the rep

314
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,340
what represents the end product how it's

315
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:45,099
made right right oh yeah because you

316
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,769
can't you can't reincorporate after

317
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,899
you've dissolved stuff right well and

318
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:51,460
you've got its difference between co2 as

319
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:54,789
well as what you're extracting from pH

320
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:58,030
oh you know we're isolating particular

321
00:14:54,789 --> 00:15:00,879
particular gland heads by micron size

322
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:04,389
and oil is mouth dissolving every single

323
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,710
gland head bulbous but you can I can see

324
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:07,389
why the connotation or the understanding

325
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,340
is that way because it's still a form of

326
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,470
to them they're only a nomenclature that

327
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,600
they know is hash or a type of hash

328
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:17,529
because that is a cannabis resin

329
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,950
concentrate you know so I understand the

330
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,850
nomenclature I just don't think we have

331
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,680
you know you know what you need to do

332
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,450
then you know we need to put out white

333
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,699
papers you know a proper discussion

334
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,080
breakdown and put a circle eight

335
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,540
something like that and discuss it

336
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,850
because it's a it's a valid point of

337
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:37,029
breakdown of nomenclature which I do

338
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:40,000
believe needs to be you know dealt with

339
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,949
a certain level so that you know you can

340
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,559
deal with you know the water extraction

341
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,230
versus you know butane extraction versus

342
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,799
you know rosin because rosin is a

343
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:57,220
different you know beast altogether then

344
00:15:49,799 --> 00:16:00,399
either BHO or pho or you know co2 itself

345
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,170
so each extraction I don't know does it

346
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,029
then justify its own name nomenclature I

347
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:10,839
think at a certain resolve this

348
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:12,939
discussion is bringing that division up

349
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,129
so that we can have an understanding

350
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,630
because the consumer doesn't have an

351
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:19,419
understanding as much as what they have

352
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:20,889
access to or read or hear about again

353
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,079
when I first I went back to West

354
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:24,639
Virginia in 2013 friends would tell me

355
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,009
have you heard about this stuff called

356
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,870
earwax it's everywhere now and I went

357
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:30,879
down to the local bomb shop there and

358
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,389
they've got full rigs and stuff going on

359
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:38,200
so the how its spread was pretty quick

360
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:40,419
but the the hash itself spread faster

361
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,990
than the understanding of the process or

362
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:46,209
a breakdown of what the concentrate is

363
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,320
what do you think about that Sam do you

364
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,540
think there's

365
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,530
the individual named classifications per

366
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:57,730
process in the near future I will be

367
00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:02,379
releasing my new patented parties which

368
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:07,299
have resin heads the size of grapes so

369
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:09,069
you just squeeze it and people won't be

370
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,078
doing extractions anymore there won't be

371
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:14,500
any need though just be picking grapes

372
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:19,539
off and having fun can we make sure

373
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:23,588
those grapes are seedless god I hope so

374
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:25,629
that'd be horrible I just don't think

375
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:27,789
it's really a big deal that they're

376
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:31,390
different I just think that it's funny

377
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:34,119
that oil seems to the oil community

378
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:37,030
wants oil to be hashish so desperately

379
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,219
and it's just from from where I just

380
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:40,750
don't see it as being a sheet they want

381
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,120
to be included I get why they want to be

382
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,549
included it's just they could they can

383
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,439
separate themselves properly by actually

384
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,649
saying you know we are different we're

385
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,840
this and then back what that is but

386
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:56,759
they're confused to a certain resolve

387
00:17:52,839 --> 00:18:00,699
because happy with being stronger than

388
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:04,180
almost all commercially produced in

389
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,850
imported a sheesh so the extracts can

390
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:12,310
easily you know beat them in the dust

391
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:14,289
with both terpene and that's why my

392
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:17,079
medicine is predominantly that nowadays

393
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:19,210
because of that you know it works for me

394
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,369
it doesn't work for everybody but i

395
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:25,269
still call it hash you know because

396
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:26,979
that's as close as people can understand

397
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,930
it marcus i'm not necessarily trying to

398
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,329
say or undermine the discussion it's

399
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,880
just people for the most part less than

400
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:36,220
1% of us are aware of this you know as

401
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,010
it is we know we're kind of at that that

402
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,259
spearhead again and we could affect

403
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:44,319
change that ripples through if we you

404
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:46,379
know we take the discussion seriously so

405
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,210
that they can realize you know I am a

406
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,790
particular process that is that stands

407
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,259
out and so therefore we should move this

408
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:55,809
but I understand why they're lumping

409
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:58,599
themselves into hash because that's as

410
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,609
close to a denomination as they can get

411
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:04,089
nomenclature wise

412
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:06,819
I believe in the consumer knowing what

413
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:09,849
it especially anything to do with health

414
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:12,579
and safety if there's any compromise

415
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:15,819
whatsoever for any reason then the

416
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:17,500
consumer should be aware of it but well

417
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:22,899
here's what I'm I'm having a discussion

418
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:27,400
Sam what Sam I we're having a discussion

419
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:32,679
currently if it is a worthy discussion

420
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:35,590
to gather the fertilizer grown of that

421
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:41,410
particular flower listed along with the

422
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:44,109
other information such as potency grower

423
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:47,679
might be fairly important if you're a

424
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:51,759
chemical grower then I'm not sure how

425
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,910
important it is if it's a chemical NPK

426
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,529
then that's what it is well some

427
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,940
patients were asking you know well what

428
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,889
was this originally grown with and it

429
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,539
started me to think that well this was

430
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,110
an older consumer I would say she was

431
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:06,940
probably in her mid to late 50s and she

432
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:08,709
asked a very legitimate question

433
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,259
well what fertilizer was grown with this

434
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,880
and it as I was behind the counter doing

435
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:14,109
my own transaction on the side I started

436
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,490
to think about you know that's a very

437
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:20,048
valid point of notification because it's

438
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,419
not something that we've ever considered

439
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:25,720
or had much less the base of testing and

440
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:27,429
technology but is the consumer as you're

441
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,230
watching are you the consumer are you

442
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:30,759
concerned about the fertilizer that's

443
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,130
grown II you just care about the end

444
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:37,769
product you know care how it's you know

445
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,770
what it's produced with versus what it

446
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:44,980
there's a growing number of consumers

447
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:48,189
that care how their cannabis or tomatoes

448
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,890
and food in general is grown that said

449
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,019
the vast majority of Americans don't

450
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:56,710
seem to give a flying [ __ ] I mean the

451
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:58,720
GMO corn and they chemically fertilized

452
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,910
corn and that's where the universe works

453
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,679
the first time it's the first time in

454
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,750
the history of the world that poor

455
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:10,450
people are obese check that out

456
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,660
that's a Creole America America believes

457
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:17,410
in that

458
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:23,830
food stamps and TV and high fructose

459
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:26,830
corn syrup apparently that's what you

460
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:28,809
can buy with them mm-hmm yeah I've

461
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:31,449
always considered it well like when I

462
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,159
smoked hash and I when I smoked oil and

463
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,529
I only smoked rosin that's the only oil

464
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:44,529
I smoked but I can tell you that they're

465
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:46,599
different 100 that's okay they are not

466
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:48,129
the same in my opinion from even the

467
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,439
highs that they give from the same

468
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,560
material hitting an oil from something

469
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,500
and even hitting different micron gland

470
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:59,980
heads from the same cultivar can produce

471
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,349
you know slightly different you can get

472
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,259
a different high from the resin from the

473
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:07,000
vho from just the resin heads themselves

474
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:09,129
I think that's why we make it

475
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,160
differently okay and why do people have

476
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:14,440
preferences so and I think also one of

477
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,140
the major problems I had with Addison's

478
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:21,430
comment was that he's a founder in steep

479
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:24,550
hill a lab a lab for cannabis and I just

480
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,410
felt like shouldn't we use like the like

481
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,089
the proper sort of like when we're

482
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,970
speaking about these things like you are

483
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:32,919
a person that's going to be informing

484
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,309
the majority of people you're testing

485
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,990
cannabis you're testing hash well you

486
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:39,700
know we just need scientists and peer

487
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,710
review I mean it's the same way that

488
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,779
we're still having difficult with you

489
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,660
know Rob Clark pointed out a few years

490
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,029
ago now that in to consider or not what

491
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,190
we thought they were so now we have to

492
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:53,109
change or start their spark this

493
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,190
discussion you know that actually

494
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:58,119
changes you know this constant the

495
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,309
definition of these concentrate

496
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,049
nomenclatures you know because they are

497
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,419
different you know and I love Addison

498
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,069
I've worked with Addison originally way

499
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:10,590
back in the day in dealing with testing

500
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:13,629
so but at the same time there's no

501
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:16,149
different scientific classification or

502
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,580
that has been presented to say otherwise

503
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:21,940
so I can see why he would say currently

504
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:23,799
it is is but I understand what you're

505
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,090
saying and I think it's a valid

506
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,990
discussion because

507
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:31,720
as concentrates are a whole other level

508
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,160
of discussion than they were 10 15 years

509
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,019
ago

510
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,880
not only that thanks to you by having

511
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:39,910
your bubble bags and things like that I

512
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,390
have 8 to 10 varieties of bubble hash as

513
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:46,810
well as 8 to 10 varieties of rosin and

514
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,640
etc so I have the full spectrum you know

515
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:50,679
and so it's now it's left to the

516
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,660
consumer to the side however you know

517
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,060
you're the scientists you're the people

518
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,790
who can break down information properly

519
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:59,619
and dissin ate it in white papers so

520
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:01,629
that you can get peer review so that you

521
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:05,979
can then change the discussion as

522
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:08,920
opposed to I mean are like eventually ed

523
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,349
Chen the old lady that came in and asked

524
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,200
about what the fertilizer was that per

525
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:19,899
budget for an extract and that was for

526
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:23,200
buds but I mean actually she she's gonna

527
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,820
be doing it for extracts to do right and

528
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,319
so that's why I was thinking and I

529
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:29,169
started discussed with my you know my

530
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,359
purchasers is you know should we do this

531
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,710
how would we gather this information how

532
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,740
does it make it to where it needs to go

533
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,600
as well as you know is it valid or

534
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,700
worthy information to have is it just a

535
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,639
waste of time currently or is this

536
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,430
another way that we can set trend by you

537
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,620
know now posting the type of growth

538
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:50,289
methodologies that goes along with it

539
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:52,500
yeah one thing you can do is start

540
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:56,259
collecting the information voluntarily

541
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:59,289
from from the growers and get feedback

542
00:24:56,259 --> 00:25:02,309
from the people who buy it and see are

543
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:05,109
their preferences towards particular

544
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,240
fertilization regimes and that's that's

545
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:09,279
a you know it's gonna take time but I'm

546
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,019
good I've already started gathering that

547
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,799
information so that we could learn you

548
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:17,139
know because you know part of our work

549
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:19,720
good and it's because when the consumers

550
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:23,440
are now asking for and since I am you

551
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,610
know a pioneering dispensary first I

552
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,100
don't you know I think of new ways to

553
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:29,019
disseminate or gather information for

554
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,219
the consumer because it makes a

555
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,379
difference for me when I go to a Whole

556
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,990
Foods or any you know store do I buy

557
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,270
conventional organic I tend to go

558
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,509
organic you know if I have that option

559
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,578
or I can afford that

560
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:43,578
option that's not always the case but if

561
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:48,969
I can you know I do think about that and

562
00:25:43,578 --> 00:25:48,969
I forget for organic as long as the

563
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:58,159
organic every single time because to say

564
00:25:54,858 --> 00:26:00,108
it's not organic means that chemicals

565
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,139
were sprayed on the earth and go

566
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:05,028
affecting animals inspecting everyone

567
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:06,918
and then at the same how are we getting

568
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:09,378
away with something they're just curious

569
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:14,119
slight oh we save some money so we're

570
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:19,278
good but nothing else is so I agree with

571
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:23,088
you but I or to Utley eat for taste so

572
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:25,489
if something tastes better i as as it's

573
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:27,948
not dangerous than I would prefer it but

574
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:30,379
yeah I agree dress if it's been great

575
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:34,359
with what you're saying but I'm addicted

576
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:37,418
to taste well you're in luck because

577
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:40,009
organic food a hundred times you know I

578
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,349
always taste better so you're pretty

579
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:43,608
much good to go on that there's two

580
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:46,519
different types of taste

581
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:48,948
there's the organic delicious sustaining

582
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:51,048
life and there's the toxic chemical

583
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:53,329
Monsanto which convinces your brain it's

584
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:56,568
delicious while simultaneously poisoning

585
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:58,278
your body and those around you so this

586
00:26:56,568 --> 00:27:00,348
is what we have to deal with this is the

587
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:02,419
position we're in in every decision we

588
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:04,068
make every time we open our mouth it's

589
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:06,739
interesting to hear from the connoisseur

590
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:08,418
perspective like and then have forests

591
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:10,759
come in and you realize no you don't

592
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,639
understand like these chemicals will

593
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:16,669
absolutely affect these children these

594
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:19,128
sensitive sensitive being I didn't mean

595
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:22,759
chemicals as much as chemical

596
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:25,538
fertilizers because in a lot of

597
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:29,838
countries they will use one particular

598
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:32,388
of PK because their soils deficient in

599
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:35,989
it and without it it really super poor

600
00:27:32,388 --> 00:27:39,888
yields mmm which plant material and bio

601
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:44,088
maps can help a lot better than chemical

602
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:47,568
fertilizers listen I wait a minute I bet

603
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:50,450
a biodynamic farmer I was taught by Alan

604
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:51,799
Chadwick I understand you don't need to

605
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,830
preach to me I'm

606
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:58,339
converted I don't feel like I'm

607
00:27:54,829 --> 00:28:01,549
preaching I'm just talking its hashed

608
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:03,949
Church it is I do want to clarify is

609
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:06,619
that I've had some wonderful organic

610
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,120
fruit that tasted like [ __ ] before so it

611
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:10,489
doesn't make it everything absolutely

612
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,169
taste good I've had bad tasting stuff

613
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,509
before too but for the most part I agree

614
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,710
is that it does like like if you do

615
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:17,240
something properly and it brings out the

616
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,160
flavor noise it brings out that you know

617
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,650
everything that you want you know and I

618
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,320
prefer somebody's homegrown something

619
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,640
that's opposed to a mass-produced

620
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:29,389
absolutely agree with you in general

621
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,970
it's true I know I wouldn't mind talking

622
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,310
really quickly about how like amendments

623
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,960
and fertilizers do affect medicine and

624
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:36,859
for us to just look at it as a

625
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,350
connoisseur

626
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:42,109
you know aspect makes it really

627
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:43,879
difficult because there's a whole

628
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:45,500
growing process that goes into it and

629
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,420
all of the nutrients and inputs that

630
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:51,019
goes into it are really all part of the

631
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:53,150
factor so we get tons of people that

632
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,639
want to know how medicine has grown and

633
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,620
it's really really important to them and

634
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,590
when they find out that wow this

635
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:02,359
medicine tastes really good and it was

636
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:04,009
grown in a way that was eka logically

637
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,379
supporting nature and the environment

638
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:08,289
they're all over it they don't want to

639
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,190
have anything to do as chemicals

640
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:14,960
generally speaking most of the time and

641
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,820
we're finding that to be a really really

642
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,259
important part of the selling point for

643
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:19,759
farms because they get to tell their

644
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:22,129
story they get to show how they're

645
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,559
supporting bee populations and in the

646
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,200
end I know a lot of farmers we work at

647
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,720
the tone of farmers and they have maybe

648
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,309
worked synthetically or in chemical

649
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,799
regiments before and then turned over

650
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:35,869
towards organics or towards even plant

651
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,909
material or Korean natural farming

652
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:40,219
methods and they're getting higher

653
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:43,040
cannabinoid counts and higher terpene

654
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,549
levels through those methods so I think

655
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,170
that there's a lot of reasons why it's

656
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,940
really important about what we put into

657
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,440
the medicine and if it can create a

658
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,029
high-grade product in the end it's a

659
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,789
huge selling point because people really

660
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:56,569
are behind it so what what do you guys

661
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:58,519
think about that

662
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,779
well I think that I wanted to a welcome

663
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,440
you to the room

664
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:05,750
and also welcome wave in to the room

665
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,919
from house of Harlequin and also welcome

666
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,480
be 420k

667
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:13,159
into the room from the house of nar and

668
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,929
[ __ ] welcome forest into the room i

669
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,970
hope i hope you're all doing well I

670
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:18,890
didn't miss anyone did I know those were

671
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,900
the newbies I had DS been in the room

672
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:23,150
for like an hour and I just or a half an

673
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,220
hour and I just welcomed him now so yeah

674
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,169
I couldn't keep interrupt you guys's

675
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,089
conversation I was pretty deep stuff man

676
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:31,490
I could even fit in a ball rip in there

677
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,750
I just did one that's it we're just

678
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,429
trying to get into the conversation I

679
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,650
love one forest and wade coming to the

680
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:38,480
conversation because it really you know

681
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,460
and something that you said joschwa in

682
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,798
regards to we have to take it beyond the

683
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,169
connoisseur sort of level and I totally

684
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,900
get that yet at the same time it really

685
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:52,480
has been some of the most OCD

686
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:55,610
connoisseurs who have maintained and

687
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,069
stewarded this this plant this medicine

688
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:59,719
to a point where the people who are like

689
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:01,759
oh this is the most special thing right

690
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,409
here it's like I've been I've been it's

691
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,419
for my head it's for you know we've been

692
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:07,850
sharing it for 20 it seems that there's

693
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:10,820
a really interesting transition from

694
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:12,529
those the same way that particular plant

695
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:15,109
makes someone feel incredible through

696
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:17,658
their recreational feelings or adult use

697
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:19,668
that it translates over to some very

698
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:24,400
powerful medicine versus you know buying

699
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:28,159
some XE sweg off the street or whatnot

700
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,830
as Sam knows the biodynamic collects do

701
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,900
bring out amazing qualities in in

702
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:35,629
cannabis and food and that's why it's

703
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:39,880
still around how many years have you

704
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,880
been growing cannabis biodynamically

705
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:47,959
since I have been up here for and 19

706
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:50,090
years I mean you know biodynamic so how

707
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,860
about this you know I've been doing it

708
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:57,470
twice as long so so I I believe in it

709
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:59,979
it's the way I personally do it but I

710
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:04,038
also know that most farms are not

711
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:08,000
biodynamic or be they vegetables fruits

712
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:11,990
or cannabis and I think it would be

713
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,829
better at more were but yeah it's it's

714
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,210
hard to convince somebody

715
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:19,250
well the proof is in the puffing

716
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,590
whatever you were doing back in the day

717
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,720
Sam when I first met you whatever you

718
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:27,439
were growing I can honestly say to this

719
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,539
day that was grown biodynamic no one's

720
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,269
ever put anything it like that is really

721
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:35,569
seriously medicine that is like medicine

722
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:37,940
that frightened my soul like I've never

723
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:40,129
been high like that in my life like that

724
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,200
is that you could probably eat enough of

725
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,260
that and operate on a person like you

726
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,240
would knock them unconscious for 36

727
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:52,160
hours if you ate how did you ever get

728
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:55,609
knocked out by eating that resin Sam as

729
00:32:52,160 --> 00:33:00,410
in well what happened to me a few times

730
00:32:55,609 --> 00:33:05,689
when I made no big cookies I would make

731
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:09,800
them with a half a gram or a gram of THC

732
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:13,309
so each one would have one gram or even

733
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,349
two grams of the dry cept that was 50

734
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:18,079
percent THC by weight

735
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:20,839
so having emulsifier in those cookies to

736
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,990
break it down yeah they were putting

737
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:28,970
ghee and also to activate them they were

738
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:33,769
double boiled biggie right butter and

739
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:36,170
then powdered sugar and powdered cocoa

740
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:43,009
okay that sounds like a trip ticket to

741
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:45,920
another dimension quite strong yeah a

742
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:48,710
few people who ate a few of those also

743
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,529
when you took a bite out of them it was

744
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,200
like the strongest by deenis peppery

745
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:56,299
taste from the from the rest that you've

746
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,059
ever tasted I mean they were really

747
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:02,119
really rich of herpes because it's not

748
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:05,240
THC that has that bitter bite it's a

749
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,939
it's a terpenes isn't it strange that

750
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,039
this plant gets made illegal so long ago

751
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,440
it's got these incredible properties but

752
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:14,869
it seems that people who want to get

753
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,789
high are the people who are the stewards

754
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:18,650
for all of these years while they're

755
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:21,050
trying to eradicate it and get rid of it

756
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,660
and it's just this really I keep going

757
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,130
back to that transition of you know the

758
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,349
hashish eaters getting their teeth

759
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,809
wrenched out in the 14th century in the

760
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,269
Cairo

761
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:32,429
square-like compared to now where it's

762
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:35,159
just opening up and it's it's just so

763
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,349
much bigger than a dolt use now as as as

764
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,230
we're all seeing and learning over the

765
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:43,519
who would have ever thought twenty years

766
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:46,710
ago that you know cannabis would be

767
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,659
resetting credit for all of the things

768
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:52,170
that it's that it's now being credited

769
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:56,159
for its pretty spectacular I wanted to I

770
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:59,430
think I honestly did believe in all of

771
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,829
these medical applications even ones

772
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:04,019
that we hadn't heard of yet I expected

773
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:06,090
them to be bound with each different

774
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,250
cannabinoid with each different terpene

775
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:11,160
combination you know it's going to

776
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:15,420
modify it for other medical indications

777
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:17,670
so I expect I was more of the school of

778
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,250
like I thought it was burning out my

779
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,990
brain cells when I was like 14 15 puffs

780
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,960
and joints I just figured that's what it

781
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:26,549
was doing and as I you know learned as I

782
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,400
met people like Hillary black and

783
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:32,130
yourself and many others I realized that

784
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:38,190
wow this is this is unbelievable

785
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:41,039
just how actually helpfully people it's

786
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,230
true that in the 1800's and a lot of the

787
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,809
apothecaries and then the Victorian era

788
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,170
cannabis was a base of tons of medicine

789
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:51,239
so it's almost like we had to force

790
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:53,610
teach ourselves that it wasn't good and

791
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,309
they had to force it down our throats

792
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,200
that kills brain cells and and monkey

793
00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:00,059
brain cells and all that for us to

794
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,460
totally forget about it in math so that

795
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:05,070
we could totally rediscover it and find

796
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,440
out wow it's amazing it's a medicine and

797
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,000
it is an incredible awakening and with

798
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,579
all the labs even though some of the

799
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,500
labs are talking controversial stuff you

800
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,299
know they have helped us get to a lot of

801
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,250
really good information and it's really

802
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:26,780
exciting ya know for sure nobody would

803
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:30,420
have CBD varieties hmm there you go and

804
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:34,130
everybody loves their CBD varieties big

805
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:36,510
deal almost everybody

806
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:40,019
so forest we were having a discussion

807
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,540
right before you came on regarding a

808
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:43,820
question I don't know if you heard

809
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:47,239
in our discussion prior I had a patient

810
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:52,309
come in and she was wondering what

811
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:53,419
fertilizers were used on the product and

812
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:54,769
how they were groaning so we were

813
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,970
starting the we've started the

814
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:58,429
discussion to the point where we're

815
00:36:55,969 --> 00:37:02,119
actually gathering or doing our best to

816
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:04,609
gather from the farmers as they come in

817
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,699
is what you know what they actually grew

818
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:09,380
up with and just having the discussion

819
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:11,359
do you think it's beneficial and of

820
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,130
course I know with you it's probably a

821
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,510
no-brainer but I'd like to hear from you

822
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,599
well I mean I think it's absolutely

823
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,540
beneficial I mean knowledge is its power

824
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,829
right and if we're doing things that are

825
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:26,509
there's a lot of fertilizers that can be

826
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:28,849
relatively harmless but whatever you put

827
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,830
into the ground it's gonna be in the

828
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:32,509
plant I mean that's what's amazing about

829
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:34,250
cannabis and that's what you have to be

830
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,070
responsible about it as well it's a bio

831
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:40,070
accumulator it's going to take what's in

832
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:42,680
that soil and make it part of its itself

833
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:45,920
so a lot of times it's just a lot of

834
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:48,980
folks want it to be kind of black and

835
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,869
white good and bad right and wrong evil

836
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,309
there are fertilizers that can be really

837
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,989
beneficial and healthy for the plant

838
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:55,429
that the plant needs for a healthy soil

839
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:57,469
there's a lot of but a lot of that

840
00:37:55,429 --> 00:38:01,369
fertilizer doesn't necessarily mean

841
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:05,480
medical like Miracle Grow right or some

842
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:07,190
sort of manmade compound even you know

843
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,110
building living soil can be done without

844
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,929
a lot of toxic things so I think a

845
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:14,750
survey for growers coming in especially

846
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:16,730
as an establishment that is you know

847
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,159
working with patients is a great

848
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,170
practice to say here's what it is and

849
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:22,849
then how is the medicine made if you're

850
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,110
using certain fertilizers you have

851
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:25,569
certain practices there's a big

852
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,860
difference on if you're making a

853
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,539
medicine from the flower or just selling

854
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,579
flowers they're making extract from

855
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:33,889
flowers versus if you're making that

856
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:36,710
extract through roots and stalks and

857
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:39,049
stems and calling it whole plant so your

858
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,960
risk goes up higher there because that's

859
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,660
where the plant stores a lot of

860
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,269
compounds that could potentially be

861
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:48,589
risky you know as we learn more about

862
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:50,269
and we've talked about this here before

863
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,950
but we learn more about certain metals

864
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:55,369
or toxins that can be stored in a plant

865
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:57,230
so you know right now it's hard to be

866
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:58,999
back and white as far as what's good

867
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,920
what's stored where how is it

868
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:03,189
transferred with the exception of you

869
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,329
know systemic pesticides that we see

870
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,659
coming in even second and third

871
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:12,680
generations with plants but the reality

872
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:15,230
is I think if you as a business owner

873
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,639
are do being responsible enough to say

874
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,949
well here's the information at least

875
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,868
giving the consumer the ability to look

876
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:24,318
at it and make a decision for you

877
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:28,338
themselves then that's as much as we can

878
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:30,170
do at this point you know because we are

879
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:31,759
still learning about how much is

880
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,829
transferred where and what is how it

881
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:35,748
affects the people so a more working

882
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,798
with children who are as young as six

883
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,889
months old you know we have a

884
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:41,778
zero-tolerance policy because certain

885
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:45,440
pesticides of compounds we know we're

886
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:47,088
toxic and then others well the science

887
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,889
is still out we're looking at it so we

888
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:51,768
play on the safe side either way you

889
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:54,409
know but I think with a lot of medicine

890
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:56,209
right now a lot of people just don't

891
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:57,828
understand it what is missing is just

892
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,989
the information there for the consumer

893
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:02,289
to make the decision that is best for

894
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:06,349
them not necessarily having to have

895
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:09,440
everything on some sort of standard that

896
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:12,259
is you know the standard that I would

897
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,358
expect with with children because not

898
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:15,980
everyone needs if I were going to get a

899
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:17,869
product you know and this is where I

900
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,460
think the future of cannabis especially

901
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:22,579
when it comes to pricing and economics

902
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:25,309
is a grading type of scale you know I

903
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:27,230
know I don't mean is a full-grown adult

904
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:29,089
and I'm not treating health conditions

905
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,130
if I want to go get some flowers what

906
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:33,199
would be safe for me it's a completely

907
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,298
different grading scale than what would

908
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,889
be safe for for maybe some other people

909
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:39,528
with immunocompromised systems and

910
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:42,259
things like that so you know I'm I'm on

911
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:45,230
the on the side of just the information

912
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:47,440
should be there so that people who know

913
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,940
what they're using it for can get

914
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,159
medicine that is appropriate for them

915
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,650
right I have a question I can absolutely

916
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,278
agree with you and I'll be happy to grow

917
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,650
it for you

918
00:40:55,278 --> 00:41:01,009
outdoors where the birds might poop on

919
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:03,739
it a little tiny bit I have a question

920
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:06,528
for you Forrest have you noticed any

921
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:08,250
differences I'm sure a lot of parents

922
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:10,050
notice the differences in the Kanab

923
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:13,230
and terpene profiles and how those can

924
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:15,030
change and help and maybe not help but

925
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,460
have you ever noticed differences in how

926
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:19,920
the medicine was extracted whether it

927
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,019
was an oil whether it was made with a

928
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,349
screen separations do you notice

929
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:29,009
differences in those yeah yeah

930
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:31,409
absolutely this is why you know and I'll

931
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:34,850
tell everyone here we as a clatters

932
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:37,319
Network we use we're doing ethanol

933
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:38,610
extraction organic ethanol extraction

934
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,390
which a lot of people might shake oh

935
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:44,190
that's not the the best way to do it and

936
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:46,199
well for one we have our fortunate to

937
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,610
have a lot of lab testing so we make

938
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,919
sure you have no solvents and things

939
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,230
like that but the reason we settled on

940
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,139
that as opposed to like even co2 right

941
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:57,659
now is because of an efficacy difference

942
00:41:55,139 --> 00:42:00,179
that we've seen and you know without

943
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:01,710
going into that ethanol extraction isn't

944
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,079
just one thing a lot of people hear that

945
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,480
and they say well I do that too but you

946
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,190
know I'd like to use the example of we

947
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,380
can give everybody you can give me the

948
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,780
ingredients for a beef wellington and

949
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,670
you can give Gordon Ramsay the

950
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,140
ingredients for a beef wellington just

951
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,280
because we have the same thing the same

952
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:19,349
equipment doesn't mean we're going to

953
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,230
get the same product at the end so how

954
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,179
we spent years you know really trying to

955
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:29,490
refine our methods so that we can get a

956
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:31,649
really whole plant representation of the

957
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:35,549
oils and the flavonoids enterpreneurs in

958
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:37,559
it that I feel like I've missed and we

959
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,990
didn't see the same advocacy with some

960
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:41,639
of those other processes that are really

961
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:44,299
good at stripping out a lot of the plan

962
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:47,329
you know you get these beautiful golden

963
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:51,000
transparent Amber's but when we went to

964
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:52,889
use some of the medicines we just didn't

965
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,530
see some of the efficacy and we just

966
00:42:52,889 --> 00:43:00,239
made the determination that well with

967
00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:03,210
our limited resources and our need for

968
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,279
whatever was missing out of these two we

969
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,460
settled on this this other extraction

970
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,269
method specifically although we saw a

971
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:15,539
more pure in pretty-looking product with

972
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:18,780
some of the co2 you know closed-loop

973
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:21,869
systems the efficacy wasn't anywhere

974
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:24,600
near as good and so my logic would

975
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:27,719
me that something was taken out during

976
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,750
that process that was having medical

977
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:36,779
benefit and forest for your information

978
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:39,570
if use an ultrasonic shaker with a an

979
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:42,660
ethanol bath and you put whatever you

980
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:44,880
want extracted that for about 30 seconds

981
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:47,190
while you're shaking it the oil will

982
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,099
come out light yellow you only get about

983
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:52,349
80 percent yield you lose about 20

984
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:55,199
percent but you can then extract that

985
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:58,110
with ethanol in the way you've been

986
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:00,569
doing it but we you'll get all that is

987
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:03,630
so pretty that you won't believe them

988
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,890
yeah I mean we have oil that is and I

989
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,420
could run and grab some of those

990
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:09,119
probably wouldn't look you wouldn't be

991
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,789
able to tell over the webcam but it's um

992
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,159
it's beautiful amber it's not you know

993
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:18,599
it's not that sludgy chlorophyll filled

994
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:21,480
sort of you soak it and the higher the

995
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,579
temperature of the ethanol the darker

996
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,110
and greener it gets right right so we do

997
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,019
very short soaks and those sort of

998
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,360
things but but anyway yeah so it's a

999
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:33,960
long answer to a short question but all

1000
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:37,019
that led through seeing differences in

1001
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,670
an efficacy that I think have to do with

1002
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:40,949
what is and isn't filtered out of the

1003
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,440
plant and how you administering the

1004
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:44,460
extract is this in the sub lingual

1005
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,400
tanner

1006
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,019
yeah for the most part so well for the

1007
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,660
most part it's considered internal

1008
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,280
because sublingual you know beholding

1009
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:55,859
under the tongue and a lot of kids

1010
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,540
aren't cooperative so even though

1011
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,599
internal dosing is probably the least

1012
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:02,210
efficient and you know the liver removes

1013
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,789
a lot of it before it even becomes

1014
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:08,340
really effective in the system with with

1015
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:10,529
kids and and people who have

1016
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,690
developmental delays you know you don't

1017
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,240
always have the most understanding or

1018
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,070
cooperative patient so we give it in

1019
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:20,809
them however we can but yeah sublingual

1020
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:23,340
and internally now you know what is the

1021
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:26,090
analyzed for in terms of cannabinoid

1022
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,710
content and say that again a broken

1023
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:31,220
what is the extract analyzed for in

1024
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,659
terms of navitor content hmm

1025
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:35,699
well I mean we do a full cannabinoid

1026
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:38,309
profile and then

1027
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,608
besides microbio residual solvents you

1028
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:44,460
know those sort of things so isn't like

1029
00:45:40,608 --> 00:45:46,529
60% or 70% cannabinoids or I would say

1030
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,900
the average between we are just come out

1031
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:52,950
between like 65 and 75 yeah in that

1032
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:55,700
window the reason I was asking about the

1033
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:58,909
different types of medicine my friend

1034
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:03,358
Cheryl Rose her daughter Hayley who's

1035
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:05,069
ICI also has LGS I guess got diagnosed

1036
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,199
when she was quite young like seven or

1037
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,570
eight years old and they they found this

1038
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,949
Halley's Comet this high CBD cultivar

1039
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:13,470
that worked for her they named it after

1040
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:16,199
her Halley's Comet and she was getting

1041
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:17,489
quite relief from this and it was just

1042
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:19,348
something interesting I've never really

1043
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:21,029
talked about it much you know I I didn't

1044
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:22,650
want to sound like like I was trying to

1045
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,960
promote my company but I had given her

1046
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:27,900
bags so that she could make different

1047
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,579
medicines for me and I guess in the end

1048
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,619
she started giving her this bubble in

1049
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,470
capsules instead of the oil she was

1050
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:36,358
making and it was the first time Haley

1051
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:39,618
had ever gone I think it was a hundred

1052
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:42,389
or two hundred days without a seizure

1053
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:44,068
mistimed yeah yeah cause if you know the

1054
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:45,989
oil and stuff cut her seizures down by

1055
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:48,239
like 90% or something but it didn't

1056
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:50,219
completely eliminate them it was only

1057
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,289
until she started making bubble hash and

1058
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,929
putting all the different micron hashes

1059
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:57,869
inside the capsules that that she got

1060
00:46:54,929 --> 00:47:00,289
this incredible you know like I'm pretty

1061
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:02,670
sure it was over a hundred days which I

1062
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:04,619
don't think Haley had had it had ever

1063
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,019
gone a hundred days in her entire life

1064
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:10,039
since she was diagnosed what's their

1065
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:13,519
cannabinoid profile ratio that strain

1066
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:16,170
let me look it up real quick for you

1067
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,659
it's been amazing I only ask because it

1068
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,250
is I used to hesitate saying things like

1069
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:22,409
this but you know like everybody else

1070
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,088
the more families you work with the more

1071
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:28,279
confident you get seeing patterns and

1072
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:33,568
it's amazing to me how many more kids

1073
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:36,319
respond to a two to one between one to

1074
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:41,009
two and two to one in that range ratio

1075
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:46,250
medicine more so than the twenty to one

1076
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:47,420
I see V D this is raised one to one yeah

1077
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,449
yeah

1078
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,920
so especially the LGS and what I talk to

1079
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:54,679
parents because a lot of people come or

1080
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,930
people were treating we just CNN really

1081
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,179
helped to boost this and a lot of that

1082
00:47:56,929 --> 00:48:00,739
was not that they did anything they

1083
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:02,629
brought a lot of good attention to the

1084
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:05,539
subject but some of the negatives that

1085
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,460
came along with that was the the CBD

1086
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:09,818
felt good and safe to talk about for

1087
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,289
ideological reasons so not necessarily

1088
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:14,599
because that was what would they had

1089
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:16,699
discovered was the best medicine for

1090
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,140
these conditions you know it just felt

1091
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:20,838
safe to say well this one doesn't get

1092
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:23,659
you high so we're gonna max out this and

1093
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:27,858
give it an CBD has some benefits in that

1094
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:30,318
way but the benefits are really when you

1095
00:48:27,858 --> 00:48:34,068
start adding THC to it the benefits are

1096
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:36,650
more than doubled them then when there

1097
00:48:34,068 --> 00:48:37,759
are isolated THC or CBD and we've seen

1098
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:42,318
that with a lot of kids they'll have

1099
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:44,750
some reduction with Charlotte's Web or

1100
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:47,719
you know some of those high cv ac/dc or

1101
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:49,818
high CBD strains but when you start to

1102
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:51,588
get closer to a more balanced profile

1103
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:53,929
you start to see some of those dramatic

1104
00:48:51,588 --> 00:48:55,789
results and that's what I experienced

1105
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:58,098
that with my own son you know with

1106
00:48:55,789 --> 00:49:01,130
having he never had a single day without

1107
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:02,690
a seizure on high CBD meds but that's

1108
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,548
what we started with is that's what we

1109
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,519
had heard you know six years ago as

1110
00:49:04,548 --> 00:49:09,230
parents and almost gave up because we

1111
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,670
thought well I guess the CBD you know

1112
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,170
it's what's what they say it's good for

1113
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,838
kids and but it's not working for us so

1114
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,670
we're not lucky and you know through

1115
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,940
doing research and what's more words

1116
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:22,068
right are you using your alcohol extract

1117
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:24,710
to make distillate or using the alcohol

1118
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:28,460
extract in the in the capsule or in the

1119
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:30,289
in the formulation itself try and see if

1120
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,568
I have any here I can run again no it's

1121
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:35,659
it's like full extract eco what we call

1122
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:37,429
it will extract cannabis oil it is okay

1123
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:39,139
so not you're not when your eyes and

1124
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:41,750
distilling or anything like that's just

1125
00:49:39,139 --> 00:49:44,210
thick you know so we measure let me test

1126
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,068
that we measure it out and then yeah

1127
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:49,130
there's some way to us and that's made

1128
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:52,219
by our group right there okay turn it

1129
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,930
sit still terpene rich oh yeah you open

1130
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:57,469
that the lid on that thing and it smells

1131
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:58,068
like a fruit basket it's got this

1132
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:01,219
beautiful

1133
00:49:58,068 --> 00:50:03,380
terpenes besides the THC

1134
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:08,299
might also be contributing to the debt

1135
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:10,760
law for the CBD yeah and I'm a big I am

1136
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,200
sold you know I know there's still some

1137
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,240
debate in the scientific community about

1138
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:16,789
the entourage effect but there's no

1139
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:19,129
debate and our my experience because

1140
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:23,088
we've just seen it too many times where

1141
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:26,530
we've recreated the exact same base

1142
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:29,539
cannabinoid profile right your CBD your

1143
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:32,240
THC or CBD as much as you can and how

1144
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:34,300
that translates or you know you guys

1145
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,279
understand et cetera we've we've had

1146
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:39,410
strange shift to say been forced because

1147
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,079
we've run out but we've with lab testing

1148
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:46,578
been able to recreate those profiles and

1149
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:48,500
seemed absolutely night and day into the

1150
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:51,109
spectrum as far as efficacy with kids

1151
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,599
where at times you could actually even

1152
00:50:51,108 --> 00:50:55,848
see adverse effects where when we went

1153
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,970
back to the strain that was originally

1154
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:02,690
there same cannabinoid profile you then

1155
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:05,358
see the same positive benefits come back

1156
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:11,389
and the reason I was mentioning this was

1157
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:16,279
because a lot of these 22 one CBD to THC

1158
00:51:11,389 --> 00:51:20,179
ratios varieties have quite consistently

1159
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:25,430
different terpene flavors and aromas

1160
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:30,440
than varieties that are higher in THC

1161
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:32,989
and have been selected for terpenes yeah

1162
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,599
yeah if I've noticed that as well I mean

1163
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:38,209
you see you know I know that a lot of

1164
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,568
the our force and Charlotte's Web

1165
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,949
lineage have a lot underlining pining

1166
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:44,179
sort of smells to them when they're

1167
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:47,509
growing then you don't see with some

1168
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:50,509
other strains not as much as those the

1169
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:53,119
carry awfully black pepper sort of funk

1170
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:57,260
that you get with with other balanced

1171
00:51:53,119 --> 00:52:00,010
ratios but like I said it's it's I think

1172
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:03,200
the answer is in a combination of both

1173
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:05,690
and the answer also is whatever helps

1174
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,779
the patient yeah and that's it you know

1175
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,750
that's exactly it you know so saying

1176
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,150
that saying okay we've seen better

1177
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:15,349
results with the more balanced

1178
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,760
cannabinoid ratio but

1179
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:18,980
I can give you an example ten kids where

1180
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,140
that's not the case you know some kids

1181
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,750
they're people you know I work with kids

1182
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:27,679
and adults but some mostly kids respond

1183
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:29,929
poorly to THC and you know you get the

1184
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,349
same diagnosis and they need exact

1185
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:35,659
opposite medicines and the way I try to

1186
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:38,420
help people visualize this is just

1187
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:40,190
understanding the concept that when you

1188
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,869
see a you know so we'll just stick on

1189
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,670
this thing because that's that's forest

1190
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:46,880
theme but it's a good one to visualize

1191
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:49,519
if you just stick with a seizure when

1192
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,740
you see a seizure happening you're

1193
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:55,309
seeing the consequence of something

1194
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:57,289
broken in the system right so you might

1195
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:59,269
have two people with seizures and the

1196
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:00,920
doctor observes those symptoms and

1197
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:02,900
you're gonna get a similar diagnosis

1198
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:06,500
let's say Linux gets toe syndrome ma'am

1199
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,360
you get that diagnosis that diagnosis

1200
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,119
doesn't correlate with what might have

1201
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,789
broken down in the system to manifest

1202
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,880
those consequences those seizures in

1203
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:18,619
different parts of just to oversimplify

1204
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,380
it a bit let's just stick with the

1205
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:23,569
endocannabinoid system different parts

1206
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,369
of that system can go wrong and manifest

1207
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:27,830
the same problem we could not be

1208
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:30,380
producing as you guys know an animai and

1209
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:32,509
two AG you could have a down regulation

1210
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:36,140
issue with the cb1 receptor you could

1211
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:38,720
not have the enzyme that is necessary to

1212
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:42,199
break down and cause the reaction when a

1213
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:44,659
nano minor THC bond to the cb1 receptor

1214
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:46,429
so there's just three different real

1215
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:47,539
quick examples of things three different

1216
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:50,539
things that could be going wrong in the

1217
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:53,779
system that are going to manifest the

1218
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:55,389
same seizure when the end of cannabinoid

1219
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:58,490
system is not able to regulate

1220
00:53:55,389 --> 00:54:00,199
neurotransmitter function so we know

1221
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:02,899
these different cannabinoids profiles

1222
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:04,909
and terpene profiles interact with these

1223
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,250
receptors differently in cost different

1224
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:09,139
reactions some cause and and amide to

1225
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,179
build up in the system some interact

1226
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:13,699
with the receptors in different ways and

1227
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:15,409
I think this is really the key logic

1228
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:18,109
would tell me that this is really why we

1229
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:21,559
see some people with the same symptoms

1230
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:23,870
but need different approaches because

1231
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:25,519
although we can see the symptom we can't

1232
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:26,960
see what's going wrong in the body so

1233
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,579
teaching people how to take you know

1234
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,030
efficient

1235
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:33,980
approach to aim what works for them is

1236
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:36,410
is really the trick you know and that

1237
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,579
goes back to you know dispensaries and

1238
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:39,019
what do they tell patients when they

1239
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:41,210
come in looking for things you know some

1240
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:42,920
of it is feeling comfortable telling

1241
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,539
patients well it could be a lot of

1242
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,070
different things that you need how can

1243
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:49,969
we teach you how to most efficiently

1244
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:51,830
find what your body needs as opposed to

1245
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:55,159
tell them no you need this and if this

1246
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:56,989
doesn't work then you're s out of luck

1247
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:58,909
right and it gives them the wrong

1248
00:54:56,989 --> 00:55:00,979
impression of what might help them and

1249
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:02,420
they could walk away prematurely when

1250
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:12,530
there's still an answer there for them

1251
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:15,019
somewhere what fish song comes to mind I

1252
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:17,140
was at a big fish free at last night

1253
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:20,030
don't get me started

1254
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:21,799
yeah just one more thing about

1255
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:27,050
concentrations and you talked about that

1256
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:29,269
oh extract being somewhere between 65 to

1257
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:32,630
70% cannabinoids so then you take that

1258
00:55:29,269 --> 00:55:34,849
and you cut that with like another oil

1259
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,619
vehicle like coconut oil or something

1260
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:39,739
like that what's your ratio when you

1261
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:42,289
when you make the oil that actually is

1262
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:44,329
going in so that helps us understand

1263
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:46,699
again the level of cannabinoids that

1264
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:48,500
you're getting in these doses and

1265
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:49,849
whether or not the effort efficacy is

1266
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,369
always going to be a function of how

1267
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:57,639
much they're getting so how is it like a

1268
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:57,639
ten to one delusion that that's

1269
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:09,539
oh he got muted sorry for isn't you did

1270
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,769
you I thought you were talking to

1271
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:15,389
someone else you got to unmute yourself

1272
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:17,880
no I got just reaching behind me in my

1273
00:56:15,389 --> 00:56:21,298
bag of tricks here so much that's the

1274
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,920
benefit of having dinner I look at it

1275
00:56:21,298 --> 00:56:24,480
the more I've worked with this the less

1276
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,400
I look at strain names and I look at the

1277
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,818
test results and say okay we have a

1278
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,539
pallet of cannabinoids terpenoids

1279
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:37,068
flavonoids that we can work with and

1280
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:40,588
from there you know mark we're able to

1281
00:56:37,068 --> 00:56:43,739
really dial in what that individual

1282
00:56:40,588 --> 00:56:45,298
person needs so when you have your your

1283
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:46,709
extract right so this is some nice

1284
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:49,710
pineapple jack

1285
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:52,289
THC extract labeled and tested ready to

1286
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:54,480
go measured out we know exactly well

1287
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:56,818
exactly within testing range we all know

1288
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,338
that analytical testing various a little

1289
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:01,858
bit so we're able to take that and I can

1290
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:03,929
say okay well I have the amount of THC

1291
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:06,630
and a particular terpene profile with

1292
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:08,818
that but maybe this person is showing

1293
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:11,099
that they are also responding to acidic

1294
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:14,730
compounds so I can take some rosin that

1295
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:16,829
we've had pressed here it is also acidic

1296
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,960
triangle if you can see that oh it's

1297
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:22,650
bubbly goodness there we can work with

1298
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,260
then adding in specific THC and CBD a

1299
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:28,950
and THC VA and some of these other

1300
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:31,770
compounds it basically then build a

1301
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:33,358
customized medicine for that person and

1302
00:57:31,769 --> 00:57:34,079
when we get into you know I work really

1303
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:35,670
with rare

1304
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,099
you know neurological conditions a lot

1305
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:40,440
so it isn't sup being very

1306
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:42,930
individualized so you're able to take

1307
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,200
that medicine yeah I use typically MCT

1308
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:48,029
oil unless they have a sensitivity to it

1309
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:50,519
not uncommon most people are doing that

1310
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:52,500
these days - good good choice and and

1311
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:54,900
there's actually studies that show it's

1312
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:57,750
a preferred vehicle for getting quick

1313
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,119
onset of activity in the oral mucosa so

1314
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:02,909
yeah that's a real good choice right so

1315
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:05,250
yeah what's your that you use how what

1316
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:07,618
would and we're like if people are

1317
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,869
listening and they want to again create

1318
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:12,869
their own products or how would you I

1319
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:16,280
always thought that the best way to do

1320
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:17,920
is to like dose until you actually feel

1321
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,869
nabbed or

1322
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,329
the patient's so when you know that you

1323
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:25,088
can titrate them up to the level where

1324
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:27,640
you're agonizing cb1 maybe you want to

1325
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:29,980
dial back from that so would you start a

1326
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:33,789
patient especially a child patient and

1327
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:36,789
say like a 20 milligram per day dose or

1328
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:39,279
is 10 milligrams or 5 milligram what's

1329
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:43,058
the right place to start to sort of look

1330
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,798
to titrate up to that level of where you

1331
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:46,780
know you're getting cannabinoids in

1332
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:49,809
there but you're not doing it in a way

1333
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:51,880
that completely incapacitates the child

1334
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:55,089
or the patient to where they have to you

1335
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:57,608
know get dizzy or just their patients

1336
00:58:55,088 --> 00:58:59,170
what I find is that they don't want to

1337
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:01,630
take the medicine anymore because they

1338
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,720
don't like the way it feels and so I

1339
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:06,700
think it's really important to titrate

1340
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:08,379
their body up to that level because that

1341
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:10,389
tells you that you're getting

1342
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:13,539
cannabinoids into their system but maybe

1343
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:15,909
dial back the daily dose so they can

1344
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:18,548
still be functional and not be dizzy and

1345
00:59:15,909 --> 00:59:21,960
not feel disoriented so what advice

1346
00:59:18,548 --> 00:59:25,139
would you give them especially parents

1347
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:28,420
dr. michele m and israel find that

1348
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:28,989
really young children like you know 2 3

1349
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,639
4 or 5

1350
00:59:28,989 --> 00:59:35,919
don't get high when they're given Katie

1351
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:40,389
yeah I've seen I've seen children take

1352
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,980
doses that have blown my mind I'm gonna

1353
00:59:40,389 --> 00:59:43,318
meet with this parent because I want to

1354
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,798
really double-check and make sure

1355
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:51,130
they're looking at the tests accurately

1356
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:54,280
who is 70 maybe no she's like 45 pounds

1357
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:57,990
she's 8 years old and is somewhere

1358
00:59:54,280 --> 01:00:00,790
around 1,800 milligrams a day dosing so

1359
00:59:57,989 --> 01:00:02,649
that would be an extreme nobody starts

1360
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:05,170
at that level baseless so when we're

1361
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:08,318
talking about starting I started one you

1362
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:10,869
know I started we started you know it

1363
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:14,679
would be one of those slow we check for

1364
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:18,309
we check for all sorts of things no I

1365
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:21,039
think that's the only way you can use

1366
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:23,349
the physiological response as any

1367
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,949
indicator to whether or not they're

1368
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:29,230
feeling again I I guess again my feeling

1369
01:00:26,949 --> 01:00:31,739
is I was trying to work with an older

1370
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:33,990
patient who feels very distal

1371
01:00:31,739 --> 01:00:36,899
and when she takes like a a hundred

1372
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:40,049
milligram candy so what we're trying to

1373
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:42,300
do is start with her low and slow

1374
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:44,039
I think is the way to go and I think

1375
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,380
especially for children patients

1376
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:49,800
wouldn't you recommend the same well

1377
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:53,490
this is why we use drops you know it's

1378
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:55,080
not it's not just for you know looks or

1379
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:57,059
because people are used to getting it in

1380
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:00,509
droppers one of the main advantages is

1381
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:02,279
that you can control the dose relatively

1382
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:05,130
you know approximately down to the

1383
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,560
milligram so we start with like a

1384
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:10,410
milligram or a drop depending on how

1385
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:11,820
concentrated the droppers are and that's

1386
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:13,319
another great reason when you're going

1387
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:16,410
from concentrate you can make that

1388
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:19,309
teacher is concentrated or is diluted as

1389
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:22,829
you think is appropriate but yeah I

1390
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:25,230
leaned on the side of you start down at

1391
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:27,779
minimum but you don't also need to dilly

1392
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:30,599
dally with titration for months on it

1393
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,550
right so we start with a dose we make

1394
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:34,739
sure there's no adverse reactions no

1395
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:37,170
rare allergies nothing that could be

1396
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:40,139
throw us a curveball and then we just

1397
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:42,090
start to titrate up with times of day so

1398
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:44,730
we keep the dose so very small might be

1399
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:46,858
a milligram and then we start we add in

1400
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:48,358
the bedtime dose and in the noon dose

1401
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:50,340
because we want to see every four to six

1402
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:54,119
hours because our goal is to keep a

1403
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:55,950
sustained level in the system not spikes

1404
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:59,130
and waves right so we have you know

1405
01:01:55,949 --> 01:02:00,509
neurological type conditions so that's

1406
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,430
that's sort of our approach and then

1407
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:05,070
when we get the four or three doses

1408
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:07,049
whatever they feel is appropriate a day

1409
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:10,220
then we start titrating up those doses

1410
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:13,950
like a milligram or two at a time and

1411
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:15,449
doing it that way we've I I can't

1412
01:02:13,949 --> 01:02:17,579
actually remember the last time I had

1413
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:21,839
someone even complained about being high

1414
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:23,779
because you will see efficacy usually

1415
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,300
before that happens for most

1416
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:31,310
endocannabinoids regulatory issues which

1417
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:34,740
a lot of these conditions fall under and

1418
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:35,940
once you do start to feel something

1419
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:38,239
because you're taking such a methodical

1420
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:40,190
slow approach it

1421
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,319
then it's not big jumps in your dose

1422
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:44,300
it's never at the point where this is

1423
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,820
uncomfortable like yeah okay I made me

1424
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:51,530
feel a little relaxed here on the sets

1425
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:55,039
the low threshold of intoxication or

1426
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:56,660
psycho activity that it's never a

1427
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,279
negative it's never been a negative

1428
01:02:56,659 --> 01:03:01,969
experience and you're a hundred percent

1429
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:07,160
right about children and how they

1430
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:08,509
process it because I like I said and

1431
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,500
then I've heard dr. Russo and other

1432
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:11,630
doctors say this as well

1433
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:14,119
I've noticed that kids just process it

1434
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:16,190
differently so if we take that low and

1435
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:18,940
slow approach like you said or low and

1436
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:21,289
not too slow but a methodical approach

1437
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:24,349
you know we don't I don't see a real

1438
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:26,480
problem with intoxication ever and the

1439
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:28,309
kids who do end up getting they titrate

1440
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,650
up the doses that I know would knock me

1441
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:33,799
on my butt and they've never seen even

1442
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:35,570
you know a blurred eye or giggly

1443
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,180
attitude out of them there's no sign of

1444
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:40,670
any sort of intoxication whatsoever and

1445
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:42,230
I think you know each individual

1446
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:43,400
endocannabinoids system has something to

1447
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,530
do with that if they're already

1448
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:49,220
deficient and the receptors aren't being

1449
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:50,030
saturated or by an and oh my into AG I

1450
01:03:49,219 --> 01:03:52,759
think you're going to be able to

1451
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:54,950
tolerate more stimulation through THC so

1452
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:59,210
all those things have something to do

1453
01:03:54,949 --> 01:04:01,730
with it but I don't think the other

1454
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:04,039
thing that does heroic doses do is you

1455
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:06,469
got to remember that the metabolites are

1456
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:08,840
stored in in fatty tissues in fatty

1457
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:10,969
organs and stuff it's protecting those

1458
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:13,789
organs from free radical damage and

1459
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:15,879
oxidative damage but it also on the

1460
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:19,159
burning of adipose tissue basically

1461
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:22,490
releases all that you know systemically

1462
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:24,889
so I mean humans were evolved to hold on

1463
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:27,589
to these cannabinoids for as long as we

1464
01:04:24,889 --> 01:04:30,230
possibly can and they're fat soluble so

1465
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:32,930
like most antioxidants like vitamin C

1466
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:35,210
are water-soluble the cannabinoids are

1467
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:37,879
our fat soluble which protects fatty

1468
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:39,559
tissues from oxidative damage oh my god

1469
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:45,440
that I say I already said that I feel

1470
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:46,869
like a mana no I myself as they go off

1471
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,710
of certain medications there's

1472
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:50,720
medications that cause you to gain

1473
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:51,470
weight right we've all seen that or

1474
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,108
experience

1475
01:04:51,469 --> 01:04:57,169
and I've seen big-time not just the

1476
01:04:54,108 --> 01:05:00,500
removal of the medication influence

1477
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:03,170
significantly the cannabinoid supplement

1478
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:05,090
dose but as they lose that fat you know

1479
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:06,858
right so the Oedipus tissue is no longer

1480
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:08,840
making those stores I've seen the

1481
01:05:06,858 --> 01:05:10,730
interactions with the cannabinoid

1482
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,980
medicines change and have to really make

1483
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:15,619
some adjustments because of that as well

1484
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,820
so that is a really good point well and

1485
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:18,500
the other thing that's different about

1486
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:21,170
about your product which I'm very

1487
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,510
intrigued is is that in this full plant

1488
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:26,358
extract you're not winterizing so you're

1489
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:29,060
not removing any of the other components

1490
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:32,108
such that so if your stuff is analyzing

1491
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:34,789
for let's say a neighborhood you know

1492
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:36,710
seventy percent there's thirty percent

1493
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:38,929
other components in there of terpenes

1494
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:41,480
are a sizable fraction well there's

1495
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:43,639
still a pretty sizable fraction of other

1496
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,500
extractables that are coming along with

1497
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:47,739
the plant that certainly you may not

1498
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,090
want in stay like add a beable

1499
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:53,118
concentrated Abbeville product because

1500
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:55,039
those things are gonna close in and and

1501
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,890
degrade but certainly in this product

1502
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:00,199
format where you're looking to you know

1503
01:05:57,889 --> 01:06:02,690
try to deliver the whole plant goodness

1504
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:06,079
by extracting everything that the plant

1505
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:07,670
has to extract again there's fatty acids

1506
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,409
in there there's lipids in there like

1507
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:12,019
you point out there's flavonoids in

1508
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:14,329
there all the other minor components

1509
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:18,588
that are non cannabinoids might be

1510
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:21,289
helping the overall entourage effect of

1511
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:23,358
everything and that's good for people to

1512
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:27,199
hear that again you don't necessarily

1513
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:29,598
have to go through making distillate now

1514
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,750
making distillate I think is a

1515
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:35,780
completely valid opportunity again to

1516
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:37,730
make medicine from the plant but I think

1517
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:41,769
in this particular case what you're

1518
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:45,079
looking for is again it could possibly

1519
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:48,710
provide so you know for those including

1520
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:51,348
the groups including the roots for those

1521
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:54,588
who used to watch Star Trek this is like

1522
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:56,359
fire all weapons you know phasers you

1523
01:06:54,588 --> 01:06:58,460
know photon torpedoes you hit them with

1524
01:06:56,358 --> 01:07:01,309
everything because if the plant offers

1525
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:03,949
this and again the plant is a source of

1526
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:05,250
vital nutrition for humans why not take

1527
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:07,409
it in the extract

1528
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,780
why would you want it separated out from

1529
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:11,849
something that again can provide medical

1530
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:14,540
efficacy and I think that's part of what

1531
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:17,009
you're seeing in the boost of efficacy

1532
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:19,050
yeah you know we go back and forth on

1533
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:20,700
certain parts of the plant and how to

1534
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:23,190
best use it you know how what

1535
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:25,649
chlorophylls impact is in those sort of

1536
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:28,050
things but you know I agree there's a

1537
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,490
lot to the plant you know when I I don't

1538
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,720
have data to back it up that is an

1539
01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:33,299
anecdotal this is where we get into

1540
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,980
anecdotal data but you know when I have

1541
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,050
a tincture and I'd be happy to send you

1542
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,690
guys something to check out that you

1543
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:41,789
open the lid and it just bursts in the

1544
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:43,409
room with with all the things that the

1545
01:07:41,789 --> 01:07:45,440
plant wants to communicate and that's

1546
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:47,730
what those turns are is its way of

1547
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:50,519
communicating with the world around it I

1548
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:52,619
just like with the evidence that's come

1549
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:54,989
out with some of the entourage studies

1550
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:58,859
that are being done and across the board

1551
01:07:54,989 --> 01:08:01,139
the studies have shown that single

1552
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:05,099
isolate cannabinoid therapies are not as

1553
01:08:01,139 --> 01:08:07,559
effective as therapies that are when you

1554
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:10,259
include and reintroduce you know THC to

1555
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:12,059
a CBD therapy or vice versa and then you

1556
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,640
start to talk about the terpenes that

1557
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:16,289
research is being done it's pretty

1558
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:19,170
conclusive that's each study has shown

1559
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:21,838
the efficacy is increased with the

1560
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:23,520
addition of the whole plant cannabinoids

1561
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,670
and enterpreneurs as opposed to

1562
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,600
isolating you know to me it's just

1563
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,069
that's the direction we're going to go

1564
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,400
until we have something that points us

1565
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:34,470
otherwise and yeah there's some there

1566
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,629
are some turbulent terpenoids

1567
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:37,980
that are only in the roots you know dr.

1568
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:41,159
Russo's work right now is just

1569
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:42,809
mind-blowing but I take it with a little

1570
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,430
bit of caution and this is where we get

1571
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,740
back to where we started where it's just

1572
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:48,420
I don't want to say what's right and

1573
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:50,489
wrong because Who am I we're all on this

1574
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:53,940
journey of researching and doing what we

1575
01:08:50,489 --> 01:08:56,099
think is best so I think that there's

1576
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:57,689
some caution personally with the kids we

1577
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:01,039
were working with if we were starting to

1578
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:04,108
integrate and distill and concentrate

1579
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:06,720
medicines that were made from roots and

1580
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:11,220
stems and things like that just strictly

1581
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:13,079
because of cannabis his ability to suck

1582
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:15,060
things out of the soil and store it in

1583
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:16,229
its roots and stems but that doesn't

1584
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,450
mean there's not medically beneficial

1585
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:19,189
things in there that does

1586
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:20,750
mean that if your soil is good and your

1587
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,879
soils clean and your environments clean

1588
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,590
that that can't be done safely so this

1589
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,079
gets back to just making sure that the

1590
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:29,239
customer knows what they're by you know

1591
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:31,760
so that they can say yeah this could be

1592
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:33,920
great for me as a full-grown adult if

1593
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,989
I'm trying to work with my you know six

1594
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,119
month old with neuroblastoma I might

1595
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:40,099
avoid some of these just because there

1596
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:45,739
might be something I feel it's something

1597
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:50,450
that be cautious about no stems no seeds

1598
01:09:45,739 --> 01:09:54,229
that you don't need Acapulco gold is far

1599
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:55,579
out weed nervous about this bulk CBD

1600
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:58,309
coming in you know there's people now

1601
01:09:55,579 --> 01:10:00,920
that you can get Gowan CBD oils and it's

1602
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:03,170
all just it's essentially medical or

1603
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,720
non-medical it's industrial waste you

1604
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:08,420
know it's from Asia and Eastern Europe

1605
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,699
where they're doing big hemp you know

1606
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:13,279
for manufacturing reasons they're making

1607
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:15,649
him products ropes and clothes or

1608
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,539
whatever wallets cedra but they just

1609
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:19,489
bundle all this stuff into a big hopper

1610
01:10:17,539 --> 01:10:22,069
at the end of it and just dose it with

1611
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:24,079
things and you get CBD at the end and

1612
01:10:22,069 --> 01:10:26,869
they're able to distill that down and

1613
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:30,079
run it through a purifier and the heimo

1614
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:32,329
sell you these gallons of purified CBD

1615
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:35,180
oil and that that to me without having

1616
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:37,130
that information of you know where it

1617
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,920
comes from how it's made what's in it is

1618
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:40,340
it organic that stuff just makes me

1619
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,199
nervous

1620
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:45,079
nekkid just butyl being overcautious but

1621
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:48,979
it's not not for me it should make you

1622
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:50,359
nervous yeah man I think people realize

1623
01:10:48,979 --> 01:10:52,389
that's what that is that it's a waste

1624
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:57,579
product of the hemp industry in Asia

1625
01:10:52,390 --> 01:11:06,100
grown for that purpose China fell grown

1626
01:10:57,579 --> 01:11:08,869
biodynamically for sure human poop well

1627
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:11,539
there's definite so there's definitely a

1628
01:11:08,869 --> 01:11:13,399
need for monomolecular for the isolation

1629
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:15,710
of the molecules because then people

1630
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:17,809
like forests can come along and find the

1631
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:20,359
recipes and add the terpenes and produce

1632
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:22,340
those very specifically accurate

1633
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:25,099
cannabinoid and terpene profiles that

1634
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,900
stay accurate every single time all the

1635
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,480
way down the line whereas plants with

1636
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:30,519
variables they can have these

1637
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:33,189
bits of changes and whatnot so I see the

1638
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,320
value I also see the snake oil salesman

1639
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:37,479
aspect for a long time I couldn't figure

1640
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:40,299
out how is everyone shipping this stuff

1641
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:42,459
when it's not legal to ship and then I

1642
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,739
realized oh okay they're shipping hemp

1643
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:47,980
oil that's been cold-pressed and because

1644
01:11:44,738 --> 01:11:50,979
it's a low THC you know there couldn't

1645
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:53,709
be CBD cultivar in the cultivar that it

1646
01:11:50,979 --> 01:11:56,169
it basically small amounts of it press

1647
01:11:53,710 --> 01:12:01,329
into the oil and they're calling that

1648
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:05,319
CBD oil when really it's hemp oil with

1649
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:06,460
CBD contaminant in like super super

1650
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:08,199
small amounts

1651
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:09,730
I ran the bottle it's a hundred and

1652
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:13,000
eighty nine dollars for a bottle of

1653
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:13,419
marketed their kids and families every

1654
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,470
day

1655
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:19,899
Plus hemp oil and we took it to the labs

1656
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:23,170
and tested it and there was nothing in

1657
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:25,599
it not a terpene not a fraction that the

1658
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:27,039
machines couldn't even pick up CBD you

1659
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,039
know and so it's essentially you know

1660
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,899
it's $189 if you know I'm assuming him

1661
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:33,579
seed oil could be olive oil for all I

1662
01:12:31,899 --> 01:12:37,899
know you know just the way we know

1663
01:12:33,579 --> 01:12:41,199
nothing in it beneficial well I didn't

1664
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:42,969
hear that mark said I surprised so bean

1665
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:48,099
oil just because it's the cheapest yeah

1666
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:50,020
so that is absolutely happening though

1667
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:52,180
are you decarboxylated this ethanol

1668
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:55,870
extract or you're putting it in there

1669
01:12:52,180 --> 01:13:00,220
not decarboxylated aur be carboxylates

1670
01:12:55,869 --> 01:13:01,599
but because of the the distiller it's

1671
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,310
really good at temperature control but

1672
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,739
it mostly D carbs as well it's not

1673
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:08,800
really good with making acidic compounds

1674
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:11,139
which is where we've started renting out

1675
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,650
rosin you know price it starting to do

1676
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:17,289
it that way but yeah we're D carbon we

1677
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:19,210
do classes for families up here really

1678
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:20,590
try to we're doing another one here

1679
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:22,180
pretty soon if you're in the Northern

1680
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:24,610
California area where we actually teach

1681
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,350
families how to how to do this so just

1682
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:28,779
try to give them some independence you

1683
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:31,120
know but yeah it's it's D carved it can

1684
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:34,029
all be done at home I'm a big advocate

1685
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:37,300
of not letting people convince people

1686
01:13:34,029 --> 01:13:40,420
that they can't take control of their

1687
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:42,250
medicine and do it safely uh it's not

1688
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,270
easy and it's not right for

1689
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,949
everybody especially if they're

1690
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:46,450
full-time caregivers to be able to do

1691
01:13:44,949 --> 01:13:49,449
that but that's different from it being

1692
01:13:46,449 --> 01:13:53,619
impossible to do so we do a lot of

1693
01:13:49,449 --> 01:13:55,179
classes teaching families you know how

1694
01:13:53,619 --> 01:13:56,229
to do it if they wanted to or at least

1695
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:58,240
watching them be able to know exactly

1696
01:13:56,229 --> 01:14:00,639
how the things that we're providing are

1697
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:02,469
made and how it's done safely how to

1698
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,960
read test results how to then use that

1699
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:09,039
to make them accurately dose medicines

1700
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:11,500
etc yeah that's really important to

1701
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:14,350
empower families how to do it themselves

1702
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:16,239
sorry for interrupting you there but I

1703
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:18,370
have a question for you guys and I'm

1704
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:21,579
wondering about are you working or doing

1705
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:24,130
any test studies in utero with pregnant

1706
01:14:21,579 --> 01:14:27,760
women that because we're learning about

1707
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:30,640
this as a basic a nutrient and I've also

1708
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,350
noticed that in children that are that

1709
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,970
we're also treating with the oils that

1710
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:37,480
we're making which is a whole plant

1711
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:42,190
extract as well we're noticing that the

1712
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:43,919
children who have had THC or CBD from

1713
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:46,509
the beginning you know mothers that have

1714
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,930
ingested cannabis from the beginning

1715
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:53,050
have different kind of tolerances then

1716
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:55,150
children who you know have never had it

1717
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:58,020
before it's actually quite significant

1718
01:14:55,149 --> 01:15:00,729
so talking about like a basic nutrient

1719
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:02,470
from the beginning you know in a zygote

1720
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:04,569
form I think that's just a really

1721
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:07,030
interesting conversation and I'm

1722
01:15:04,569 --> 01:15:09,609
wondering do you work with women in

1723
01:15:07,029 --> 01:15:10,239
pregnancy you know it's funny that you

1724
01:15:09,609 --> 01:15:13,149
bring that up

1725
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:17,109
I mean it's known that endocannabinoids

1726
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:20,529
signaling is a huge part of neurological

1727
01:15:17,109 --> 01:15:22,179
development pre and postnatal I mean but

1728
01:15:20,529 --> 01:15:24,849
it's funny I'm going to jump to another

1729
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:27,369
story real quick because I do a lot of

1730
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:30,610
consultations with families from all

1731
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:32,319
over the world Indonesia the UK India

1732
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:35,769
you know the United States of course

1733
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:38,679
Canada and I had the mom who I was

1734
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:41,140
speaking with this week who has a very

1735
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:44,409
young child I think seven months old

1736
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:46,240
and infantile spasms right so this is

1737
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:48,460
not a good sign when your child starts

1738
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:50,050
having infantile spasms of that age it

1739
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,670
can quickly be diagnosed as wess

1740
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:55,930
syndrome which then leads into these

1741
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:59,590
more unfortunate epilepsies but

1742
01:15:55,930 --> 01:16:02,560
she was in Texas and the access in Texas

1743
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:05,800
is horrific inhumane would be the word I

1744
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,450
would use and but if you have access to

1745
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,360
what they can order online which is

1746
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:12,189
although not necessarily legal but the

1747
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:17,259
lack of enforcement allows us to get

1748
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:19,659
some CBD real CBD products at times and

1749
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:22,060
she was using those CBD products and not

1750
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:23,109
having any luck with her daughter's

1751
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:25,870
seizures she was still having these

1752
01:16:23,109 --> 01:16:28,299
spasms every single day and a friend of

1753
01:16:25,869 --> 01:16:30,010
hers gave her THC and like a lot of

1754
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:32,170
parents like I don't know I don't know

1755
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:34,810
if THC is safe you know I'm not sure I

1756
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:36,779
should use it and she read the and she

1757
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:38,620
was gonna see if it was safe and her I

1758
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:39,909
don't know what she was thinking as far

1759
01:16:38,619 --> 01:16:42,279
as seeing if it was safe but she's gonna

1760
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:45,069
try it herself and see if it was you

1761
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:48,159
know poison or not okay she read the

1762
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:50,409
label wrong and just totally Doster

1763
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:53,680
stealth-like with a 40 or 50 milligram

1764
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:56,829
dose which is not something she does

1765
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:59,170
because she's not a cannabis user was

1766
01:16:56,829 --> 01:17:00,579
knocked out on the couch for the day and

1767
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:02,350
she's like man was experience and kind

1768
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:04,539
of everything go now I'm nervous to give

1769
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:05,289
this to my baby it was such a intense

1770
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:09,819
experience

1771
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:13,180
but then she called and said that she's

1772
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:15,549
breastfeeding her child and after she

1773
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:19,119
dosed herself with that THC her daughter

1774
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:20,380
with four days without a seizure and she

1775
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:22,829
hadn't gone four days without a seizure

1776
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:25,449
in months and months and months

1777
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:28,539
something that really excites me I think

1778
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:30,369
that it's incredibly important we

1779
01:17:28,539 --> 01:17:32,170
definitely work with small children and

1780
01:17:30,369 --> 01:17:34,930
especially work with small children and

1781
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:36,789
women and children with all different

1782
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:38,260
types of autoimmune disorders whether

1783
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:40,869
it's seizures whether it's some

1784
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:43,659
emotional disorders and we're noticing

1785
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:46,180
that you know really dosing the mothers

1786
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:49,899
with large doses of THC along with the

1787
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:52,570
CBD is immediate response you know with

1788
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:54,099
with the baby and breastfeeding and I

1789
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:56,590
think that you know it's an important

1790
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:58,270
conversation to have even you know with

1791
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:00,190
our alternative culture because they're

1792
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:02,470
going to be more receptive to it but I

1793
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:04,719
do think that it's important to be

1794
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:06,820
introducing to mothers you know from the

1795
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,520
beginning of pregnancy or even before

1796
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:09,819
they want to get pregnant to start and

1797
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,420
Jess

1798
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:15,309
in cannabis in doses you know that make

1799
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:17,170
them feel good which in turn is going to

1800
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:19,240
help their baby in the long run and then

1801
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:20,920
I think when we see these children who

1802
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:23,769
have had cannabinoids since the

1803
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:25,890
beginning you know they are able to

1804
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:28,090
receive the cannabinoids much easier

1805
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:30,700
something that's very familiar to their

1806
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:34,560
system allows their immune system to you

1807
01:18:30,699 --> 01:18:36,970
know avoid autoimmune disorders yeah and

1808
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,240
just an important key that you know we

1809
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:42,130
haven't had enough research out there

1810
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:43,809
but we are doing it like you said you

1811
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:45,699
know working with a lot of children and

1812
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:48,810
I definitely am noticing that those

1813
01:18:45,699 --> 01:18:51,939
children that have had the seeit TB C

1814
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:53,890
THC and the CBD from the very beginning

1815
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:55,539
are just doing so much better with the

1816
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:58,060
medicine right off the get-go it's not a

1817
01:18:55,539 --> 01:18:59,829
week it's the first dosage that they get

1818
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:01,840
it because their body is reminded of it

1819
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:03,760
and they know it well that was kind of

1820
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,680
where that story was leading to because

1821
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:08,140
of that experience she was like well

1822
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,579
maybe it is THC that is benefiting she

1823
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:12,280
was not a little bit more comfortable

1824
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:14,920
within slowly adding some milligrams of

1825
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:17,710
THC into the trounce dose and we saw the

1826
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:19,869
seizures dramatically decrease you know

1827
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:23,439
so there's a lot you know it's a lot we

1828
01:19:19,869 --> 01:19:26,769
don't know about neonatal impacts and in

1829
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:28,869
utero impact of high-level cannabis use

1830
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:30,250
so that I think these people who might

1831
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:32,109
be watching this get nervous and go oh

1832
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:33,880
my gosh are they advocating for that I

1833
01:19:32,109 --> 01:19:37,779
mean there's a big difference between

1834
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:41,260
sitting around and taking dabs all day

1835
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:44,439
right and using certain cannabinoids as

1836
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:45,699
a supplement in the body and when you

1837
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:49,719
look at the research have been you

1838
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:51,939
turrible use with children writer or

1839
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:53,500
parents who are using cannabis at the

1840
01:19:51,939 --> 01:19:56,829
children who then came through the

1841
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:59,020
pregnancy when they remove comorbidity

1842
01:19:56,829 --> 01:20:02,170
right things like alcohol use and

1843
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:04,210
smoking and in other factors there's

1844
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:06,579
really nothing that shows any harm and

1845
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:09,069
that's still even with that that's not

1846
01:20:06,579 --> 01:20:12,579
saying we're advocating or recommending

1847
01:20:09,069 --> 01:20:14,500
parents abused cannabis and high levels

1848
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:16,000
there's it's just we learn to

1849
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,970
differentiate there's more than one way

1850
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,229
we can use cannabis now and it's a night

1851
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,730
and day difference in some of these

1852
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:23,289
supplements if the parents are having

1853
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:26,589
issues that are

1854
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:31,079
possibly more beneficial and less

1855
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:33,670
harmful then say you know a SSRI

1856
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:36,100
inhibitor right some of those things

1857
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:38,470
that we know can cause problems in in

1858
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,220
utero but if the mom say is dealing with

1859
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:41,230
depression

1860
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:43,060
I wouldn't say jump and just start you

1861
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:44,559
using cannabis but if you have the

1862
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:46,960
choices between some of these drugs that

1863
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:50,650
we know can cause in utero problems and

1864
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:53,920
a low-dose cannabinoid supplement that

1865
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:55,960
can deal with what might be causing a

1866
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,640
regulatory issue that can cause some

1867
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,500
depression or some of those things that

1868
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,119
can happen in pregnancy it's just about

1869
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,380
looking at what is safe and best for the

1870
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:04,599
mother and child and we're at the point

1871
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:08,619
now where if you get over that fear that

1872
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:10,510
cannabis is not this evil dangerous drug

1873
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:13,059
and there's really no science to back it

1874
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:15,400
up and you compare it to what would be

1875
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:17,260
offered at the pharmacy it's just about

1876
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:19,420
you know what is the least impactful

1877
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,880
with the most chance of a positive

1878
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:23,800
benefit and I think cannabis posing way

1879
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:27,880
before a lot of these other drugs that

1880
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:30,610
are given to women in pregnancy and I

1881
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:33,760
think that it's important note um that

1882
01:21:30,609 --> 01:21:35,949
you know women are also utilizing

1883
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,630
cannabis in their pregnancy for you know

1884
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:39,279
things that they have that's an ailment

1885
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:41,170
that's going on with them you know

1886
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:43,449
they're utilizing it as their medicine

1887
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:45,250
as well um one thing I'd like to note

1888
01:21:43,449 --> 01:21:47,019
you know saying that I don't advocate in

1889
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:49,569
the same way that you do in large doses

1890
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:52,060
and I certainly don't advocate for women

1891
01:21:49,569 --> 01:21:56,519
to be smoking during their pregnancy you

1892
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:59,320
know hot smoke cuts off the vaso

1893
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,180
movement in the placental from the

1894
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:03,309
mother to the baby so it's very

1895
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:05,530
important that if they are utilizing

1896
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:07,630
cannabis you know smoking it in large

1897
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:08,739
doses I don't recommend at all yeah I

1898
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:10,210
think it's unfortunately you have to

1899
01:22:08,739 --> 01:22:11,859
just mention that because that's what a

1900
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:13,869
lot of people visualize right away you

1901
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:15,759
know so they had to keep putting that

1902
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:17,349
qualifier on there to realize that

1903
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,570
there's different types of relationships

1904
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:22,630
that you can have and some can be very

1905
01:22:19,569 --> 01:22:24,849
beneficial and safe you know I wanted to

1906
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:28,420
throw something out here I think it was

1907
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:31,480
Russo who presented the idea of what

1908
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:35,470
he's calling cannabinoid deficiency

1909
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:36,948
syndromes and it's a plural and the idea

1910
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:38,810
is that

1911
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:40,909
there's all these conditions that we've

1912
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:44,239
found that humans are subject to that

1913
01:22:40,909 --> 01:22:47,179
seem to respond to cannabis therapies

1914
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:49,428
and most of them are ingested cannabis

1915
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:52,250
again where we see the really dramatic

1916
01:22:49,429 --> 01:22:54,529
results and it's reus I believe it was

1917
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,130
Rousseau do you remember forest was it

1918
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:57,859
Rousseau

1919
01:22:55,130 --> 01:23:00,380
yeah and economic efficiency syndrome is

1920
01:22:57,859 --> 01:23:02,509
yeah baby could never know a deficiency

1921
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:05,239
syndrome and and yeah what blew my mind

1922
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:08,289
about this was the idea that all these

1923
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:11,779
conditions from epilepsy to autism to

1924
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:14,979
certain cancers etc etc all these things

1925
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:16,849
that respond to cannabinoids are

1926
01:23:14,979 --> 01:23:19,189
happening in the human population

1927
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:21,679
because the human population due to

1928
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:26,178
prohibition is suffering from a

1929
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:28,609
collective cannabinoid deficiency and as

1930
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:29,329
we start adding the cannabinoids to our

1931
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:33,229
bodies

1932
01:23:29,329 --> 01:23:36,229
I think of CBD as the molecule that

1933
01:23:33,229 --> 01:23:37,218
helps your body find the state that we

1934
01:23:36,229 --> 01:23:40,849
call health

1935
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:43,670
it's a homeostatic regulator it helps

1936
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:49,100
the body find the condition we call

1937
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:51,859
health and it's adapted genic among

1938
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:56,420
other things yes exactly it helps the

1939
01:23:51,859 --> 01:23:59,389
body find health yeah I just had a and I

1940
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:01,940
I did an episode with of my podcast with

1941
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:04,340
dr. Jeffery hergenrother and he went

1942
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:06,469
into cannabis as an adaptogen in that

1943
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,239
conversation that we could do a whole

1944
01:24:06,469 --> 01:24:11,630
show on that I'm really interested and

1945
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:13,069
talking more about that but I want to do

1946
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,900
the show so I can learn more about it

1947
01:24:13,069 --> 01:24:16,840
I'm not ready to speak a bunch about it

1948
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:20,529
but yeah really really interesting

1949
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:23,690
conversation is and how it pertained to

1950
01:24:20,529 --> 01:24:25,429
some of maybe the misunderstandings

1951
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:27,409
about cannabis about what cannabis does

1952
01:24:25,429 --> 01:24:29,359
what but without taking into account

1953
01:24:27,409 --> 01:24:31,670
that cannabis can do different things

1954
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,349
that during different times because of

1955
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:36,350
the body's ability to use it in

1956
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:38,390
different ways was really fascinating we

1957
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:40,280
really resonate with using poly pores

1958
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:41,480
and medicinal mushrooms in this equation

1959
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:43,670
too and I would love to see our

1960
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:46,519
community get more involved in that and

1961
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:48,319
being able to take different compounds

1962
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:50,480
for medicinal mushrooms and put it it's

1963
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,819
magic which you know

1964
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:55,009
a perfect fusion to the human body as

1965
01:24:52,819 --> 01:24:56,929
well and other adaptogenic Chinese herbs

1966
01:24:55,010 --> 01:25:00,220
you know that really share different

1967
01:24:56,930 --> 01:25:02,720
terpenes that cannabis has as well as

1968
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:04,970
cannabinoids that cannabis has as well

1969
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,920
it's just really interesting to look at

1970
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:08,810
what other sources that we can get it

1971
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:12,619
from so that we can get a more holistic

1972
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:14,780
more rounded you know view of it as well

1973
01:25:12,619 --> 01:25:18,559
as a medicine it's an opportunity to

1974
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:22,219
bring all you know modalities together

1975
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:24,260
and bring the cannabis and with Chinese

1976
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:26,420
herbs and in with poly poisons that we

1977
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,829
get from our florist and you know we

1978
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:30,109
have amazing quality pours in our

1979
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:32,210
forests and we're finding incredible

1980
01:25:30,109 --> 01:25:36,259
results by bringing it together with

1981
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:38,449
cannabinoid Paul statements work of

1982
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:41,690
course doing tremendous amounts of work

1983
01:25:38,449 --> 01:25:45,380
with poly pores and mixing to Nabin a

1984
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:47,539
cannabis methodical and we read as much

1985
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:50,300
Japanese and Russian stuff as possible

1986
01:25:47,539 --> 01:25:52,250
but you know it's PDF files are there

1987
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:55,550
it's pretty mundane and they'd work

1988
01:25:52,250 --> 01:26:02,029
together with medical industry as well

1989
01:25:55,550 --> 01:26:04,699
oh yeah I see my psyllium running can I

1990
01:26:02,029 --> 01:26:08,119
say cannot wait to just put you on your

1991
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:14,479
shirt there I'm quite a fan of it so far

1992
01:26:08,119 --> 01:26:18,349
this morning yes we're missing the

1993
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:21,439
mushrooms right now drinking mushrooms

1994
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:25,340
yes now I think that part of what we're

1995
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:28,039
speaking to is that my experience of

1996
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:31,159
cannabis it is a one of the healing

1997
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:33,199
plants and there's I think there's

1998
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:35,409
reasons that humans have been interested

1999
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:39,289
in all these different herbs mushrooms

2000
01:26:35,409 --> 01:26:42,260
and I'm pretty convinced that science

2001
01:26:39,289 --> 01:26:45,590
can do a lot for us about helping to

2002
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:47,810
understand some of the modalities some

2003
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:51,860
of the things that happen to make nature

2004
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:54,289
what it is but I'm also pretty confident

2005
01:26:51,859 --> 01:26:57,710
that science has a very limited view of

2006
01:26:54,289 --> 01:27:00,250
the totality of things that are going on

2007
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:01,340
and there's a wisdom in

2008
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:04,189
[Music]

2009
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:06,140
herbal ism there's something going on

2010
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:08,599
with those plants and how our bodies

2011
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:10,940
relate to them and I think what we're

2012
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:13,280
doing here today in the church is

2013
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:15,919
exploring how cannabis is one of those

2014
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:19,009
healing plants that we are all drawn to

2015
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:22,039
very strongly but I think there's other

2016
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:24,470
things going on and really part of what

2017
01:27:22,039 --> 01:27:28,399
I'm here for it's a sense of well-being

2018
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:30,230
and happiness and health that cannabis

2019
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:32,869
helps me experience but I use other

2020
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:35,209
herbs as well as well as mushrooms I

2021
01:27:32,869 --> 01:27:37,670
really view mushrooms as a really great

2022
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:39,350
sign in the garden when mushrooms are

2023
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:43,699
happening in the garden everybody's

2024
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:47,150
happy in the garden Stamets is research

2025
01:27:43,699 --> 01:27:49,939
on bees and the benefits that they're

2026
01:27:47,149 --> 01:27:53,649
finding from honeybees who are an

2027
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:53,649
essential friend in all of our lives

2028
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:59,690
yeah yeah and I know I think that it's

2029
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:02,630
really important to when we start

2030
01:27:59,689 --> 01:28:04,069
talking about blending different plants

2031
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:05,960
you know and looking for different

2032
01:28:04,069 --> 01:28:07,939
compounds and medicinal compounds and

2033
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,770
these ancient Chinese herbs that have

2034
01:28:07,939 --> 01:28:13,129
been studied you know forever that you

2035
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:15,620
know talk about evidence and yeah Aria

2036
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:17,300
thetic Chinese herbs you know we do know

2037
01:28:15,619 --> 01:28:19,099
so much about it but maybe modern

2038
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:20,989
science hasn't stepped into the picture

2039
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:22,460
so all of a sudden oh we don't know

2040
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:25,340
anything about it but there is a

2041
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:27,770
tremendous amount of research and I'm

2042
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:30,800
really interested in taking all of that

2043
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:33,860
research of herbs and then feeding it to

2044
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:36,710
those master plants so trying to create

2045
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:39,049
more terpenes with terpenes you know

2046
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:40,670
going to those master plants that have

2047
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:42,710
been looked at for ever and ever and

2048
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:44,480
ever collecting them from the woods in

2049
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:46,010
the forest and then feeding them to

2050
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:47,929
themselves or creating different

2051
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:49,940
compounds making teas out of those and

2052
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:53,030
building the soil microbes because the

2053
01:28:49,939 --> 01:28:54,739
soil microbes are the actual true key to

2054
01:28:53,029 --> 01:28:56,059
the medicine we can talk all day about

2055
01:28:54,739 --> 01:28:58,760
what we're gonna do with all of our

2056
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:01,100
secondary metabolites when we get them

2057
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:04,460
but you know to be able to get the most

2058
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:07,760
complex intricate cannabinoid systems or

2059
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:10,220
terpene profiles starts with soil and a

2060
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,650
diverse soil and if we can get into

2061
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:15,039
herbalism forties and herbalism for

2062
01:29:12,649 --> 01:29:18,969
soils and herbalism for soy

2063
01:29:15,038 --> 01:29:20,768
all rise us here you really raised our

2064
01:29:18,969 --> 01:29:22,929
tree all the sudden everything's

2065
01:29:20,769 --> 01:29:24,969
vibrating you know the the soil is

2066
01:29:22,929 --> 01:29:27,510
vibrating the medicines vibrating we're

2067
01:29:24,969 --> 01:29:30,128
vibrating and it's it's it's beautiful

2068
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:32,708
and there is a difference it's not just

2069
01:29:30,128 --> 01:29:36,689
like folklore it's it really comes out

2070
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:38,738
in the labs it comes out in people's

2071
01:29:36,689 --> 01:29:41,619
reaction to wanting to buy the medicine

2072
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:44,918
and and everything it's a really natural

2073
01:29:41,618 --> 01:29:46,988
feel so you know medicine is something

2074
01:29:44,918 --> 01:29:48,608
that we can test in science but medicine

2075
01:29:46,988 --> 01:29:50,588
is also something that we can test when

2076
01:29:48,609 --> 01:29:52,359
we ingest it and if we're giving the

2077
01:29:50,588 --> 01:29:54,668
medicine everything that we can a full

2078
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:57,929
spectrum from other plants and other

2079
01:29:54,668 --> 01:30:00,608
medicinal plants then we're also

2080
01:29:57,929 --> 01:30:03,248
familiarizing our own immune system our

2081
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:06,519
own DNA with those medicinal plants that

2082
01:30:03,248 --> 01:30:08,438
you know as far as our DNA goes and our

2083
01:30:06,519 --> 01:30:10,899
structure from the very beginning we've

2084
01:30:08,439 --> 01:30:15,119
been utilizing these plants you know

2085
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:15,119
from the beginning respectful evolution

2086
01:30:15,628 --> 01:30:23,019
kind of a step back for a second

2087
01:30:18,729 --> 01:30:26,019
in one of the things that I understand

2088
01:30:23,019 --> 01:30:29,109
about traditional Chinese medicine was

2089
01:30:26,019 --> 01:30:32,409
the original agreement in a village

2090
01:30:29,109 --> 01:30:35,048
between the healer and the folk who

2091
01:30:32,408 --> 01:30:38,529
lived in the village was that the people

2092
01:30:35,048 --> 01:30:40,868
who wanted this healers help would offer

2093
01:30:38,529 --> 01:30:43,929
whatever they had some portion of it to

2094
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:46,719
them to help them maintain a sense of

2095
01:30:43,929 --> 01:30:48,519
health well-being and as long as you

2096
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:52,359
were healthy you kept paying the healer

2097
01:30:48,519 --> 01:30:58,329
but if you got sick they treated you at

2098
01:30:52,359 --> 01:31:01,838
no cost our Western medicine our medical

2099
01:30:58,328 --> 01:31:06,398
system today is set up that no one gets

2100
01:31:01,838 --> 01:31:08,708
paid until somebody's sick and there's a

2101
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:12,189
problem there there's it's not in the

2102
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:14,708
interests of our medical system if you

2103
01:31:12,189 --> 01:31:18,039
will to show us and teach us how to

2104
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:21,128
maintain health and then in the

2105
01:31:18,038 --> 01:31:24,158
traditional Chinese culture it was about

2106
01:31:21,128 --> 01:31:26,679
maintaining health so these herbs that

2107
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:29,439
they I've had good experience with

2108
01:31:26,679 --> 01:31:32,140
acupuncture getting way off subject

2109
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:33,429
but I'm really talking about health at

2110
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:36,100
the moment and the sense of well-being

2111
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:38,170
and I really think that science is

2112
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:41,350
helping us to understand why we don't

2113
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:43,810
feel healthy but I don't think science

2114
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:46,810
has the full answer on how to get

2115
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:48,970
healthy I think nature we evolved with

2116
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:53,830
nature and all these plants and I think

2117
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:55,840
that is where we can find wellbeing this

2118
01:31:53,829 --> 01:31:58,869
in nature and how nature can work

2119
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:01,239
together with us and it involves finding

2120
01:31:58,869 --> 01:32:06,099
all of these things that you we're

2121
01:32:01,239 --> 01:32:08,019
speaking of but yeah the sense of health

2122
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:12,190
the sense of well-being of being in your

2123
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:14,770
body and feeling good in it I call it I

2124
01:32:12,189 --> 01:32:19,239
think everyone wants what's that I call

2125
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:21,490
it happy huh so unless people go looking

2126
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:23,109
for it they'll look for it everywhere

2127
01:32:21,489 --> 01:32:25,510
they just can't find it they're like

2128
01:32:23,109 --> 01:32:27,309
where the hell is it we catch little

2129
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:28,840
glimpses of it they're like I was

2130
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:31,690
feeling it for a few seconds there did

2131
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:34,180
you notice I was happy happiness is

2132
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:36,549
health it's balanced it's well-rounded

2133
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:38,320
missus it's definitely a lot more than

2134
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:40,539
using cannabis as a medicine I'll tell

2135
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:43,239
you about much I see a lot of people in

2136
01:32:40,539 --> 01:32:45,579
the industry who just need to get a

2137
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:47,710
healthier diet be a little more active

2138
01:32:45,579 --> 01:32:50,460
exercise you know because cannabis is

2139
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:53,529
one part of the puzzle for sure but I

2140
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:56,649
think it will bring happiness alone well

2141
01:32:53,529 --> 01:32:59,050
happiness is the proper balance of those

2142
01:32:56,649 --> 01:33:01,689
chemical soup that your body is it's

2143
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:04,239
just you know depression versus you know

2144
01:33:01,689 --> 01:33:06,879
manic joy is all which neurotransmitters

2145
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:09,670
flowing on what level and it's funny

2146
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,930
that when we look at tying in cannabis

2147
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:13,359
to this when we look at ways to

2148
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:16,930
influence your endocannabinoids system

2149
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:20,229
whose sole job is to keep the body in

2150
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:23,380
balance in homeostasis to provide that

2151
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:26,109
optimal setup for your body the way the

2152
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:28,449
best ways to influence that system that

2153
01:33:26,109 --> 01:33:30,779
have nothing to do with cannabis are

2154
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:33,849
diet and exercise when you're exercising

2155
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:35,289
when your diet is good you influence the

2156
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:38,470
way your endocannabinoids system

2157
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:39,670
functions so yeah when you when you are

2158
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:41,050
doing those things and we've been note

2159
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:42,578
we've known that for years and years and

2160
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:44,199
years what we didn't know is

2161
01:33:42,578 --> 01:33:46,328
how much that effort was really

2162
01:33:44,198 --> 01:33:49,210
benefiting the endocannabinoid system

2163
01:33:46,328 --> 01:33:52,889
and supporting its ability to keep the

2164
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:56,609
body healthy and imbalance so you know

2165
01:33:52,889 --> 01:33:59,980
yeah exercise sorry I didn't mean to

2166
01:33:56,609 --> 01:34:03,158
it's hard coming in on the mute thing I

2167
01:33:59,979 --> 01:34:05,848
think that exercise is really important

2168
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:08,558
and it's you know also healthy microbes

2169
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:10,539
happy microbes happy beneficial bacteria

2170
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:13,599
and ice inside of our body makes us

2171
01:34:10,539 --> 01:34:15,069
happy and I think that you know when we

2172
01:34:13,599 --> 01:34:17,800
are doing healthy things for ourselves

2173
01:34:15,069 --> 01:34:20,019
and we're treating our soils with good

2174
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:22,150
things then we're getting healthy

2175
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:23,619
microbiology and I think that you know

2176
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:25,569
they have the higher intelligence

2177
01:34:23,618 --> 01:34:28,170
there's way more of them than there is

2178
01:34:25,569 --> 01:34:31,299
us and I think that if we are able to

2179
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:33,309
you know ally with them in a way that

2180
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:35,010
you know is more open to our culture you

2181
01:34:33,309 --> 01:34:37,719
know we're just starting to get into

2182
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:40,030
bifidus and lactobacillus and all the

2183
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:41,380
prebiotics and the probiotics and now

2184
01:34:40,029 --> 01:34:43,599
it's starting to become sort of a

2185
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:46,569
regular term you know I see it on TV you

2186
01:34:43,599 --> 01:34:48,940
know in just regular commercials so

2187
01:34:46,569 --> 01:34:51,460
hopefully we can you know start gaining

2188
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:55,419
more and more intelligence from those

2189
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:57,219
microbes as as a culture to help us out

2190
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,868
and along the way to create a higher

2191
01:34:57,219 --> 01:35:00,399
intelligence just like you have to

2192
01:34:58,868 --> 01:35:03,130
oxygenate your teas you have to

2193
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:04,779
oxygenate your blood and oxygenate you

2194
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:06,849
know through cardiovascular movement

2195
01:35:04,779 --> 01:35:08,439
that's part of why gardening is health

2196
01:35:06,849 --> 01:35:10,869
is because you're ingesting soil

2197
01:35:08,439 --> 01:35:12,428
microbes and your fingers and you're

2198
01:35:10,868 --> 01:35:14,558
utilizing your body you're stretching

2199
01:35:12,429 --> 01:35:16,989
your doing like garden yoga and you're

2200
01:35:14,559 --> 01:35:19,539
getting weeds and and you're and you

2201
01:35:16,988 --> 01:35:21,069
have to oxygenate your soils too you

2202
01:35:19,539 --> 01:35:23,500
have to have like aeration in your soil

2203
01:35:21,069 --> 01:35:25,840
so more and more research is being done

2204
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:27,849
you know on a medical scientific study

2205
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:30,250
that people who are having a lot of

2206
01:35:27,849 --> 01:35:32,590
ailments you know autoimmune disorders

2207
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:35,198
seizures people that are having IBS

2208
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:37,000
people that are even having cancer all

2209
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:39,279
we're doing you know they're doing is

2210
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,578
looking into the microbiome inside of

2211
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:45,460
the intestine and realizing that you

2212
01:35:42,578 --> 01:35:48,039
know they're totally devoid of a lot of

2213
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:50,439
different microbiology that they should

2214
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:52,300
have in order to be healthy so I think

2215
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:55,419
that this is sort of all wrapped up into

2216
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:59,110
into one thing and

2217
01:35:55,420 --> 01:36:00,399
cannabinoid system microbiome it's

2218
01:35:59,109 --> 01:36:02,019
interesting you said there's more of

2219
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:10,449
them than us but I guess when it comes

2220
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:12,820
to bacteria they are us yeah just what I

2221
01:36:10,449 --> 01:36:15,939
was thinking me conversations today

2222
01:36:12,819 --> 01:36:18,849
we've busted out some pretty deep so far

2223
01:36:15,939 --> 01:36:20,439
I like it and the mitochondria is a

2224
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:22,840
whole other aspect that's really

2225
01:36:20,439 --> 01:36:25,899
fascinating in the whole mitochondrial

2226
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:28,779
DNA has its own DNA that surrounds all

2227
01:36:25,899 --> 01:36:30,460
of our cells is a whole other entity

2228
01:36:28,779 --> 01:36:32,500
with inside of our body that's just so

2229
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:35,619
unbelievable yeah that's totally a

2230
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:37,239
living being as well so that's digesting

2231
01:36:35,619 --> 01:36:38,979
and thinking and breathing for us as

2232
01:36:37,239 --> 01:36:40,679
well it's really really interesting

2233
01:36:38,979 --> 01:36:43,509
wormhole that we can go down for sure

2234
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:46,119
but having a healthy immune system

2235
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:47,560
creates a healthy immune response and

2236
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:49,630
this is where cannabis is a great

2237
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,160
catalyst in our thinking towards that

2238
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:52,680
which is awesome a lot of us are

2239
01:36:51,159 --> 01:36:55,389
thinking about it when we're utilizing

2240
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,340
cannabis you know but you do have to go

2241
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:59,740
further but like you said Marcus you

2242
01:36:57,340 --> 01:37:02,350
know it's not just about just utilizing

2243
01:36:59,739 --> 01:37:04,869
cannabis by cannabis like gives us the

2244
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:06,730
mindset to sit back and connect and

2245
01:37:04,869 --> 01:37:08,559
think about all these amazing things and

2246
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:10,750
then go out and put it to use in

2247
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,760
practice and then having this community

2248
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:14,529
to share it with and because we can't

2249
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,940
all do everything and once we have it

2250
01:37:14,529 --> 01:37:17,729
all to share with and I think that we

2251
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:19,779
have the most amazing benefits and

2252
01:37:17,729 --> 01:37:22,149
recently in the last few years they've

2253
01:37:19,779 --> 01:37:24,909
been some pretty and things that have

2254
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:27,339
happened within growing and cultivating

2255
01:37:24,909 --> 01:37:30,729
and also within medicine and all the

2256
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:33,029
extracts I mean it's like never ending

2257
01:37:30,729 --> 01:37:35,259
really fun things it's almost like

2258
01:37:33,029 --> 01:37:36,849
exciting to wake up every day to find

2259
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:40,350
out like what new thing we get to learn

2260
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:43,150
about and so thank you everybody yeah

2261
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:45,190
yeah I'm in the same boat I feel like I

2262
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:47,139
just I can only imagine 20 years from

2263
01:37:45,189 --> 01:37:49,539
now what we'll know about these

2264
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:51,730
relationships these compounds and how

2265
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:54,149
they interact with not just sick people

2266
01:37:51,729 --> 01:37:56,679
but healthy people people you know as

2267
01:37:54,149 --> 01:37:58,479
preventive the whole it's really gonna

2268
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,820
there's gonna be this eventual we're

2269
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:03,579
such humans we always we just divide

2270
01:38:00,819 --> 01:38:05,799
divide divide you divide everything we

2271
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:07,899
cut it all up we categorize it and then

2272
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:09,640
eventually we come around and it seems

2273
01:38:07,899 --> 01:38:11,949
though for me what I'm

2274
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,510
around 2:00 is the quiver you know for

2275
01:38:11,949 --> 01:38:15,429
earlier having the conversation about

2276
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:18,489
the difference between oil and hash I

2277
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:21,070
was by no means saying that one is

2278
01:38:18,489 --> 01:38:22,630
better than the other for me I have a

2279
01:38:21,069 --> 01:38:24,130
preference but other there's always

2280
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:25,390
going to be different preferences for

2281
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:27,100
different reasons and that's why

2282
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:29,710
monomolecular Madison will have its

2283
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:31,480
place and that's why you know fee Co

2284
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:33,340
will have its place and that's why all

2285
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:35,079
the different types of extracts ones

2286
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:37,810
that we don't even know about right now

2287
01:38:35,079 --> 01:38:39,970
will have their place because it's

2288
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:41,650
unique it's different and it changes

2289
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:43,600
small things when we leave that

2290
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:46,059
footprint behind when we change those

2291
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:48,789
volatile terpenes that we know modulate

2292
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:51,280
the effects of the cannabinoids then we

2293
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:55,680
know that by changing the way we make

2294
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:58,599
the medicine we're changing the medicine

2295
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:02,590
yeah so speaking of volatile terpenes of

2296
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:05,289
forest how do you decarboxylate but

2297
01:39:02,590 --> 01:39:07,750
still maintain your terpene profile I

2298
01:39:05,289 --> 01:39:09,789
mean that seems to be a trick in the

2299
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:12,430
industry a lot of people are removing

2300
01:39:09,789 --> 01:39:14,380
terpenes and reincorporating after any

2301
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:17,980
kind of thermal treatment whatsoever

2302
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:19,930
because the most delicate of terpenes

2303
01:39:17,979 --> 01:39:22,839
which is the most delicate part of the

2304
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:25,000
fragrance will thermally rearrange or

2305
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:27,250
decompose and give you off flavors from

2306
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:35,020
what you've extracted so are there any

2307
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:37,390
secrets on that yes well yeah I've got

2308
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:41,020
nothing really fancy to offer me we are

2309
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:43,420
we're at home town sort of folks but we

2310
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:45,280
definitely don't just decarboxylate in

2311
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:48,220
and of and and let everything get lost

2312
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:50,619
out of the wall so your oven so we keep

2313
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:52,930
everything contains when we're

2314
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:55,779
decarboxylated and when we're doing our

2315
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:57,190
ethanol rinses we rinse the containers

2316
01:39:55,779 --> 01:39:59,050
that we decarboxylated and you can

2317
01:39:57,189 --> 01:40:01,059
actually see them build up on the

2318
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:04,180
surface of those things to integrate

2319
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:08,980
them back into the medicine that sounds

2320
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:11,050
kind of country doing it but we through

2321
01:40:08,979 --> 01:40:12,459
test results and through experience

2322
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:13,829
we've seen it makes a real difference

2323
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:17,109
that you can actually capture those

2324
01:40:13,829 --> 01:40:21,130
terpenes in the decarboxylation process

2325
01:40:17,109 --> 01:40:23,289
and then we rinsed the the containers

2326
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:25,480
and bags with the

2327
01:40:23,289 --> 01:40:28,029
alcohol to strip any terpenes that have

2328
01:40:25,479 --> 01:40:30,489
collected during that process otherwise

2329
01:40:28,029 --> 01:40:32,199
they just sort of all on the outside of

2330
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:35,590
your your oven wall or something like

2331
01:40:32,199 --> 01:40:38,019
that whatever your d curving it so do

2332
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:40,960
you recover your ethanol and then how

2333
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:43,570
many times do you use it before you you

2334
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:46,239
know don't use it anymore you keep on

2335
01:40:43,569 --> 01:40:49,689
using it no no it definitely loses

2336
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:51,460
something as you know I'm sure but what

2337
01:40:49,689 --> 01:40:53,949
we do is we kind of reconstitute it by

2338
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:55,930
adding in fresh as you go right and

2339
01:40:53,949 --> 01:40:57,609
keeping it's like a cycle that goes

2340
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:59,860
through it it allows it to stay pretty

2341
01:40:57,609 --> 01:41:01,920
fresh and then you're losing enough in

2342
01:40:59,859 --> 01:41:04,329
the soap and the rinse where you're not

2343
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,829
getting all of your alcohol back so

2344
01:41:04,329 --> 01:41:09,250
you're constantly having to add fresh

2345
01:41:05,829 --> 01:41:11,680
into it so we're constantly adding fresh

2346
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:13,720
alcohol into it so say we reclaim eighty

2347
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:16,450
percent then the next batch has twenty

2348
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:19,210
percent that is fresh and so on and we

2349
01:41:16,449 --> 01:41:21,819
haven't seen it once what is it that's

2350
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:24,220
extracted that fouls the ethanol right I

2351
01:41:21,819 --> 01:41:26,380
mean it's not a turkey that's a sugar or

2352
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:28,869
something like that or what makes the

2353
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:31,119
ethanol no good anymore and at that

2354
01:41:28,869 --> 01:41:33,789
point is it actually worth it to

2355
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:35,769
actually just buy a still and distill

2356
01:41:33,789 --> 01:41:37,840
that ethanol recovered because that's

2357
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:39,550
not you know could be damn expensive

2358
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:42,069
because it's controlled dangerous

2359
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:44,770
substance and you have to have a license

2360
01:41:42,069 --> 01:41:49,000
for it and a lot of people have to get

2361
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:51,910
paid to even this bio ethanol is a pain

2362
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:55,869
in the ass their supply chain you know

2363
01:41:51,909 --> 01:41:57,849
people that have their pockets open that

2364
01:41:55,869 --> 01:41:59,890
want to make a lot of money here but the

2365
01:41:57,850 --> 01:42:03,039
question I'm asking you is that so when

2366
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:05,320
you recover your ethanol you'll use it

2367
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:07,269
like maybe once twice or how many times

2368
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:12,189
can you use it to where no longer has

2369
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:14,140
good extraction rates organic you know

2370
01:42:12,189 --> 01:42:17,439
we gave it two hundred proof you have to

2371
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:18,940
drive a long way to get it but I guess

2372
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:21,039
we don't we're not throwing it out

2373
01:42:18,939 --> 01:42:23,710
because we're constantly making batches

2374
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:25,539
that it's just recycled through it so

2375
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:27,550
you know it's we're not seeing that lot

2376
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:30,039
so it's when we don't constantly add

2377
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:32,619
fresh in every single time that it goes

2378
01:42:30,039 --> 01:42:34,119
bad and I would you know that's a I wish

2379
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:36,710
I had the answer I gotta plead ignorance

2380
01:42:34,119 --> 01:42:38,908
there as to why

2381
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:40,560
brain around it I was hoping maybe you

2382
01:42:38,908 --> 01:42:43,189
guys could let me know as to what

2383
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,389
changes because it's still high-octane

2384
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:48,569
alcohol and ethanol when it comes out

2385
01:42:45,389 --> 01:42:50,940
but it it's just we've all experienced

2386
01:42:48,569 --> 01:42:52,250
it it's just it doesn't work and pull

2387
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:54,359
the same after a while

2388
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:55,859
so yeah we don't have that problem much

2389
01:42:54,359 --> 01:42:57,269
because we constantly add fresh hints

2390
01:42:55,859 --> 01:43:00,210
we're not necessarily dumping any out

2391
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:04,080
what we lose in the wash and in the soap

2392
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:07,948
it's enough volume is when we replace it

2393
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:10,590
with a clean fresh alcohol every time

2394
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:12,809
that we don't have the same problem you

2395
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:16,050
said you'd lost about 20 percent each

2396
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:19,469
run well I mean I'm generalizing but you

2397
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:20,909
know my medicine makers might be

2398
01:43:19,469 --> 01:43:22,500
watching this to enforce you got your

2399
01:43:20,908 --> 01:43:25,229
numbers all wrong and shaking their

2400
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:28,469
heads with me you know simplifying we

2401
01:43:25,229 --> 01:43:30,988
lose you note in the made say 10% 20%

2402
01:43:28,469 --> 01:43:34,050
each time and then we reconstitute

2403
01:43:30,988 --> 01:43:37,948
very material dependent in general right

2404
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:39,810
I mean yeah it's how many how dry was it

2405
01:43:37,948 --> 01:43:42,509
which that's a huge step as well then we

2406
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:45,480
could do a whole apps on our med making

2407
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:46,679
process which I'd be happy to do but you

2408
01:43:45,479 --> 01:43:48,479
know a lot of times when people are

2409
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:51,090
distilling or making doing ethanol

2410
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:53,339
washes they don't dry out the material

2411
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:54,869
enough I mean it's got to be well to the

2412
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:56,520
point where you think it's ruined right

2413
01:43:54,869 --> 01:43:58,260
you would never do it for cannabis that

2414
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:01,080
you were smoking like crumbling in your

2415
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:03,869
hands dry because it's the water that is

2416
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:05,550
gonna cause problems in there so you

2417
01:44:03,869 --> 01:44:07,800
know when you do that it's also doing

2418
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:10,079
then absorb a lot of alcohol so you

2419
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:12,289
definitely lose that's where you lose

2420
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:15,569
the majority of her alcoholism that step

2421
01:44:12,289 --> 01:44:19,260
where did we always we always used to

2422
01:44:15,569 --> 01:44:22,769
cater beep with Animus before we put it

2423
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:26,280
in with the alcohol I was gonna say you

2424
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:28,590
could you can freeze dry that some

2425
01:44:26,279 --> 01:44:36,988
product and you'd be surprised how it

2426
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:39,539
turned out indeed well it's all quite

2427
01:44:36,988 --> 01:44:41,519
interesting isn't it ways to make

2428
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:43,488
medicine or to acquire medicine that's

2429
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:46,920
already there let's be honest we're not

2430
01:44:43,488 --> 01:44:48,448
making anything we're just sort of well

2431
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,500
I look at it it's the same as you know

2432
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:51,449
we can grow

2433
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:53,640
cannabis and we can all grow the same

2434
01:44:51,449 --> 01:44:55,439
cannabis and there's a certain petition

2435
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:57,720
certain amount of people who ruin it

2436
01:44:55,439 --> 01:45:00,539
during that period and dry in process

2437
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:02,280
right so it's like how do we you know

2438
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:04,109
how do we just get the best the best

2439
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:06,329
process we can we can't all gonna end up

2440
01:45:04,109 --> 01:45:09,029
with something at the end of it but just

2441
01:45:06,329 --> 01:45:12,420
like everything how can we help the

2442
01:45:09,029 --> 01:45:14,399
plant maintain its full potential you

2443
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:16,079
know you don't see it very often at

2444
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:18,479
least I don't and I do see a lot of

2445
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:20,460
cannabis I saw some yesterday that I

2446
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:23,459
felt like wow this is some of the first

2447
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:26,640
cannabis in awhile that has expressed

2448
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:28,760
itself to its maximum potential it was

2449
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:32,130
just really covered in this beautiful

2450
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:35,100
beautiful coating of trichomes it smelt

2451
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:38,279
impeccable it felt like velour and it

2452
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:42,750
was just nice to see someone grow bud

2453
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:51,239
that is actually attuned to the infamous

2454
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:54,960
local BC brokerage term quads oh geez

2455
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:57,479
everyone's selling mid-grade schwag as

2456
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:59,069
quads this is the problem people are

2457
01:45:57,479 --> 01:46:00,659
using and throwing around words that

2458
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:03,149
aren't accurate and I like to be a bit

2459
01:46:00,659 --> 01:46:05,399
of a stickler and I'm I apologize for

2460
01:46:03,149 --> 01:46:07,589
come across as a dick because I do that

2461
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:10,469
that's all I was doing with saying that

2462
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:13,260
hash and oil are different otherwise

2463
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:14,789
they wouldn't have different names you

2464
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:18,050
know they're different processes they're

2465
01:46:14,789 --> 01:46:22,949
different and products they're great

2466
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:24,659
words matter I think so I think so what

2467
01:46:22,949 --> 01:46:26,639
our quads yeah but gabble well this is

2468
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:29,039
the way it happened in the 90s when I

2469
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:31,320
was involved in the game it didn't go as

2470
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:33,720
high it didn't go hot as high as quads

2471
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:36,479
it was triples and it was triples were

2472
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:38,520
triple A's a being the highest quality

2473
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:42,089
that you could get and triple-a being

2474
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:44,580
ridiculous quality so it's something

2475
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:46,260
they can just it's the trips you want

2476
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:47,670
the trips and then buddy brings you a 50

2477
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:50,730
pack of mushrooms and you're like no

2478
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:56,550
dude like okay I'll take the mushrooms

2479
01:46:50,729 --> 01:46:58,739
but it's the herb I wanted I've always

2480
01:46:56,550 --> 01:47:01,289
been a firm supporter of the mushroom

2481
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:03,149
the same way cannabis helped me change

2482
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:05,460
the way I think and look at things

2483
01:47:03,149 --> 01:47:08,069
differently I got an incredible amount

2484
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:09,929
of value from psychedelic mushrooms and

2485
01:47:08,069 --> 01:47:11,579
I wasn't really like eat a bunch and go

2486
01:47:09,929 --> 01:47:12,090
to fish shows although I did enough of

2487
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:14,519
that

2488
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:16,739
it was more like go and with like one or

2489
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:19,320
two people and really like go into the

2490
01:47:16,738 --> 01:47:21,988
trip lot learned an incredible amount

2491
01:47:19,319 --> 01:47:23,639
about myself and about kind of the world

2492
01:47:21,988 --> 01:47:26,579
in the way it works just through these

2493
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:28,800
experiences so I would never I would

2494
01:47:26,579 --> 01:47:31,619
never downplay psychedelic mushrooms I

2495
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:34,320
definitely feel that well you see people

2496
01:47:31,619 --> 01:47:38,059
now taking what are they taking it for

2497
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:51,869
is it low doses for PTSD and some other

2498
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:54,270
depression that Maps yeah you receive

2499
01:47:51,869 --> 01:47:56,519
amazing teachings through through

2500
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:59,010
psychedelics and through journeys that's

2501
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:01,469
why their journeys you can for sure I

2502
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:03,060
mean you can also have like the worst

2503
01:48:01,469 --> 01:48:04,560
experience ever depending on your

2504
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:07,409
setting and the people you're doing with

2505
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:09,929
it and your intentions but I always had

2506
01:48:07,408 --> 01:48:12,229
I was like Bill Hicks I was like I hate

2507
01:48:09,929 --> 01:48:16,380
to tell you I had a lot of fun on drugs

2508
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:18,269
no he does that little sort of I had a

2509
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:22,619
great time on psychedelic mushrooms I I

2510
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:25,710
think of them as definitely you know as

2511
01:48:22,619 --> 01:48:29,158
important as as that my views on

2512
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:31,529
cannabis are I I have a strong feeling

2513
01:48:29,158 --> 01:48:32,819
that psychedelic mushrooms will and not

2514
01:48:31,529 --> 01:48:35,488
just like you Dalek mushrooms but

2515
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:37,439
mushrooms as a whole will come to offer

2516
01:48:35,488 --> 01:48:39,299
you know more than we could have ever

2517
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:41,189
possibly imagined even though Paul

2518
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:43,529
Salmons is really blowing the lid off

2519
01:48:41,189 --> 01:48:46,019
this [ __ ] right now anyone wants to go

2520
01:48:43,529 --> 01:48:47,759
and watch a Paul Stamets video this

2521
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:49,730
particular one how mushrooms can save

2522
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:52,230
the world that this book is based on

2523
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:55,139
which I think originally was one of his

2524
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:57,448
TED talks and it was like I think it was

2525
01:48:55,140 --> 01:49:00,750
called six ways mushrooms can save the

2526
01:48:57,448 --> 01:49:03,119
world definitely standing ovations type

2527
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:04,948
[ __ ] I would love to have Paul on hash

2528
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:06,779
Church one day it would be amazing if

2529
01:49:04,948 --> 01:49:08,219
anyone knew how to reach out to Paul I

2530
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:11,189
could reach out to him he definitely

2531
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:12,960
would be he I mean his time is of the

2532
01:49:11,189 --> 01:49:16,159
essence at the moment so his work is

2533
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:18,050
ready he loves you know kite

2534
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:20,149
cannabis and the psychoactive he's

2535
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:22,400
totally that's the beautiful thing about

2536
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:24,349
pollen we've spent days with him and

2537
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:28,279
I've even done the Cortez workshop with

2538
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:30,829

01:49:30,829 --> 01:49:36,470
Country Fair late night see it down in

2541
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:38,210
the early morning Lucas that book is an

2542
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:39,650
accumulation of all of this work and

2543
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:41,600
everything that he's been doing along

2544
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:43,250
with his crew cuz it's it's Paul Davis

2545
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,370
but it's his crew and everyone that

2546
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:50,029
works fungi perspective for perfect

2547
01:49:46,369 --> 01:49:52,099
sorry in Olympia and and is why his wife

2548
01:49:50,029 --> 01:49:53,809
is partner and they're all just on a

2549
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:56,440
high level and it's really amazing what

2550
01:49:53,810 --> 01:50:03,320
they're doing they're all along with

2551
01:49:56,439 --> 01:50:04,849
yeah yeah I I got to sort of play a

2552
01:50:03,319 --> 01:50:07,939
little trick on Paul at one of the

2553
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:09,650
psychedelic symposiums that were up in

2554
01:50:07,939 --> 01:50:11,509
Whistler very small gatherings the

2555
01:50:09,649 --> 01:50:14,599
psychedelic family much smaller than the

2556
01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:17,329
canvas family but he walked by my booth

2557
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:19,610
and I I had a picture of a trichome like

2558
01:50:17,329 --> 01:50:21,500
I think it was from you Dumas the Dutch

2559
01:50:19,609 --> 01:50:25,339
photographer that used the micro

2560
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:27,020
electrons microscope microscopy I can't

2561
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:28,880
even pronounce it anyway he had this

2562
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:31,610
incredible still to this day one of the

2563
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,319
greatest tricone shots ever taken and I

2564
01:50:31,609 --> 01:50:36,289
showed it to Paul and I said can you

2565
01:50:33,319 --> 01:50:38,829
identify this mushroom and it just

2566
01:50:36,289 --> 01:50:41,449
stopped him in his tracks he was like

2567
01:50:38,829 --> 01:50:43,189
looking at it all intently and after

2568
01:50:41,449 --> 01:50:45,260
about a minute I said ah you know it's

2569
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:48,079
it's a it's a trichome it's a glandular

2570
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:51,579
trichomes from a cannabis plant and he

2571
01:50:48,079 --> 01:50:53,809
was just like man you had me stumped

2572
01:50:51,579 --> 01:50:56,840
yeah you're never gonna figure this one

2573
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:58,370
out it's not really what kind of

2574
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:01,520
mushroom is oh my god it's translucent

2575
01:50:58,369 --> 01:51:04,340
mushroom what's happening here like it's

2576
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:06,650
lit up I'm like oh yeah it's so it looks

2577
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:09,199
so big - it was a full-page picture of a

2578
01:51:06,649 --> 01:51:11,179
full you couldn't really tell it was

2579
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:13,639
small he was probably thinking it was

2580
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:15,770
like you know much bigger than it was

2581
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:19,430
you should've photoshopped it to look

2582
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:21,320
like it was bruised and blue yeah that

2583
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:23,150
would have been it right there yeah I

2584
01:51:21,319 --> 01:51:25,489
found these on my property they're about

2585
01:51:23,149 --> 01:51:28,629
the size of ants when you eat the entire

2586
01:51:25,489 --> 01:51:32,408
world just splits open

2587
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:34,659
and light casts shadow that creates a

2588
01:51:32,408 --> 01:51:37,059
language that you've learned

2589
01:51:34,658 --> 01:51:38,379
instantaneously upon seeing hey Tony

2590
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:40,920
we're going deep we're talking about

2591
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:45,969
psychedelics what's going on dude

2592
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:47,949
there's also with I was just saying to

2593
01:51:45,969 --> 01:51:49,539
invite anyone that knew Paul Stamets to

2594
01:51:47,948 --> 01:51:50,529
invite him into hash Church because man

2595
01:51:49,539 --> 01:51:53,019
wouldn't we love to have that

2596
01:51:50,529 --> 01:51:56,979
conversation and our friends at

2597
01:51:53,020 --> 01:52:00,690
dragonfly Madison we know we'll invite

2598
01:51:56,979 --> 01:52:05,289
them how are things with you Tony

2599
01:52:00,689 --> 01:52:07,988
good man just been some all-nighters

2600
01:52:05,289 --> 01:52:10,569
trying to figure out all kinds of little

2601
01:52:07,988 --> 01:52:16,329
technical things but I'm good how about

2602
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:19,569
you guys it is today my son's third

2603
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:23,439
birthday so I and the only reason I'm

2604
01:52:19,569 --> 01:52:25,329
really not kind of not doing hash Church

2605
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:27,399
is because he's sick right now so he's

2606
01:52:25,329 --> 01:52:30,579
just sleeping it's not feeling good he's

2607
01:52:27,399 --> 01:52:32,710
got a fever and he's just been sick for

2608
01:52:30,579 --> 01:52:36,519
like three days so it's a bummer

2609
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:39,100
you just hate when kids get sick it's no

2610
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:41,650
good usually means you'll get sick sin

2611
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:43,600
I'm not you know what as a parent it's

2612
01:52:41,649 --> 01:52:45,849
like whatever I mean I'll take the guy

2613
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:50,079
would take his sickness in the blink of

2614
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:54,480
an eye times 10 yeah but it's how they

2615
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:56,800
build immune systems so you just just

2616
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:59,468
that they're on the right path and that

2617
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:06,010
the fever is doing the good work instead

2618
01:52:59,469 --> 01:53:08,500
of the bad work well I can tell you I

2619
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:12,670
made a post about this earlier in the

2620
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:14,529
week this is the cbn this yeah there's

2621
01:53:12,670 --> 01:53:16,239
something there actually yes on that

2622
01:53:14,529 --> 01:53:22,029
post it looks ridiculous

2623
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:25,589
I should say it's CBN and CBC so but

2624
01:53:22,029 --> 01:53:27,698
mostly cbn is this someone you saw the

2625
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:32,260
color-changing happening with is this

2626
01:53:27,698 --> 01:53:34,269
that Wow yeah it goes clear I mean it's

2627
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:39,610
pretty clear just in that giant jar it

2628
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:42,369
looked yellow but my first experience I

2629
01:53:39,609 --> 01:53:49,688
was gonna load a pen but my first

2630
01:53:42,368 --> 01:53:53,558
was on Friday night and I'm gonna make

2631
01:53:49,689 --> 01:53:55,199
some some claims here about CBN because

2632
01:53:53,559 --> 01:53:56,579
I don't think we've had a lot of

2633
01:53:55,198 --> 01:54:04,259
experience

2634
01:53:56,578 --> 01:54:08,078
vaporizing full concentrates of CBN but

2635
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:11,168
had a couple people try it interesting

2636
01:54:08,078 --> 01:54:15,158
enough I think that you know that kind

2637
01:54:11,168 --> 01:54:17,578
of forgetfulness Spacey head kind of

2638
01:54:15,158 --> 01:54:20,648
feeling that you get when you smoke a

2639
01:54:17,578 --> 01:54:23,139
joint or your smokes an older herb that

2640
01:54:20,649 --> 01:54:25,809
kind of couch lock feeling that you you

2641
01:54:23,139 --> 01:54:29,828
kind of get we all kind of think of like

2642
01:54:25,809 --> 01:54:34,929
CBN but the space enos like when you hit

2643
01:54:29,828 --> 01:54:36,728
it it like it kind of I could see why I

2644
01:54:34,929 --> 01:54:38,498
would help I could see why I went to

2645
01:54:36,729 --> 01:54:41,949
sleep and slept so well on Friday night

2646
01:54:38,498 --> 01:54:44,198
but it kind of I don't know it kind of

2647
01:54:41,948 --> 01:54:47,978
makes you forget about what you're

2648
01:54:44,198 --> 01:54:50,648
thinking about and then you know you

2649
01:54:47,979 --> 01:54:54,969
sure I wonder if that's cbn or a lack of

2650
01:54:50,649 --> 01:54:57,369
pining I don't know I I mixed this with

2651
01:54:54,969 --> 01:55:00,069
Clementine terpenes just to give it some

2652
01:54:57,368 --> 01:55:02,529
kind of modulation effect so it could

2653
01:55:00,069 --> 01:55:08,408
play in effect but I mean it was like

2654
01:55:02,529 --> 01:55:12,398
this I smoked it I didn't COFF and it

2655
01:55:08,408 --> 01:55:14,198
kind of like I wouldn't say the

2656
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:16,959
forgetfulness comes from a but like when

2657
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:18,219
you kind of you almost like loss for

2658
01:55:16,958 --> 01:55:19,510
words a little bit you're sure it's kind

2659
01:55:18,219 --> 01:55:21,788
of like uh it's kind of strange I'm a

2660
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:24,070
little Spacey and then you're like you

2661
01:55:21,788 --> 01:55:27,038
know maybe you can't pronounce words or

2662
01:55:24,069 --> 01:55:29,738
like anything right away I wouldn't say

2663
01:55:27,038 --> 01:55:32,139
it's kind of that drastic but it's it's

2664
01:55:29,738 --> 01:55:34,268
like my mind was wound up and I was

2665
01:55:32,139 --> 01:55:36,639
talking a whole bunch and I hit that it

2666
01:55:34,269 --> 01:55:38,939
definitely silences you do you like I

2667
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:42,729
remember because you were talking to me

2668
01:55:38,939 --> 01:55:46,059
yeah okay yeah I was talking to you like

2669
01:55:42,729 --> 01:55:52,820
a million miles an hour and then you

2670
01:55:46,059 --> 01:55:57,970
were like you were like okay yeah

2671
01:55:52,819 --> 01:56:01,670
yeah kind of yeah [ __ ] golf shoes

2672
01:55:57,970 --> 01:56:03,440
well and I didn't talk and I didn't and

2673
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:05,720
I was like oh that's strange and it had

2674
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:08,299
and I may be just a delta aid or the CBC

2675
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:09,949
but there was this like delayed effect

2676
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:12,440
it was just kind of like okay kind of

2677
01:56:09,949 --> 01:56:16,639
calm me down but then I started to yawn

2678
01:56:12,439 --> 01:56:21,129
and I got tired and then I slept for ten

2679
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:24,440
hours so for sure it helps with sleeping

2680
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:26,900
for sure it calms your mind and I could

2681
01:56:24,439 --> 01:56:29,599
see like for PTSD and for different

2682
01:56:26,899 --> 01:56:33,739
things it helps you forget and that's

2683
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:36,320
not a bad thing no that's not a bad

2684
01:56:33,739 --> 01:56:39,109
thing so I do you think you got and how

2685
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:41,590
did you feel the next morning oh I

2686
01:56:39,109 --> 01:56:44,210
didn't feel anything in the head I don't

2687
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:46,730
hear anything the next morning no no I

2688
01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:50,180
smoked some right now it's not gonna

2689
01:56:46,729 --> 01:56:54,379
help but and then I just woke up so

2690
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:55,940
let's see but it's definitely unusual I

2691
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:59,329
definitely think it could go in a pen

2692
01:56:55,939 --> 01:57:01,219
with Clementine terpenes or any other

2693
01:56:59,329 --> 01:57:04,250
terpenes paired with it it's really nice

2694
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:08,170
it doesn't taste like cherry at all

2695
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:12,859
there's no cherry taste to it there's no

2696
01:57:08,170 --> 01:57:16,670
it's very medicinal it's not it doesn't

2697
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:18,229
have like your normal I don't know it

2698
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:20,449
doesn't have any kind of cherry taste it

2699
01:57:18,229 --> 01:57:22,759
doesn't and it's absolutely clean on the

2700
01:57:20,449 --> 01:57:24,710
nail I mean there's I'll show to you

2701
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:28,930
there's nothing there's absolutely

2702
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:31,189
nothing so I'll show to you let's see

2703
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:34,610
she's clean on the nail

2704
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:36,349
clean clean mine let's show you nice you

2705
01:57:34,609 --> 01:57:38,659
had Napa Valley's like Tony's gonna fall

2706
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:44,570
asleep on stream look at look at this

2707
01:57:38,659 --> 01:57:49,760
stuff can you see this yes you can see

2708
01:57:44,569 --> 01:57:54,739
that right he was doing it just 30 more

2709
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:56,840
minutes it is making me tired

2710
01:57:54,739 --> 01:57:59,239
that's like nerd porn for you know

2711
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:03,880
cannabis science junkies right there

2712
01:57:59,239 --> 01:58:05,679
I mean it's pretty ridiculous

2713
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:11,050
it was testing

2714
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:13,360
like close to 50% CBN and like I was

2715
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:15,550
quite a bit of CBC in it I have to look

2716
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:27,819
at that again but don't they there's no

2717
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:31,329
thca or THC in it the other 50% the

2718
01:58:27,819 --> 01:58:35,049
other 50% is roundup yeah roundup

2719
01:58:31,329 --> 01:58:40,899
yeah it's roundup CBN News bubbleman pit

2720
01:58:35,050 --> 01:58:43,110
look how much vapor I get no cough and

2721
01:58:40,899 --> 01:58:46,329
normally Eickhoff you guys all know that

2722
01:58:43,109 --> 01:58:48,909
so I know CBN doesn't work that way

2723
01:58:46,329 --> 01:58:51,159
because it's a byproduct of THC but it's

2724
01:58:48,909 --> 01:58:54,430
the rest of the components are they

2725
01:58:51,159 --> 01:58:58,510
activated in their acidic form with as

2726
01:58:54,430 --> 01:59:01,480
clear as it is you know well I think I

2727
01:58:58,510 --> 01:59:05,260
posted the test result on on the capsule

2728
01:59:01,479 --> 01:59:07,869
the capsule kind of shows you when but

2729
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:11,770
that has CBD in it so I'll post a

2730
01:59:07,869 --> 01:59:13,899
regular one so the thing with it and

2731
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:16,180
mark it probably like like this and so

2732
01:59:13,899 --> 01:59:17,799
if you take and the first time they

2733
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:21,250
started testing and if you take like the

2734
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:24,310
pure cbn extract and take like you know

2735
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:27,789
a concentrate of it it's off the GC it's

2736
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:31,330
like off the scale so you know diluting

2737
01:59:27,789 --> 01:59:33,970
it four times before you test it gives

2738
01:59:31,329 --> 01:59:36,729
you a much more accurate reading I'm not

2739
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:40,960
really sure what the rest of it is mark

2740
01:59:36,729 --> 01:59:46,389
as it's as clear as can be you could see

2741
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:49,140
it on the side how thick it is but yeah

2742
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:54,460
I don't know it's not like this is build

2743
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:56,770
this was molecularly distilled mm-hmm

2744
01:59:54,460 --> 02:00:01,810
yeah so something that's distilled I

2745
01:59:56,770 --> 02:00:04,450
mean if if it is about 50% one thing and

2746
02:00:01,810 --> 02:00:09,039
50% something else I mean typically a

2747
02:00:04,449 --> 02:00:12,569
distillation it was a 90 it was 90% it

2748
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:17,229
was a 90 percent THC with all the THC oh

2749
02:00:12,569 --> 02:00:19,569
it was not okay so say say that again I

2750
02:00:17,229 --> 02:00:21,819
thought you said it was 50%

2751
02:00:19,569 --> 02:00:24,279
you see so check this out you could do

2752
02:00:21,819 --> 02:00:26,259
this with rosin or distillate so if you

2753
02:00:24,279 --> 02:00:28,329
did it with rosin right and you made it

2754
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:31,989
and we've done this with we've made a

2755
02:00:28,329 --> 02:00:36,300
distillation from rosin which you'll

2756
02:00:31,989 --> 02:00:39,639
lose about thirty percent of your weight

2757
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:41,710
in terpenes and fats and other [ __ ]

2758
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:45,730
from the hash rosin you could get to

2759
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:47,619
like a ninety percent activated THC you

2760
02:00:45,729 --> 02:00:51,459
could do that also from distillate so if

2761
02:00:47,619 --> 02:00:55,029
you're molecularly distilling and you if

2762
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:58,210
you start with a 85 or 90 percent THC

2763
02:00:55,029 --> 02:00:59,289
you could also start with THC a which is

2764
02:00:58,210 --> 02:01:00,579
something I don't know if you guys

2765
02:00:59,289 --> 02:01:02,380
talked about today but I definitely

2766
02:01:00,579 --> 02:01:05,619
wanted to put the instructions up and

2767
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:08,230
get people on the THC a tip of how to do

2768
02:01:05,619 --> 02:01:09,340
that you could start with a couple

2769
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:11,199
different things but ultimate if you

2770
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:14,289
start with THC a you got to convert it

2771
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:17,019
to THC and that's pretty easy to do in a

2772
02:01:14,289 --> 02:01:19,479
rosin as well you could you could take a

2773
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:21,490
hash rosin you could double boil that

2774
02:01:19,479 --> 02:01:24,339
you can gently and slowly activate it

2775
02:01:21,489 --> 02:01:26,409
from THC to THC then you could make a

2776
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:29,110
distillation from it if you had enough

2777
02:01:26,409 --> 02:01:31,750
of it once you get to 90% though and

2778
02:01:29,109 --> 02:01:34,479
you've cleaned up what's supposed to be

2779
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:37,180
any of the you know contaminants and

2780
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:40,569
stuff left behind then the process that

2781
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:44,860
we do not necessarily mind to share with

2782
02:01:40,569 --> 02:01:50,189
but it does it then does not use your

2783
02:01:44,859 --> 02:01:53,469
traditional heat and distillation

2784
02:01:50,189 --> 02:01:56,589
methods it uses a completely different

2785
02:01:53,470 --> 02:02:00,070
method when which does not lose any

2786
02:01:56,590 --> 02:02:01,779
weight so we would go from 90 so if

2787
02:02:00,069 --> 02:02:06,309
something you start with a kilo of 90

2788
02:02:01,779 --> 02:02:11,469
percent THC you end up with 900 and you

2789
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:15,700
know 80 950 grams very little is lost in

2790
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:17,369
the process if any and de COEs it's a

2791
02:02:15,699 --> 02:02:21,729
more a little bit more than a 50%

2792
02:02:17,369 --> 02:02:25,059
conversion without a volume loss it's

2793
02:02:21,729 --> 02:02:27,489
pretty pretty substantially crazy I

2794
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:29,470
didn't really believe it until it's a

2795
02:02:27,489 --> 02:02:32,539
50% conversion that means you still have

2796
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:36,320
50 percent THC

2797
02:02:32,539 --> 02:02:38,899
nope that goes away well 50% conversion

2798
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:39,439
only 50% of it is converting it well I'm

2799
02:02:38,899 --> 02:02:42,170
sorry

2800
02:02:39,439 --> 02:02:46,250
you go from 90% then we ended up around

2801
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:49,670
48 to 50 percent CBN with no THC present

2802
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:51,529
left so is it just alright mark well

2803
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:53,300
here you go explain that is that just

2804
02:02:51,529 --> 02:02:54,949
the breakdown of the molecule itself

2805
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:57,980
I understand those numbers don't add up

2806
02:02:54,949 --> 02:03:01,220
to me so I'm know that's really simple

2807
02:02:57,979 --> 02:03:03,109
it means that there was a hundred

2808
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:08,150
percent conversion but the yield was

2809
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:14,089
only 50 percent so okay so I will tell

2810
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:16,849
you this there are okay so if you start

2811
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:18,619
with a kilo that's testing 86 percent or

2812
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:22,430
eight hundred and sixty milligrams and

2813
02:03:18,619 --> 02:03:26,840
you end up with 500 milligrams of CBN it

2814
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:29,119
appears that the CBC was a I don't know

2815
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:30,920
if there's a converted by-product but

2816
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:35,899
there was high levels of CBC that were

2817
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:38,119
not there before so that doesn't make

2818
02:03:35,899 --> 02:03:40,639
any sense at all to me that's crazy

2819
02:03:38,119 --> 02:03:43,849
yeah that's all any sense because you

2820
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:48,800
need you need a synthase to convert to

2821
02:03:43,850 --> 02:03:51,770
convert CBC into either CBD or or THC

2822
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:54,170
and that requires there's electrons to

2823
02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:55,640
require there so your there's chemistry

2824
02:03:54,170 --> 02:03:57,800
going on there that doesn't make sense

2825
02:03:55,640 --> 02:04:00,320
to me you shouldn't have seen me see in

2826
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:03,260
there if there wasn't to begin with

2827
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:06,289
actually it really doesn't make sense we

2828
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:08,480
we did a lot of work on CBC varieties

2829
02:04:06,289 --> 02:04:10,279
and develop varieties that where the

2830
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:14,029
majority of the cannabinoids in the

2831
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:16,130
plant were CBC oh let me see if CBC was

2832
02:04:14,029 --> 02:04:19,750
in the original starting low hon second

2833
02:04:16,130 --> 02:04:22,850
I took a picture of the test-score

2834
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:25,220
my piece might be talking out my ass

2835
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:27,380
hold on a second rooster Tony is this

2836
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:29,180
the same process where you saw the

2837
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:32,210
color-changing effects based on

2838
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:35,390
temperature it's just the same this has

2839
02:04:32,210 --> 02:04:36,619
nothing like the temperature I thought

2840
02:04:35,390 --> 02:04:38,539
the post said it was due to the

2841
02:04:36,619 --> 02:04:40,369
temperature it was changing colors oh no

2842
02:04:38,539 --> 02:04:42,109
if you just take the if you just take

2843
02:04:40,369 --> 02:04:44,510
that oil at the end and warm it up it

2844
02:04:42,109 --> 02:04:46,279
goes clear now I thought what you were

2845
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:48,320
doing is you were starting with the tea

2846
02:04:46,279 --> 02:04:52,340
see isolate and you were converting it

2847
02:04:48,319 --> 02:04:55,340
to CBN to make a something that's 50

2848
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:58,039
percent by weight CBN I thought that's

2849
02:04:55,340 --> 02:05:00,860
what he said you were doing yeah no this

2850
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:03,439
is imagine you start with like 1200

2851
02:05:00,859 --> 02:05:07,269
grams of hash rosin you end up with a

2852
02:05:03,439 --> 02:05:10,699
thousand grams of rosin distillate just

2853
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:13,340
without alcohol you just you fraction a

2854
02:05:10,699 --> 02:05:15,979
tin and then this is high THC a high THC

2855
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:18,110
variety yeah I mean the rosin is like

2856
02:05:15,979 --> 02:05:19,879
80% as it is and you get it to 90 and

2857
02:05:18,109 --> 02:05:23,059
you remove all the terpenes and all the

2858
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:26,600
[ __ ] right and then see what you

2859
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:29,360
find this and then the same way it

2860
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:38,170
doesn't change weight it just converts

2861
02:05:29,359 --> 02:05:45,439
all of that THC to from a 90% to 46% CBN

2862
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:46,940
and then there's 56% of nothing so there

2863
02:05:45,439 --> 02:05:49,129
are two different molecules with two

2864
02:05:46,939 --> 02:05:52,939
different molecular weights and so to go

2865
02:05:49,130 --> 02:05:56,029
from THC to CBN you basically have to

2866
02:05:52,939 --> 02:05:58,159
move lose two moles of hydrogen right

2867
02:05:56,029 --> 02:06:02,869
and that's an ad e hydrogenation process

2868
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:04,760
to caramelize the North ring of THC when

2869
02:06:02,869 --> 02:06:06,349
you're looking at the chicken wire north

2870
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:09,770
rate will now look like a benzene ring

2871
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:12,650
because it'll now be fully unsaturated

2872
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:16,460
so in that process you have to lose two

2873
02:06:12,649 --> 02:06:19,219
moles of h2 so it's different in

2874
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:22,279
molecular weight I mean just like THC a

2875
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:24,650
and THC are different so what you're

2876
02:06:22,279 --> 02:06:28,219
extracting in the rosin process is first

2877
02:06:24,649 --> 02:06:32,559
like THC a and that's carboxylated to

2878
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:35,840
make THC and undergoes this d

2879
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:37,580
hydrogenation reaction to make cbn so

2880
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,800
that's what's going on and it seems like

2881
02:06:37,579 --> 02:06:42,340
you just have a distribution of all

2882
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:44,750
either cannabinoid acids that have been

2883
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:48,199
decarboxylated and now partially

2884
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:49,939
converted over to cbn and then that

2885
02:06:48,199 --> 02:06:52,819
partial conversion there could also be

2886
02:06:49,939 --> 02:06:55,609
what's called dye hydro you know so you

2887
02:06:52,819 --> 02:06:57,439
have tetrahydrocannabinol you have what

2888
02:06:55,609 --> 02:06:58,589
I make when I hydrogenate which is

2889
02:06:57,439 --> 02:07:01,769
hexahydrate

2890
02:06:58,590 --> 02:07:03,900
hydro no double bond at all naturally in

2891
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:06,600
the plant tetra hydro then there's die

2892
02:07:03,899 --> 02:07:08,939
hydro which is with two double bonds and

2893
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:11,250
then it's thermodynamically downhill to

2894
02:07:08,939 --> 02:07:13,649
lose that last mole of hydrogen to make

2895
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:17,369
CBN so yeah you'll have everything

2896
02:07:13,649 --> 02:07:20,210
populated along that profile it probably

2897
02:07:17,369 --> 02:07:22,949
depends on if they're using some type of

2898
02:07:20,210 --> 02:07:26,430
coax in Anor what type of oxidation

2899
02:07:22,949 --> 02:07:29,760
procedures are using no oxygen okay no

2900
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:31,909
gin so this is so no heat or oxygen so

2901
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:34,079
that's the only thing I could do but

2902
02:07:31,909 --> 02:07:37,109
because you need something to overcome

2903
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:41,189
the activation energy barrier between

2904
02:07:37,109 --> 02:07:43,349
there and there well it's like I said is

2905
02:07:41,189 --> 02:07:48,149
not really my process to share it was

2906
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:49,440
co-developed but it's all I can tell you

2907
02:07:48,149 --> 02:07:55,019
is that it sounds like it needs

2908
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:57,359
improvement well it's only a 50% yield

2909
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:59,640
what are you talking about so here's

2910
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:02,210
here's okay so here's how I'm current

2911
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:05,100
here here's how I was currently doing it

2912
02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:07,409
taking sift farmers grade sift and

2913
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:10,800
putting it into a chamber that has heat

2914
02:08:07,409 --> 02:08:14,460
and oxygen for degradation for a week at

2915
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:18,449
a time to get to convert from 250

2916
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:21,750
milligrams of let's say THC a right in a

2917
02:08:18,449 --> 02:08:24,389
sip form down to 70 milligrams of CBN

2918
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:28,739
and if I started with a kilo of sift I

2919
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:30,660
end up losing like the weight of the

2920
02:08:28,739 --> 02:08:33,689
kief that isn't a thousand grams when I

2921
02:08:30,659 --> 02:08:38,069
get it back it's like you know five 600

2922
02:08:33,689 --> 02:08:39,569
grams and I also lost the maybe not

2923
02:08:38,069 --> 02:08:43,710
maybe not quite that much what I'm

2924
02:08:39,569 --> 02:08:46,109
losing like seventy plus percent in the

2925
02:08:43,710 --> 02:08:48,210
conversion doing it that way with heat

2926
02:08:46,109 --> 02:08:50,460
and oxygen what I'm saying to you now is

2927
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:55,470
when I have a kilo of rosin or

2928
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:57,600
distillate I get the same kilo back and

2929
02:08:55,470 --> 02:09:00,000
the conversion rate is extremely well

2930
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:03,329
I'm happy with a 50 percent conversion

2931
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,640
rate and no volume no weight loss you

2932
02:09:03,329 --> 02:09:07,409
know what I mean right but this is where

2933
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:09,470
I'm having a difficult time following

2934
02:09:07,409 --> 02:09:12,389
Tony so if you're only getting 50%

2935
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:15,600
conversion and that means

2936
02:09:12,390 --> 02:09:17,760
in in your muscle have you thought any

2937
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:19,490
way to convert it at a better rate from

2938
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,260
THC to CBN

2939
02:09:19,489 --> 02:09:24,389
no no hold on a second or so there's no

2940
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:25,949
no I'm not trying I'm not trying to make

2941
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:28,650
CBM but I'm just trying to understand

2942
02:09:25,949 --> 02:09:30,750
what your what your you're holding up in

2943
02:09:28,649 --> 02:09:33,779
the jar so if what you're saying is that

2944
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:36,199
you're only getting 50% conversion and

2945
02:09:33,779 --> 02:09:39,569
does that mean the other 50% that's not

2946
02:09:36,199 --> 02:09:43,380
converting does that stay is THC you say

2947
02:09:39,569 --> 02:09:44,519
that there's no no see so so what's the

2948
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:46,619
other 50%

2949
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:50,460
I'm just true oh yeah no I'm with you

2950
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:52,109
because the other the and the labs also

2951
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:53,489
having kind of a hard time testing so

2952
02:09:52,109 --> 02:09:57,239
we've tested this like four different

2953
02:09:53,489 --> 02:09:59,550
ways what I can tell you is when I when

2954
02:09:57,239 --> 02:10:03,029
we mixed everything and we said okay

2955
02:09:59,550 --> 02:10:06,270
here's our final capsule with CBD oil in

2956
02:10:03,029 --> 02:10:12,029
it - we were the only thing in it was

2957
02:10:06,270 --> 02:10:14,460
CBD CBN Delta a and CBC in the original

2958
02:10:12,029 --> 02:10:16,109
oil let me see if I could find it let me

2959
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:18,630
see hold on I'm gonna find it right now

2960
02:10:16,109 --> 02:10:21,960
I'll tell you exactly what exactly was

2961
02:10:18,630 --> 02:10:25,529
in it did they look for Delta Aid yeah

2962
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:28,380
they look for nothing huh cool no no no

2963
02:10:25,529 --> 02:10:31,259
this is SC Labs this is this this went

2964
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:32,989
through a lot of different testing on I

2965
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:43,520
wouldn't put it out there if it didn't

2966
02:10:32,989 --> 02:10:43,519
let's see here okay okay was this one

2967
02:10:45,529 --> 02:10:50,429
yeah so as a chemist you know again if I

2968
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:51,420
ever realized holy there was 50 percent

2969
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:53,700
completion

2970
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:56,069
I want that reaction to go to a 100

2971
02:10:53,699 --> 02:10:58,769
percent completion so that that's what I

2972
02:10:56,069 --> 02:11:02,009
mean in terms of the opportunity to take

2973
02:10:58,770 --> 02:11:03,780
wait here figure out how to push it the

2974
02:11:02,010 --> 02:11:07,050
rest of the 50 percent but go ahead

2975
02:11:03,779 --> 02:11:10,469
known okay maybe I'm saying it wrong it

2976
02:11:07,050 --> 02:11:13,650
converts all of the THC to CBN but the

2977
02:11:10,470 --> 02:11:16,880
rate at which it converts it is about 50

2978
02:11:13,649 --> 02:11:19,500
percent of what it started with

2979
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:21,539
so I'll get let me read you what was in

2980
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:23,489
the starting oil okay so that's not

2981
02:11:21,539 --> 02:11:26,050
changing some of it's changing into

2982
02:11:23,489 --> 02:11:28,239
right but rate when you say the rate

2983
02:11:26,050 --> 02:11:31,360
rate is a measure of how fast the

2984
02:11:28,239 --> 02:11:33,039
reaction is no I think what attorney

2985
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:35,319
correct me if I'm wrong here you have

2986
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:38,199
essentially the same volume at the end

2987
02:11:35,319 --> 02:11:41,019
but instead of it at 90% concentration

2988
02:11:38,199 --> 02:11:43,210
the THC was all the THC is gone you have

2989
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:45,190
the same volume but you have a 50

2990
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:50,829
percent concentration assuming it

2991
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:53,199
correct right so what's the other right

2992
02:11:50,829 --> 02:11:53,859
that I would love to know so that's why

2993
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:56,619
I'm asking you

2994
02:11:53,859 --> 02:11:59,289
so let me tell you what was in it try to

2995
02:11:56,619 --> 02:12:02,529
figure it out because it is mind blowing

2996
02:11:59,289 --> 02:12:05,079
I've been blown away for about two

2997
02:12:02,529 --> 02:12:08,800
months now working on this and so okay

2998
02:12:05,079 --> 02:12:10,689
the starting the starting oil this is

2999
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:13,239
all through se labs so this was tested

3000
02:12:10,689 --> 02:12:14,829
twice you know just to make sure but

3001
02:12:13,239 --> 02:12:16,179
let's say the start the starting oil was

3002
02:12:14,829 --> 02:12:20,640
82

3003
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:25,450
so it was an 82 percent THC no Delta 8

3004
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:28,510
there was 5 there was okay so is eighty

3005
02:12:25,449 --> 02:12:37,239
two point four six THC it was point five

3006
02:12:28,510 --> 02:12:43,119
seven th cv 1.19 CBC 1.43 CBG 0.57 cbn

3007
02:12:37,239 --> 02:12:47,439
0.22 CBD and point two six CBD a when it

3008
02:12:43,119 --> 02:12:49,949
came out the only thing it had on a

3009
02:12:47,439 --> 02:12:49,949
second

3010
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:56,800
the okay here it is now here when it

3011
02:12:52,689 --> 02:13:04,210
came back out it had no more THC no more

3012
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:08,980
THC a no CBD no CBD a it had 400 plus

3013
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:10,090
like 460 milligrams of cbn no CBD v no

3014
02:13:08,979 --> 02:13:16,119
CBD VA

3015
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:18,069
no CBG no CBG a no THC v forty to forty

3016
02:13:16,119 --> 02:13:23,050
two milligrams of delta eight and

3017
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:27,519
seventy seven milligrams of CBC so it's

3018
02:13:23,050 --> 02:13:30,820
over fifty 50 milligrams and of that was

3019
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:32,530
it looks like ten percent of it or 20

3020
02:13:30,819 --> 02:13:35,199
percent of it was CBC and ten percent

3021
02:13:32,529 --> 02:13:38,170
was Delta eight then I put that into a

3022
02:13:35,199 --> 02:13:39,819
capsule to dilute it to get with CBD oil

3023
02:13:38,170 --> 02:13:46,649
to try to make our piece

3024
02:13:39,819 --> 02:13:49,479
or on and that came out too that had oh

3025
02:13:46,649 --> 02:13:53,348
those rolling home that one came out too

3026
02:13:49,479 --> 02:13:56,259
I got that one over here okay that one

3027
02:13:53,349 --> 02:13:59,110
came out too no THC no THC a which is

3028
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:59,800
fine our CBD that was in there was 44

3029
02:13:59,109 --> 02:14:03,250
milligrams

3030
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:06,310
no CBD a then it was 35 milligrams of

3031
02:14:03,250 --> 02:14:09,460
CBN no other components except six

3032
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:12,280
milligrams of C Delta 8 and 21

3033
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:15,789
milligrams of CBC now capsules a half a

3034
02:14:12,279 --> 02:14:18,550
gram and that lines up with exactly the

3035
02:14:15,789 --> 02:14:21,158
oil numbers of the CBN so that actually

3036
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:23,349
all does line up but what I'm saying to

3037
02:14:21,158 --> 02:14:28,059
you is CBC was not that much prevalent

3038
02:14:23,349 --> 02:14:30,250
so perhaps what I'm I don't know where

3039
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:33,520
all the CBC came from if what you're

3040
02:14:30,250 --> 02:14:38,529
saying is that when you convert THC to

3041
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:41,219
see me n the like it wouldn't create see

3042
02:14:38,529 --> 02:14:44,170
me see there's what you're saying

3043
02:14:41,219 --> 02:14:46,719
something I I don't know it depends the

3044
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:48,810
process you know if you have a against

3045
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:52,630
it sounds like a proprietary

3046
02:14:48,810 --> 02:14:55,150
low-temperature rot no template you're

3047
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:57,429
you're doing chemistry I mean you're

3048
02:14:55,149 --> 02:14:58,388
taking the components and your rear rate

3049
02:14:57,429 --> 02:15:00,609
deckchairs

3050
02:14:58,389 --> 02:15:02,078
and I don't know exactly you have to

3051
02:15:00,609 --> 02:15:05,429
look at the chemistry and you look at

3052
02:15:02,078 --> 02:15:09,759
the reaction manifolds good cbcb form

3053
02:15:05,429 --> 02:15:11,828
all the building blocks are there you

3054
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:14,380
know basically you're just rearranging

3055
02:15:11,828 --> 02:15:17,469
the same atoms that are that are there

3056
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:22,260
in the molecules and there has to be

3057
02:15:17,469 --> 02:15:24,730
sort of thermodynamic driving force for

3058
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:26,349
those rearrangements they don't just

3059
02:15:24,729 --> 02:15:29,888
happen on their own through either

3060
02:15:26,349 --> 02:15:32,260
initiated by heat or a light or some

3061
02:15:29,889 --> 02:15:38,489
type of microbial degradation I mean

3062
02:15:32,260 --> 02:15:42,820
there's all kinds of like degraded in

3063
02:15:38,488 --> 02:15:44,908
cannabinoids that end up going CBN

3064
02:15:42,819 --> 02:15:47,380
because CBN is somewhat of a

3065
02:15:44,908 --> 02:15:50,979
thermodynamic dead end

3066
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:53,349
I think else Olli had pointed out that

3067
02:15:50,979 --> 02:15:56,559
there's hydroxylated

3068
02:15:53,349 --> 02:15:58,900
metabolites I think the eight hydroxy t8

3069
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:01,150
C's and whatnot those are all if you

3070
02:15:58,899 --> 02:16:03,698
heat those up they immediately lose

3071
02:16:01,149 --> 02:16:06,908
water dehydrate now it makes dihydrate

3072
02:16:03,698 --> 02:16:10,019
HC which again goes to CBN almost

3073
02:16:06,908 --> 02:16:12,789
instantly so yeah those are all

3074
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:14,800
thermodynamically downhill from where

3075
02:16:12,789 --> 02:16:17,019
the molecules of the planar so when you

3076
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:19,029
start heating things or when you treat

3077
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:21,849
them with catalysts or treat them with

3078
02:16:19,029 --> 02:16:24,519
any type of stress to put stress on

3079
02:16:21,849 --> 02:16:27,279
those most sensitive molecules

3080
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:30,070
especially ones that can equilibrator to

3081
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:39,099
other isomers which is what cbc is right

3082
02:16:30,069 --> 02:16:42,699
CBC's and isomers of of THC mm-hmm well

3083
02:16:39,099 --> 02:16:46,808
I don't know quite the answer to why or

3084
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:50,620
how I guess but I'm pretty happy with

3085
02:16:46,808 --> 02:16:52,148
the conversion I mean if there was a way

3086
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:54,309
I guess what you're saying if yeah the

3087
02:16:52,148 --> 02:16:58,779
next step would be if you can convert 86

3088
02:16:54,308 --> 02:17:02,590
percent 807 milligrams of THC to 807

3089
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:05,200
milligrams of THC or CBN then yeah that

3090
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:07,750
would be amazing but I I don't think

3091
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:09,639
that's ever gonna be it you would think

3092
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:12,069
in a distillation that you would get a

3093
02:17:09,638 --> 02:17:13,289
cleaner cut or that you would actually

3094
02:17:12,069 --> 02:17:15,819
if you're doing a short path

3095
02:17:13,290 --> 02:17:17,710
distillation here that you'd be able to

3096
02:17:15,819 --> 02:17:20,619
take several cuts during that

3097
02:17:17,709 --> 02:17:22,869
distillation to look at like can you

3098
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:24,700
actually get rid of the minor

3099
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:26,649
cannabinoid fractions there in an

3100
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:29,530
earlier cut and then later in a

3101
02:17:26,648 --> 02:17:33,638
distillation major cut is going to be

3102
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:35,800
just more purified CBN CBN is right and

3103
02:17:33,638 --> 02:17:38,049
Sam will correct me on this a white

3104
02:17:35,799 --> 02:17:42,009
crystalline compound so if it's pure

3105
02:17:38,049 --> 02:17:45,069
like CBD can be purified to essentially

3106
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:46,750
be so yes so the scientists that I was

3107
02:17:45,069 --> 02:17:49,329
working with on this I asked them about

3108
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:50,829
like breaking out CBN and I said yeah

3109
02:17:49,329 --> 02:17:52,599
you won't be able to do it with terpenes

3110
02:17:50,829 --> 02:17:55,659
or anything because of the polarity and

3111
02:17:52,599 --> 02:17:58,210
the way that THC a or CBD breaks out is

3112
02:17:55,659 --> 02:17:59,829
totally different than cbn I'm curious

3113
02:17:58,209 --> 02:18:01,989
to see look because that is the next

3114
02:17:59,829 --> 02:18:04,090
step now how do I take this to a ninety

3115
02:18:01,989 --> 02:18:05,739
nine percent yeah there's ways that you

3116
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:08,290
could quantitatively can

3117
02:18:05,739 --> 02:18:11,530
her THC that's been isolated like the

3118
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:15,370
clear quantitatively converted all over

3119
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:17,470
to CBN and and then if it's not all

3120
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:19,720
converted you can then clean it up in

3121
02:18:17,469 --> 02:18:21,579
chromatic chromatography or or

3122
02:18:19,719 --> 02:18:23,590
distillation to basically make it an

3123
02:18:21,579 --> 02:18:25,299
analytically pure sample but do you have

3124
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:31,239
to but would you use a solvent in that

3125
02:18:25,299 --> 02:18:35,170
process depending on you mean the octave

3126
02:18:31,239 --> 02:18:38,530
dehydrogenation of THC itself yeah well

3127
02:18:35,170 --> 02:18:40,270
it's all the classic yeah you probably

3128
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:41,920
have to do that in a solvent or though

3129
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:44,140
you could be probably creative and

3130
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:45,639
figure out a way to do it without using

3131
02:18:44,139 --> 02:18:48,639
a solvent but you know that would

3132
02:18:45,639 --> 02:18:50,939
require some some engineering but yeah

3133
02:18:48,639 --> 02:18:53,079
most so it's basically it's just a

3134
02:18:50,940 --> 02:18:54,520
dehydrogenation reaction right so you

3135
02:18:53,079 --> 02:18:57,159
have to this is what you kind of

3136
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:59,770
patented right what's that no I actually

3137
02:18:57,159 --> 02:19:03,369
founded the hydrogenation that's adding

3138
02:18:59,770 --> 02:19:06,550
hydrogen hydrogen away so the methyl

3139
02:19:03,370 --> 02:19:09,850
cyclohexane ring of THC can basically

3140
02:19:06,549 --> 02:19:12,909
lose hydrogen and so when you see if

3141
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:14,500
you're doing a distillation and you

3142
02:19:12,909 --> 02:19:15,819
typically see white smoke coming from

3143
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:20,110
the distillation that's usually

3144
02:19:15,819 --> 02:19:22,959
indicative of cbn formation because what

3145
02:19:20,110 --> 02:19:27,100
is happening is that the oxygen in air

3146
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:29,859
is actually being hydrogenated if you

3147
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:32,260
will why the methyl cyclohexane ring to

3148
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:34,090
make air in order to make water and so

3149
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:36,670
that steam that's actually coming up

3150
02:19:34,090 --> 02:19:38,290
from from the distillation pot when you

3151
02:19:36,670 --> 02:19:40,180
see the white smoke coming from your

3152
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:42,970
distillation pot that's typically

3153
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:45,069
indicative of cbn formation so yeah

3154
02:19:42,969 --> 02:19:48,369
it'll happen with just air air is

3155
02:19:45,069 --> 02:19:50,799
actually the oxygen and air is strong

3156
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:52,990
enough but you could use other oxidants

3157
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:55,899
to basically promote that to make it go

3158
02:19:52,989 --> 02:19:59,379
at less harsh conditions and I know Arno

3159
02:19:55,899 --> 02:20:05,289
has camp published a paper and I think

3160
02:19:59,379 --> 02:20:07,649
did his his PhD dissertation on a or one

3161
02:20:05,290 --> 02:20:11,200
of the parts of his PhD dissertation

3162
02:20:07,649 --> 02:20:14,829
involved the quantitative oxidation of

3163
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:17,820
THC to CBN and I think that's go global

3164
02:20:14,829 --> 02:20:19,409
and you define his dissertation

3165
02:20:17,819 --> 02:20:20,909
Internet I actually saw that once

3166
02:20:19,409 --> 02:20:24,030
actually yeah I think

3167
02:20:20,909 --> 02:20:27,511
did he use like silver nitrate yes like

3168
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:30,391
a silver kind of stoichiometric which

3169
02:20:27,511 --> 02:20:32,340
I'm not sure as is is what you wanted

3170
02:20:30,390 --> 02:20:34,800
what you really want to do but I think

3171
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:37,140
one of the things that people always get

3172
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:41,789
hung up on again is that you know you

3173
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:44,129
can convert well this happens to a small

3174
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:48,360
extent just on the nail you know when

3175
02:20:44,129 --> 02:20:52,189
you're oxidizing THC in an atmosphere of

3176
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:54,810
oxygen you will get some you know a

3177
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:57,659
conversion to CBN and so you see that

3178
02:20:54,810 --> 02:21:01,289
actually as an artefact sometimes in in

3179
02:20:57,659 --> 02:21:03,931
dirty G sees and again things happen

3180
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:06,511
where you could actually see the dye

3181
02:21:03,931 --> 02:21:08,659
hydro product as well I know that Ryan

3182
02:21:06,511 --> 02:21:11,640
has shared that chromatogram well yeah

3183
02:21:08,659 --> 02:21:13,590
that's from our no paper if I remember

3184
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:15,750
correctly yeah

3185
02:21:13,590 --> 02:21:18,149
so those intermediates can't can be

3186
02:21:15,750 --> 02:21:20,579
identified I just wanted to mention that

3187
02:21:18,149 --> 02:21:23,690
Tony yeah there's so these guys you know

3188
02:21:20,579 --> 02:21:26,539
they worked for Genentech and some other

3189
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:28,649
pretty substantial companies but like

3190
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:32,190
ultimately yeah they were like yeah if

3191
02:21:28,649 --> 02:21:33,931
you built this custom this column

3192
02:21:32,190 --> 02:21:35,610
machine and spent like eight hundred

3193
02:21:33,931 --> 02:21:37,681
thousand dollars they could break out

3194
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:41,641
everything in its pharmaceutical grade

3195
02:21:37,681 --> 02:21:43,739
level but I do believe that there is a

3196
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:46,109
little bit of solvent that's using it so

3197
02:21:43,739 --> 02:21:48,360
I guess the I guess what it is is you

3198
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:52,079
hit a wall and you say okay if you're

3199
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:54,601
happy with converting th c to c be in

3200
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:56,879
without a solvent this is probably the

3201
02:21:54,601 --> 02:21:59,190
best we're gonna be able to do if you

3202
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:01,739
want to take it to the next level and by

3203
02:21:59,190 --> 02:22:04,051
all the crazy gear you probably could do

3204
02:22:01,739 --> 02:22:07,351
it at a you know at a much more

3205
02:22:04,050 --> 02:22:09,359
efficient conversion rate you know yeah

3206
02:22:07,351 --> 02:22:14,340
i think what might be key is to remove

3207
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:16,530
the be able to remove the the product in

3208
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:18,810
like a reactive distillation so it

3209
02:22:16,530 --> 02:22:21,420
doesn't build up over time because i

3210
02:22:18,810 --> 02:22:23,431
think over time they will degrade and i

3211
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:25,110
think that there's other did you use we

3212
02:22:23,431 --> 02:22:26,500
did use short path though I'm not saying

3213
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:27,790
we did yeah

3214
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:30,040
and and and and that's great I mean

3215
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:32,650
that's a great way to to do it but I

3216
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:35,290
think you could probably to clean to

3217
02:22:32,649 --> 02:22:37,899
ticket rosin out there was some funky

3218
02:22:35,290 --> 02:22:39,190
weird [ __ ] that I don't even know if I

3219
02:22:37,899 --> 02:22:42,549
want to share like what comes out of

3220
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:47,319
hash but for sure when you try to short

3221
02:22:42,549 --> 02:22:51,699
path rosin some weird [ __ ] comes out of

3222
02:22:47,319 --> 02:22:53,559
it I test my time you heat stuff up like

3223
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:57,520
if you're heating stuff up to do a high

3224
02:22:53,559 --> 02:23:00,189
vacuum yes you should definitely do what

3225
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:05,170
you can to make sure that it's

3226
02:23:00,190 --> 02:23:06,850
completely Ben D winterized because you

3227
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:08,559
know this is the point of having fats

3228
02:23:06,850 --> 02:23:11,950
and waxes and something that you're

3229
02:23:08,559 --> 02:23:13,840
heating up to these temperatures these

3230
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:15,190
things don't distill what they do is

3231
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:18,309
they degrade and when they degrade to

3232
02:23:15,190 --> 02:23:20,020
create those off burn rubber flavors

3233
02:23:18,309 --> 02:23:22,989
that you don't want in your in your

3234
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:24,940
distillate and so the best way to keep

3235
02:23:22,989 --> 02:23:27,039
that stuff out of your distillate is to

3236
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:29,829
make sure that what goes into the pot is

3237
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:32,860
as clean as you possibly can you know

3238
02:23:29,829 --> 02:23:36,639
people are using activated carbon and

3239
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:39,460
SIVs and you know what they can to make

3240
02:23:36,639 --> 02:23:43,119
sure that by the time you put any

3241
02:23:39,459 --> 02:23:45,549
thermal history on that material that

3242
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:47,920
you've done what you can to remove

3243
02:23:45,549 --> 02:23:50,259
things that aren't meant to be heated up

3244
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:53,770
to that temperature like those things

3245
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:57,219
are gonna degrade and give your stuff a

3246
02:23:53,770 --> 02:23:59,739
really off flavor yeah so one thing I

3247
02:23:57,219 --> 02:24:03,849
would note that and I agree with that is

3248
02:23:59,739 --> 02:24:06,670
that when you go from a hash rosin the

3249
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:08,079
way it is like the azulene and the

3250
02:24:06,670 --> 02:24:11,829
different weird stuff we're pulling out

3251
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:14,049
I actually had it tested and it tested

3252
02:24:11,829 --> 02:24:17,709
for all kinds of funky stuff

3253
02:24:14,049 --> 02:24:20,079
it had THC in it it was just it like you

3254
02:24:17,709 --> 02:24:22,329
said it was like rubbery fishy all these

3255
02:24:20,079 --> 02:24:24,459
weird different kind of what I thought

3256
02:24:22,329 --> 02:24:26,920
was terpenes of blue terpenes and things

3257
02:24:24,459 --> 02:24:30,759
like that but it actually had all kinds

3258
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:34,329
of [ __ ] in it but so consider a little

3259
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:37,600
bit a bad flavor goes a long way yeah

3260
02:24:34,329 --> 02:24:40,079
like a drop of some of that stuff oh my

3261
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:42,271
god we blow your entire

3262
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:44,610
I have people again who will take those

3263
02:24:42,271 --> 02:24:47,250
low boiling fractions completely

3264
02:24:44,610 --> 02:24:49,380
disassemble their unit before taking the

3265
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:52,021
high boil in Terps because you don't

3266
02:24:49,379 --> 02:24:54,000
even want to contaminate the path by

3267
02:24:52,021 --> 02:24:56,940
which you're gonna collect your

3268
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,390
wonderful clean distillate with all that

3269
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:04,829
ass smelling crap that comes over early

3270
02:25:00,390 --> 02:25:07,489
and again if I think really if you do

3271
02:25:04,829 --> 02:25:10,021
your distillate preparation

3272
02:25:07,489 --> 02:25:12,329
appropriately that fraction should

3273
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:15,721
actually be quite flavorful and try to

3274
02:25:12,329 --> 02:25:18,390
hold on to it yeah I've seen blue I've

3275
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:20,609
seen yellow purple red all kinds of

3276
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:22,829
different colors well I would tell you

3277
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:25,190
so check it out so then everybody's been

3278
02:25:22,829 --> 02:25:27,659
talking about you know the THCA thing

3279
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:29,880
separating THC a withdraws and I don't

3280
02:25:27,659 --> 02:25:32,310
I'm sure it's been a pretty big topic I

3281
02:25:29,879 --> 02:25:33,720
mean it's been a pretty big topic on the

3282
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:36,060
internet a lot of people making a lot of

3283
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:37,261
claims that they created it and

3284
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:39,209
what-have-you

3285
02:25:37,261 --> 02:25:42,300
I can tell you from my experience the

3286
02:25:39,209 --> 02:25:45,029
first time I ever saw it was our friend

3287
02:25:42,299 --> 02:25:47,459
Matt from Strait concentrated in 2015

3288
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:49,409
when those in Ukiah and we had our hands

3289
02:25:47,459 --> 02:25:52,589
on the first press

3290
02:25:49,409 --> 02:25:55,110
he pressed hash rosin and then we took

3291
02:25:52,590 --> 02:25:56,851
that repress that refolded it up right

3292
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:59,790
in the little twenty five screen repress

3293
02:25:56,851 --> 02:26:02,159
that out came super sappy oil and

3294
02:25:59,790 --> 02:26:05,550
insider Matt Armstrong whose but yeah

3295
02:26:02,159 --> 02:26:08,909
yeah yeah I don't know he watches right

3296
02:26:05,549 --> 02:26:10,680
no yeah well no I don't think he's do I

3297
02:26:08,909 --> 02:26:12,899
think he's still with him I don't know

3298
02:26:10,681 --> 02:26:14,159
there was some something on on his

3299
02:26:12,899 --> 02:26:17,369
Instagram it looked like he was starting

3300
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:20,011
a new label or I don't know really but

3301
02:26:17,370 --> 02:26:21,811
either way yeah either way we've had our

3302
02:26:20,011 --> 02:26:23,761
differences in the past and I wrote on

3303
02:26:21,810 --> 02:26:25,799
his Instagram was like listen all I all

3304
02:26:23,761 --> 02:26:28,140
I can tell you is in my history in my

3305
02:26:25,799 --> 02:26:32,159
experience the first person that I saw

3306
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:34,949
repress rosin was him and we had a white

3307
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:39,030
funky substance I've had I've done that

3308
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:40,440
I never like would create a product or

3309
02:26:39,030 --> 02:26:43,261
release it but it was it was always very

3310
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:46,140
interesting we tested that that chip

3311
02:26:43,261 --> 02:26:49,771
before I tested some recent huckleberry

3312
02:26:46,140 --> 02:26:51,840
og that we did and surprisingly it was

3313
02:26:49,771 --> 02:26:54,000
extremely high in THC a it's like a

3314
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:57,540
white little chip doesn't have a lot of

3315
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:01,739
flavor and there is a website out there

3316
02:26:57,540 --> 02:27:02,190
that teaches you how to do it it is

3317
02:27:01,739 --> 02:27:03,930
Halloween

3318
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:07,350
we got an Tamar of it it looks beautiful

3319
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:10,139
it's it's the absolutely pristine oh

3320
02:27:07,350 --> 02:27:14,010
it's beautiful yeah yeah I mean it's it

3321
02:27:10,139 --> 02:27:15,899
the signals on the NMR ring like like

3322
02:27:14,010 --> 02:27:19,170
there's no tomorrow it just absolutely

3323
02:27:15,899 --> 02:27:22,590
pristine beautiful and it's solvent less

3324
02:27:19,170 --> 02:27:25,409
so yeah so if you go to low temp -

3325
02:27:22,590 --> 02:27:27,989
plates calm there's uh there's a whole

3326
02:27:25,409 --> 02:27:30,809
tutorial and actually how to make it and

3327
02:27:27,989 --> 02:27:32,610
you can refine this two or three times

3328
02:27:30,809 --> 02:27:35,850
so if you pressure rosin and repress it

3329
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:37,920
again at like 130 to 140 you'll get that

3330
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:39,989
nice wide if you could do it again and

3331
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:43,079
you could start pulling out like all

3332
02:27:39,989 --> 02:27:46,379
kinds of like crystalline from it I have

3333
02:27:43,079 --> 02:27:48,389
been doing that for so you could do that

3334
02:27:46,379 --> 02:27:49,799
for you know like a pronto line or

3335
02:27:48,389 --> 02:27:52,619
something like that for capsules which

3336
02:27:49,799 --> 02:27:57,149
works unbelievable but now I've been

3337
02:27:52,620 --> 02:28:00,930
soaking those in you know like how we do

3338
02:27:57,149 --> 02:28:05,010
the crystalline crystalline for CBD and

3339
02:28:00,930 --> 02:28:06,960
for the stuff that we're doing gold drop

3340
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:09,809
but now I've been doing that same thing

3341
02:28:06,959 --> 02:28:13,859
with THC so I'm gonna have a Girl Scout

3342
02:28:09,809 --> 02:28:15,739
cookies crystalline grown from soaking

3343
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:18,870
and terpenes instead of you know like

3344
02:28:15,739 --> 02:28:20,729
people that are taking like an ethanol

3345
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:22,500
wash and then a hexane wash like on a

3346
02:28:20,729 --> 02:28:24,510
CVD and then they're getting crisps or

3347
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:27,120
getting it to break out I'm breaking it

3348
02:28:24,510 --> 02:28:30,750
out with cannabis terpenes so hopefully

3349
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:33,710
next week I'll have variations of a

3350
02:28:30,750 --> 02:28:37,290
crystalline that I could test that will

3351
02:28:33,709 --> 02:28:38,909
be grown from from within that solvent

3352
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:41,340
like so to be I think it's pretty cool

3353
02:28:38,909 --> 02:28:45,180
it's a fast way to do that I'm also

3354
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:49,020
working on ways to if you do that with

3355
02:28:45,180 --> 02:28:51,720
say CBD and THC oil there's potential of

3356
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:54,870
separating the CBD out from the THC a

3357
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:57,479
because if you have any CBD that's in

3358
02:28:54,870 --> 02:28:59,579
your oil so if you notice when you make

3359
02:28:57,479 --> 02:29:01,770
that THC a and those little chips that

3360
02:28:59,579 --> 02:29:03,959
are left behind all of the oil and the

3361
02:29:01,770 --> 02:29:08,220
sauces to the other side that will

3362
02:29:03,959 --> 02:29:12,799
contain CBD and other components so

3363
02:29:08,219 --> 02:29:16,949
I think that it's a significant

3364
02:29:12,799 --> 02:29:20,159
significant movement in the solvent list

3365
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:21,510
world and you know hats off to Matt he

3366
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:23,489
was working on it for a while I've seen

3367
02:29:21,510 --> 02:29:26,610
a couple other people out there claiming

3368
02:29:23,489 --> 02:29:29,579
that they created it but working on what

3369
02:29:26,610 --> 02:29:31,590
like he squished he pressed dress he

3370
02:29:29,579 --> 02:29:33,780
pressed it again and inside the bag was

3371
02:29:31,590 --> 02:29:36,090
THCA but we didn't know it at the time

3372
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:38,521
no no I know because I mean I got the

3373
02:29:36,090 --> 02:29:41,159
same thing at the same time I really dry

3374
02:29:38,521 --> 02:29:43,050
sift turning white white being like I

3375
02:29:41,159 --> 02:29:44,639
got a puff this and see what's up and

3376
02:29:43,049 --> 02:29:47,549
feeling effects from it and being like

3377
02:29:44,639 --> 02:29:49,170
what the [ __ ] I brought some to you I

3378
02:29:47,549 --> 02:29:50,850
brought some to you recently remember I

3379
02:29:49,170 --> 02:29:53,399
was like oh check this out and we smokes

3380
02:29:50,851 --> 02:29:55,980
it together yes that Matt gave it that

3381
02:29:53,399 --> 02:29:57,810
Matt gave me yep and what I found like

3382
02:29:55,979 --> 02:30:01,100
because I've seen him enter and we've

3383
02:29:57,810 --> 02:30:03,750
talked after cups and different things

3384
02:30:01,101 --> 02:30:06,720
yanno I think he actually filed for it

3385
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:09,200
or something but he hid what I say he's

3386
02:30:06,719 --> 02:30:11,459
been working I I think legally he was

3387
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:16,110
working on patenting it if I wasn't

3388
02:30:11,459 --> 02:30:18,149
mistaken but regardless he had entered

3389
02:30:16,110 --> 02:30:20,250
it a couple times I'd only seen him this

3390
02:30:18,149 --> 02:30:22,560
is like for a year he's had it and I

3391
02:30:20,250 --> 02:30:24,840
felt bad because it's really strong

3392
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:26,579
that's really good and people weren't

3393
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:28,079
gravitating towards it at all and the

3394
02:30:26,579 --> 02:30:29,940
cups that didn't do very good people

3395
02:30:28,079 --> 02:30:31,170
probably thought it was wasn't real even

3396
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:34,050
when I got it I was like oh it's a

3397
02:30:31,170 --> 02:30:36,299
solvent list and then I remembered like

3398
02:30:34,049 --> 02:30:38,310
it just triggered my memory okay I

3399
02:30:36,299 --> 02:30:40,229
remember now now because we thought it

3400
02:30:38,310 --> 02:30:41,940
was lipids we thought it was like fats

3401
02:30:40,229 --> 02:30:44,159
or something everyone that's what

3402
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:47,700
everyone was saying oh yeah I got stuffs

3403
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:49,950
garbage I have since though so what's

3404
02:30:47,700 --> 02:30:52,860
interesting though ever since I started

3405
02:30:49,950 --> 02:30:56,280
prana when we press like you know CVD or

3406
02:30:52,860 --> 02:30:58,440
we press hash we keep all those chips

3407
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:02,840
and that goes into the topical line I

3408
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:05,460
even told that to I've even said that to

3409
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:06,810
force when he came by and he was like oh

3410
02:31:05,459 --> 02:31:09,810
and I was like yeah everything gets

3411
02:31:06,810 --> 02:31:12,299
reused for us you know we put it under

3412
02:31:09,810 --> 02:31:15,659
our high vacuum and into our prana fat

3413
02:31:12,299 --> 02:31:17,819
and then used and then heated up to try

3414
02:31:15,659 --> 02:31:20,489
to get like a active THC out of it and

3415
02:31:17,819 --> 02:31:21,760
there's quite a bit quite a bit in those

3416
02:31:20,489 --> 02:31:24,010
chips

3417
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:25,630
we're talking trees we kind of joke

3418
02:31:24,010 --> 02:31:27,610
about it with with flower rosin and

3419
02:31:25,629 --> 02:31:29,379
things in patch Rus and there's lots of

3420
02:31:27,610 --> 02:31:33,069
edible makers that you know it's gold

3421
02:31:29,379 --> 02:31:35,409
it's considered like gold now and people

3422
02:31:33,069 --> 02:31:39,039
been using that so it's kind of funny

3423
02:31:35,409 --> 02:31:41,920
that like at least for the solvent list

3424
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:43,721
world it's it's definitely the next it's

3425
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:46,149
definitely the next push in the next

3426
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:48,549
movement that will come out more and

3427
02:31:46,149 --> 02:31:50,260
more and something that you could do

3428
02:31:48,549 --> 02:31:55,689
with a hair art and the twenty five

3429
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:57,271
screen you know daily making rosin and

3430
02:31:55,690 --> 02:31:59,681
make him making another product

3431
02:31:57,271 --> 02:32:02,590
simultaneously yeah and what's cool is

3432
02:31:59,681 --> 02:32:04,540
the sauce or like you know you like for

3433
02:32:02,590 --> 02:32:06,340
us we walk into the walk-in freezer and

3434
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:10,150
in like 30 seconds you can take it right

3435
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:11,860
off but you know if you're at home and

3436
02:32:10,149 --> 02:32:14,739
it's you know you've separated it you're

3437
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:16,271
going to get like a super saucy thing on

3438
02:32:14,739 --> 02:32:18,640
your parchment paper so you can fold

3439
02:32:16,271 --> 02:32:22,659
that up put it in a double ziploc throw

3440
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:24,609
it in a freezer you know or vacuum seal

3441
02:32:22,659 --> 02:32:26,351
it and throw it in a freezer try to get

3442
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:28,329
it as cold as possible but the second

3443
02:32:26,351 --> 02:32:30,880
you come out if you're in an 85 degree

3444
02:32:28,329 --> 02:32:34,409
or 90 degree area it's just going to be

3445
02:32:30,879 --> 02:32:38,770
all over the parchment again so I think

3446
02:32:34,409 --> 02:32:42,190
that's the only difficult part but I do

3447
02:32:38,771 --> 02:32:44,380
think that you know I do think it's

3448
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:46,780
gonna push the push the industry yet

3449
02:32:44,379 --> 02:32:49,509
again I always like when people are

3450
02:32:46,780 --> 02:32:57,521
doing things without solvent see where

3451
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:59,620
CEREC see where it could go that would

3452
02:32:57,521 --> 02:33:02,050
have been d for twenty K's moment to say

3453
02:32:59,620 --> 02:33:03,790
bong rip I like that it was like tony

3454
02:33:02,049 --> 02:33:11,439
was talking I lucked out these holes

3455
02:33:03,790 --> 02:33:14,200
that a pipe in his mouth well I mean you

3456
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:16,630
gotta admit it's pretty neat huh mark

3457
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:19,181
because as a chemist you do everything

3458
02:33:16,629 --> 02:33:22,239
you can to try to find ways of

3459
02:33:19,181 --> 02:33:24,190
separating people were laughing and

3460
02:33:22,239 --> 02:33:28,510
people have been laughing about rosin

3461
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:29,950
for a long time I believe there's a all

3462
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:34,450
kinds of memes out there that if you

3463
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:35,350
smoke Roz and you turn gay right there's

3464
02:33:34,450 --> 02:33:39,399
all kinds of funny

3465
02:33:35,350 --> 02:33:42,040
memes out there but oh no it's getting

3466
02:33:39,398 --> 02:33:44,528
pretty good hey Tony

3467
02:33:42,040 --> 02:33:47,500
yes sir fYI you can take the

3468
02:33:44,529 --> 02:33:53,560
highly-educated stems and put it on that

3469
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:55,689
gen1 cap of the oh yeah I uh

3470
02:33:53,559 --> 02:34:00,670
we got a longer without burning yourself

3471
02:33:55,689 --> 02:34:03,750
because it'll will I've been looking for

3472
02:34:00,670 --> 02:34:06,068
that thing for a while bro

3473
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:09,209
every time someone says that I'm like

3474
02:34:06,068 --> 02:34:13,209
yeah where the hell is that thing I

3475
02:34:09,209 --> 02:34:18,398
actually lost my little titanium gray

3476
02:34:13,209 --> 02:34:21,068
260 wire screen cipolla it's a gen 2 HP

3477
02:34:18,398 --> 02:34:22,478
with it has the hollow and has the two

3478
02:34:21,068 --> 02:34:24,068
holes and allow you to breathe through

3479
02:34:22,478 --> 02:34:27,299
it and so it allows you to actually

3480
02:34:24,068 --> 02:34:30,430
breathe through the cap no problem okay

3481
02:34:27,299 --> 02:34:34,778
so that's called the gen 2 well I think

3482
02:34:30,430 --> 02:34:38,590
it is yeah if this thing screws off

3483
02:34:34,779 --> 02:34:42,250

02:36:41,220 --> 02:36:45,550
but um there was a lot of questions

3526
02:36:43,569 --> 02:36:49,720
about like I got this week you know I

3527
02:36:45,550 --> 02:36:53,800
guess those Trinity pens went out and I

3528
02:36:49,720 --> 02:36:55,689
did want to say that they're working on

3529
02:36:53,800 --> 02:37:00,189
a way to get terpenes back out to you

3530
02:36:55,690 --> 02:37:03,101
guys on a retail level but we'll find

3531
02:37:00,190 --> 02:37:05,530
out on Monday it looks like maybe not

3532
02:37:03,101 --> 02:37:07,810
three blue river but through up tech

3533
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:08,950
you'll be able to get your you'll be

3534
02:37:07,810 --> 02:37:12,190
able to get those kits and you'll be

3535
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:16,170
able to get terpenes as well from him

3536
02:37:12,190 --> 02:37:19,480
because you know he's has a long history

3537
02:37:16,170 --> 02:37:20,800
with his credit card processors and we

3538
02:37:19,479 --> 02:37:22,390
went through the qualification process

3539
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:26,800
and it seems like they were pretty

3540
02:37:22,390 --> 02:37:28,720
acceptive of it so it'll be pretty

3541
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:31,600
pretty good to get those out and I sent

3542
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:33,579
you the new vials too you saw those how

3543
02:37:31,601 --> 02:37:36,280
mark I did yeah they look pretty cool

3544
02:37:33,579 --> 02:37:39,909
I'm always with new vials you show

3545
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:41,500
somebody gene errs well I think it's

3546
02:37:39,909 --> 02:37:43,899
important because look I've gone through

3547
02:37:41,500 --> 02:37:45,431
this thing these little applicators and

3548
02:37:43,899 --> 02:37:47,529
this is why I haven't released stuff

3549
02:37:45,431 --> 02:37:49,601
because I want to take time with it and

3550
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:52,500
these little applicators you can see

3551
02:37:49,601 --> 02:37:59,050
this had to be changed right and so you

3552
02:37:52,500 --> 02:38:02,648
can either do an HD or LD or PTFE type

3553
02:37:59,049 --> 02:38:04,898
of plastic straight glass works - that's

3554
02:38:02,648 --> 02:38:09,760
what I used straight glass works really

3555
02:38:04,898 --> 02:38:12,760
well straight glass yep those are those

3556
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:15,880
I would say you know Gary's working on

3557
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:17,530
trying to get those the okay he's got

3558
02:38:15,879 --> 02:38:20,199
one too over there so see the one that

3559
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:23,200
Mark's got all right so that rubber at

3560
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:26,560
over so that little rubber stopper

3561
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:29,050
anything past you know eight percent

3562
02:38:26,559 --> 02:38:30,639
terpenes is gonna start to 8 to 10

3563
02:38:29,049 --> 02:38:33,849
percent turbines gonna start to eat that

3564
02:38:30,639 --> 02:38:36,189
away long-term when you start getting 15

3565
02:38:33,850 --> 02:38:38,170
percent terpenes and I'm just sharing

3566
02:38:36,189 --> 02:38:40,720
with it like this little plunger wants

3567
02:38:38,170 --> 02:38:42,398
to punch out whether the terpenes are

3568
02:38:40,719 --> 02:38:44,108
off gassing whatever you want to call it

3569
02:38:42,398 --> 02:38:46,750
it definitely creates a little bit of

3570
02:38:44,109 --> 02:38:49,090
pressure in there from high volume of

3571
02:38:46,750 --> 02:38:52,420
terpenes that's about 70 percent THC a

3572
02:38:49,090 --> 02:38:58,120
and 15 percent 12 percent terpenes and

3573
02:38:52,420 --> 02:39:02,469
so it's it's there okay they work all

3574
02:38:58,120 --> 02:39:06,729
right but I think that at the end of the

3575
02:39:02,469 --> 02:39:08,500
day I have a different method than I

3576
02:39:06,728 --> 02:39:10,659
think you know eventually we have to

3577
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:14,648
build our own to be honest with you from

3578
02:39:10,659 --> 02:39:16,148
scratch but in the meantime it'll it

3579
02:39:14,648 --> 02:39:17,949
we've got a different way that I'm going

3580
02:39:16,148 --> 02:39:22,389
to do it with the micro glass dropper

3581
02:39:17,950 --> 02:39:24,970
and a vial within a vial that will that

3582
02:39:22,389 --> 02:39:31,139
I think is pretty neat and it has a PTFE

3583
02:39:24,969 --> 02:39:34,478
cap but the way that the file will work

3584
02:39:31,139 --> 02:39:38,010
show you right now mark will recognize

3585
02:39:34,478 --> 02:39:38,010
these boom

3586
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:46,470
so that little vial is on a kind of like

3587
02:39:44,290 --> 02:39:48,580
almost like a spring loaded into the cap

3588
02:39:46,469 --> 02:39:49,869
when you open it you can actually have

3589
02:39:48,579 --> 02:39:52,359
your terpenes in there with a little

3590
02:39:49,870 --> 02:39:54,069
glass dropper or a glass syringe then

3591
02:39:52,359 --> 02:39:55,989
you could turn that inside to the vial

3592
02:39:54,068 --> 02:39:57,568
mix all of your stuff up you could put

3593
02:39:55,989 --> 02:40:01,568
two grams in there which makes four

3594
02:39:57,568 --> 02:40:03,369
refill carts so this is for the people

3595
02:40:01,568 --> 02:40:04,989
at home that are buying Trinities that

3596
02:40:03,370 --> 02:40:06,910
wanna like make turtle make their own

3597
02:40:04,989 --> 02:40:08,920
stuff at home you need terpenes to do

3598
02:40:06,909 --> 02:40:10,719
that and you need to be able to get it

3599
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:12,398
so that you can get every last drop out

3600
02:40:10,719 --> 02:40:12,850
of it instead of it being a square

3601
02:40:12,398 --> 02:40:15,189
bottom

3602
02:40:12,851 --> 02:40:16,511
needs to be a pointed bottom you need to

3603
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:20,261
be able to get something in there so

3604
02:40:16,511 --> 02:40:23,591
this is the solution for that and then

3605
02:40:20,261 --> 02:40:26,739
you know pre-mixed refills it I find it

3606
02:40:23,591 --> 02:40:29,081
I find this thing to be easy to use I

3607
02:40:26,739 --> 02:40:30,699
know mark does I mean they're awesome

3608
02:40:29,081 --> 02:40:32,831
because you could do anything with them

3609
02:40:30,700 --> 02:40:37,061
you know I find it easy to fill the tank

3610
02:40:32,831 --> 02:40:39,130
up like that but you know a little glass

3611
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:40,421
dropper that will go into there and to

3612
02:40:39,130 --> 02:40:42,300
put it in the side of the tank would

3613
02:40:40,421 --> 02:40:45,101
work as well

3614
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:46,390
it's just that saucy you know it's not

3615
02:40:45,101 --> 02:40:48,101
like a distillate so it doesn't

3616
02:40:46,390 --> 02:40:50,710
necessarily have to be in something like

3617
02:40:48,101 --> 02:40:54,280
this but yeah do you see a turning dark

3618
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:55,770
on exposure to light like when it first

3619
02:40:54,280 --> 02:41:00,551
goes in there it's kind of like a

3620
02:40:55,771 --> 02:41:04,961
slavery but yeah screaming yep it was

3621
02:41:00,550 --> 02:41:07,779
lighter it was creamier yeah yeah I

3622
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:11,619
could see the oil turning dark you know

3623
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:14,860
in those clear glasses or the yeah

3624
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:17,681
Turkey well also besides melting the

3625
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:23,530
rotted stopper in the syringe will melt

3626
02:41:17,681 --> 02:41:25,271
any plastic sidewalls also yeah yep it

3627
02:41:23,530 --> 02:41:27,641
doesn't necessarily melt it right it

3628
02:41:25,271 --> 02:41:32,650
just it basically just plasticizers it

3629
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:36,460
so that's probably it melted I first saw

3630
02:41:32,649 --> 02:41:40,359
this 40 years ago in a sealed vacuum

3631
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:43,119
sealed glass mason jar with a rubber

3632
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:45,190
band I accidentally left in it I opened

3633
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:50,011
it up six months later and the rubber

3634
02:41:45,190 --> 02:41:52,541
band had melted all in the bud oh yeah

3635
02:41:50,011 --> 02:41:56,381
see if I can get a picture and send it

3636
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:59,229
from my phone but that had am spray

3637
02:41:56,380 --> 02:42:02,949
bottle that actually House of Harlequin

3638
02:41:59,229 --> 02:42:05,229
gave me Wade's organization it was full

3639
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:07,811
of terpenes but it was kind of in a

3640
02:42:05,229 --> 02:42:10,899
spritzer so I was been taking home and

3641
02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:14,319
and work with it and I it tipped over in

3642
02:42:10,899 --> 02:42:16,810
my refrigerator and I found it

3643
02:42:14,319 --> 02:42:20,681
I can noticed a day or so later and it

3644
02:42:16,810 --> 02:42:24,011
had melted the plastic shelf on my

3645
02:42:20,681 --> 02:42:26,620
refrigerator infused the container to it

3646
02:42:24,011 --> 02:42:29,140
so in the cold refrigerator

3647
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:31,030
it was corrosive enough to melt the

3648
02:42:29,139 --> 02:42:32,319
shelf and I have a picture of it here on

3649
02:42:31,030 --> 02:42:35,470
my phone let's see if I can get it to

3650
02:42:32,319 --> 02:42:37,148
pull out but that was a lesson learned

3651
02:42:35,469 --> 02:42:40,299
the hard way about not only how

3652
02:42:37,148 --> 02:42:42,639
corrosive they can be but well check

3653
02:42:40,299 --> 02:42:45,670
this out in just Marley I just posted

3654
02:42:42,639 --> 02:42:50,619
this in the in the chat you can post it

3655
02:42:45,670 --> 02:42:52,840
in the in has the hospital asked group

3656
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:54,640
on Facebook but if you click that little

3657
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:56,920
image I sent you guys in this little

3658
02:42:54,639 --> 02:43:04,478
chat you could share that this has a

3659
02:42:56,920 --> 02:43:06,398
chart of the LDPE HDPE PTFE PSP PPC and

3660
02:43:04,478 --> 02:43:07,659
abs types of things that are out there

3661
02:43:06,398 --> 02:43:10,358
and then it has all of the different

3662
02:43:07,659 --> 02:43:12,369
solvents and then it gives you a rating

3663
02:43:10,359 --> 02:43:17,319
of if it's going to be good or not for

3664
02:43:12,370 --> 02:43:20,320
that and so with what you know caustic

3665
02:43:17,319 --> 02:43:24,670
effects and things like this

3666
02:43:20,319 --> 02:43:27,579
ether ester you know it's got all kinds

3667
02:43:24,670 --> 02:43:28,930
of nasty great stuff in there and you

3668
02:43:27,579 --> 02:43:32,559
want to look for things like if you look

3669
02:43:28,930 --> 02:43:36,609
at the PTFE it's all a is all the way

3670
02:43:32,559 --> 02:43:38,978
down except for one category benzene and

3671
02:43:36,609 --> 02:43:40,540
then you could see what would be rated

3672
02:43:38,978 --> 02:43:42,969
so if you're feeling something with a

3673
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:47,170
hash oil and you're saying okay they're

3674
02:43:42,969 --> 02:43:48,760
just using pp at the stopper and you

3675
02:43:47,170 --> 02:43:51,340
look at terpenes and you say okay

3676
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:54,728
terpenes with what we know about them

3677
02:43:51,340 --> 02:44:00,280
once you start going past you know 8% 5

3678
02:43:54,728 --> 02:44:01,840
you know 10% 20% that stuff you're going

3679
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:04,380
to have to use different different

3680
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:07,478
sources and PTFE like we talked about

3681
02:44:04,379 --> 02:44:09,849
not something easily biodegradable but

3682
02:44:07,478 --> 02:44:13,929
it does work really good all of the new

3683
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:16,600
Blue River degradable at all man no yeah

3684
02:44:13,930 --> 02:44:19,239
it's not biodegradable and so but it is

3685
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:24,489
the best if you're looking at the best

3686
02:44:19,239 --> 02:44:28,030
source or you know not having any cost

3687
02:44:24,489 --> 02:44:30,449
oh yeah and and so again like part of

3688
02:44:28,030 --> 02:44:33,939
the issue with some of these things is a

3689
02:44:30,450 --> 02:44:35,740
plastic is not just the polymer itself

3690
02:44:33,939 --> 02:44:37,898
and people are talking about like

3691
02:44:35,739 --> 02:44:40,289
whether it's polypropylene polystyrene

3692
02:44:37,898 --> 02:44:43,289
there's polyolefin PLAs

3693
02:44:40,290 --> 02:44:46,021
polyester plastics but what makes them

3694
02:44:43,290 --> 02:44:48,720
flexible is they add plasticizers to

3695
02:44:46,021 --> 02:44:51,120
that and a common plasticizer of the

3696
02:44:48,719 --> 02:44:53,489
phthalates that are used that they often

3697
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:55,530
have health concerns about because

3698
02:44:53,489 --> 02:44:57,659
they're in plastics like for baby

3699
02:44:55,530 --> 02:45:00,120
bottles and baby toys and whatnot and

3700
02:44:57,659 --> 02:45:03,049
they can leach out out and I guess in

3701
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:06,000
certain you know toasters Salley

3702
02:45:03,049 --> 02:45:09,149
plasticizers can be toxic but like

3703
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,190
that's the issue with a lot of these you

3704
02:45:09,149 --> 02:45:13,260
know materials whether it's the lid on

3705
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:16,021
your vials or whatever that comes in

3706
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:18,271
contact with extracts that are rich with

3707
02:45:16,021 --> 02:45:21,239
with terpenes is that deter pians will

3708
02:45:18,271 --> 02:45:23,420
start to leach out the plasticizer now

3709
02:45:21,239 --> 02:45:25,559
you have plasticizer in your hash

3710
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:28,530
phthalates and [ __ ] like that so that's

3711
02:45:25,559 --> 02:45:31,770
why you never want to use any plastic

3712
02:45:28,530 --> 02:45:34,500
containers to have to have anything and

3713
02:45:31,771 --> 02:45:35,579
we used to use always use film vials for

3714
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:38,579
like buds and stuff

3715
02:45:35,579 --> 02:45:40,260
but I mean like for vials for storing

3716
02:45:38,579 --> 02:45:43,049
stuff like this it should be in a glass

3717
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:44,700
vial and not a plastic file and you

3718
02:45:43,049 --> 02:45:46,920
shouldn't really be using plastic

3719
02:45:44,700 --> 02:45:49,500
syringes and I see in plastic surgeries

3720
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:51,000
use them used quite a bit but I think

3721
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:52,829
the other thing and again Tony this

3722
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:55,829
might have something to do with what

3723
02:45:52,829 --> 02:45:58,049
like with these syringes right here they

3724
02:45:55,829 --> 02:46:01,920
actually they are stabilized to take

3725
02:45:58,049 --> 02:46:04,889
some type of liquid load and and in most

3726
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:06,540
cases like there are no you know if you

3727
02:46:04,889 --> 02:46:09,239
look at like the rubbers and all all

3728
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:11,580
those rubbers again will all start

3729
02:46:09,239 --> 02:46:13,920
absorbing it's just a matter of rate and

3730
02:46:11,579 --> 02:46:15,989
certainly like if you pull the plug off

3731
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:18,899
of some of these syringes you'll find

3732
02:46:15,989 --> 02:46:21,930
that the the the rubber itself has

3733
02:46:18,899 --> 02:46:24,180
swollen I mean there's like now the

3734
02:46:21,930 --> 02:46:26,850
polymer itself is now swollen because

3735
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:29,250
you've actually absorbed a lot of liquid

3736
02:46:26,850 --> 02:46:31,409
into the material itself so you can't

3737
02:46:29,250 --> 02:46:34,440
kind of fit it in anymore but the point

3738
02:46:31,409 --> 02:46:36,059
is is that any material that you come in

3739
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:39,420
contact with that's a synthetic material

3740
02:46:36,059 --> 02:46:42,600
like a polymer or plastic a lot of those

3741
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:44,370
are coated or have plasticizers in there

3742
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:46,350
that could essentially leach out with

3743
02:46:44,370 --> 02:46:49,050
terpenes so I think that's the more

3744
02:46:46,350 --> 02:46:53,329
problematic issue of using anything that

3745
02:46:49,049 --> 02:46:55,449
comes in contact with a with a extractor

3746
02:46:53,329 --> 02:46:58,909
trait that could extract plasticizers

3747
02:46:55,450 --> 02:47:01,850
yeah I agree and ultimate the end of the

3748
02:46:58,909 --> 02:47:04,879
day we have only so many choices even

3749
02:47:01,850 --> 02:47:07,780
the lids we've got new little lids for

3750
02:47:04,879 --> 02:47:13,039
these terpenes and they do so PTFE

3751
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:14,960
underside yep PTFE slip lids there's

3752
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:16,430
then they sell plastic ones and they

3753
02:47:14,959 --> 02:47:19,039
sell different [ __ ] that's under there

3754
02:47:16,430 --> 02:47:22,610
but ultimately if you want to have the

3755
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:27,021
safest vials for terpenes or the safest

3756
02:47:22,610 --> 02:47:31,010
files for high terpene oils kind of have

3757
02:47:27,021 --> 02:47:33,290
to go that direction so that's what

3758
02:47:31,010 --> 02:47:34,700
we're kind of releasing and then I think

3759
02:47:33,290 --> 02:47:36,470
that's how our applicators are going to

3760
02:47:34,700 --> 02:47:37,909
be them I mean I think that like if

3761
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:39,949
you're using something like that I don't

3762
02:47:37,909 --> 02:47:43,909
think it's if it's a short-term thing

3763
02:47:39,950 --> 02:47:47,630
it's pretty good but the whole concept

3764
02:47:43,909 --> 02:47:49,360
has to be has to be redesigned so we'll

3765
02:47:47,629 --> 02:47:53,509
eventually have our own little custom

3766
02:47:49,360 --> 02:47:56,000
push twist glass on glass you know

3767
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:58,489
refill applicator that can work like a

3768
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:01,340
syringe but not look like one but also

3769
02:47:58,489 --> 02:48:03,199
work like a controlled you know device

3770
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:05,000
I've seen it you can see what happens

3771
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:07,159
when you have like a paper liner and

3772
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:10,010
it's not a plastic liner oh yeah

3773
02:48:07,159 --> 02:48:12,680
that's horrible now the paper starts to

3774
02:48:10,010 --> 02:48:15,260
become basically a reservoir for what do

3775
02:48:12,680 --> 02:48:16,729
you think that's inside the jar but so

3776
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:18,800
you can't just there's not a paper

3777
02:48:16,729 --> 02:48:20,510
solution and I think there are like

3778
02:48:18,799 --> 02:48:24,679
coatings that you can put on that are

3779
02:48:20,510 --> 02:48:29,989
somewhat more like yeah yeah yeah yeah

3780
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:31,639
this one is all of our new caps are they

3781
02:48:29,989 --> 02:48:33,649
don't have that kind of liner like in

3782
02:48:31,639 --> 02:48:37,969
Sony let's see that again hold that up

3783
02:48:33,649 --> 02:48:41,799
again yeah sure it looks like that so

3784
02:48:37,969 --> 02:48:45,199
it's a maybe like a polyethylene liner

3785
02:48:41,799 --> 02:48:47,989
it's a pee yeah I forget what it was it

3786
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:50,510
was slightly rated um so I thought it

3787
02:48:47,989 --> 02:48:52,129
was pretty good instead of like a I have

3788
02:48:50,510 --> 02:48:53,780
to look it up when we when we bought

3789
02:48:52,129 --> 02:48:57,889
them it was definitely better than the

3790
02:48:53,780 --> 02:48:59,530
liner but nothing that's like anything

3791
02:48:57,889 --> 02:49:01,909
that's now anything that's saucy it's

3792
02:48:59,530 --> 02:49:03,620
like here's one that I'm not using

3793
02:49:01,909 --> 02:49:06,200
anymore this one's okay this is one of

3794
02:49:03,620 --> 02:49:07,100
those this is what you normally see that

3795
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:10,609
little [ __ ] that

3796
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:12,318
there yeah I mean you wouldn't want a

3797
02:49:10,609 --> 02:49:14,568
whole container made out of that

3798
02:49:12,318 --> 02:49:19,750
material but certainly as a lid liner

3799
02:49:14,568 --> 02:49:22,789
that would be just fine probably ever

3800
02:49:19,750 --> 02:49:24,709
yeah I don't know about the silicone

3801
02:49:22,790 --> 02:49:27,680
containers though you know those little

3802
02:49:24,709 --> 02:49:31,129
weird rubber ones they seem to those

3803
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:33,109
thing to crack and break down well there

3804
02:49:31,129 --> 02:49:36,198
there are victims sometimes you get like

3805
02:49:33,109 --> 02:49:38,359
these little tiny holes and the little

3806
02:49:36,199 --> 02:49:41,210
pore holes it's not like the material

3807
02:49:38,359 --> 02:49:42,710
itself is impervious to most but because

3808
02:49:41,209 --> 02:49:45,318
it's thermally cured at a higher

3809
02:49:42,709 --> 02:49:47,509
temperature where again polymerizations

3810
02:49:45,318 --> 02:49:49,750
happened and so there's a barrier to

3811
02:49:47,510 --> 02:49:52,728
keep you know things from being absorbed

3812
02:49:49,750 --> 02:49:56,389
but they're only you know as good a

3813
02:49:52,728 --> 02:49:58,849
barrier is they are free of little pin

3814
02:49:56,389 --> 02:50:01,639
holes or cracks or fissures and that's

3815
02:49:58,850 --> 02:50:05,270
where stuff can start getting in you

3816
02:50:01,639 --> 02:50:08,539
know yeah how do you feel about LDPE and

3817
02:50:05,270 --> 02:50:11,329
HDPE yeah so those are just a Crenn um's

3818
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:13,880
for low density polyethylene and high

3819
02:50:11,329 --> 02:50:19,750
density polyethylene they're made from

3820
02:50:13,879 --> 02:50:22,269
petroleum I don't know we want to patrol

3821
02:50:19,750 --> 02:50:25,129
promote petroleum products

3822
02:50:22,270 --> 02:50:26,930
I know they're plastics they're

3823
02:50:25,129 --> 02:50:29,778
ubiquitous they're in society I mean

3824
02:50:26,930 --> 02:50:33,158
there's really there's not much you can

3825
02:50:29,779 --> 02:50:36,890
do you know about it just for everywhere

3826
02:50:33,158 --> 02:50:39,639
they're everywhere I did like it do your

3827
02:50:36,889 --> 02:50:43,189
limit to you know make sure that any

3828
02:50:39,639 --> 02:50:44,329
product packaging that you buy yeah I'm

3829
02:50:43,189 --> 02:50:49,068
saying don't you think that's better

3830
02:50:44,329 --> 02:50:51,309
than PP polypropylene yeah don't you

3831
02:50:49,068 --> 02:50:53,000
think an LD or net HD would be a better

3832
02:50:51,309 --> 02:50:55,930
I'll give you a little bit more

3833
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:59,869
protection if you're talking about more

3834
02:50:55,930 --> 02:51:01,670
you know high terpene yeah it depends I

3835
02:50:59,869 --> 02:51:03,170
mean again I think that those types of

3836
02:51:01,670 --> 02:51:07,579
high jerking products should only be

3837
02:51:03,170 --> 02:51:10,818
packaged in glass yeah I think I mean

3838
02:51:07,579 --> 02:51:12,889
you know occasionally we get a fold that

3839
02:51:10,818 --> 02:51:15,379
some kind of you know hash and it's very

3840
02:51:12,889 --> 02:51:16,908
very chirpy it was with it a fold so

3841
02:51:15,379 --> 02:51:19,130
it's not difficult to deal with and you

3842
02:51:16,908 --> 02:51:23,181
wish you had in the glass container

3843
02:51:19,130 --> 02:51:25,399
but um I I would think that yet less

3844
02:51:23,181 --> 02:51:27,521
plastic is good when it comes to

3845
02:51:25,399 --> 02:51:29,569
anything that comes in contact with

3846
02:51:27,521 --> 02:51:32,989
something especially something that you

3847
02:51:29,569 --> 02:51:34,399
cannot dabby or vaping hey I just wanted

3848
02:51:32,989 --> 02:51:36,979
to jump in really quick and show you

3849
02:51:34,399 --> 02:51:39,681
guys a new packaged product that we're

3850
02:51:36,979 --> 02:51:41,659
having here you know we've got our co2

3851
02:51:39,681 --> 02:51:43,671
extract that's in between ten and twenty

3852
02:51:41,659 --> 02:51:45,800
six percent terpene content and so it's

3853
02:51:43,671 --> 02:51:47,541
really really high and I've been worried

3854
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:49,880
about putting it in these sort of

3855
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:52,880
plastic syringes you know always going

3856
02:51:49,880 --> 02:51:55,340
for the best that we can get but plastic

3857
02:51:52,880 --> 02:51:59,359
was really the best at the moment so

3858
02:51:55,341 --> 02:52:02,239
after working and and looking in China I

3859
02:51:59,360 --> 02:52:05,450
found these and so it's all glass on

3860
02:52:02,239 --> 02:52:07,251
glass and it's it's very similar to what

3861
02:52:05,450 --> 02:52:08,990
you've got there Tony that you've been

3862
02:52:07,251 --> 02:52:12,140
using although there's no silicone

3863
02:52:08,989 --> 02:52:14,001
plunger and so they they they hold air

3864
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:16,011
you know you can you can pull it up and

3865
02:52:14,001 --> 02:52:18,800
then it's a it's it's definitely an air

3866
02:52:16,011 --> 02:52:20,690
tight air tight fit there so if

3867
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:22,399
anybody's looking for something to put

3868
02:52:20,690 --> 02:52:25,310
their extract in that's a high tree bean

3869
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:28,341
extract definitely look around Ali

3870
02:52:25,310 --> 02:52:29,300
Baba's a good resource for this and let

3871
02:52:28,341 --> 02:52:31,581
me ask you something there's that

3872
02:52:29,300 --> 02:52:34,279
plunger since if you get to 20 or 30%

3873
02:52:31,581 --> 02:52:35,841
with terpenes does that plunger stay in

3874
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:38,120
on its own or do you have to hold it in

3875
02:52:35,841 --> 02:52:40,581
yeah yeah I know it holds in it holds in

3876
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:42,261
so so I'm just you know yeah just

3877
02:52:40,581 --> 02:52:44,390
sticking my finger over it there you can

3878
02:52:42,261 --> 02:52:47,239
tell that it's it's airtight

3879
02:52:44,390 --> 02:52:49,671
yeah it just bounces right back up so

3880
02:52:47,239 --> 02:52:52,790
yeah it's it's glass on glass I would

3881
02:52:49,671 --> 02:52:54,380
say that if you get over 20 or 30

3882
02:52:52,790 --> 02:52:56,300
percent sure beans you're going to be

3883
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:58,251
losing it like if you put pure terpenes

3884
02:52:56,300 --> 02:53:00,890
in here they're going to come out the

3885
02:52:58,251 --> 02:53:05,060
backside it's not gonna hold in that

3886
02:53:00,890 --> 02:53:07,550
really really liquid Turkey but but yeah

3887
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:09,140
for for anything that's a mixture and

3888
02:53:07,550 --> 02:53:13,460
you know we haven't had any issues with

3889
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:15,710
it on the heights European extracts yeah

3890
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:17,149
it's important to talk about because as

3891
02:53:15,710 --> 02:53:19,670
everyone gets keeps boosting their

3892
02:53:17,149 --> 02:53:22,069
terpene level it's like that changes

3893
02:53:19,671 --> 02:53:23,511
that packaging and that's why I didn't

3894
02:53:22,069 --> 02:53:25,130
release these little I made like six of

3895
02:53:23,511 --> 02:53:27,530
these applicators I've kind of sat on

3896
02:53:25,130 --> 02:53:29,119
them I've changed the plungers the LD

3897
02:53:27,530 --> 02:53:32,480
you know just done a few different

3898
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:32,840
things I'm like yeah and it's like you

3899
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:35,299
could go

3900
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:38,290
down that path but then ultimately I'm

3901
02:53:35,299 --> 02:53:40,519
just doing a little glass on glass

3902
02:53:38,290 --> 02:53:43,160
spring-loaded vial with a glass on glass

3903
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:45,020
Mico dropper for at least for the tanks

3904
02:53:43,159 --> 02:53:47,090
because I'm not trying I'm not trying to

3905
02:53:45,020 --> 02:53:48,500
get like I'm not trying to use it for

3906
02:53:47,090 --> 02:53:50,210
dabbing I'm just trying to refill my

3907
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:52,579
friggin tank

3908
02:53:50,209 --> 02:53:54,978
maybe those like just like how do I get

3909
02:53:52,579 --> 02:53:57,049
my sauce in something where I don't lose

3910
02:53:54,978 --> 02:53:59,148
it you know they've got this beautiful

3911
02:53:57,049 --> 02:54:01,309
like live rosin sauce and cream and

3912
02:53:59,148 --> 02:54:03,049
you're like okay what do I put it in I

3913
02:54:01,309 --> 02:54:04,969
can't put it in a regular file because

3914
02:54:03,049 --> 02:54:06,079
you won't get it all out you can't put

3915
02:54:04,969 --> 02:54:07,699
it in stuff that's gonna have any

3916
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:10,189
plastics because then that'll eat away

3917
02:54:07,700 --> 02:54:11,359
so the same thing you probably went

3918
02:54:10,189 --> 02:54:12,559
through you're like okay what do we do

3919
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:15,920
and you're like I got to find something

3920
02:54:12,559 --> 02:54:17,449
and then you know the glass syringes I

3921
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:19,100
think are great I've you know it's just

3922
02:54:17,450 --> 02:54:21,500
like some of the dispensaries and some

3923
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:23,989
of the people are like oh it's a syringe

3924
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:27,109
it's like yeah but like there's only so

3925
02:54:23,989 --> 02:54:29,239
many glass on glass things that you can

3926
02:54:27,109 --> 02:54:31,579
use you're either gonna use a dropper in

3927
02:54:29,239 --> 02:54:32,959
a glass some form of vial or you're

3928
02:54:31,579 --> 02:54:36,139
gonna have to use a glass on glass

3929
02:54:32,959 --> 02:54:38,299
syringe the one Marcus has and we found

3930
02:54:36,139 --> 02:54:39,409
the same thing and you know alibaba's

3931
02:54:38,299 --> 02:54:41,478
got really thin

3932
02:54:39,409 --> 02:54:42,680
they have really thin ones too that are

3933
02:54:41,478 --> 02:54:44,539
just exactly what you were showing

3934
02:54:42,680 --> 02:54:46,819
you've had a big Daddy one though you

3935
02:54:44,540 --> 02:54:50,479
know you're this is a two milliliter

3936
02:54:46,819 --> 02:54:53,359
syringe and and they do sell the one

3937
02:54:50,478 --> 02:54:54,829
milliliters that are just like the the

3938
02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:59,450
standard one mils

3939
02:54:54,829 --> 02:55:04,280
I think Marcus has one up yep those are

3940
02:54:59,450 --> 02:55:06,740
the one MLS yep yeah exactly yeah I

3941
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:09,140
really like the form factor of the two

3942
02:55:06,739 --> 02:55:11,898
milk because you were able to you know

3943
02:55:09,139 --> 02:55:14,269
pull your gram of extract out and you

3944
02:55:11,898 --> 02:55:16,369
don't have a whole bunch of space in

3945
02:55:14,270 --> 02:55:18,710
there and taking up extra packaging

3946
02:55:16,370 --> 02:55:24,800
space so the ten milliliter seemed to

3947
02:55:18,709 --> 02:55:26,779
work really well yeah yeah I went in the

3948
02:55:24,799 --> 02:55:29,599
other I went in I went in the other door

3949
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:31,159
for for using this I actually poured my

3950
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:33,200
sauce right in the back

3951
02:55:31,159 --> 02:55:35,930
let it drip right down and then just

3952
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:37,520
drop the plunger in and build from there

3953
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:40,939
I didn't I didn't actually pull the

3954
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:43,670
sauce up in its actually yeah it's

3955
02:55:40,939 --> 02:55:46,250
actually really hard to pull up on these

3956
02:55:43,670 --> 02:55:48,559
syringes you know so a better

3957
02:55:46,250 --> 02:55:50,690
to go about it is to fill a much larger

3958
02:55:48,559 --> 02:55:52,879
syringe and then use a syringe to

3959
02:55:50,690 --> 02:55:54,890
syringe connector and then you can

3960
02:55:52,879 --> 02:55:56,869
actually fill from the bottom up and

3961
02:55:54,889 --> 02:56:01,340
it'll just push the plunger up to

3962
02:55:56,870 --> 02:56:03,050
onenote later I like that so then to do

3963
02:56:01,340 --> 02:56:06,139
that but then like for the you know the

3964
02:56:03,049 --> 02:56:08,750
common folk like you know the best is

3965
02:56:06,139 --> 02:56:10,309
for what we went with is the V and the V

3966
02:56:08,750 --> 02:56:12,319
insert inside the file that has the

3967
02:56:10,309 --> 02:56:16,119
sauce that can you can just grab it with

3968
02:56:12,319 --> 02:56:18,680
a micro dropper to fill up your tank

3969
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:19,910
because then it's like more little parts

3970
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:23,479
you know I was like going through this a

3971
02:56:19,909 --> 02:56:25,309
lot but you know if you're trying to use

3972
02:56:23,479 --> 02:56:28,010
it for an applicator yeah the glass on

3973
02:56:25,309 --> 02:56:29,779
glass is the way to go yeah good to see

3974
02:56:28,010 --> 02:56:30,319
you Jeff by the way long time no see

3975
02:56:29,780 --> 02:56:32,000
brother

3976
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:34,610
yeah good to see you guys like how he

3977
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:36,950
was gone for like eight months and then

3978
02:56:34,610 --> 02:56:38,480
he just pops right in he's just like

3979
02:56:36,950 --> 02:56:40,220
right into it like as if you were just

3980
02:56:38,479 --> 02:56:42,379
like there the whole time yeah I got a

3981
02:56:40,219 --> 02:56:44,689
question real quick that's great to see

02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:18,290
you get here now you're doing co2 like

3995
02:57:15,020 --> 02:57:21,530
you're doing a high terpene co2 yeah

3996
02:57:18,290 --> 02:57:25,340
yeah so we've been doing some really

3997
02:57:21,530 --> 02:57:27,739
high trip in co2 Rossi Oh - so there's

3998
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:30,069
no winterization that's involved in the

3999
02:57:27,739 --> 02:57:32,090
process using really really high quality

4000
02:57:30,069 --> 02:57:33,889
material you don't have all of the

4001
02:57:32,090 --> 02:57:36,469
lipids that are extracted I mean there's

4002
02:57:33,889 --> 02:57:39,170
still lipids don't get me wrong but it's

4003
02:57:36,469 --> 02:57:42,679
it's really you know a high terpene

4004
02:57:39,170 --> 02:57:45,200
content just really liquid extract that

4005
02:57:42,680 --> 02:57:48,739
we're able to put right into a vape cart

4006
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:51,079
and and go with it so you know really

4007
02:57:48,739 --> 02:57:53,690
really been blessed with with the

4008
02:57:51,079 --> 02:57:55,549
ability to work with puffin farm up here

4009
02:57:53,690 --> 02:57:58,100
in Washington State in the legal market

4010
02:57:55,549 --> 02:58:00,139
and you know just just been enjoying

4011
02:57:58,100 --> 02:58:01,488
I'll be a clean green sir

4012
02:58:00,139 --> 02:58:06,079
five material that they're able to

4013
02:58:01,488 --> 02:58:07,609
provide so your process is solving less

4014
02:58:06,079 --> 02:58:09,799
than because you're not winterizing know

4015
02:58:07,609 --> 02:58:11,600
well it's it's a solvent because co2 is

4016
02:58:09,799 --> 02:58:14,179
a solvent a lot of people say you know

4017
02:58:11,600 --> 02:58:16,040
non solvent because it's a totally

4018
02:58:14,180 --> 02:58:19,158
different class but yeah it's it's

4019
02:58:16,040 --> 02:58:22,279
definitely solvent extraction using a

4020
02:58:19,158 --> 02:58:25,699
you know even Labs extractors which is

4021
02:58:22,279 --> 02:58:27,890
what I'm using okay yeah but you know I

4022
02:58:25,699 --> 02:58:31,370
mean using co2 you don't test positive

4023
02:58:27,889 --> 02:58:33,289
for residuals on anything to you well

4024
02:58:31,370 --> 02:58:36,319
I'm not putting any solvents in there

4025
02:58:33,290 --> 02:58:38,810
and and two off gases as soon as it gets

4026
02:58:36,318 --> 02:58:42,439
to back to the you know regular

4027
02:58:38,809 --> 02:58:46,488
atmosphere so there's no co2 residual in

4028
02:58:42,439 --> 02:58:49,068
there you know at least not after 24

4029
02:58:46,488 --> 02:58:52,219
hours everything is off gassed out of

4030
02:58:49,068 --> 02:58:54,049
there but but yeah no secondary solvents

4031
02:58:52,219 --> 02:58:56,148
at all so yeah so that's what I always

4032
02:58:54,049 --> 02:58:57,738
try to tell people winter so there's a

4033
02:58:56,148 --> 02:59:00,559
that fine line when supposed to go to

4034
02:58:57,738 --> 02:59:03,170
co2 extractors its solvent listen like

4035
02:59:00,559 --> 02:59:05,658
well it only be solvent lists and then I

4036
02:59:03,170 --> 02:59:07,488
can under you know we can argue the

4037
02:59:05,658 --> 02:59:09,709
definition the solvent but in the end in

4038
02:59:07,488 --> 02:59:11,920
the end here ultimately what we're

4039
02:59:09,709 --> 02:59:14,419
putting in our lungs doesn't contain any

4040
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:17,090
footprint from a solvent if you're not

4041
02:59:14,420 --> 02:59:19,908
winterizing with alcohol we're a lot of

4042
02:59:17,090 --> 02:59:21,770
co2 companies winterize with alcohol

4043
02:59:19,908 --> 02:59:23,539
grain alcohol then they have to put it

4044
02:59:21,770 --> 02:59:25,970
in a rotor vac and they have to distill

4045
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:29,479
it out and there's always like that some

4046
02:59:25,969 --> 02:59:32,299
small percentage of alcohol weight so in

4047
02:59:29,478 --> 02:59:34,250
my mind what you're doing you know is a

4048
02:59:32,299 --> 02:59:37,209
very clean version of the co2 it's a

4049
02:59:34,250 --> 02:59:39,680
solvent free I would say that because

4050
02:59:37,209 --> 02:59:43,849
solvents left in in the extract

4051
02:59:39,680 --> 02:59:46,130
afterwards yeah it's a gas that's turned

4052
02:59:43,850 --> 02:59:48,680
into a liquid then back into a gas it's

4053
02:59:46,129 --> 02:59:53,420
a the extraction is actually done in a

4054
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:54,130
super critical pressure yeah I'm down

4055
02:59:53,420 --> 02:59:57,049
with that

4056
02:59:54,129 --> 03:00:00,408
with the cannabinoid concentration in

4057
02:59:57,049 --> 03:00:04,000
your extract it varies between the high

4058
03:00:00,408 --> 03:00:06,500
40s and the low 60s

4059
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:09,379
so it's suffice to say there is a fair

4060
03:00:06,500 --> 03:00:11,590
amount of lipids in there well yeah

4061
03:00:09,379 --> 03:00:14,399
there's also a large amount of other

4062
03:00:11,590 --> 03:00:16,800
constituents as well like Turkey

4063
03:00:14,399 --> 03:00:19,319
like we've gotten up to 26% so that's

4064
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:22,409
taking a huge bite out of what you know

4065
03:00:19,319 --> 03:00:26,069
out of that that would be an 86% oil if

4066
03:00:22,409 --> 03:00:27,630
you test 60 and 20 see exactly and then

4067
03:00:26,069 --> 03:00:29,761
there's the flavonoids the other

4068
03:00:27,630 --> 03:00:33,989
constituents that are extractable under

4069
03:00:29,761 --> 03:00:36,120
co2 supercritical so then unfortunately

4070
03:00:33,989 --> 03:00:39,539
we're not testing or at the moment I

4071
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:41,131
wish that I could get an NMR done on all

4072
03:00:39,540 --> 03:00:43,471
of my extracts so that I could really

4073
03:00:41,130 --> 03:00:46,109
know what was in there but unfortunately

4074
03:00:43,470 --> 03:00:49,050
it's just not not viable at the moment

4075
03:00:46,110 --> 03:00:52,261
in our industry I would love to send you

4076
03:00:49,050 --> 03:00:54,149
a blank kit for you to try the reusable

4077
03:00:52,261 --> 03:00:57,060
Trinity tanks because I think you would

4078
03:00:54,149 --> 03:01:01,681
like them oh yes specifically with the

4079
03:00:57,060 --> 03:01:03,479
oil that you just described if you put

4080
03:01:01,681 --> 03:01:05,399
your address in the little chat not in

4081
03:01:03,479 --> 03:01:07,170
the youtube one send me it there I'll

4082
03:01:05,399 --> 03:01:08,761
send you one because I texted over to

4083
03:01:07,170 --> 03:01:10,800
you I got your number as long as hasn't

4084
03:01:08,761 --> 03:01:12,500
changed yeah it texts me over because

4085
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:16,020
I'll just be curious to see what your

4086
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:18,899
what your high chirping co2 raw would be

4087
03:01:16,021 --> 03:01:20,579
like in one of these yeah all kinds of

4088
03:01:18,899 --> 03:01:22,979
different oil in it you know everybody's

4089
03:01:20,579 --> 03:01:27,601
oil just to see yeah I'd better be

4090
03:01:22,979 --> 03:01:30,630
spectacular I tried some there were some

4091
03:01:27,601 --> 03:01:32,700
holy water like the newer version

4092
03:01:30,630 --> 03:01:36,750
obviously like the solvent free holy

4093
03:01:32,700 --> 03:01:38,940
water then I had had some distillate

4094
03:01:36,750 --> 03:01:41,819
some cold drop distillate in Terps it's

4095
03:01:38,940 --> 03:01:44,521
pretty good I find it like it's it's

4096
03:01:41,819 --> 03:01:46,440
better suited for a little bit thicker

4097
03:01:44,521 --> 03:01:47,131
oil you know it's better suited for what

4098
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:49,890
you're talking about

4099
03:01:47,130 --> 03:01:50,699
like it's good for rosin hash rods in

4100
03:01:49,890 --> 03:01:52,409
which are peens

4101
03:01:50,700 --> 03:01:54,870
it's good for like an oil that's a

4102
03:01:52,409 --> 03:01:56,341
little bit thicker it works fine with

4103
03:01:54,870 --> 03:02:01,801
the thinner ones but I think you would

4104
03:01:56,341 --> 03:02:03,659
find it yeah this co2 is it has like a

4105
03:02:01,800 --> 03:02:06,060
thickness that happens when it kind of

4106
03:02:03,659 --> 03:02:09,271
coagulates and sits there but the moment

4107
03:02:06,060 --> 03:02:11,699
that you move it in the vial or in you

4108
03:02:09,271 --> 03:02:13,771
know it just turns right to a liquid

4109
03:02:11,700 --> 03:02:16,170
without even any heat so you can

4110
03:02:13,771 --> 03:02:18,091
literally drip it out of the syringes

4111
03:02:16,170 --> 03:02:20,970
which is yeah that's kind of like what I

4112
03:02:18,091 --> 03:02:23,729
noticed exactly the same thing so like

4113
03:02:20,970 --> 03:02:25,380
this is this is a once you hit like 15

4114
03:02:23,729 --> 03:02:27,959
percent I mean if I took this off I'll

4115
03:02:25,380 --> 03:02:31,680
show you same thing it just drips

4116
03:02:27,959 --> 03:02:32,369
I mean it literally just like like

4117
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:36,359
dreads

4118
03:02:32,370 --> 03:02:38,430
yeah yep exactly that's the same

4119
03:02:36,359 --> 03:02:40,170
viscosity is what we're dealing with up

4120
03:02:38,430 --> 03:02:42,120
here for sure the tank you're gonna love

4121
03:02:40,170 --> 03:02:44,909
the tank that is that is designed for

4122
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:46,229
excellent well I'm glad to glad to try

4123
03:02:44,909 --> 03:02:51,869
it out and I'll let you know how it

4124
03:02:46,228 --> 03:02:54,778
works out yep I'm getting ready to put a

4125
03:02:51,870 --> 03:02:56,520
whole bunch of them and wash them in ice

4126
03:02:54,779 --> 03:03:00,000
so I'm gonna try that dark thing you

4127
03:02:56,520 --> 03:03:03,840
said Marcus the I'm gonna try one of the

4128
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:06,689
tanks in the dark clear Oh in the DC

4129
03:03:03,840 --> 03:03:08,130
yeah why not yeah of course I'm gonna

4130
03:03:06,689 --> 03:03:10,050
I'm about to clean some of the near

4131
03:03:08,129 --> 03:03:13,469
future here as well my two are just done

4132
03:03:10,049 --> 03:03:16,228
so I will be cleaning some and hopefully

4133
03:03:13,469 --> 03:03:18,238
making a video I am at the 3-hour point

4134
03:03:16,228 --> 03:03:19,709
I promised my family I would go hang out

4135
03:03:18,238 --> 03:03:22,829
with my little guy it's his birthday

4136
03:03:19,709 --> 03:03:24,509
number three number three birthday so I

4137
03:03:22,829 --> 03:03:27,000
would like to say thank you to everyone

4138
03:03:24,510 --> 03:03:30,540

4139
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:32,939
to skunk man Sam - Wade - Jeff church to

4140
03:03:30,540 --> 03:03:37,890
the Dragonfly medicine crew - Marcie

4141
