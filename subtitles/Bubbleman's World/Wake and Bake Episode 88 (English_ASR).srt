30
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,669
because let's be honest I need one there

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,320

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,829
blowing out can't even keep up with that

33
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,478
[ __ ]

34
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,728
gonna have a nice little wake and bake

35
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,090
this morning if we can get the oil from

36
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:33,030
being stuck to my fingers it's really

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,609
not coming off is it sometimes little

38
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,890
shards of rosin can stick to your finger

39
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,920
in a way that you just can't get it off

40
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,118
I think I'm just gonna stop trying

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,680
because really it's not so bad to have a

42
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,828
little rosin on your fingers right a

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,780

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:47,879
sound on my god Kayleigh that was in

74
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:53,929

Omar you want to hit some full melt yes

76
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:59,750
[Laughter]

77
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:20,959
how many times a day do you rip well as

78
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,519
often as I can I'm not gonna lie ripping

79
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,019
doesn't really affect me the way it

80
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:29,079
affects a lot of the people that I smoke

81
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:31,639
with I don't really get destroyed

82
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:35,180
well sticks the way you get a legends

83
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,560
shirt does you go to legends you don't

84
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,079
get a legend shirts if you don't go to

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,610
legends and each shirt is unique and

86
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,589
different to the legends that you would

87
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,150
go to and so of course I could make a

88
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:46,909
ton of cash selling legends shirts

89
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:48,049
people asking for them all the time but

90
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,380
I think the really cool thing about

91
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,150
legends is that if you don't go you just

92
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:58,219
you don't get to represent you have to

93
00:04:53,149 --> 00:05:00,349
go to represent oh dude last Sunday's

94
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,740
hashed Church was my favorite my top

95
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,050
favorite it made me realize that nobody

96
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,120
on the panel is the most important that

97
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,250
has Church is bigger than all of us and

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,759
that we proved it by all of us leaving

99
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,250
the panel and having a completely

100
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,259
different panel Natasha did a pretty

101
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,240
incredible job along with Hilary in

102
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,879
moderating and organizing and setting up

103
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,160
all those women they straight owned

104
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,379
hashed hurts let me tell you I'm not

105
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,020
sure if they knew how well they were

106
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:31,129
doing the whole time but I know some of

107
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:33,319
the women were a little uncomfortable

108
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:38,209
that they don't normally talk in that

109
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:42,589
sort of setting but well my thoughts on

110
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:44,120
that DJ 3000 who asked I'd like to know

111
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:45,079
your thoughts on CBD isolate do you

112
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,269
think it's a good idea or do you believe

113
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,250
in the full plant extraction try not to

114
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:50,899
get locked up in one's own belief

115
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,870
systems do I think it's a good idea of

116
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:55,668
course it's a good idea regardless of

117
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,470
whether it's gonna be a good idea for me

118
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:59,990
I know it's gonna be a good idea for

119
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,150
someone monomolecular medicines along

120
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,250
with terpenes can be made into very

121
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:06,529
accurate recipes that can be recreated

122
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,620
time and time again and for people who

123
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:12,649
suffer from Crohn's and from the

124
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,810
Parkinson's and from different forms of

125
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:17,359
epilepsy particularly neurological

126
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,459
problems they require sometimes very

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,689
specific ratios that need to be very

128
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,878
very accurate

129
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,799
when we grow cannabis sometimes

130
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,509
variables can change something can

131
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:29,478
change from one crop to the next and you

132
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:32,059
can actually change your terpene profile

133
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:35,058
just enough that you probably would not

134
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:38,929
see the same effects for that patient

135
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:40,819
now so for me I want everything that we

136
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:42,408
have I just because I don't use mono

137
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:43,729
molecular medicine doesn't mean that I

138
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:46,399
wouldn't fight for it and I would

139
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:48,829
certainly say the people who are against

140
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,360
it why not spend your time and your

141
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:52,249
energy maybe doing something a little

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,800
bit more positive like fighting for what

143
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:56,809
you want that you don't have rather than

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,389
fighting against something people do

145
00:06:56,809 --> 00:07:02,479
have and that they do want we got to

146
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:05,499
stop fighting for what's already there I

147
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,498
mean for real

148
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,389
that's my opinion and I think it was a

149
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:14,178
great question and I was happy to answer

150
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,788
it made me feel like another bond rapid

151
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:19,158
knocking lie knocking my god the bar

152
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:20,568
grab Turk gifts are just so delicious I

153
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:22,788
think I'm gonna go in for some lemon

154
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:29,300
tree this time I will go for a little

155
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:31,610
bit of smaller dab the new pen was

156
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,110
designed to work with Terp sauce that's

157
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,968
not to say it won't work with a whole

158
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,610
bunch of other things but we designed

159
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:41,509
the new pen to work with a terpene

160
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,179
infused rosin like distillate which is

161
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,759
not a distillate we didn't use any

162
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:49,668
chemical petrochemical solvents I think

163
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,588
that you guys will see the pen is gonna

164
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:54,308
be very nice it's we've been working on

165
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:57,019
it for almost a year just so you know

166
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:57,699
this shirt I think this shirt is like 25

167
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:02,300
bucks

168
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:04,879
it's a embroidery so it's a it's a hard

169
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,749
patch you can get him up at bubble bag

170
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,360
calm exactly so Dauntless sauce all

171
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:12,739
these people have been doing these a

172
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,050
distillate pens and they put in fruit

173
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:16,549
terpenes or whatever gold dropped put in

174
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,079
the blue river terpenes and they were

175
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,788
crushing it so it was really a true

176
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,649
inspiration from gold drop and our

177
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:23,988
friend Gary who owns Omicron that maybe

178
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:26,209
we should create our own pen I told Tony

179
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:28,278
I can't put my name on just any pen I

180
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,990
just can't do it I I don't like the idea

181
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:32,568
of people buying pens and throwing them

182
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,960
away that's so [ __ ] wasteful so we

183
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,879
started talking about eight months

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,150
to go and started discussing the idea of

185
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:42,539
potentially creating a reusable pen a

186
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:45,059
pen that can be refillable and a pen

187
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,759
that has no wires no solder no

188
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:50,429
insulation no plastic no motherboards

189
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,069
near the element that can that can heat

190
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:55,559
up so it's listen we may learn that the

191
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,470
pen can be improved even even better but

192
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,299
trust that Tony and myself and Gary has

193
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,550
spent eight months designing and

194
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:04,019
creating and coming up with this pen so

195
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,519
that we could feel good about putting

196
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,949
the bubbleman brand in the Blue River

197
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,199
brand terpene name on that pen as well

198
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,600
as Omicron because I mean he does really

199
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,420
high-end work I wouldn't want him to put

200
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,290
his brand name on anything that was less

201
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:22,559
than the best so that's what we're

202
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:24,179
trying for we should have them by August

203
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,009
first and for those of you that are

204
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,989
wondering yes we are selling them filled

205
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:32,419
up with rosin and terpenes that'll be in

206
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:35,039
the California market Tony has a new

207
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:37,229
company that he's working with that is a

208
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,959
delivery service called Anki delivery

209
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,120
and that's going to be delivering those

210
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,530
pens all over California we definitely

211
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,629
gonna be bringing the Pens to Jamaica

212
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm hoping on getting the Pens up in

213
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:51,509
Canada once the legal mechanism exists

214
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,310
for that and we'll try to get it into as

215
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,470
many states as we can for now we're

216
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:58,019
focused on Cali keep in mind the Pens

217
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,210
for us was like it's kind of like the

218
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,129
bubble box the pen is very much like the

219
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,500
bubble box I want to turn people on to

220
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:07,649
how to enjoy these extracts with

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,490
terpenes and without in a way that is

222
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,370
next-level

223
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,889
and so if we can get them the best pen

224
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,210
possible that leads them into a dabbing

225
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,830
experience because that's what the pen

226
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,470
is like it's like hitting a really nice

227
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,930
dab it is so unbelievably tasty you

228
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,940
can't believe it and the bubble box was

229
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:25,859
a very similar thing I was sending

230
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,840
selling the bubble box to people who are

231
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,879
joint smokers and I was trying to teach

232
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,379
them about making hash so they'd be

233
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,269
breaking up their buds and rolling their

234
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,279
joints over this little screen I'd tell

235
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:37,500
them you know you know after many joints

236
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,720
lift up the screen card through this

237
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,700
first screen to this to the bottom and

238
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,860
then card for awhile and suddenly people

239
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,900
who were just smoking joints we're

240
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,180
getting full melt dry stuff the holy

241
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,519
grail of extracts there's many

242
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,219
paths down this road of extraction and

243
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,439
trust me they're exciting each and every

244
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,810
one of them but the end of the path is

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,810
perfectly grown micro encapsulated

246
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:08,579
glandular trichomes resin heads isolated

247
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:11,639
to near perfection 99.9% heads yeah you

248
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,500
know how it's the Holy Grail ask anyone

249
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,569
if they have it next time you're at a

250
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,159
cannabis event and there's like hundreds

251
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,649
of people in the audience and if you're

252
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,389
up on stage say hey could you please put

253
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:24,450
your hand up if you have full melt dry

254
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,970
sift and you might see a couple of hands

255
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,028
go up I did it at the Cannabis Cup years

256
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,610
ago everyone will have oil everyone will

257
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:35,639
have oil boxes and boxes of oil

258
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,259
very few people although much more than

259
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,870
in the past will have a full mount

260
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:43,490
bubble hash you know maybe maybe a dozen

261
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,799
maybe two dozen but full melt dry sift

262
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:49,259
you'll be very very very surprised that

263
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:56,419
just not many people have it it's not

264
00:11:49,259 --> 00:12:00,720
that often that you see it 99.9% heads

265
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:02,458
that's that 99 dunk him up on me this

266
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,850
stuff was just both of these were not

267
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:07,739
really what I would call now these are

268
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,110
99.9 percent heads however both growers

269
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,450
didn't really hit the mark and so they

270
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,278
were kind of like what does full melt

271
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,310
actually mean okay nine-inch colas a

272
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,439
long time ago and about not 2000 maybe I

273
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,359
was at the Cannabis Cup and I was

274
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,180
hanging out with skunk man Sam and we

275
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,389
were smoking on his full melt you know

276
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,789
clear dome dry sift and we were smoking

277
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:32,458
on it on a screen on a very tight tight

278
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:35,789
stainless steel screen in his little

279
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:37,859
pipe and I'd be like yeah when it's when

280
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:40,828
it when it melts like water I call it

281
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,959
full melt and then Sam says yeah and

282
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:44,489
when it's really really high quality not

283
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,969
only will it melt like water but it'll

284
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,799
bubble up these big giant clear domes

285
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,420
and I'm like yeah that's the full melt

286
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,599
clear dome and that's literally the

287
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:57,000
moment that we point the phrase FM CD as

288
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,339
well as full melt and as well as clear

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,339
dome both all three different kind of

290
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,929
titles if you will so that's where those

291
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,399
titles came to be

292
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:10,870
that's right Connor Jake is very few

293
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,059
people have it and when you have it

294
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:16,210
you're a rock star look at cubed he has

295
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:18,519
it rock star you know suddenly that [ __ ]

296
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,170
disappears less of a rock star it's the

297
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,909
big it's a big deal to have full melter

298
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:23,500
I sift not many people have it and it's

299
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:26,469
one of the things that bubble man brand

300
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,409
is absolutely going to be bringing you

301
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,310
in California in the very near future

302
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,519
already been talking with some people

303
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,209
about sift that they have to clean and

304
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,500
well Macke

305
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:41,080
Chloe grow something I believe was his

306
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,210
name that one he I asked who took the

307
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,790
picture of me in the Avatar which was me

308
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:49,509
smelling the buds in Jamaica and he said

309
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:54,719
Johnny B and I said you won and so he

310
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,720
won so let's have another rib shall we

311
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,610
let's do it yes I did zero one two three

312
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,750
four five six seven eight nine nine

313
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,279
eight seven six five four three two one

314
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,110
zero

315
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:22,240
nice palindrome name by the way I like

316
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:23,740
the space it really sets the tone hard

317
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,930
to say it depends on how much we pay for

318
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,220
the pounds I mean we just really you

319
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:32,259
know we're not trying to destroy people

320
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,769
we're trying to sell the for the lowest

321
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,769
price possible

322
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,330
yeah I'm hitting the Sapphire aqua every

323
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,960
time I'm at home I'm hitting the

324
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,210
Sapphire

325
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,080
unless I'm torching and then obviously

326
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,080
I'm hittin the quartz

327
00:14:51,820 --> 00:15:01,040
well the escrow Tacoma we do use local

328
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,559
retail partners ideally ideally people

329
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,019
that have licensing in place that are

330
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:09,409
already growing or have processing and

331
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:11,120
want to you know bring in our brands we

332
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,789
can come in with the SOP and some people

333
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,980
trained up make sure that the quality is

334
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:23,389
on point cuz I just we just can't put

335
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:27,050
the brand name on just any quality yummy

336
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,759
so yeah it's about it we're definitely

337
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:32,778
looking to what well you don't clean the

338
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:35,299
Sapphire the Sapphire just gets gets a

339
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:37,789
q-tip you don't put south a DC glass

340
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:43,389
cleaner on sapphire it'll crack sapphire

341
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:45,439
can't change heat that fast all right

342
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,088
let's make gold and dry sifting it was

343
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,200
full melt 99 percent dry sipped and I

344
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,910
got it from a whole bunch of super

345
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,810
strong bud with tons of track the

346
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:55,669
brighter screen there you go a lot of

347
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:57,019
times people think it's 99% but if you

348
00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:01,309
look at it under a microscope

349
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:06,230
99% is really hard to get this is a

350
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:08,958
abracadabra it's actually quite hot well

351
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,000
let me hold up the other one cuz I do

352
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,289
have another one here just put it

353
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,389
together for it this is the one most

354
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:25,519
people like like even more than the

355
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:27,588
other one Flower of Life well not

356
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,079
necessarily trim it I'll I'll we'll

357
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,180
bring in people and potentially you know

358
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,129
it's SOP so depending on the company and

359
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:36,620
the professionality and whether it's

360
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:39,080
worthwhile to assign contracts and get

361
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,509
that information the SOP in the know-how

362
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,009
is very well protected with sift we

363
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,830
would probably send someone to do that

364
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:48,620
job someone could come in and do you

365
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:55,700
know five to 10 kilos in a couple of

366

377
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:32,548
I'd love to get this up to 300 I'd love

378
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:37,440
to get it up and beyond but it is what

379
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:41,599
it is we do what we do oh thank you

380
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,889
whoever just said that about the Hat I

381
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,678
don't know I'm not Health Canada you'd

382
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:49,259
have to ask them those it's the

383
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,548
government listen if you're gonna have

384
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,658
that attitude with the government you

385
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:54,359
should do this send in your application

386
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,340
and if you get it within a year you

387
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,259
should do a backflip that way and when

388
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,388
it comes back in like four or five or

389
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,339
six months you'll be so happy because

390
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:04,408
it'll be way less than a year but if you

391
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:06,148
expected in four or five or six months I

392
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:07,409
bet you it takes a year it's the

393
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:10,469
government they're the worst

394
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:13,010
they're like the only people worse at

395
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,028
communicating than the government are

396
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:19,589
telecommunication companies so like

397
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:22,440
Verizon and AT&amp;T and Virgin and Fido and

398
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:26,819
Rogers and [ __ ] Telus those companies

399
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,470
are literally the worst at communicating

400
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:30,058
which is amazing when you think about it

401
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,839
because they are a telecommunications

402
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:36,690
company it's kind of a weird irony I

403
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,339
think yeah that's that's how it that's

404
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,179
how you do it melty heads puffs with the

405

00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,909
that I got turned on very very long time

440
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:34,160
ago

441
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,810
yeah pharmacy you said you were sending

442
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,940
a box a while ago I'm definitely I

443
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:39,919
always go to the p.o box cuz I hate to

444
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,350
forget so if you say you're sending

445
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,090
something let me know and I won't you

446
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:49,609
know just randomly not go to my P o box

447
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:51,709
for 10 days everything was straight

448
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:53,240
trikes now when you say straight trikes

449
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,140
are you talking about the entire

450
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,299
trichome or just the heads or were the

451
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,520
little stalks in there - Alonso because

452
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,740
that's what most people don't understand

453
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,529
is the entire trichome is not active

454
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,200
only the heads are active it's dry sift

455
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:11,930
with stocks in it is very easy to make

456
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,819
its we call it farmers grade but getting

457
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,789
the stalks out is like the most

458
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:19,250
impossible like most difficult really

459
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:21,769
really really difficult thing and the

460
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,849
word the pot the word is in the in the

461
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:26,389
photos you know when you see

462
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:28,730
really beautiful perfectly you know

463
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,370
isolated glandular trichomes heads yeah

464
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,319
dawn 710 heads like heads like dried

465
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:37,279
trichome heads you know see those little

466
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,779
kind of heads there good evening Andrew

467
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,750
to you good morning and good afternoon

468
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:43,250
to everyone else I think that covers it

469
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,779
all it is the Holy Grail

470
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:50,990
it's 100% yeah I mean it's just farmers

471
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:52,549
grade lots of people show me sift it

472
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,140
looks gold to the naked eye when you

473
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:58,039
don't know you don't know and when you

474
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:02,390
yeah yeah 150 160 180 200 140 it's all

475
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,950
farmers grade John we only care about

476
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,380
the heads that's correct and here's the

477
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,299
thing when you separate out the

478
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,540
trichomes as buddy was saying and it's

479
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:13,609
all gold and there's no herb you know no

480
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,889
green in it that's fine but that's not

481
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:19,519
we're not even close to done yet now you

482
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,190
have heads in a ratio to stocks that is

483
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,200
almost like the ratio of trichomes that

484
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,539
you had to plant matter so you have to

485
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,220
clean it twice you get the sift off the

486
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:29,690
bud but then when you get the sift you

487
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,130
think you've done a concentrate you

488
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,350
haven't you've done a farmers grade

489
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,320
isolation what you really need to do now

490
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:40,039
is you need to get rid of that 80%

491
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:43,279
contaminant that is non glandular okay

492
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:46,970
it's the stock it's the system of hairs

493
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:52,160
it's it's it's non glandular material it

494
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,660
is not glandular trichomes heads so what

495
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,440
are you saying there Shelly Simpson I

496
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:00,860
give good what I love any grade well

497
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,299
luster that's cool I personally it's not

498
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,309
even a grade though glandular trichomes

499
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,500
stalks is not a grade if you isolate

500
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:09,470
them out from heads and you try to dab

501
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,660
them you will not have an effect other

502
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:17,569
than like you just dabbed cellulose or

503
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:19,370
paper whoa MD 73 I get blonde - and you

504
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:23,689
get blonde - from washing bud stem

505
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:27,799
because those glands seem to be just the

506
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:31,640
the lightest and and freshest color ever

507
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,440
they I've always gotten near white when

508
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,160
it comes from the stock even the st.

509
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,900
stocks that have come from a

510
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,509
an older crop that went a week and a

511
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,450
half past due and had very amber heads

512
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:44,430
still white on the stalk so there's

513
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,740
definitely something to be said for the

514
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,390
the stock hash I've made bubble with

515
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,279
just stock you can do it too you

516
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,350
literally get exactly what that

517
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:57,389
gentleman just said the whitest hash

518
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:58,949
it's quite neat well it does take a

519
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:05,520
while dirts you got to put your time in

520
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:06,569
you got to put your time in you got to

521
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,039
put your time in

522
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:12,480
I don't smoke pho anything I was at a

523
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,069
friend's house the other day what did he

524
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,980
he's like hey you want some of the he

525
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:18,899
had his his distillate that he was all

526
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,000
and he's he's getting some some some

527
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,830
trichome some resin that he's gonna be

528
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,099
putting on it but I'm just like I don't

529
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:28,169
care about it at all I will try to find

530
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:32,219
a picture of it though so you can see it

531
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:36,200
he had quite a bit of it this is his

532
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,200
distillate some of it was very clear

533
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:42,029
they were doing their thing with it but

534
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,589
I just it does you know once again I

535
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:45,089
wouldn't fight against it I'm glad

536
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:47,399
people have access to it but it's not

537
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:49,289
for me I'm not excited about smoking

538
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,759
distillate I'm excited about smoking

539
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:56,549
really beautifully grown cultivars with

540
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:58,950
beautiful extractions you know of all

541
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,930
sorts from DRI sifted obviously dry

542
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,090
sifting is a huge one because you don't

543
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:07,140
have a footprint you don't have a

544
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:10,319
footprint when you dry sift you know mmm

545
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,880
that's important this lid is what you do

546
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,029
with bad material it's what a lot of

547
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,100
people are doing for sure it made the

548
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:18,420
outdoor cannabis community here very

549
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,639
happy because everyone just takes their

550
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,580
outdoor that wasn't selling I didn't go

551
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,720
to the Turk mansion actually and they're

552
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,869
just you know turning it into

553
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,240
cannabinoids

554
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:31,429
which is great the world needs more

555
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,349
cannabinoids you know it's just not my

556
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:37,350
I'm not interested in focusing on that I

557
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:40,049
have a little bit different of an agenda

558
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,909
for the for the community that I want or

559
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:44,490
what I want to release and so that's the

560
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,980
beauty of the spice of life we all get

561
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,599
to choose what we want to choose so yeah

562
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,730
you know for me survivor

563
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,559
I mean not just solvents but like the

564
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,990
petrochemical based solvents that's

565
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,149
really who I'm trying to skip out on the

566
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:00,900
best that I can but it's near impossible

567
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:04,290
I still put it in my dirt bike and in

568
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,980
Mike you know sled and in my truck and

569
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:08,639
in my boat and in my van and in my car

570
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,940
am I gonna do

571
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,530
hopefully I'll go electric one day well

572
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,570
that's good Sal that you have that

573
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:17,970
access to be able to take it and get to

574
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:19,769
sleep it's pretty darn important you and

575
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,180
Amelia what is Amelia and Terra laughs

576
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:28,139
and that Terra's always saying funny

577
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:30,900
[ __ ] well I mean scale domes not really

578
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,320
a dumbass he's actually very intelligent

579
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,700
and has a PhD to back it up I know where

580
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:37,859
he was coming from but at the same time

581
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,380
I know exactly where Sam was coming from

582
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:43,169
- the beautiful thing about information

583
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,540
is you know it's it's about like

584
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,120
shallowness sharing information that he

585
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,649
knows to be true

586
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,750
Sam is saying listen whether it's true

587
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,460
or not we don't really want to be you

588
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,079
know like well Sam doesn't really want

589
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,370
to be but what Sam has to understand is

590
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,379
because he has a very strong belief

591
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:59,759
system that there's the other side of

592
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,280
the coin of the people who will still

593
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,049
continue to sell that [ __ ] in the

594
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,879
industry regardless of whether it's been

595
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:08,519
cleaned or not so if they can clean it

596
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,880
there is absolutely no argument that

597
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:14,220
that's that that's better than if they

598
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,980
can't I mean they're already selling it

599
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:21,360
people are inhaling poison dude all day

600
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:24,029
long all day long so I got to understand

601
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:26,549
I was on Sam's side of the fence but as

602
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:29,519
I realize hash Church is so much bigger

603
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:32,339
than us and our little opinions and I

604
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,049
look at the information I see well it

605
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,679
was you know [ __ ] I wouldn't have said

606
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:38,129
it either

607
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,539
but that's why I hashed churches a panel

608
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,730
that's why hash search has a bunch of

609
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:45,899
different people so that someone will

610
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:47,460
say it you know oh you're welcome Tara

611
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,250
Lee I don't know if it was a shout out

612
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,960
but how about this now I'm sure yeah and

613
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,700
I'm shout now people that asked me to

614
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,049
shout them out on their birthday my god

615
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,150
there was a guy who said it was his

616
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:59,369
birthday and I think it's his birthday

617
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,110
today and I definitely have to spend a

618
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:02,099
few seconds just going through my inbox

619
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:05,669
here

620
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:07,379
to see which guy this was we gotta wish

621
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,680

622
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,780
for me to forget about if I already

623
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,450
missed it and I apologize dude I just

624
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:16,799

626
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,369
18th it would really make my day

627
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,100

637
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,720

638
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:50,789
minutes talking about him and

671
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:50,929
pin I think that's right proper no I

672
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,610
mean Joseph Lewis who the [ __ ] is seeing

673
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,779
a higher trichome count and how are they

674
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:56,089
doing that are they counting their

675
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:57,589
trichomes I photograph many many

676
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:00,730
different cannabis plants and I can tell

677
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:03,949
you that trichome density tricone growth

678
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,930
changes all over the plant it's

679
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,269
ever-changing there's constantly

680
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:13,789
trichomes growing at new times and and

681
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:16,009
maturing at different rates but you

682
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,839
could you could measure the cannabinoids

683
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,599
and the terpene content to find out if

684
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,039
you're getting more but having a higher

685
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,500
concentration of heads won't necessarily

686
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:25,879
give you that if the wax membrane is so

687
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,490
thick and you have a very very small

688
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,870
amount of the goods inside so it really

689
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,529
depends on how well you grew those

690
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:33,349
trichomes

691
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:34,910
I think Turpin aider personally I don't

692
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:37,309
believe in it it's not something I would

693
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,529
tell people to buy I'm not trying to

694
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,599
call out the product I haven't used it

695
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:43,579
but I did go to Ramos I did visit his

696
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,889
grow when he was using it and I just

697
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:48,470
felt like San Remo like all your [ __ ]

698
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,210
was is amazing like this Terminator does

699
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,410
not look any better than the

700
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,090
one next to it that doesn't have

701
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,790
Terpening or like it's just beautiful

702
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:57,349
beautiful grower so Remo can throw any

703
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,849
product and do is grow and as long as it

704
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,889
doesn't kill or affect his [ __ ]

705
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:03,799
negatively that those companies are

706
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:06,530
stoked because Remo is a really good

707
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:09,079
grower obviously he based his food on

708
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:11,180
that I haven't used his food as I was

709
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:12,740
staying in a more organic line although

710
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,810
I heard recently he did announce that

711
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,400
his line was vegan I'm not too sure

712
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:18,769
about that I'm sure it's true if he's

713
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,750
saying it a lot of people I know are

714
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:24,950
grown with it and having fun I'm more

715
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:27,259
interested in brews teas compost the

716
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,819
soil balance Pro that Peters been

717
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:32,420
talking about I have a real interest of

718
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:33,289
learning about those bacteria it's

719
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,720
interesting stuff

720
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,649
yeah Remo is damn straight he's he he

721
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:43,789
knows what he's doing

722
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:45,380
oh yeah yeah you just can't get one size

723
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:47,659
head although I will tell you that there

724
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,160
are sized heads in plants that if you

725
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,140
separate them all out by their different

726
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,460
sizes you will have a favorite mm-hmm

727
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,290
well I think they're already kind of

728
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:07,190
like these fruit Terps and you know

729
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:09,889
false Terps as I would say Wow well I

730
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,870
think indras full of [ __ ] if he's saying

731
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,670
[ __ ] like that and if he's saying [ __ ]

732
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:15,589
that I said I can tell you for sure

733
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,660
Indra might be losing his mind I'm not

734
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:19,730
too sure why he would say that on his

735
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,610
live stream I think it's one of the

736
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:24,410
reasons I'm you know Todd left was Indra

737
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:25,849
was getting more and more negative and

738
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,529
negative and really the last few

739
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:29,480
episodes he was on the only reason he

740
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:32,000
was being nicer is because I had to tell

741
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,950
him listen dude like if you if you saw

742
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,769
him when he first started his Instagram

743
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,080
account it got bad fast I mean he went

744
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:41,990
from being this really cool spiritual

745
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:45,799
old guy with amazing stories to very

746
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:47,450
very negative and nasty fast and so I'm

747
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,289
not too sure what's going on in his head

748
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:53,180
I'm sure he's feeling a little upset as

749
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:56,089
he's you know in this sort of experience

750
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,430
with Todd but I wouldn't fan the flames

751
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:00,289
Indra I think you should drop it and I

752
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,789
definitely think you should keep my name

753
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,000
out of your mouth when you're talking

754
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:07,589
about things that ice

755
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,360
because that that just doesn't sound

756
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:12,789
sound right at all it's too bad it's too

757
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,899
bad you know I liked Indra III like

758
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:19,449
Indra I just I see he has this dichotomy

759
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:21,579
where he's just this he's he tells these

760
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:23,289
amazing stories he's all spiritual and

761
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:25,329
then all of a sudden on this other side

762
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:28,449
he's socially poisoning and he's saying

763
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:29,889
things that are really nasty and I don't

764
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,319
know I'm not gonna spend too much time

765
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:35,530
on it but it's definitely true that you

766
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,230
could see a little bit less of Indra in

767
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,120
hashed Church I mean you know I just

768
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,369
don't want to see that I even in hash

769
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,349
Church chat he'll hold it down and you

770
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:44,799
guys ask him all the questions about his

771
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,440
machine

772
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,240
I really would wish you didn't I wish

773
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,539
you would ask him that stuff in private

774
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,428
and not make it all about that while

775
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:58,480
he's in this chatroom so now I've said

776
00:34:54,429 --> 00:35:01,450
my piece and it is what it is I hope you

777
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:06,039
guys are still baked and I hope you guys

778
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:07,839
are I mean well todd has his only show

779
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,460
Kaylee and it's a pretty awesome show

780
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,530
you can check it out on his channel

781
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,110
and I don't think Todd will be coming

782
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,750
back I think it's it's a growth for the

783
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:18,940
better it's a growth for the better and

784
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,760
who knows maybe you'll see Indra on his

785
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:27,329
show in the near future who's to know

786
