wherever you

375

see all our friends and kind of get a

378
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,399
bunch of videos for you guys to watch

379
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,919
and

380
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,120
um yeah I guess right now John and I

381
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,719
just going to have a quick little rip

382
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,640
each we're going to head down across the

383
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,480
street to Jack asers go grab ourselves a

384
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
bite to eat and then just yeah we

385
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,558
haven't even eaten that was the other

386
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,400
thing we thought all day I thought that

387
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,519
this thing was a a dinner and so we

388
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,160
never ate and then we realized at about

389
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,959
7:00 as we were going to head down there

390
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,519
uh or I guess 7:00 uh yeah 8 minutes

391
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,880
after 8 here Toronto 8 minutes after 8

392
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,319
right I've got all these wrong times so

393
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,120
what because you're looking at computer

394
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:34,798
and your computer says Vancouver time

395
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:39,279
and we're my phone says Toronto time oh

396
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:41,200
nice so that little hit after running

397
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,359
around not being able to actually hit a

398
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,240
dil and do actually a true rip cuz we

399
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,038
were just trying to get there just

400
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,279
changed everything I just woke up I just

401
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,519
like oh my God I just so needed that

402
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,759
it's truly what medicine's about I'm

403
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,599
pretty sure you just witnessed that I

404
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,759
was bagged after that hit I just like

405
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,639
you were laying on the bed 10 minutes

406
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,640
ago I didn't think you I was done I I

407
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,159
was like that cab driver just everything

408
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,480
today those banners putting up all those

409
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,720
Wicked signs it was a great day you know

410
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,440
the only thing that was a bit of a

411
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,038
bummer and you know what sometimes I

412
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,360
follow this in my life sometimes when

413
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,038
there's events that occur that don't

414
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,678
that that that are telling me maybe it's

415
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,038
not right maybe it's not working out

416
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,519
maybe I've learned as I get older to not

417
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:21,879
force those things now it is a real

418
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,319
bummer that we don't get to be there for

419
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,159
the Coalition but it's not going to stop

420
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,480
us from supporting it it's not going to

421
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,520
stop us from asking for you guys to from

422
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,079
support from you guys and and we're

423
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,440
still going to keep on fighting the good

424
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,678
fight here in Canada so I don't know

425

what do you say we go grab a bite and

426
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,240

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,480
Tower in the background that would be

523
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,319
Toronto so that's where the best part of

524
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,440
about live camera work live camera work

525
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,119
exactly so we were in the restaurant we

526
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,880
were going to do a dab in the restaurant

527
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,439
but the lady that worked there honed in

528
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,278
on us pretty quick without pulling even

529
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,759
out the rig or the torch and just was

530
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,720
like I had my ball of bubble and she's

531
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,119
like what is that and I'm like this here

532
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,519
this is just my [ __ ] I'm putting it away

533
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,798
and she's like oh well what what is it

534
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:14,200
and I'm like it's bubble has are you

535
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,599
familiar and then she said uh oh not in

536
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,080
my restaurant you know I don't want that

537
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,959
stuff in my restaurant and then I had to

538
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:21,678
explain to her that it would be like

539
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,519
seeing like um any medication from any

540
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,600
person that was using any type of

541
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,158
medication pills or whatever it's just

542
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,759
like that I explained to her that I just

543
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,320
had it out for a brief minute it was

544
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,558
going back it didn't stink up for

545
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:36,079
restaurant and that uh yeah that we

546
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,519
should be allowed to have our medicine

547
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,480
where wherever we go so we're out in

548
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,319
front of her restaurant it's just across

549
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,720
the street right now yeah we figured you

550
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,639
know what what better place to do this

551
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,600
but right here right within her view

552
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,559
let's hope she's

553
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,519
watching all right so why don't you hold

554
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,720
that up I really believe that she was

555
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,918
actually hold it up for me she watched

556
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,798
bubble M's world she honed in right away

557
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,799
because she's actually watched us puff I

558
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,158
would be surprised she's a secret puffer

559
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,679

00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:50,679
night was over 1216 we were supposed to

613
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,720

00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,798
them on the on the road outside on our

615
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,159
way to Jack aers which we thought we

616
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,839
would do dabs inside the restaurant but

617
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,480
I think the lady that the restaurant

618
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,918
honed in on us or maybe she watched

619
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,480
bubble man's world I don't know but she

620
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,399
was definitely she was definitely she

621
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,720
was like what is that what is that and I

622
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,918

629
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:24,000
stinking the restaurant up so oh oh oh

630

631
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,720

632
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,440

bummed not that he was smoking cannabis

689
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,919
cuz she said I don't mind about the

690
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:35,200
Cannabis it just seems she wasn't really

691
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,120
into the butter thing and she didn't

692
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,639
know exactly why she just thought it

693
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:42,558
wasn't good and and we were like

694
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:44,359
confirmation Mom it isn't good you don't

695
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,638
like it because it's dangerous it's

696
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:50,119
chemical exposure it's potentially some

697
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:52,319
bad things that are inh you know so it

698
