00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,399
the things we Yammer on about I won't

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,198
delay in smoking a pure hash joint

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,879
John's been waiting to try one for few

18
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,519
weeks now got to be a couple weeks yeah

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,640
it's a few weeks so I got this one

20
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,798
here see the quality of that real nice

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,719
pure hash no paper no glue I'm showing

22
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,200
it to you and explaining it to you so

23
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,359
you don't have to ask in the comments

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
there's no glue there's no cannabis

25
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,959
there's no paper it's pure hash pressed

26
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,919
out laminated into a thin flat strip and

27
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,919
then rolled over a toothpick or another

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,680
small straight object have that pulled

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,000
Frozen and uh it sets God it's beautiful

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
so we're pretty pretty much looking

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,840
forward to that why don't you uh light

32
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,319
that bad boy up there is a little bit of

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,240
etiquette with a pure hash joint you

34
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,718
really want to be gentle when you put it

35
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,078
in your mouth you don't want to squeeze

36
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:50,158
it with your fingers and close the end

37
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:52,158
and you just lightly you know cherry out

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,600
the front and I usually put my teeth in

39
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,840
front of the uh the hole cuz it can pull

40
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:00,158
a little hot yeah the first uh few times

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,520
until it resin up and it closes up a

42
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,000
little bit in the middle there so while

43
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,439
John's doing that I wanted to thank

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,199
Dynasty genetics uh for a multitude of

45
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,199
reasons actually they sent us some beans

46
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,159
they sent us some shirts that we're both

47
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,958
wearing right now and uh I've really

48
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,959
been impressed with his photography he's

49
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,439
got the MP lens I'm not sure what body

50
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,598

51
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:28,199

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,640
or not I just love to see quality macro

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
cannabis

56
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,919
shots well I'm being a little quiet here

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,719
it's um well that's nice not that you're

58
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,119
being quiet but this hash join it was

59
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,120
nice

60
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:49,400
yeah very

61
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,079
tasty I guess I also want to thank

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,519
method 7 should be putting my method

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,239
seven shades on these are my sun

64
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,039
resistance um they recently sent me a

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,158
real nice little package I do a lot of

66
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,639
Photography under the HPS and metal

67
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,560
highlight lights so they sent me a set

68
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,919
of the uh resistance HPS so these are

69
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,519
basically they turn under the HPS light

70
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,798
to look normal I'll imprint a photo over

71
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,959
the video so you understand what I'm

72
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,760
talking about they sent me a set of the

73
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,319
metal Hy operators which are under that

74
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,598
particular light I don't get quite as

75
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,119
bad of a headache but these just filter

76
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:31,318
out the light that's bad for your eyes

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,158
um I really like their uh their company

78
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:37,438
uh logo here method 7 don't grow blind

79
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,079
you know don't grow blind so it's both

80
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:40,759
uh it's got a couple of meanings but I

81
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,439
thought that was pretty sharp of them

82
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,959
and then they also sent me um the LED so

83
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:47,799
this is a green lens and when I look

84
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,280
under my LED light it looks just

85
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,079
perfectly normal green like it's it's

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,120
really cool how what this company's done

87
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,879
and how they've created these simple

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,200
lenses for your eyes to produce that

89
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,158
normal light that you want and of course

90
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,878
uh they do the camera filters now as

91
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,078
well it's perfect yeah I got a pair

92
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,878
right in the very beginning for

93
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,760
protecting my eyes being in a room for a

94
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,239
while and they work great and um I'd say

95
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,280
some of my beginning photos on Instagram

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,798

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,839

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,240
got the UBC chemo Kush this is now

136
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,120
rooted and growing in a two gallon pot

137
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,759
you may remember when Remo gave this to

138
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,720
me I posted a little picture of that

139
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,560
online so that's a little UBC Kemo Kush

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,120
that I'll be sharing uh probably first

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
with Johnny as uh I generally share with

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,879
him

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,120
first and uh next to that we've got the

144
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,918
old Jamaican can you believe how tall

145
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,240
this thing is man well definitely yeah I

146
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,000
got some I need to top

147
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,439
it I need to start topping this Beast

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,240
beautiful Ash on that yeah it's perfect

149
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,839
so this thing is about 4 feet tall now

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,879
this is that Jamaican hybrid that I've

151
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:16,439
been talking about uh the world Pho taxi

152
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,199
which has a three three fan leaves

153
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,439
coming out of certain stocks this one

154
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,240
has three this one has three the middle

155
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,399
section basically is the two sections

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,800
with three then it splits up here and it

157
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,279
and it normalizes in these two stocks

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,560
yeah and if we cut that top off then

159
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,559
you're going to get this

160
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,800
great yeah well I'll probably cut this

161
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,439
top off and clone every one of these

162
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,360
growths oh for sure can't be thrown away

163
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,000
any of the JAMA right now oh and then um

164
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,319
update on the Jamaican Sprout that I

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,680

166
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,199
half inch long tap route on it right now

167
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,439
it needs to be planted Pronto so that's

168
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,038
something else we should do here on pop

244

245

247
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,399
genetics that's another thing oh yeah so

248
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:15,039
had those for well I got those basically

249
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,120
from seed back in 2009 I think it was or

250
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,639
something I can't even inter have

251
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,440
pinched it there I'm not sure got be

252
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,679
real careful bit a pinch what's that

253
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,200
little bit of a pinch you got to be real

254
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,039
careful towards the last little part of

255
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,920
passing these joints they soften up and

256
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,039
it's once you pinch it like like that

257
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,838
it's slowly starts to disintegrate and

258
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,399
fall apart I have faith in John and I

259
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,120
that we'll be able oh no it's

260
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,320
done know it's done the pinch the pinch

261
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,000
took it

262
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,000
out there we go but the hash is still

263
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,078
here and we can puff it in a bowl which

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,958
we

265
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:52,439
will man that was a nice gram of hash we

266
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,599
just puffed I actually felt uplifted

267
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,959
from that oh you should definitely a

268
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,560
nice nice little buzz from that for sure

269
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,078
it's definitely a solid buzz for sure

270
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,359
which one was that

271
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:08,278

taste the chocolate in there a little

274
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,920
bit I'm sure nice very tasty so I guess

275
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,120
we're going to go get that seed and

276
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:21,958

277
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,639

282
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:37,278

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,200
see this little guy go in I always use a

286
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,959
paper towel a wet piece of paper towel

287
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,240
to do my moving I don't do tweezers or

288
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,399
anything like that jump it in and there

289
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,079

291
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:58,159
of cover it with the paper towel and

292
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,519
There She Goes planted I'm going to get

293
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,278
that in the dome I'll be right be right

294
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,919
back oh that's pretty

295
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:10,679
cool so we puffed a nice hash joint it

296
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:12,838
felt great we uh we planted a new a new

297
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,599
a new Jamaican strain like the nicest

298
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,360
was it not from the nicest Bud we saw

299
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,159
while we were

300
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,120
there yes like by far by far there was

301
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,639
for me it was by quite a distance

302
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,720
there's a few seeds that I gathered

303
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,639
while I was in the fields those were

304
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,278
from fresh plants though and the problem

305
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,198
with that is you never know you know how

306
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,519
a fresh plant just looks amazing even

307
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:35,359
when it's fresh I don't know what it's

308
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,278
going to be like when it dries it's a

309
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,480
different story and this this herb that

310
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:43,159
I got this one seed from was from

311
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,000
beautiful dried cured herb it was a

312
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:49,719
small bud but man it had a nice

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,278
blueberry fruity kind of skunk to it so

314
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,920
je definitely gave me a little bit of a

315
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,360
Bud there and I rolled it up and I was

316
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:56,039
like this is so tasty you probably

317
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,919
smoked the bud that I took the seed out

318
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,639
of cuz maybe I did yeah I gave it to

319
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,319
Tony if that was the one that he had

320
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,639
that's the one we rolled and tried yeah

321
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,040
exactly so that's the one that we just

322
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,560
planted it definitely was the tastiest

323
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,719
bug we tasted on the island perfect well

324
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:15,159
we'll have it it'll be there we'll keep

325
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,519
