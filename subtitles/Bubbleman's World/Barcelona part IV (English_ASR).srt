00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,559
job on it you know you're looking at the

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,958

B all right so we're doing macro

222
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,278
photographs right now of the zombie Kush

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,519
from seed Ripper and

224
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:50,879
it's so beautiful and so photogenic even

225
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,679
though it's dried already what he

226
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,360
somehow has managed to understand is

227
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,039
that if you don't touch it and bag it up

228
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,720
and do all this kind of stupid [ __ ] your

229
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,559
bud will forever be perfect and you know

230
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,480
it's the putting it in bags and touching

231
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,399
it and squeezing it back in the bag out

232
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,079
of the bag you just it's a lot of time

233
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,440
and energy to grow resin to give it to a

234
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,439
plastic bag or a glass jar

235
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,039
all right you generate a question I make

236
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,679
it happen and then I translate it back

237
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:47,599
yeah I guess I'd like to know how it got

238
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,599
turned on the water hash

239
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:08,198
and he he started by growing and using

240
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:10,519
all of the all of the ends of his need

241
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:13,240
everything instruction were the most

242
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:17,759
accessible to Growers nice excellent and

243
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,759
how did he um get into breeding

244
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,919
so he he actually do quite a joke what

245
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,920
he there go he doesn't really look for

246
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,799
money he goes first gu followed by

247
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:50,000
Passion yeah his passion got him here

248
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,198
way I I can tell also it seems like the

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,958
guy that if he got into herb when he was

250
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,159
younger he possibly had the best herb

251
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:01,039
out of all his friends it seems like

252
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,039
that you know if you can say that

253
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:18,199
at 22 he opened his first grow

254
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,199
shop where you get everything to grow

255
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,000
and I just wanted to say that I you know

256
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,078
I met you at the canas cup in Amsterdam

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,039
we've met before and I've seen Ripper

258
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,758
seeds but to me I never knew about

259
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,679
Ripper seeds I never heard about Ripper

260
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,839
seeds but I I want to tell you all out

261
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:36,719
there right now everything that these

262
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:39,880
guys have shown me is beyond exceptional

263
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,040
super fire hble hash and incredible

264
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:47,240
quality but I look forward to making

265
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,240
hash with you man yeah absolutely

266
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,078
so it's good to be hanging

267
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,958
out during the beginning of making hash

268
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,560
he just

269
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,599
small kind of pulling himself in the

270
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:26,879
sense that oh yeah I'm using B but it

271
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,959
wasn't a he started using top H ready

272
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,078
and everything really nice he started

273
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,078
getting this qu

274
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,399
fresh

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,480
say he doesn't always make it

276
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,359
fresh he he actually acknowledged that

277
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,839
there's a difference

278
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,839
in for me the the

279
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,479
for him the best thing to do is buy it

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,480
for Mon and then put it on

281
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,400
[Applause]

282
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,720
the they also trive by doing four or

283
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,960
five mon free and then pulling it out

284
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,600
but uh it seems it seems to them that

285
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,960
everything was to graded

286
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,798
theice over my opinion my opinion yeah

287
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,360
of course is a strong opinion as it

288
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:44,000
