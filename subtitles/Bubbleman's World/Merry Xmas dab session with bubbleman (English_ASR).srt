00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:24,039
hey guys welcome to Bubble man's world

3
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:26,358
and Merry Christmas it is December the

4
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,880
25th and I'm just sitting here taking a

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,439
break from my family activities and I

6
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,200
thought I would come and share with my

7
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,039
audience a small Gauntlet of sorts I've

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,600
got the denail with the mothership

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,558
quartz pooking bee uh collab going over

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,960
here and then over here I've got the new

11
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,799
uh quartz Banger that I got from uh Dark

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,120
Crystal glass and I've really been

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,959
liking it actually it's quite a nice

14
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,959
little unit got it in my Swiss perk

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,878
which is always nice to hit the Swiss

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,640
perk and uh yeah I've got uh a dab of

17
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:05,158
some Barb 99 I've got a dab of some of

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:09,319
d420 K's uh full melt dry sift and I've

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,920
got a dab of some sweet skunk dry sift

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:15,519
full melt as well and then after that

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm going to take a CBD infusion of

22
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,478
CBD with

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,719
turmeric which has been CO2 extracted so

24
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,959
a friend of mine gave me this and he

25
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,400
wanted me to check that out so I figured

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,078
I'd give it all a check out here on

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,960
Bubble man's world so let's start with

28
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,239
well let's start with the quartz Banger

29
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:36,478
that's what we'll do we'll start with

30
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,879
the quartz Banger now I've had a few

31
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,840
people get a little upset with me I

32
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,879
admit I'm not torch Savvy when it comes

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,560
to heating these bowls up and I really

34
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,798
was hitting it too soon after heating it

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,519
up so uh for those of you that were just

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,960
having a hard time witnessing such a

37
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:52,280
thing and I believe that it was a hard

38
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,559
thing to witness I'm going to let the

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,079
quartz cool down this time and I'm going

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,879
to take that nice tasty rip um

41
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,438
surprisingly enough the few hits that I

42
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,319
I took when it was really really hot

43
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,078
weren't as bad as you might think they

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,318
weren't that hot burnt sort of oil taste

45
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,959
that even sometimes bubble has will do

46
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,039
when you put it on a nail that's too hot

47
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,920
so there we go with that I guess we'll

48
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,919
hit the Barb first and

49
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,679
foremost and we'll give it a little bit

50
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,518
of a a little bit of a a cool down guys

51
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,640
probably see I've got my melt shirts on

52
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:29,200
representing the triome heavy extract

53
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:31,719
crew jibs and Ken shout out to you guys

54
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,439
my main boys out in Colorado killing the

55
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,560
game literally killing the game so thank

56
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,759
you guys for doing what you do and here

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,759
we

58
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:05,878
go all right so that is the Barb 99%

59
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,920
Barb really nice we're going to follow

60
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,919
that up with a sweet skunk

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,040
Chaser all right and last but certainly

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,680
not least we're going to hit a little

63
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:33,318
d420

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,239
K full melt OG cush dryp now he gave me

65
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,759
this almost a year ago was probably

66
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,360
about a year ago that I was at his place

67
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,798
in PG I think it was just before

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,879
Christmas and he gave me this little jar

69
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,680
of hash you can tell it's almost pretty

70
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,000
much empty in there

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,840
but there's a few little nerds of

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,479
goodness left so I figure what better

73
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,239
place to hit it than on the Christmas

74
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,438
rips with bubble man I hope you guys are

75
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,560
all having a great Christmas um to me

76
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,959
that means spending time with uh family

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920
friends and loved ones more so than

78
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,479
acquiring uh gifts I acquired just a few

79
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,639
gifts this year and that really wasn't

80
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:17,798
my highlight at all my highlight is and

81
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,079
always will be the people so we got this

82
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,198
thing nice and orange you can actually

83
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,720
see the ash from the last hit the sort

84
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,439
of little bit of U me uh just the I

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,960
guess residuals from the Barb the Barb

86
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,719
was actually I called it 99% could I

87
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:36,519
should call it 998 it's it's this it's

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,960
uh it's his 24hour run that I managed to

89
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:42,758
clean up into 99% heads but the quality

90
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,159
of a 24-hour dry sifted tumble is

91
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,439
obviously going to be much lower than

92
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,320
say his 5 and 10 minute tumble even his

93
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:53,120
1 hour tumble that he does is very high

94
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,120
quality so here we go let's hit the last

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
one

96
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,758
and there it is guys the Christmas

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,199
Trinity with bubble man have a great

98
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,720
holidays and a Happy New Year and we'll

99
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:23,080
see you on hash Church in a couple of

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,080
days peace
