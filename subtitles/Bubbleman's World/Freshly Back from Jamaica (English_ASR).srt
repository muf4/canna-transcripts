00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959

67
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,000
you'll be able to hear about that more

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,598
when BBC's finish their interview with

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,239

70
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,359
online I'll do the links into this video

71
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,680
In fact when that happen so I'm at in

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,440
the yard incredible ree music's playing

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,159
on the stage really really nice stuff

74
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,439
and I find some bud um couple of

75
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,039
different guys give me bud I met a

76
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,799
really cool Japanese guy there that was

77
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,400
pretty headyy he gave me a little bit of

78
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,879
Bud had that classic ammonia smell to it

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,319
a little bit too strong for my likings

80
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,840
but my friend Jeff pulled out a bud and

81
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,039
it was some of the most perfect butd

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,000
I've seen since I've been there actually

83
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,840
really beautiful looked like orange Hill

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,120
the Orange Hill kill as I call it anyway

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,080
I managed to pull out a Single Seed from

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,759
um from this uh bud and I just thought

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
it was hilarious because you know the 20

88
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,560
years ago I brought the seeds back I

89
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,239
brought only eight of them I cracked

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,479
them and only one popped so I figured I

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,120
only found one seed in this bud and here

92
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,078
it is right here let's start the uh

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,158
we'll start it off right there's the

94
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,640
seed so what's happening here

95
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,959
is I'm going to do my paper towel method

96
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,919
this Jamaica seed's going to crack in

97
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,319
the blink of an eye in fact it almost

98
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,158
looks like it's ready to crack already

99
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,878
so let's get this into the paper towel

100
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,879
I'm going to grab a little

101
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,279
water all right we got the spray bottle

102
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,399
now I know there's a million ways to do

103
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,000
this I don't really need to hear about

104
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,719
your comments on how this isn't the

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,839
right way to do it uh you'll see the

106
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,039
seed will crack it will Sprout and it

107
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,519
will grow me a beautiful plant and if

108
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,439
that doesn't count as uh working and

109
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,120
real then I I don't know what what does

110
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,360
so this is the way I've done it since I

111
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,519
was a young young lad teenager when I

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,800
started growing cannabis we always just

113
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:52,120
moistened uh paper towel

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,120
up all

115
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:01,360
right always good to give the inside a

116
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,038
little spoch and boing there we we go

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,680
you guys saw it here first what's this

118
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,199
going to be we don't know but it's going

119
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,280
to be something

120
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,038
nice so just cover that up what I

121
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,079
normally do is I put another plate over

122
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,519
top of it and then I'll put it on top of

123
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,359
my receiver actually which seems to be

124
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,240
always at this really nice ambient

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,919
temperature of around

126
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,800
78° um it will evaporate the water out

127
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,560
if I left it there for 48 hours but I'll

128
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,240
check it literally every 12 hours and

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,319
give it a little spray and I would

130
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,079
suspect within the next uh you know

131
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,039
probably by tonight or tomorrow morning

132
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,000
we'll see a route on this thing I'll

133
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:38,079
start the process by macro photographing

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,519
the entire thing once again and uh just

135
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,318
like I have with the original Jamaica

136
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,079
plant you you've got to see the original

137
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,759
Jamaica plant actually let me uh let me

138
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,839
bring you outside for a

139
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:51,400
second all right so here's the

140
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:55,679
garden now the Jamaican

141
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:57,560
seed is right here here's Jamaica guys

142
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,240
so this plant is by far the tallest out

143
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,720
of all the plants I have the only other

144
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,439
plant that that's even close is a

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,199
sunflower plant over

146
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,199
there these guys right

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,960
here but uh we've got real nice nine

148
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,159
levers throughout seven and N levers and

149
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,879
uh the mutation in the center of the

150
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,400
stock is absolutely incredible uh the

151
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:23,279
whal pho taxi you can see here is doing

152
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,879
a one a two and a three so you've got

153
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,000
three growths here this one shot out

154
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,560
three as well but then mutated and shot

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,959
out a second one I believe in this split

156
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,439
we may have lost the whal pho taxi it

157
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,918
looks as though it's now growing as a

158
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,199
normal plant but uh we'll see and that

159
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,758
is the Jamaican Lamb's bread hybrid

160
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,360
cross that I planted on May

161
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,720
20th so you can tell this plant is only

162
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,479
a month and 2 weeks old and it's taller

163
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,919
than the Afghani the congales the sweet

164
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,680
skunks uh this sweet skunk's closing in

165
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:00,359
on it but

166
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,280
uh yeah so that's pretty exciting too

167
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,038
you know 6 weeks of growth and the thing

168
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,159
is 3 and 1/2 ft tall I've never had a

169
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,839
plant grow that fast on me it is a

170
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,720
female it's already shot out many

171
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,000
pistolet stigma hairs so we're not

172
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
worried about it turning into a male I

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
wouldn't mind maybe this one being a

174
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,638
male how nice would that be if I got a

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,598
male out of this and I could smack that

176
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,079
little female I also took a bunch of

177
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,038
clones yesterday I took five doc Atomic

178
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:28,120
Northern Lights I took five medic kushes

179
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,800
I took five Jamaicans I took five hash

180
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,478
plants five sweet skunks five harmonies

181
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,120
and five hoses which is the hay OG skunk

182
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,120
cross what else is there to tell you oh

183
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,560
I came home to a beautiful bag of dry

184
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,519
sift um not 99% by any means but uh I'll

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,959
be able to clean it up to a 99% no

186
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,359
problem here's just uh just one bag to

187
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,878
give you an idea of the quality it's got

188
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,280
a great color it's self- pressing into

189
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,439
rocks we'll keep this out of the heat so

190
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,000
I can uh clean it up and I'll uh

191
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,478
probably do a small video on how to

192
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
prepare I mean I know you guys have seen

193
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,240
the cing technique enough that it's not

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,399
really too important for me to show that

195
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,759
over and over and over again but I would

196
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,359
love to show you guys how to prepare a

197
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,520
resin like this when you do get some

198
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,919
nice dry sift it's pressed into these

199
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,038
little rocks you know they're fairly

200
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,878
tough and if I let them heat up too much

201
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,038
um they they'll melt and self press even

202
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,800
worse in which case it'll be much harder

203
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:30,120
to um to clean the heads out from the

204
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,440
rest now I do have

205
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,080
a little bit of pure heads

206
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,039
here

207
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,038
so let me just grab the

208
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,600
denail all right guys so I got a little

209
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,120
bit of this dry sift here a couple of

210
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,000
variations um going to started off with

211
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,639
the Barb I've been out of town for too

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,639
long and I've missed

213
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:57,639
Barb she's so so sweet give it up to the

214
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,000
great

215
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:03,600
Gardener the guy's legit

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,600
so some of you may be wondering hey

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,278
bubble man why are you using a titanium

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,120
nail in

219
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:17,240
your in your on your

220
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:21,360
Dil well I am using it because I pooched

221
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,159
my whip in Jamaica in fact I believe I

222
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,639
actually pooched the whip in Spain but

223
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,319
it was still working and it worked the

224
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,480
whole time I came back from Spain for

225
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
months it was a little bit sketchy but I

226
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,079
just kept using it instead of ordering a

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,559
new one and then when I finally took the

228
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:37,919
new whip to Jamaica it uh it petered out

229
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,479
halfway through the trip so it was a

230
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,639
little bit unfortunate not to be able to

231
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,399
hit hit the denail as often as I would

232
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,399
have liked but uh I'm back home and I

233
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,360
can hit it now so I've also got a couple

234
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,600
of cool things that they sent me from

235
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,159
denil I'll probably be doing a video in

236
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,159
the very new future on this the ceramic

237
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,759
disc as you guys saw before when we were

238
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:02,120
hitting these off the uh off the Melt

239
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,919
and then they sent me a black one as

240
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,600
well so I've got the White and the black

241
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:11,639
ceramic which will sit right on top of

242
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,159
either my quartz I have my quartz Bowl

243
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,519
here's a new quartz Bowl I actually got

244
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,838
this one's just a slider slides right

245
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,240
into almost any pipe just a matter of

246
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,959
getting the whip on there and we're

247
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,600
laughing

248
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,119
so first rip back since I've been uh

249
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,959
home from Jamaica I came in late last

250
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,560
night I've I've been running quite a bit

251
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,719
of chores this morning with the garden I

252
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,239
had uh I took a bunch of clones last

253
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,560
night at 2:00 in the

254
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,320
morning I put out all my mothers I've

255
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,159
got about 15 mothers out on my deck

256
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,600
right now about 3 to 4 feet tall each

257
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,759
I've got tent number one which is in

258
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,759
full bloom and it actually comes

259
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,519
down you know not that I have any

260
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,519
specific time when it comes down but I

261
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,959
would suggest that it should come down

262
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,639
in the next 15 days so I'll be cutting

263
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:01,799
those down and then um the LED and the

264
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,399
HPS experiment that I'm doing in my

265
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,039
second tent that we just built recently

266
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,679
John and I um it's starting to flower as

267
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:11,399
well um I've only been gone for 14 days

268
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,838
and they started flowering right around

269
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,360
the time that I left so they're 2 weeks

270
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,839
into flower and it'll be interesting to

271
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,159
see how they go I'm I'm telling you the

272
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,920
ones that are blooming right now under

273
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,639
the hpss are looking incredible I look

274
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,879
really forward to seeing what this led

275
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,799
can produce and I'll probably go down

276
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,480
today and photograph the different um

277
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:34,559
Bud formations and the pistol hairs on

278
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,879
both the LED and the HPS so I would have

279
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,919
been doing that for the last two weeks

280
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,320
unfortunately I was in Jamaica can't

281
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,000
really say unfortunately but I would

282
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,920
have loved to have uh been doing the

283
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,600
side by side all the way through it's

284
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,599
only a couple weeks in so we'll still

285
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,440
get a real nice uh idea of what's going

286
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,040
on and in the end it's really all about

287
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,639
that final resin that we produce so I

288
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:57,000
guess it's time to take a rip dnails at

289
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:00,879
700 Mothership in hand Skillet tool and

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,879
Barb let's do this

291
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,839
my

292
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,838
God does that tastes

293
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,278
good man the Barb is

294
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:44,879
loud felt my temperature go up solid 10°

295
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,879
on that

296
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,000
rip um unfortunately my last trip to

297
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,039
Jamaica was very busy I wasn't just

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,759
doing bubble Man's World stuff it's

299
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,759
probably why you noticed you I got a lot

300
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,519
of um I only really put up a few videos

301
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,838
I was very busy while I was there having

302
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,959
different meetings and setting up

303
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,160
different projects we're going to be

304
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,239
definitely interested in telling you

305
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,719
guys about that in the near future but

306
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,278
unfortunately one of the things I never

307
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,879
really got to do this year in Jamaica

308
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,480
was really

309
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,679
find the best herb that I could and turn

310
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:25,560
it into some uh some full melt hash like

311
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:29,319
I like I did in uh 2001 2002 2003 2004

312
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,479
2005 and so on um my next trip when I go

313
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,839
back in a couple weeks I'm going to

314
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,399
organize making some really beautiful

315
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,399
bubble and that way you'll see more

316
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,240
macro photographs you'll see um more

317
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,759
shots of living resin as well as

318
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,240
extracted um heads and some melt videos

319
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,720
as well I know you guys love the Melt

320
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,879
videos so I won't be blabbing on for

321
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,240
much longer I just wanted to uh do a

322
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,320
quick video letting everyone know that

323
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm back in Canada I'm back with my

324
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,560
