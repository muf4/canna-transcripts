1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,839
Howdy, howdy.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,960
I'll give a short story and that was the

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:13,000
first, it's kind of music related. The

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,840
first seed I ever planted was in

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,480
1965 in Hollywood at Sunset and Vine and

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:24,879
Wallace Music City's uh flower box

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,960
outside there. Uh, I don't know if

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,919
anybody knows of Wallace Music City. It

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,880
used to be before Tower Records, the

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,079
coolest place to buy music. Uh, at least

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,160
in California. And

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,960
uh, yeah, I I I just grew Mexican seeds.

13
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,279
I mean, they weren't nothing super

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,719
special, but uh they got a foot or two

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,920
tall before either the gardener cut them

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,558
down or one of the people that were

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,239
hanging out on Sunday Boulevard spotted

18
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:02,280
them and and harvested them for the

19
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:05,118
revolution. And uh yeah, and then after

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,960
that, the music I was actually listening

21
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:13,519
to at that time was people like uh

22
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,478
Buffalo Springfield,

23
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,478
uh, Jefferson

24
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:22,679
Airplane. That's the music that I liked

25
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,920
back then. But uh when I moved to Santa

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,080
Cruz in

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,960
uh 1972,

28
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:38,078
uh a few years later we were able to see

29
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:41,959
uh uh Bob Marley played at Santa Cruz

30
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:45,359
Civic twice and we went and saw him both

31
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:48,879
times. Second time we had our daughter

32
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,200
with us. She was only uh uh two or three

33
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:56,000
years old, I'm sure. But

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,799
uh it was fantastic. And the Santa Cruz

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,879
Civic used to be my favorite place to go

36
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,680
see music because it was small. Maybe at

37
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:11,280
the most one or two thousand people fit

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:16,360
in it. And uh man, it I saw so much good

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:21,439
music there, you know, uh lot of ree

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:25,280
and the the first two times I saw Bob

41
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:28,639
were there also, which was pretty nice.

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,520
I have a bootleg copy of that 1972 show

43
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,159
in the Santa Cruz Civic. There's a local

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,920
guy here on the west. It wasn't 72. I

45
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:43,439
think it was 78 in July. Okay. And

46
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:46,079
79 in uh toward the end of the year. And

47
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:49,598
by the when I saw him the second time,

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,920
he was uh did not have the energy left

49
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,919
and you could tell something was wrong.

50
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,318
It's legend. The place of legend. Yeah.

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,239
The Civic. I saw Willie Nelson there to

52
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,399
this day. It's still going, but I I

53
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,800
don't know if it was It's not quite

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,560
where it used to be in the late 70s.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
That said, though, there's there's a lot

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,199
of uh good energy in that space, for

57
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,199
sure.

58
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:21,079
I I love Santa Cruz. It was the only

59
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,280
reason I left was because

60
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:28,319
uh the state and federal government were

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,759
flying airplanes and looking for people.

62
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:36,839
And uh I got out of

63
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:42,000
I understand. Yeah. Babylon sucks. Yeah.

64
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,000
1985 it was getting pretty bad.
