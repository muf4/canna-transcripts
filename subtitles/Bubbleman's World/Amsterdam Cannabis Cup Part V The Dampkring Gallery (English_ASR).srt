number of years ago back in 08 8 yeah

47
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,199
yeah it's a lot bigger in person than

48
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,319
the book and the book you actually if

49
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,479
you smoked a recent mmpv you kind of get

50
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,039
used to them at this size and then when

51
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:37,119

52
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:39,079
is with all the marbles and all the huge

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,519

83
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,720
nice piece or the uh the line work the

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,479
big hands on the on the little dude

holding the marble up is pretty as well

86
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,679
what year is this one Dave um 2011 2012

87
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,000
I believe this one was done in early

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,000
2012 okay rather rather recent like cuz

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,840
I got the the number zero which actually

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,158
doesn't come with a box okay so um how

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,878
did you get with the

92
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,519
Box um I bought it off yeah just you

93
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,279
know it was it was when you first did

94
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,680
the creature Series in the mini tubes

95
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,758
and um he hadn't done the Box concept

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,240
yet but it was the first one like

97
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,879
there's a identical height set series of

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,280
mini tubes with a creature one creature

99
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,360
on it and then some extra stuff and I

100
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,439
got the number

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
zero before he ever started doing them

102
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,319
with the

103
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,519
box it's like the equivalent of getting

104
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,839
an artist Pro for the wall yeah like a

105
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,319
well I mean like there's a bunch of like

106
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,269
prototype Mothership running around they

107
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,800
got prototypes actually sand blasted

108
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,560

122
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,879
the hose attachments but this is a uh

123

it's a fumed marbles fumed ready liion

124

125
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:29,360
is a banjo uh Joe Peters collab it's one

126
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,198
of the three from the queen honeybee

127
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,319
series

128
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,879
it's the smallest of the three oh it

129
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,199
hits like a champ it hits like a oh dude

130
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,839
it's one of the best hitting pieces that

131
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,439
that for small ones that you could

132
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,038
really have really really really pull

133
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,120
hard on that and the water doesn't come

134
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:46,000
up it's just tiniest amount of water

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,840
like Dave showed and it's just it's like

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,120
a a thimble full of water full I would

137
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,638
say it's one of my favorite ones i' love

138
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,360
to edit that

139
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,960
though so but this one here that's been

140
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,400
on Mark's show a lot but as it deserves

141
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,599
to be cuz this is one of the one of my

142
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,000
favorites I mean other than Marcel being

143
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,199
one of my favorites this piece in

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,759
particular it's the uh Phoenix totem

145
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,199
bubbler it's basically like Marcel's own

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,479
personal totem pole as um I don't think

147
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,800
he's ever written about it like that but

148
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,478
I've talked to him about it enough to

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,038
know that that's how he feels about it

150
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,000
with the octopus and the Phoenix both

151
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,879
are his uh totem symbols so when he when

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,639
he was asked to do a piece for uh smoke

153
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:31,079
2 Volume 2 um the second installation

154
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,120
from the first book that the max pollen

155
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,318
pieces from this was what he felt he had

156
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,918
to

157
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,639
do cool so with the books David was that

158
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:43,000
common with the with both smoke volume

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,680
one and volume 2 that they were pieces

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,759
that were asked either to be made or to

161
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,478
submitt it to the book The Artist the

162
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,000
artists were individually asked to to be

163
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:54,519
a part of it

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,959
yes and this is over here is some of the

165

166
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,598
just you know ly around not necessarily

167

the best stuff in the world but the

168
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:03,878
ghost piece is certainly a nice one it's

169
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,879

170
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,720
2011 it's um just a really nice uh

171
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,919
example of sculpted uh glass sculpted

172
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,960
borrow with electroforming um all the

173
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,120
little um pieces that are attachments

174
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,038
are little like household items like di

175
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,800
like it's like a AV converter that's

176
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:23,199
been electroformed and attached to the

177
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,360
back um one really nice piece on it is

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,319
on the back um you'll have to go around

179
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,160
but it's got a freak marble on it freak

180
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,720
brain marble and those I've always

181
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,479
personally quite loved quite a lot yeah

182
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,039
that freak brain marble is absolutely

183
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,800
stunning it's brilliant I better go

184
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,839
around and show them cuz we talked about

185
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,478
it yeah this one's amazing out of it

186
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,279
stand too when you hold it in your hand

187
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,000
it feels naturally form and the weight

188
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,719
is just right on the bottom with the

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,598
grip it's got a handle it hits amazing

190
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,680
and it's got like a ladder perk here

191
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,918
down on the it seems like just yesterday

192
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,478
I was hitting that tube yeah about a

193
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,598
week ago actually about two weeks ago

194
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,800
and then this is a s blasted Paco fyc

195
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,719
Toro with Ash capture and I mean it's

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,038
it's really nice Toro's lost a lot of

197
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,319
its it's so that's a [ __ ] your crew huh

198
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,680
that's

199
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,280
fyc yeah dude when Mar when they came

200
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,598
out with [ __ ] your crew I just laughed

201
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,399
so hard that's so perfectly Slinger

202
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:20,800
[ __ ]

203
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,878
totally

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,520
absolutely oh yeah Slinger was living in

205
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,240
Vancouver when he first started learning

206
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,959
about the sand blasting and the stencil

207
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,960
work that's really where he got into it

208
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,439
okay

209
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,360
and so we get to be there for the birth

210
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,679
of that it's really nice to kind of show

211
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,200
The Ghost with the metal work but then

212
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,359
show the Paco and with the sand blast

213
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,560
sand different so different it literally

214
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,720
looks like it comes from a different

215
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,838
culture well and even like to compare

216
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,879
another another technique over beside it

217
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,240
here this is a Dave Parks tube you know

218
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:55,600
a little more modern y design a little

219
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,278
more you know modern art style but the

220
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,839
rap and rake uh snake skin that he's

221
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,278
really known for yeah yeah it's a really

222
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,399
nice example of that it's really nice

223
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,600
example too of a a nice small bowl too

224
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,720
that fits really nicely and you

225
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,320
know we got the swing there too that's

226
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,120
actually that's actually what I need

227
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
that's the bowl I need that's the bowl

228
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,600
you need that is the bowl you need yeah

229
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,559
and then we don't need to ah right right

230
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,159
and then what do we have down at the

231
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,559
bottom here down at the bottom so on the

232
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,039
left and on the right it's an artist

233
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,599
that's no longer actually on the torch

234
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,958
his name is Steve Gelb and um he runs a

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
mountain bike store now and he fixes

236
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,239
bikes and it's too bad he's not on the

237
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,199
torch cuz he's a really amazing artist

238
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,399
and they're just more uh older examples

239
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
of some ray gun you got some nice

240
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,039
reversals and

241
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,360
some I think I'll pull out my Gelb

242
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,039
Sherlock in the next couple of days cuz

243
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,879
there's a lot of things at the same time

244
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,439
you you should put them in here I want

245
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,679
to smoke with you the one in the the one

246
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,000
in the middle is an ease electroformed

247
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,838
fumed um direct inject Tu really nice

248
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,639
fuming in the in the dome as well you

249
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,240
can see these kind of like bubble marks

250
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,838
through the bottom my favorite is the

251
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,200
fuming through the middle section the

252
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,720
silver and the gold and the way it's

253
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,200
wrapped is just it's just beautiful

254
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,200
amazing and then lastly but certainly

255
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
not least certainly not least because

256
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,519
this is a really this is a really

257
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,600
popular piece but this is the Brandon

258
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,839
Martin functional doll number

259
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,278
one um dome's here in the breathing

260
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,720
apparatus where the the breathing tube

261
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,639
mouthpiece would be on the doll that's

262
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
actually a percolator so it's an

263
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,000
[Music]

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,600
inline right in

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,879
there and then the mouth piece is

266
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,120
the part on the side of the head I like

267
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,559
how you got Forks on the back yeah so

268
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,159
he's he's utilized different household

269
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,278
materials again just much the same way

270
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,919
that ghost did you know and and has

271
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,958
formed them into the different aspects

272
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,439
of the doll Dave the blue color in here

273
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,278
is absolutely incredible do you know if

274
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,880
that was or if that was actually a blue

275
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,720
color that BL color yeah but when you if

276
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,399
you wait until it's night time and the

277
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,879
light and you see light shine through it

278
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,480
when it's dark it actually it's all it's

279
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,720
all see-through okay glasses the light

280
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,639
shines right through it you can see

281
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,399
right inside I realiz but um and you can

282
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,560
see on the back here that he's actually

283
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,120
and not easily I'm sure but he's

284
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,319
electroformed his name into the back of

285
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,879
the piece yeah fantastic so you can see

286
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,920
and TI signature just beside it as well

287
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,838

metal feet that the puppet fits into and

306
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:04,399

312
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,000
concepts that he wants to present here

313
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,360

00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:22,919
it's wonderful to kind of finalize on

317
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,679
this one and

318
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,439
just be incredible work because not many

319
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,278
people are doing anything of this

320
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,079
caliber and mixing the different media

321
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,120
trying to make both a functional and an

322
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,120
aesthetic puppet it's true and it's

323
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,959
really it's nice to make it available to

324
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,440
the public I mean I feel fairly blessed

325
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,078
cuz I can just go over to Dave's house

326
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,600
and see this on his uh his hutch in his

327
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,000
living room exact where it sits but uh

328
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,879
it's nice for other people to be able to

329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
come here and actually see the quality

330
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,240
of the piece I mean it's dangling on a

331
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,919
on a on a chain on a chain right you

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,839
know what I mean what a concept alone

333
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,759
right there you can hit it actually like

334
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,639
like you can actually just hit it just

335
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,159
like that you don't have to hit it oh I

336
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,600
see what you mean like smoke from it

337
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,360
while I've hit it with you one time you

338
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,360
have you have one time one time so yeah

339
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
that's one of the things that we really

340
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,079
wanted to do here Europe is not very big

341
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,320
on the smoking glass culture because as

342
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,599
you seees yeah we hoping it improves and

343
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,879
that's that's why we're here is to

344
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,759
expose this type of work for both people

345
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,159
to understand the workmanship that goes

346
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,159
into it the type of artists that are

347
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,639
working in this these days and also some

348
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,879
of its scale I mean when you see this in

349
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,799
a photograph you would assume that it

350
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,639
might be as big as a cup when I saw the

351
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,120
max pollen piece in Smoke

352
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,879
I assumed also that it was like a

353
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,480
smaller you know lightning bolt type pie

354
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,600
and then I we pulled it out it's huge

355
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,440
like are you kidding me it's the size of

356
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,278
a so max is a big boy he can blow big

357
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,600
pieces oh yeah Max is like honestly like

358
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,240
holding that glass on a py stick and

359
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,000
like flipping it over a flame oh

360
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,360
[ __ ] you're like w w you know this thing

361
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,078
just right right right circulating it's

362
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,440
very cool well right on I guess we'll uh

363
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,439
we'll maybe go downstairs and take a

364
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,120
quick peek yeah okay one sec go ahead

365
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,880
all right so on November 1st which is

366
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,480
Museum night in Amsterdam we hosted what

367
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,439
we believe to be truly a museum level

368
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,839
glass collaboration that we facilitated

369
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,759
between five artists we have Snick and

370
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,920
salt from Texas the same Elmo fire

371
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:23,079
studio and we have Yoshi condo Rose rhs

372
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,559
and daito who goes by the name dis glass

373
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,439
also known for his slop work and these

374
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,239
are the beasts that were put together by

375
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,880
the guys over the course of 13 months

376
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,879
The Story Behind These are that they're

377
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,720
all mythical beasts of Japan the show

378
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,679
was called Yoku Yokai being the

379
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,560
shape-shifting ghosts and the Kaiju

380
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,198
being more the dragon demon likee

381
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,799
Godzilla characters the guys worked back

382
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,758
and forth um sending stuff by mail but

383
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,039
also flying down two of the guys from

384
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,079
Japan flew down to the DFO and then

385
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,198
stayed in the United States and continue

386
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,719
to work with the guys so what came out

387
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,240
of it was about 17 beasts of this sort

388
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,399
of Epic nature everything from from the

389
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,440
smaller guys that you see up top to the

390
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,759
more epic beasts in the middle and two

391
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,959
monster beasts that we have downstairs

392
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,079
as well as a few slop

393
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:15,359
cups very

394
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,000
cool love the slop cups with this one

395
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,480
the next one that you're shooting the

396
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,799
sake bottle all the tiny tiny white dots

397
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,000
the ring at the top and just the tiny

398
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,000
dots in that kind of brick type stack

399
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,318
those are all UV reactive there's a

400
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,399
slight layer under the eyelid that's UV

401
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:34,278
reactive but the guy is hit it in a very

402
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,278
subtle fashion it's also a really

403
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,318
interesting set of teeth from Salt where

404
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:40,559
it's a fully circular but Hollow set of

405
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:41,958
teeth underneath so that Chomper

406
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,198
literally like a circular set of teeth

407
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,278
that would just bite into anything very

408
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:49,318
cool and this is so cool with the

409
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,600
hanging head so epic we got come on

410
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,318
we've got the ogre and we've got these

411
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,800
silver

412
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:58,278
formed glass with silver over top blades

413
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,479
that have been sharpened by the guys and

414
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,759
this is the capitated head that the ogre

415
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,759
has

416
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,000
captured

417
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:12,078
man that's really really impressive and

418
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,360
then at the bottom we have an

419
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,758
interpretation of three different sake

420
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,159
bottles so similar to the clear one

421
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,480
we've got sort of smaller drinking

422
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,039
bottles at the bottom we've got a green

423
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,680
one a pink one and a purple guy over

424
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:27,039
here each of them having their own

425
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,799
Japanese Beast name as well as we move

426
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,120
over to the right

427
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,159
you'll see just like you were filming

428
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,480
the big cab on the RO the rose roads cab

429
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,519
on this one is similar to the one from

430
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,800
up top with the spider where all the

431
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,039
clear dots between the blue dots are all

432
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:45,318
UV reactive wow so once you pop a black

433
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:48,198
light onto this everything that's

434
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:51,039
clear just explodes and sort of like a

435
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:53,958
bright I just noticed the woman on this

436
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,958
guy's chest you'll also notice the woman

437
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,838
on the guy's chest softens so she

438
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,758
becomes very deeply blasted at the top

439
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,160
and then it softens around leg so that

440
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,318
there's no Integrity lost in the

441
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,798
structure of the leg my God and this

442
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,159
Beast is called iaya which means a woman

443
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,838
whose face reflects as an old man so you

444
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,480
can see the falling slop woman looking

445
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,159
up at the old man a little tough with

446
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,038
the light in here too but behind the

447
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,240
rose roads eye Millies is also a layer

448
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,759
of UV so this one is very taxle and its

449
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,000
UV uses as well just behind the

450
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:28,119
eyeballs and we've

451
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,880
got got Nick and salt working on the

452
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,639
hands the and the face the feet are very

453
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,200
obviously Snick and then you've got a

454
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,799
Yoshi marble on the back and the rose

455
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
roads Cals and disc glass diece skate

456
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:41,440
did the shaping of the bottle in the

457
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,678
middle

458
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,679
wow it's

459
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,480
incredible so yeah our goal is really to

460
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,200
start exposing this type of work in the

461
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,319
neighborhood we're fortunate enough to

462
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,120
have uh a Glass Gallery that's been

463
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,319

465
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,000

00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,079
piece by b feine b feine Meer and uh

490
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,120
Martin was not a part of this it was all

491
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,678
this is a collaboration between Martin

492
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,519
between rer and B yes and it is the cup

493
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,038
winning entry for

494
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,319
201 I believe it was it was it was right

495
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,798
on or next to my booth that year that's

496
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,759
right that's right in fact and then

497
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,720
beside your booth last year did you have

498
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,558
a booth last year yes and was R beside

499
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,480
your booth with the backpack last year

500
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:18,480
Yep they're always either at my booth or

501
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,798
beside my booth most years I've told

502
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Martin uh he can put whatever he needs

503
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,480
to put on my booth and we've just been

504
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,159
doing that for almost 10 years now so

505
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,279
cool so then part of the extension of

506
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,360
the Yoku stuff that you saw upstairs we

507
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,038
have two sloth cups that are in here

508
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,439
well we call them SLO cups but they're

509
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,960
actually five man collaborations really

510
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,279
hard to see under the plastic so we'll

511
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,960
move some of this stuff out but for

512
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,678
example this one is a great thing to

513
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,360
show outside you've got one side which

514
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,919
has a very saltlike face with two

515
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:54,798
fantastic ey Millies the ey Millies are

516
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,919
insane insane insane right that's insane

517
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,639
and then there's an IM Milly on the Dome

518
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,720
of a different pattern beautiful teeth

519
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,759
too I know and look at from the side so

520
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,440
now you have both faces you have the

521
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,839
Snick and the salt so we're moving over

522
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,440
to the Snick side now we three different

523
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:16,079
Millies how about that Bindy

524
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Millie right so are you kidding me now

525
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,798
I'm going to also take the diffuser out

526
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,919
and show you from the bottom cuz this

527
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:26,519
was pretty special seeing how the bottom

528
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,759
looked how Yoshi's section was kind of P

529
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,200
almost made it look like one of his

530
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,919
marbles right incredible and then we'll

531
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,480
turn it around and you see the same kind

532
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,400
of thing from the

533
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,440
top all right let me get in there

534
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,919
without touching that oh oh

535
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,360
yeah so absolutely outstanding work

536
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,520
there are three collaboration cups

537
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,079
remaining is this the artist up here

538
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:49,879
yeah this is Yoshi condo he's one of the

539
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,759
artists that we had in our show respect

540
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,039
Yoshi the photos that we have on the

541
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,079
wall are by a photographer named Akiko

542
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,558
Akiko good job Akiko These are nice

543
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:01,119
shots amazing amazing and she visited

544
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,440
Yoshi's studio and made the photographs

545
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,119
and we printed them up on the wall there

546
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
are some making up photographs as well

547
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,879
that were shot by Yoshi himself we'll do

548
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,320
the same thing with a marble and there's

549
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,080
one in here I really want to show you

550
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,558
guys it's a new style marble that Yoshi

551
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,278
condo created specifically for the show

552
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:19,519
most of his stuff is extremely circular

553
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,240
and symmetrical this is circular and

554
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,278
symmetrical but what you've got here now

555
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,480
is you've got he kind of breaks the

556
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,119
circle on the top and you've got this

557
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,120
character inside so I'll turn it this

558
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,918
way and this would you know to most

559
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,439
people would look like a fairly regular

560
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,360
condo marble and then as soon as you

561
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,440
turn it you've all of a sudden got the

562
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,199
breaking of the circle up here incred

563
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,720
and his new style pendants are like this

564
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,558
Beast inside and the Beast usually you

565
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,159
can turn him upside down see multiple

566
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,480
faces I think Mark bubble man like you

567
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,799
were saying earlier you know these

568
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,120
things this is hours and hours of

569
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,319
entertainment and enjoyment this one's

570
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,519
got yeah hold it right there yeah I've

571
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,519
got an opal stack I'm going to turn it

572
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,960
so Yoshi's signature is right and then

573
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,558
you can adjust so you've got but you've

574
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,440
got a diamond opal underneath his

575
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:08,079
signature opal underneath an octagon

576
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,000
opal you are kidding me right there's a

577
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,399
and the way that Yoshi explained it to

578
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,599
me is he always puts things inside as

579
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,880
marbles for people to enjoy who have had

580
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:18,399
his marbles for a very long time so even

581
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,600
owning this for a very long time you

582
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,798
will find surprises in it as you sit

583
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,439
there and trip out on his glass really

584
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,519
and that's a very intentional part of

585
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,120
his work is that you know these are epic

586
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,960
pieces they take a long time to make but

587
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,038
he wants people to constantly discover

588
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,319
things we talking about Gates and reos

589
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:36,400
marbles they're the same you really deep

590
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,879
universes things floating in space that

591
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,480
are only revealed when you turn them

592
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,320
certain ways great name really for the

593
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,079
gates and marbles the universe marbles

594
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,439
exactly exactly now I'm going to take

595
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:48,519
you over to see three more pieces that

596
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,840
we have here actually four so I'm going

597
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:55,599
to open the cabinet so we don't get the

598
00:22:49,839 --> 00:23:01,359
glare mhm this is man onti onii sorry

599

are the are actually the sushi and onti

601
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,359
right I was going to say why does that

602
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,440
so it's very close and I kept

603
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,798
mispronouncing it my wife who's Japanese

604
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
made sure that I got it right so these

605
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:16,038
this is I mean what you're seeing here

606
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
maybe people don't always know but

607
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:19,640
accidents happen in glass when the guys

608
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,000
are working on the stuff things explode

609
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,960
colors are not always compatible and

610
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,119
here's a great little piece these faces

611
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,759
that have the wonderful Akio inclusion

612
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,639
in the top we got a Ro miniature rose

613
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,519

Bonkers how these guys

615
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,319
look so what happened is these little

616
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,640
demons that you're looking at

617
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,319
here amazing so these demons were adhere

618
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,960
to the front of the feet The Story Goes

620
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,640
his mouth and with his feet and Stomps

621
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,200

622
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,038
these were put in the Kil they exploded

623
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,519
on the feet wow so we still deal in an

624
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:59,720
area that's quite risky you know Fire

625
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,519
Burns glass cuts and not all glasses

626
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,640

seven guys have ever come together to

638
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:27,278
make a piece and from their assumption

639
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,079
this is the first time seven artists

640
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,079
from Japan have ever come together to

641
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:34,158
make anything wow so it's really

642
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,839
historical isn't it yeah and this is a

dome that they made that's available

644
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,519

and there are photographs throughout the

651
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,679
gallery and some videos behind me of the

652
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,960
making of this piece as well well it's

653
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,840
great that you guys has managed to um

654
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,640
you know record get video get photos and

655
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,959
really sort of all props to team Japan

656
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,360
they did a great job recording

657
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,159
everything so that we could explain to

658
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,918
people who had never seen this or a lot

659
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,120
of times Mark I'm sure you know people

660
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,720
assume that it's paint it's paint inside

661
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,918
some kind of layer and to really explain

662
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,278
how this dot stack worked here how these

663
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,919
tiny dots in the opal just looking at

664
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,519
the opal in the eye it's completely

665
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,759
insane it kind of floats above most of

666
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:31,119
uh taka miyake's work is like that

667
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,359
they're two separate colored eyes and

668
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,639
the opal just floats gently gently above

669
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,000
I think if you swing around in this

670
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,120
direction you might be able to see oh

671
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,119
yeah you can catch it for

672
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:51,480
sure it's cool yeah I mean the

673
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:55,479
Dome the Dome is also incredible look at

674
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,759
the opal on the top there just

675
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,839
wow wow man and you've got a hop a

676
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,119
signature a signature mil inside the eye

677
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,639
so we're going to move down to one two

678
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,959
more epic pieces we have a Sherlock that

679
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,880
was made in preparation for this show um

680
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,038
very you know should we take one of

681
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,320
these pieces outside to show you the

682
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:16,519
beauty of them in the light yeah I think

683
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,918
that'd be a great idea Okay cool

684
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,519
so we'll take we'll take the Sherlock

685
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,880
and we'll sure but maybe I I quickly

686
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,599
show you the other one as well maybe

687
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,840
bring them both okay bring them both

688
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,839

the can I can I ask you to hold this you

691
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,038

692
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,200
get we'll get you to hold this she knows

693
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,519
how to handle epic glass hold this

694
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,038
$30,000 slop cut so this is much better

695
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,200
seene here you see the same type of eye

696
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:55,240
that you were looking at earlier the

697
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,080
color in in the metal fuming is Cobalt

698
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,839
there's a Yoshi section in the middle

699
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,038
and there's a Taka miak a um sort of

700
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:05,278
Mandela here too that you saw inside now

701
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:06,919
this one's really special his DOT Stacks

702
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,599
usually are the color dock Stacks which

703
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,038
everybody is starting to know but I'm

704
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,000
going to turn this sideways just gently

705
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:17,798
so that you can see that there's metal

706
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,558
fuming between the dots that's popped up

707
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:23,440
absolutely Bonkers work there's a great

708
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:26,558
example of the fuming coming up about it

709
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Jesus the glst that's pretty incredible

710
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,918
mindblowing right tight it is so now I'm

711
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,880
going to switch hands here God the top

712
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:40,360
of that bowl is inous too so I get

713
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:43,200
haa now what we have is the seven Man

714
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:45,359
team Japan cup here these guys don't

715
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,880
make cups often there are a few examples

716
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,959
of two three and four man cups and this

717
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,440
is the first seven man cup ever created

718
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,159
it's got a excuse my language [ __ ] load

719
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,320
of um Troutman glass in here called

720
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,640
halflife and team Japan were the first

721
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,000
to get a lot of this stuff it's like a

722
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,278
Coca-Cola colored the I think this is

723
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Black Jack the skull so it's actually

724
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,079
not fully black it's kind of like a

725
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,319
Coca-Cola color and then you've got a

726
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:13,119
uranium eye I just saw that I was going

727
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:15,079
to ask you is that a uranium marble in

728
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,959
the eye there's a uranium dot in the eye

729
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:19,720
that glows focused in on that right now

730
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,360
and isn't it perfectly set like when you

731
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,440
look Beyond it it's like looking at a a

732
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,439
Jew right yeah no it's is a perfect orb

733
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,720
now I'm going to turn it around so you

734
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,399
can see the skull on the back actually

735
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,399
let's just turn the

736
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,839
Dome there we

737
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:43,398

they're goggles I didn't ey goggles

741
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,720
they're eye goggles until we took it

742
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,640
outside I didn't realize that they were

743
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,159
strapped he just put his eyes up that's

744
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,759
right he's just put his eyes up

745
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,440
unbelievable this piece keeps exciting

746
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:02,440
me so what we've got here is also the

747
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,159
first time that anybody's gone over Yosi

748
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,759
doubled it up yeah so what you have here

749
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,480
is you have an AKO isumi

750
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:13,960
um line over top of Yoshi's dots so just

751
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,720
crazy again the use of uranium in here

752
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,278
you have the white dots in here and the

753
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,519
white all the white dots in here will

754
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:23,200
glow but the middle does not so I mean

755
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,640
this this is a fairly special piece what

756
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,679
would a piece like this um this one

757
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,278
we're asking

758
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,038
$21,000 or about €8,000

759
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,599
and this is there were a few there were

760
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,158
a few there were a few pieces that were

761
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,759
made similar to this that were used to

762
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,760
to fund the trip and to fund team

763
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,839
Japan's work for this one of them is the

764
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,119
Sherlock that we're looking at that for

765
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:47,959
example is

766
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:50,479
about valued at about 5,000 U us around

767
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,480
that range all of them are kind of great

768
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,319
pieces for collectors to scoop now when

769
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,919
does when does Ed get to take that home

770
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,639
Ed gets to take that home when he puts

771
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,120
his last down payment on it he's very

772
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,080
close and this is truly an unbelievable

773
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,839
scoop I'm going to Puff it I want to

774
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,519
Puff it too so I mean we're we we really

775
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,519
respect the glass and we work closely

776
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,000
with the artist so we

777
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,399
always aome we usually work with our

778
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,200
collectors to make sure that if the

779
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:17,158
collectors at any point in time do want

780
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,200
to get rid of their piece we will help

781
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,320
them move that piece so the same way

782
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,798
that traditional art galleries and

783
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,839
museums have helped collectors move

784
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:25,679
their pieces we prefer to move it with

785
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,119
all the authenticity documents all the

786
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,200
things that we have for it move it to

787
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,000
the next customer that's the case but

788
