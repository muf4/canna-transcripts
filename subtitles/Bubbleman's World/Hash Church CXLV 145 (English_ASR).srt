both Nate I guess he's a colleague is he

42
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:04,349
yeah yeah Nathan is our a head of IT and

43
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,929
he's kind of helping us spread the word

44
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,719
on the internet so

45
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,290
well he's doing a great job Peter has

46
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,750
come to us from soil balance Pro and

47
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:16,189
he's gonna be talking to us today about

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,900
we had a really great conversation the

49
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,449
other day just in regards to living

50
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,460
soils and the bacterias and the

51
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:24,799
different strings that Peter calls

52
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,510
givers you know the ones that are gonna

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,550
produce the most sort of symbiotic

54
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:32,419
relationship with the plant and I

55
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,590
figured because he was talking about one

56
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,479
of the things that their company talks

57
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,580
about is raising the levels of terpenes

58
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,310
that was something that was of interest

59
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,230
to us as well we're always talking about

60
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,810
terpenes over here it's one of the

61
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:47,179
hottest conversations these days on a

62
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,209
lot of these shows that happen obviously

63
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,060
Tony starting it off while even prior to

64
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:56,150
Tony we had Kay really into it way prior

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,800
to Kay we had skunk man Sam that's the

66
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,560
first person I ever heard talk about

67
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:05,570
terpenes and it was God it has to be

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,969
back down to 2001 2000 and maybe two so

69
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,709
it's been a long developing conversation

70
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:13,189
I know Tony's excited to get in the room

71
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:17,390
today to discuss terpenes as well as

72
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:20,650
living soils and yeah welcome my Defour

73
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:23,329
20k and skunkman Sam to the room as well

74
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,680
happy belated Canada Day to everyone

75
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:31,219
thank you good morning yeah man cannabis

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,260
day happy cannabis day yes it was more

77
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:36,189
of a Canada Day for me I'd have to admit

78
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:39,319
I didn't go to I haven't gone to

79
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:41,810
cannabis day I have to admit in many

80
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,659
years I used to go all the time for July

81
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,629
first and go do the little gathering and

82
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:50,239
puff mat bowls and I guess this year the

83
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:53,479
art gallery pulled a move on us and they

84
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,860
were like like a month before they said

85
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,079
that there was a children's event

86
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,690
happening that they booked for that same

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,370
day so you know and Dana Larson and the

88
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,560
rest of the activists that organized

89
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,989
that event they were like man we can't

90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,780
do this we can't we can't go and have a

91
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,299
giant smoke smoke Athan at a Children's

92
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,069
Festival so hats off to Dana and all of

93
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,530
those activists that make that decision

94
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,839
showing that they don't have to be so

95
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,829
stubborn that they can easily move on to

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,689
the next to the next

97
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,180
it's about the people in the event I

98
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,560
think more than the venue anyway yeah I

99
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,569
didn't get a chance to make it to the

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,430
camera state yesterday but it looks like

101
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,740
it was a fantastic event they were down

102
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,900
that the old train station they're down

103
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,788
in Vancouver and main in terminal right

104
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,138
there was a live event it looked like

105
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:38,668
quite a few people showed up because I

106
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,530
kind of watched it viewed it I didn't

107
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:42,839
get a chance to get out of the other

108
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:45,000
other out of the home type deal it was a

109
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,068
busy busy day but looks like everybody

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,379
enjoyed themselves and hey can we have a

111
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,889
happy 150 it was fantastic that's

112
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,319
awesome

113
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,819
hey why don't pee tur would you like to

114
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,259
start and give us a little lowdown on

115
00:04:53,819 --> 00:05:01,289
how you kind of got into this soil

116
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:03,538
bacteria you know kind of focused that

117
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:07,918
you've been focused on yes sure

118
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:10,620
so I'm 39 now when I was 19 I was living

119
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:15,359
in Southern California and I was working

120
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,840
outside of a hotel and I met these two

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,270
gentlemen that we're talking about

122
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,158
facilitating you know cosmic energy to

123
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,109
into the plant so that the plants would

124
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:27,930
have super high nutrient density so that

125
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,090
way it would kind of elevate our species

126
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,310
right they were talking about what's

127
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,709
called biodynamic agriculture and I was

128
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,240
just kind of like wow you come when

129
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,528
you're that age you're kind of trying to

130
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,019
figure out what you want to do with your

131
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:41,728
life so I just was like that's me like

132
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,418
I'm tuned into that I want to make the

133
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:44,250
food better

134
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:48,269
I want to I want to increase nutrient

135
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,098
density so that you know people can just

136
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,848
elevate it just kind of felt right and

137
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:56,069
it made sense so so I started studying

138
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:59,189
sustainable agriculture and I studied

139
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:03,330
soil physics soil chemistry and and the

140
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:07,800
last part to that equation was the the

141
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:11,550
soil biology yeah a life that's in a

142
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:16,218
soil so what I did was I started

143
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,218
applying the practices of

144
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,569
the fertilization and the macro

145
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:24,180
micronutrients and the cation exchange

146
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,919
capacity and working with the pH and

147
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,949
working with paramagnetism and working

148
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,378
with the the energetic frequencies that

149
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:34,228
come from bio dynamics but a life was

150
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,340
missing so what we were having was you

151
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,699
know we were putting all these good

152
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:41,068
things in there and and we needed

153
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,139
something to kind of tie it all in you

154
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,778
know kind of like the soils digestive

155
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,819
system so what I did was I I went out

156
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:54,028
and back then you know this was like in

157
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:55,770
97 I think but a lot of people really

158
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:57,870
cared about organic agriculture

159
00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:01,109
sustainable agriculture wasn't really a

160
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,680
topic of conversation back then you know

161
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,860
I you guys remember you're in that space

162
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,918
I think so mm-hmm

163
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,240
what ended up happening was you know you

164
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:13,948
would talk to somebody about organic

165
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,598
food or nutrient dense food and they're

166
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:20,129
like that's widening here and so so

167
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,848
anyways they made kind of a really long

168
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:27,000
story short I started researching and

169
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:31,408
trying to find top microbiologists stuff

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,218
again this was like 1819 years ago hmm

171
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:36,810
and I found multiple guys back then the

172
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:38,579
industry was kind of small kind of like

173
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,620
this industry as the canvas industry is

174
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,550
just starting to really bloom but I

175
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,889
ended up meeting some of the best

176
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,889
world-class high-level microbiologists

177
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,598
in the world and these guys were kind of

178
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,250
like the microorganisms that they were

179
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,168
trying to create they were givers they

180
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,250
they understood that there was going to

181
00:07:55,168 --> 00:08:01,588
be this this this evolution of organic

182
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,408
cultivation and so they saw these guys

183
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:06,778
these organic growers struggling they

184
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:08,968
were like hey man you know these guys

185
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,348
are trying to do the right thing they're

186
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:12,180
trying to work with nature and earth but

187
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:14,519
they don't have the right tools and none

188
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,728
of the tools are there for them to to be

189
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:21,180
able to cultivate without a lot of the

190
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:23,610
health issues that they were facing and

191
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,588
so way back then these scientists these

192
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,120
micro biologists were like hey man we're

193
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,899
creating you know and these were guys

194
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,610
that were tree

195
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,009
major stuff for countries like these

196
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,408
guys were petitioned to new projects by

197
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:38,450
you know Australia the United States

198
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:42,080
like they were they were helping mostly

199
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,430
with plant diseases at that time and so

200
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,019
they said we need we need to put

201
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,969
something together we to come together

202
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:48,289
as a group kind of like what what you

203
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,129
guys are doing and what this industry is

204
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:53,539
doing we need to come together

205
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:56,588
collectively to support these stewards

206
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:58,549
of our lands these microbiologists and

207
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,850
that's when I hooked up with them

208
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:03,708
because I was on a whole other end of

209
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,259
you know the spectrum I was more into

210
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:08,869
the fertilization and biodynamic element

211
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,819
so I started to learn from these guys

212
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,649
they embrace me they were you know

213
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,760
really beautiful giving human beings and

214
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,769
very very beautiful people

215
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,689
so they taught me a lot about

216
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,549
microbiology you know I wasn't a

217
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,050
microbiologist by trade so they've kind

218
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:27,049
of cultivated me over the years and

219
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:30,409
helped me really understand how

220
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:32,240
important it is to add the light to the

221
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:35,980
soil to make everything that you guys

222
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,049
are doing new growers that much more

223
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,399
tuned into the plants and that's one of

224
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:42,708
the things that that we can talk about

225
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,240
with regards to the terpenes so I'll

226
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,578
kind of shut up now I get rolling light

227
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,470
stuff so no awesome dude glad you're

228
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:50,719
giving us a little breakdown on what

229
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,860
you're about and it's no it's great it's

230
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,259
definitely where I want the conversation

231
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,300
to lead today and get a little bit more

232
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:59,649
into these Living soils you know I

233
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:02,689
started growing back in the late 80s and

234
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:05,149
it was really all about at that point

235
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,589
people were trying up this hydroponic

236
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,659
thing I didn't start growing

237
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,190
hydroponically personally but it was it

238
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:12,139
might as well been because it's these

239
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,930
living earth not living soils quite the

240
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:17,299
opposite soil lists soils soilless

241
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:19,458
mixtures that are like it's an inert

242
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,109
material that you know sure it might

243
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:24,768
change the pH a little bit but it's not

244
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,959
a living breathing thing it's just this

245
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,970
dead soil that you kind of get the idea

246
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,469
once you grow a few crops out of it

247
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:36,230
you're like I wonder why I'm growing

248
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:38,629
sixes instead of tens and it gets to

249
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,528
that point of like are you giving the

250
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:42,948
plant what

251
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:44,778
needs to express itself and so that's

252
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:47,448
that's why I found what you were saying

253
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:49,669
I always like my spider-sense always

254
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:52,068
sort of Peaks out when I hear anyone

255
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:57,799
claiming you know to be able to

256
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:59,599
manipulate terpene content with with you

257
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,698
know like a you know there was a product

258
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,350
years ago that Remo was using called the

259
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:05,359
turbinator and I was just like I don't

260
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,829
know about this stuff he said no man

261
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,720
it's great you pour it on the plant it's

262
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:10,849
sort of I'm like I don't know I think

263
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,709
the name itself is throwing me off but

264
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,389
you guys were a little different you're

265
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,909
not really claiming that you're you know

266
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:19,549
using a certain product to manipulate

267
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:22,249
levels as much as to creating perfect

268
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:24,919
balance to create exceptional

269
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:27,019
expressions yeah so that's a little bit

270
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,509
different than saying oh we're you know

271
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,549
manipulating the the hydric of the the

272
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:34,159
terpene content of the plant inside the

273
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:35,708
trichomes compared to we're producing a

274
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,539
you know a symbiotic relationship

275
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:41,688
throughout this plant and soil that

276
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:43,458
allows for it to express you know at

277
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:45,919
least from the tests that I saw you guys

278
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,828
do they were substantially higher and

279
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,838
terpene content than the ones that

280
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:55,039
obviously were not grown that way you

281
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:58,040
know so the see we've just kind of come

282
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:01,219
into an awareness right now where people

283
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,838
are understanding how terpenes are even

284
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,689
produced but a lot of people actually

285
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:09,199
know exactly what that compound within

286
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:13,179
the trichome how how its created so it's

287
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:16,938
very fortuitous that right now the

288
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:18,258
Netherlands Institute of ecology they

289
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:22,578
know a thing or two about growing grass

290
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:23,990
out there you know the Netherlands we've

291
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:25,698
got we've got one of their most

292
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,970
exceptional growers in the room right

293
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:30,198
now

294
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:32,360
Oh fantastic so so the Netherlands

295
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,758
Institute of ecology came out with this

296
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,329
article recently that said the world's

297
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,879
most spoken language is Turkey so what

298
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:44,028
they're saying is and I'll actually read

299
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,949
it it says it says microorganisms

300
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:48,799
communicate with each other and the rest

301
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:50,808
of the world through smells if you're

302
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,699
small smells are a good way to stand out

303
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:55,439
a team of researchers led by Ben

304
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,540
ecology as demonstrated for the first

305
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,300
time that two different types of

306
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:02,490
microorganisms bacteria and fungi use

307
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:06,329
fragrances known as terpenes to hold

308
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,539
conversations that's awesome

309
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,220
yeah they're saying that it's well this

310
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,250
is a quote he says no way is that

311
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,470
limited to terpenes at all form sensing

312
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,600
is how bacteria communicates and it's

313
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,460
through all kinds of chemicals and it's

314
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,560
not limited to Turkey in Turkey in just

315
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,480
a very very small fraction there is a

316
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,809
sort of a field called chemical ecology

317
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:32,190
which studies basically the insects and

318
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:34,379
how they use chemicals as different

319
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,390
signals and so like beetles and whatnot

320
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,029
and ants and all those little creepy

321
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:41,159
crawly insects all communicate by

322
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:44,669
chemical emissions through their anus

323
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,519
and it turns out it like leaves a trail

324
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,750
for those who are coming behind to make

325
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,269
sure that they're going in the right

326
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,679
direction kinda like the the breadcrumbs

327
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:58,720
that real interesting kind of like

328
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:03,759
eating Chipotle with your friends yeah

329
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,759
[Laughter]

330
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:16,050
it's pretty obvious that organically

331
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,500
biodynamically grown tomatoes vegetables

332
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:24,629
fruits have a higher terpene content

333
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,399
more flavor more smell and in general I

334
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:30,059
would say that's obviously true with

335
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:34,139
cannabis - yeah it'll also usually grow

336
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:37,949
more with really good rich soil organic

337
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:40,590
biodynamic soil it'll grow not only more

338
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,830
roots but really a lot of the really

339
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:46,500
really really tiny fine roots it makes a

340
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,540
matter of tiny fine roots and that's

341
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,379
where the energy to produce all these

342
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:54,299
terpenes comes from yeah you know so

343
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,439
think about this this is kind of an

344
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,169
interesting concept that was

345
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,680
communicated to me recently so so when

346
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:02,370
we sweat our tibia creates a an odor

347
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,899
right

348
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,710
some people are drawn to it some people

349
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,079
are repelled by it

350
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,778
in the same way we're communicating more

351
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,440
that's right you guys as growers you

352
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:15,009
guys feel definitely like an energetic

353
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,839
communication with your plant but

354
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:19,480
there's also you know in this reality of

355
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,610
physical type of communication and a lot

356
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,909
of that's happening through the transfer

357
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,709
of biology so as the plants terpenes are

358
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:28,259
you know hydro carbon that's lighter

359
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:32,859
than air that's going into your nose

360
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:36,939
you're your own communication is is is

361
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:39,310
transferring to that plant with a lot of

362
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,839
these smells this this trippy molecule

363
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,939
this high pet hydrocarbon again that's

364
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,399
lighter than air so when you think about

365
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,870
the fact that you're tuning into your

366
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,600
plants you feel like you're tuning into

367
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,120
your plants you you really are not only

368
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,389
on an energetic level but a biological

369
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,120
one and so that's that's something that

370
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,159
has really just impacted me when you

371
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,649
think about the fact that could a plant

372
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,319
actually tune in to create the type of

373
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,350
medicine that we need according to our

374
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,589
own biology I have definitely had this

375
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,120
concept and thought years ago at first I

376
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,459
thought it was a form of cognitive

377
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,679
dissonance that people's egos were so

378
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:20,199
attracted to what they themselves

379
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,870
produced and grew they were just always

380
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,490
like all of my shits the best I got that

381
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,799
nobody can touch my [ __ ] it's just

382
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,778
unbeatable and I got to the point where

383
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,909
I somehow wondered like is there a

384
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:34,169
relationship going on where these plants

385
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:37,360
are producing these resin glands in

386
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:39,099
congruence with us being around them

387
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,509
constantly the more time you spend with

388
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,490
your plants the more time you're

389
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:44,528
touching and feeling and moving them

390
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,778
I've always thought of it myself it's a

391
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:49,778
very psychedelic thought it's not one

392
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:52,240
that I that every sort of very hardcore

393
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:54,610
staunch maybe scientist that needs proof

394
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,778
in every aspect of what they do ie I see

395
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:03,639
you smiling Mark Scott child owned it

396
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:09,189
right me too but I think it's an

397
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:11,920
interesting concept we used to grow

398
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:16,839
plants up along a riverbed on an old

399
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,610
horse trail and every morning my wife at

400
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,509
the time and I would go up and she was

401
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,549
pregnant we would

402
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:24,099
sit in the plants for a couple hours I

403
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:29,099
would bring my sitar and my club string

404
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:32,079
up there and play my mic friends told us

405
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,639
that in the morning when we first went

406
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,139
there the plants are all reaching up

407
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,480
very high because we grew them under

408
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,030
trees but by the time we got done two

409
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:45,039
hours later the plants all leaned

410
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:47,019
towards us and they I used to have some

411
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,430
pictures dispenser all in over to the

412
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:50,650
center where Annie and I were sitting

413
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,900
and when we left they would straighten

414
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:57,550
back up and go towards the Sun and we

415
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,230
always felt this they leaned towards us

416
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,210
because we were dismissing something

417
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,250
that they wanted to have vibrationally

418
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,870
by any chance where you grow in South

419
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:11,289
Indian say again by any chance were you

420
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:13,000
growing Kerala South Indian weed maybe

421
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:19,119
that's why they wanted to hear the music

422
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,400
better no I didn't but we grew in

423
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,289
Bangalore but the plants never got over

424
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,300
two and a half or three feet tall they

425
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:28,420
just started flowering from the second

426
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:31,149
set of leaves and become two foot long

427
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:34,090
but we could never get him to grow very

428
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:38,440
big there but that was in San Diego

429
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:42,730
where I'm talking about a friend of mine

430
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:45,730
his name is Bruce Pearl Owen he's a big

431
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:49,089
industrial hemp grower actually back in

432
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,279
the 90s they called him the king of pot

433
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:54,039
because he smuggled in a ton of it

434
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,889
through San Francisco so we were having

435
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:59,109
a conversation recently and he said the

436
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:02,110
Peter Ike I heard that if you take a

437
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:05,139
cannabis seed and you put it in your

438
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:07,449
mouth you allow your saliva to kind of

439
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,970
coat the seed again I don't know if this

440
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,490
is true this is just what he told me

441
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,039
you take that seed and you allow the

442
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,660
biology of your own body to to kind of

443
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,889
penetrate it and absorb within the

444
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:22,840
seaton and you plant it

445
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:25,000
that plant will produce the medicines

446
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,149
and the oils and the things and the

447
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,059
nutrients that your body is either

448
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,700
lacking or that that is necessary to

449
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:36,899
heal you we told

450
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,569
well she deeply hard to believe that one

451
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,480
[Laughter]

452
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:46,329
home it has Church Brava

453
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,610
what's that I guess you're right at home

454
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:50,039
at hashed Church with all the rest of us

455
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:53,289
hi brothers

456
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:56,039
sure enough true enough yeah well who's

457
00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:00,899
to say who's to not say I guess it's a

458
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:04,329
scientific experiments for the future

459
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:08,140
one thing's for sure everything has

460
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:10,480
order and the borders are ambiguous and

461
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,730
so if you put a seed in your mouth you

462
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,500
can be sure that somewhere along there

463
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,319
if some of your DNA is getting

464
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,740
transferred to that seat they find DNA

465
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:23,230
in the craziest places that's the police

466
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,069
department they'll tell you just how

467
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,519
crazy that is

468
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:29,289
but and they recover it from all kinds

469
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,129
of places so the idea that there could

470
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:37,839
be a penetration into it the question is

471
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:40,330
does it really affect that but then you

472
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,689
get into the area of well does the

473
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:48,789
emotion of love affect these things

474
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:51,850
that's getting into emotive Asura I know

475
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:55,389
seed for example can pass right through

476
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:59,139
a human digestive system or birds and

477
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:01,840
still be viable that's very true

478
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm sure many a bird have helped crack

479
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:08,459
many a seed all over the world does that

480
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:12,159
mean most of the weed out there is birdy

481
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:17,079
it's possible no but look at all the

482
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:20,860
[ __ ] seeds go through yeah no it's for

483
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,539
real they are they are protecting the

484
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:24,909
most delicate of things it's amazing

485
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:28,240
sometimes when you crack like a 20 plus

486
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,610
year old seed and it's just like what it

487
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,529
just grew that's amazing

488
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:38,859
really blows my mind 25 I still got 96

489
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:40,599
percent with some varieties Wow

490
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:42,250
well you're you're the man dude I'm

491
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:46,379
gonna I'm not gonna pretend that I got

492
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:50,460
96 percent I got 9 percent

493
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:54,179
but other varieties I got more like 9%

494
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,370
also but some of my better ones 26 it

495
00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:01,500
actually shocked and surprised me

496
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:06,629
wow that's pretty 26 years old 25 years

497
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:10,880
old 96 percent germination Jesus well 1

498
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:13,380
33 year old seed crack out of 2 dozen

499
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,750
and it's sitting outside the front door

500
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,530
in the Sun right now and it's an Afghani

501
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:21,119
I don't know what it is all the other

502
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,908
plants that are around it are all much

503
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:27,389
taller than it but I was very surprised

504
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:33,110
to me it looks very healthy this green

505
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:37,470
beyond green it is deepest emerald what

506
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:40,979
what about the idea of potentially seeds

507
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,630
even lasting longer when grown with

508
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,480
plants that have these beneficial

509
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:48,419
microbials and bacterias well if you

510
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,730
grow a plant to its ultimate potential

511
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:55,799
the way you would do let's say an

512
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:58,500
heirloom organic tomato your your your

513
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:01,650
package is going to be longer lasting

514
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,048
and better the other thing you can do is

515
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:08,250
instead of making seeds in five weeks

516
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:10,769
from pollination what to do is you make

517
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:13,679
it over a 10 week period wait until the

518
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:17,099
seeds practically rattle in the in the

519
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,950
calyxes through the racks and that

520
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:21,779
produces a much healthier seed otherwise

521
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,509
when you take seeds a little bit early

522
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:27,240
they can be grayish or sometimes just

523
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:29,940
the base would be near the obsession

524
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,150
layer whether joining the plant the

525
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,429
flower you'll see it's wider than the

526
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:39,960
rest of it whereas a seed truly truly

527
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:42,200
finishes its it's dark and it's the same

528
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,880
color from the tip to the butt

529
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,440
so one of our clients of yours said

530
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
germination percentages I don't know if

531
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,690
you guys would be interested in that

532
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:53,099
with the biology absolutely yeah thank

533
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,380
you for the space and I wanted also

534
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,599
preface to you guys I really appreciate

535
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,030
you guys having not

536
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,859
like I I'm so grateful to work with good

537
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:03,019
growers and it's just something that

538
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:06,649
I've been so passionate about for seven

539
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:08,750
years so thank you guys for the space so

540
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,420
so one of our clients that was used in

541
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,640
the biology mixed in with the seeds they

542
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,590
were getting you know maybe maybe nine

543
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,440
or ten percent of their seeds were not

544
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:19,819
Germany I was just the case with all of

545
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,230
the students that they that they had

546
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:23,569
historically and this was a client that

547
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,009
had been specializing in students for

548
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:27,679
the last twenty years when they added

549
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:29,809
the biology the correct biology the

550
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,810
germination percentages not only went up

551
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:34,909
by about six to seven percent so from

552
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,559
like he goes eighty nine percent to

553
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:40,040
ninety six percent germination rate

554
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,750
which was pretty significant Wow yeah so

555
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,639
they were able to germinate ninety-six

556
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,910
percent of their seeds consistently with

557
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,640
the correct life on the on the scenes by

558
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:53,240
what I received were these these were

559
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,990
tall fescue grass seeds okay this was a

560
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,059
huge company that sells a lot of see

561
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,589
nationally yeah so ten percent is a

562
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:04,730
serious number when you're rocking

563
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:06,980
metric tons of seed yeah but what was

564
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,049
cool was the tall fescue see that they

565
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,150
had tested was normally germinating in

566
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,669
ten days and we circumvented that like

567
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:17,330
three days so so we were at seven days

568
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:19,550
germination nice quicker and more

569
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:21,139
efficient it makes sense I mean it's

570
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,940
funny that we're coming around to this

571
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,470
as Sam said earlier it's like it kind of

572
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,440
makes sense that if you throw that

573
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,269
heirloom tomato organically biologically

574
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,850
like living soils the whole nine yards

575
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,410
it expresses itself greater they it's

576
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:34,899
why when we taste them like all this

577
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,310
tastes so good compared to these

578
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,870
tomatoes that have come from the grocery

579
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:41,569
store now that almost they look like a

580
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:43,519
tomato they just don't have any flavor

581
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:46,329
at least if you're used to actually

582
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:50,019
tasting heirloom tomatoes which I feel

583
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:53,500
bill Hanson I was gonna say that I

584
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:59,049
strongly believe in organic biodynamic

585
00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:04,220
farming I was taught in 1972 at the

586
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:07,579
Santa Cruz University Alan Chadwick

587
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:10,500
experimental garden and I still keep

588
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:12,899
those principles close to my heart and

589
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,599
I I prefer growing cannabis that way

590
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,670
absolutely well thank you

591
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,309
you know I'm kid listen when I first met

592
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:23,519
Sam and smoked his product you know I

593
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:25,409
thought that I wasn't quite sure exactly

594
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,730
I just thought holy [ __ ] like okay this

595
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,040
guy's on another level because he's

596
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,900
doing things that other people not only

597
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,089
are they not doing they don't even have

598
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,519
a [ __ ] clue that that is a reality

599
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:37,199
and he's just over here you know raising

600
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,599
the bar while everyone else is kind of

601
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,759
playing with their marbles when I first

602
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,379
smoked his product and I of course it's

603
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:48,359
gonna sound like a story but I'm telling

604
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:50,460
you Peter it was shocking I'm strong it

605
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,559
was shocking like it shocked me it

606
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,710
almost knocked me off my feet I was like

607
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,869
mildly I was mildly scared in my head

608
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,309
sitting in this man's living room who I

609
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:02,129
looked up to and didn't want to like

610
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:04,049
pass out [ __ ] myself like and then he

611
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,670
gave and then he gave me like 40 more

612
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:07,529
hits trying to kill me he's like I'll

613
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,620
see what this kids made of it was like

614
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:13,009
oh my god like if there's something to

615
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:15,779
be said with proper bio dammit but

616
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:18,269
biodynamic growing but also breathing

617
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:20,430
for what he wants he's not just taking

618
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,170
other people's plants and being like oh

619
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,850
yeah this one's got I like this one it

620
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,860
tastes really good he's going in and

621
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:28,619
he's breathing specifically what he

622
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:33,449
wants and how he wants it to be and so

623
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:36,959
all of that put together puts em on a

624
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:39,470
whole other level I was just lucky and

625
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,900
that I had suspected for several decades

626
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:46,259
that the terpenes were responsible for

627
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,990
potentiating and modifying the effects

628
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:51,629
of THC in the other cannabinoids but I

629
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:55,380
thought I finally proved it in 2000 and

630
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:58,320
then once that happened it really

631
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,660
changed my picture of what was important

632
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,629
in cannabis because I had focused on the

633
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,000
cannabinoids and we we developed single

634
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:10,500
cannabinoid varieties for you know the

635
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,500
top 12 but then I realized it's terpenes

636
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,359
that are really creating most of the

637
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,779
majority of the different kinds of

638
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:21,659
effects the people really love from

639
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,788
cannabis some people like it up and

640
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,950
speedy some people like it

641
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:30,528
knocking your base couch what narcotic

642
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:33,629
physical but it's not what you want it's

643
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:37,648
we should have the ability to breathe

644
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:40,558
what you want hmm absolutely well I'll

645
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:43,349
tell you it's shocked its shocked it

646
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,569
shocked me and the rush that I could and

647
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:47,368
I've kind of like I'm not gonna lie like

648
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:49,918
I don't see much of that sense like

649
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:51,839
there's but you know like Tony's got

650
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,149
some of that going on you know with his

651
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,728
with his little mixtures and creations

652
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:58,439
and stuff but since Sam was just there's

653
00:28:56,729 --> 00:29:00,119
just been very few people to put a ten

654
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,919
in my bowl that's like it was grown

669
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,528

670
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:52,858
good just hang out in puff bowls and

671
00:29:49,528 --> 00:29:56,278
watch the kids do it look if it wasn't

672
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:58,739
we were on mark yeah that was lynn

673
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,329
canyon that was the falls we were

674
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:02,159
looking up people were jumping off no no

675
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:03,720
that was the popcorn one you have to

676
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,849
jump off because you've already jumped

677
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,659
off the 80-footer that one was like 30

678
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:11,878
feet the other ones under the bridge and

679
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,739
you'll see them sliding off of it it's

680
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:15,988
you go there and you think it's nothing

681
00:30:13,739 --> 00:30:17,729
because local kids that are like 12 have

682
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:19,649
been doing it their whole lives but then

683
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:21,629
you you start reading the little plaques

684
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,178
that are all around that say Oh on this

685
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:26,038
day this person died and this person

686
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,320
over here there's even a woman who died

687
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,749
sunbathing at Linn Valley a giant

688
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,428
boulder the size of a house cracked off

689
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:34,288
the mountain and literally landed right

690
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:35,370

691
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:36,960
boulder

692
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:38,939

693
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,250
Boulder and called it a day

694
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:47,370
Wow yeah they tell you sunbathing is

695
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,589
dangerous but Oh dangerous you know it's

696
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:50,939
why all the kids when you go there and

697
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:52,500
you're like you know this is dangerous

698
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,480
you shouldn't be jumping off there and

699
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,308
they'll say well you should be careful

700
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,940

776
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:42,849
time we're always happy to have Natasha

779
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:50,839
people show up earlier that's for sure

780
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:53,179
poster please everyone wants that poster

781
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,099
we will share that poster when we know

782
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,898
we're allowed it's not really ours to

783
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,180
share and I'm sure that they produced it

784
00:34:56,898 --> 00:35:01,190
for the very reason of sharing it but

785
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:01,730
there's a book about strikes you can

786
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,700
that you

787
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:07,940
can read the abstracts online and all

788
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:11,059
that information if you reach out to any

789
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:14,000
author most authors are kind of genuine

790
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:15,440
enough to send you a PDF all you need to

791
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,380
do and they're usually there's email

792
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,940
information in the abstract itself so if

793
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,430
someone really wants to get a copy of

794
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,349
the poster it might take a couple email

795
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:26,449
correspondences with the author but

796
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:34,519
they'll eventually send you you know you

797
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:36,289
can get it yeah we'll send it to you I'm

798
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,759
gonna go back you guys to first talk

799
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:39,079
devote about when people are growing

800
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,760
they always say they're the best grower

801
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,469
and I see that with a lot of people and

802
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,760
I used to have worked at some compassion

803
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:45,589
and stuff like that

804
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,940
and then we get back into terpenes and

805
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,430
stuff like that which you're mentioning

806
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,108
and and and everybody when they came in

807
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:53,089
with their own way that just growing for

808
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:54,529
the first time like smell this is smell

809
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,858
some ways the best we give them for

810
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:59,390
tribe and and then I mean Paul for me to

811
00:35:57,858 --> 00:36:01,940
laugh about it because every grower used

812
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:05,719
to always be the best grower because of

813
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:08,108
that they used it whole time nobody no

814
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:13,629
was not not used to but you know still

815
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:13,630
stuff but you know there's a name of

816
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:23,660
diseases it's small fish I mean big fish

817
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:25,130
small pond but but it also comes down to

818
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:26,539
that terpene expression you're talking

819
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,640
about that as they're growing it they're

820
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:30,289
smelling that every day and so when it

821
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,670
first comes to the harvest it's it's

822
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:34,159
that except like wow cuz they're always

823
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,650
that's always well even this spring we

824
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,259
you can barely smell the kiss so amazing

825
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,280
yeah and then I mean I really believe

826
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,690
that well you're talking with those

827
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,190
turkeys and stuff like that I want to

828
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:45,170
make mention of that because I've seen

829
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,490
that so much and even like myself I grow

830
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,829
the best wheat of course because it's

831
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:50,719
mine and it's for me and I I'm so used

832
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:52,759
to that strain and that smell on that

833
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,769
accustomed to it and I find how that

834
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,840
helps me would say my pain control in my

835
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:58,759
condition and the person that's growing

836
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,440
it it's helping them because of those

837
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,900
terpenes it's just like we're talking

838
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,940
about the turkeys you just its how it

839
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,980
helps me over there and you know yeah

840
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,740
it's it's interesting because I have a

841
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,699
growing that grows lavender lavender is

842
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:13,189
a very fragrant

843
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:14,239
type of a plant and he grows it in

844
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,030
France and he also

845
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,338
in the United States and as he does and

846
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:21,740
those different indigenous soils

847
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:23,500
he says the smells are completely

848
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,149
different where that plant naturally

849
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,250
co-evolved with he said it's just a much

850
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:30,588
more fragrant lavender but it's the same

851
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,300
screen it's the same plant he's grown

852
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:35,679
when he grows it in this United States

853
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,660
it's not as potent it's not as fragrant

854
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:42,199
imagine France is well known for growing

855
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:46,000
the best lavender they are but that's a

856
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:50,539
certain air was a cold breast or breeze

857
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,139
where they grow it but yeah it's hard to

858
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:55,880
beat when you find a particular

859
00:37:53,139 --> 00:38:01,879
combination of soils and local eco

860
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:04,820
environment that you know and that means

861
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,849
that we get to discover now all over the

862
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:10,130
planet the best places to grow cannabis

863
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:12,530
and not necessarily the best place to

864
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,230
grow cannabis under prohibition which is

865
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:17,420
different you know that's different when

866
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:20,000
when people say in Jamaica all the best

867
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,889
herb grows in Westmoreland it's like

868
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,510
does it or is that where the furthest

869
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:25,940
place was that you could get on the

870
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:28,849
island from the police that we're all in

871
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,099
Kingston my tribe was told the higher in

872
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:33,588
the mountain the better but I think it

873
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:36,140
was just they were further away from the

874
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:38,210
authorities of course dude I think that

875
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:40,969
that was literally connected to that

876
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,530
relationship and almost every time and

877
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:45,559
now that we're in a position where it's

878
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:47,720
like maybe we could grow anywhere we

879
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:50,619
want and find these perfect terpene

880
00:38:47,719 --> 00:39:00,219
expressions welcome to the room Tony

881
00:38:50,619 --> 00:39:01,760
Tony V in the room attorney chick Tony

882
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:05,299
it worked

883
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,700
yeah but he froze up it worked for a

884
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,480
second and then he froze up he'll be

885
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:14,269
back he'll be back depends hey and now

886
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,429
when we say depends on strain we can

887
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,989
still be being correct we'll just it

888
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:19,309
we'll just we'll tell people we're not

889
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,379
talking about this strain of cannabis

890
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:25,029
they're ours no such thing talking about

891
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,030
the bacterias the beneficials

892
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,818
all right that's it yeah it's we don't

893
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:32,909
have to run from the law we can we can

894
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:35,259
the right strains in our closet now

895
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:40,179
awesome there's Tony again how you doing

896
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:42,009
buddy the lavender thing we expect

897
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:48,308
you're havin Harry for checked checked'

898
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:49,349
parole okay for 11 years they tested us

899
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:53,019
they had today

900
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:56,920
Peggy lavender in Kansas they grew

901
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:59,318
avender in south of France and they were

902
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,749
comparing the two all the time so we

903
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:05,889
went through a number of that of course

904
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:07,838
you can just never did grow is nice have

905
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:09,458
we tried growing cannabis in the same

906
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:15,159
region of France that this lavender

907
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:18,788
grows in that's the variety that grows

908
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:25,118
good there is lavender cannabis right so

909
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:30,759
miss lavendar I mean it's the South of

910
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:33,579
France it's a very dry yeah not that

911
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:36,548
we're getting back are just really weird

912
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:39,219
with with the different bacterias that

913
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:41,259
we're using so for instance um you know

914
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:45,579
like a certain strain kosher cush might

915
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:48,519
be I in in you know one specific turkey

916
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:50,559
but then when you use more or less of a

917
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:52,268
certain bacteria that that expression

918
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,150
within the profile will completely

919
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:57,818
change in the same stream very very but

920
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,548
what else is altering is is it a

921
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:02,619
different photo period is it a different

922
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:05,409
light source is it different daily

923
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:07,599
temperatures different entities I mean

924
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:09,969
it's not that simple if you grow the

925
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,338
same clone under a dozen different

926
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:17,039
environmental conditions you will get a

927
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:19,719
dozen variations of that basic profile

928
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,549
absolutely yeah that's what makes it

929
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:23,349
such a difficult game that's why it's

930
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:24,909
just not so easy for people to just be

931
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:26,469
like I figured it out it's all I have to

932
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:29,469
do is use this product called the

933
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:31,630
Terminator and it's going to raise my

934
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:34,088
it's like yeah there's variables for

935
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:37,630
sure that's out I never used the

936
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:38,739
turbinator now it's is it gone oh I'm

937
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:42,450
sure it's not out there

938
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:46,449
I'm sure it still I'm not bummed out

939
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:48,789
with with soil balance what we did was

940
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:50,349
we and this is kind of how the product

941
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:51,730
was invented which is which is

942
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,159
interesting

943
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:55,869
the gentleman or the general the people

944
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,759
that invented it would travel all over

945
00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:02,350
the world so what they would do is

946
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,820
they'd go to like deserts different agro

947
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,920
ecosystems and they would isolate

948
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:08,619
strains that grew on the roots of plants

949
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,000
in all these different areas so this guy

950
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:14,710
you know how some guys collect cars some

951
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,780
guys collect you know different stuff

952
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,280
this this one of them our microbiologist

953
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,369
would just collect different bacterias

954
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,200
bioprospecting yeah yeah kind of like

955
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:25,150
you know stamp collectors or coin

956
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,529
collectors he collected microbes and

957
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,050
heat that's what you do you go travel

958
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,269
with his family and find microbes so did

959
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:33,670
he collect any of these off the roots of

960
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:36,849
cannabis or all over planet yeah

961
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:39,159
cannabis strains as well as like desert

962
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:41,199
strains and rainforests strains but what

963
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:45,099
we found was the desert strains actually

964
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:48,569
work the fastest so so think about the

965
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:50,980
amount of rain that comes into a desert

966
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:53,530
yearly it's like four inches of rain so

967
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,690
when water comes into that environment

968
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,550
the microorganisms that are dormant on

969
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:01,900
the roots of those plants need to do the

970
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:04,030
work of a regular microorganism in a

971
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,680
very short amount of time so kind of how

972
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,480
it works in their little world is as

973
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,250
soon as the rain comes in they're like

974
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,260
okay it's time to grow really fast so

975
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:13,119
they proliferate extremely fast rates

976
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,650
and then they have to signal the route

977
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,789
there's water here you've got to absorb

978
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,858
the water you got to absorb the

979
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:20,079
nutrients it's time so what they do is

980
00:43:17,858 --> 00:43:22,539
they create like signaling molecules or

981
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,909
enzymes that actually communicate with

982
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:28,900
the plant took grow larger and in this

983
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:30,219
direction and so the the proliferation

984
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,050
rate through binary fission is

985
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:34,299
exponentially higher than you would see

986
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,039
in like a a rainforest strain that has a

987
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,410
lot of time and water and moisture to do

988
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:41,199
what it needs to do to create that

989
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:44,649
nutrient availability that makes total

990
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,929
sense that's interesting yeah so we

991
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:49,400
isolated a lot of the desert strains but

992
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:52,609
but we also combine

993
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,740
with strains from from like rainforests

994
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:58,220
and cannabis plants and strawberries and

995
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:59,839
and trees and what we found was if you

996
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:04,149
take the strongest strains of the

997
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:08,329
strains that innately understand that

998
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:11,240
their survival is contingent on the

999
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:14,599
long-term health and and viability of

1000
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:16,429
their host plant then you're isolating

1001
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,099
the giver than giving strings the

1002
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:21,199
strains that understand that they will

1003
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:23,480
survive if they just simply take from

1004
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,019
the plant like a pathogen does they're

1005
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,630
like Rhizoctonia Fusarium verticillium

1006
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:31,190
Pythium those those strains are born to

1007
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,470
just take from the plant for their own

1008
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:37,119
short-term survival but the strains that

1009
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:41,839
we've isolated are the ones that really

1010
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:44,239
work together and give of themselves to

1011
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,700
improve that environment it's a very

1012
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,829
beautiful elegant thing and and and

1013
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:51,829
we've done it and so what we've done is

1014
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:54,380
we've increased amounts of these

1015
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:58,099
bacteria that you wouldn't normally find

1016
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,329
in in like a regular soil so if you

1017
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:01,339
think about what we're doing with the

1018
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,230
cannabis plant you know we're putting it

1019
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,850
into a slowly that might not naturally

1020
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:09,619
have ever evolved naturally you know and

1021
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:12,889
so because we're doing that we need to

1022
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:15,789
reproduce the biology in there that it

1023
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:18,799
would kind of feel that it had in nature

1024
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:21,679
and so when we increase that biology the

1025
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,310
terpene expressions are just incredible

1026
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:27,079
like you know we've seen nine or ten

1027
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:30,529
different types of terpenes all it

1028
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,900
balanced levels which from what we're

1029
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:35,050
told from a lot of laboratories you know

1030
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,360
and this will be great like to ask you

1031
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:41,000
that most of the campus cup winners have

1032
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,710
one or two or three or four different

1033
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,530
types of terpenes all at very high

1034
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:47,869
levels and then microdopes the doses of

1035
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,940
the others whereas our trippy profiles

1036
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:52,279
are consistently coming in with nine or

1037
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:55,309
ten different types of terpenes all that

1038
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,860
balance levels and it's again because of

1039
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:59,719
that increase of the naturally occurring

1040
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:02,460
bacteria that that plant co-evolved with

1041
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,799
nature is what we're trying to mimic

1042
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,690
yeah that's a pretty massive move a

1043
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,000
little bit more than what might be seen

1044
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:11,250
with a small variable I've definitely

1045
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,480
you know Tony might be able to talk a

1046
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,980
little bit better about it as well

1047
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,710
because he's had quite a few terpene

1048
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,199
profiles done with SC labs and I know

1049
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,300
little things have moved but having a

1050
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,338
massive move like what you're just

1051
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,230
saying like eight or nine terpene levels

1052
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:26,969
that are that are high rather than a

1053
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,858
dominant with many many smaller ones

1054
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:32,459
that's something I haven't personally

1055
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:34,019
seen in a test yeah nope no laboratory

1056
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,059
that we talked to has ever seen that

1057
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:37,980
they said this is a scientific anomaly

1058
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,630
what we're seeing here how do you see

1059
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:43,349
have you seen anything like that

1060
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:45,539
mark Sheldon yeah I've seen you mean

1061
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:48,088
terms of a profile where it's pretty

1062
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:50,099
flat and there's really no single

1063
00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:52,500
dominant and there's like about four or

1064
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,990
five or maybe as many like you say is

1065
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:59,130
eight or nine but not small amounts

1066
00:46:54,989 --> 00:47:02,149
still larger dominant amounts yeah so

1067
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:06,119
what are what's the overall level of

1068
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:10,798
terpenes so are you looking at basically

1069
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:13,940
a lower level of all of them or you're

1070
00:47:10,798 --> 00:47:16,889
bringing up everything to just a higher

1071
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:19,789
level so you're not exactly telling me

1072
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:23,368
yeah I'm sorry to not scientifically

1073
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:25,798
equate it so so on a percentage basis

1074
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:31,079
what you find what we normally find on a

1075
00:47:25,798 --> 00:47:34,639
micro dose is under 0.1% right so like

1076
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:37,140
for instance let's see a lot of of

1077
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:47,098
strains we'll have certainly net like

1078
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:50,118
maybe like like 0.02 or 0.04 0.05 so 0.1

1079
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:53,250
would be you know a pretty high level of

1080
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:55,890
amateur pain in any profile so we're

1081
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,289
talking about in common I enjoy all

1082
00:47:55,889 --> 00:48:00,629
levels of terpenes are just saying you

1083
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:03,568
said that you you're seeing this across

1084
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:06,030
the board right and and so actually that

1085
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:08,130
level would be lower for say like

1086
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:10,680
something like Colleen depending on the

1087
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,990
strain and depending on are you looking

1088
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,519
at the flower you're looking at native

1089
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:18,699
flowers so this is like a

1090
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:23,409
a hole-punch analysis in a grow or is

1091
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:26,049
this cured material or is this what what

1092
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:29,559
are you measuring terpenes on thank you

1093
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:33,370
yeah so just flour so a flour simple

1094
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:36,639
flowers now was it a dried and cured

1095
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:39,789
flour sample with with or without leaves

1096
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:43,299
are yeah it was a dried and cured and

1097
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:45,579
and so one of the analysis is that we

1098
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,769
did it was it was a it was drying

1099
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:50,469
shirred it was four months old we sent

1100
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:53,530
it in and it came in at one point by

1101
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:55,899
five percent told her people and they

1102
00:48:53,530 --> 00:49:00,900
were that's how that's pretty average

1103
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:03,910
1.5 yeah that says yeah so the average

1104
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,800
on the low side and depends you know i'm

1105
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:08,049
like there's so much variability and

1106
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,150
test results because what's dry the one

1107
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:13,210
person may not be dry to another it's so

1108
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:15,340
mean water has a great deal to do with

1109
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:18,070
the overall mass fraction if you just

1110
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:20,230
measuring percent terpenes so typically

1111
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,450
what that's done with this internal

1112
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,340
standard where it's normalized to here's

1113
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:26,980
what the internal standard is we added

1114
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,590
this now we're basically normalizing all

1115
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,869
the concentrations of terpenes based on

1116
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:35,850
at because we know how much we add into

1117
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:38,769
that so the question is is is your

1118
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:42,730
biology or this technique resulting in

1119
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:46,150
an overall increase of beans beyond the

1120
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:50,650
baseline of what is typical typically

1121
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:53,980
observed or is it within that with levin

1122
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:56,769
what's known that was really quick the

1123
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,240
average that we found after testing 164

1124
00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:00,400
different flour samples with the same

1125
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,779
laboratory and this is with about 30

1126
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:08,320
different growers just their flour

1127
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:09,700
samples was 0.2 to 0.4 percent so the

1128
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,059
fact that we were at one point five on

1129
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:15,129
this is significant maybe it's the

1130
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:17,199
laboratory that we need to or maybe

1131
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:22,690
because it was so the material was so

1132
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:27,369
dry maybe people i samples that are

1133
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:28,849
being done by se labs and other people

1134
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:30,650
at the Emerald cup

1135
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:35,329
they they have varieties which were

1136
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:39,320
approaching 5% that's like seal I see it

1137
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:40,099
all the time yeah exactly 1.5 is nothing

1138
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,680
nothing

1139
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:45,769
we don't even run it if it's one I mean

1140
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,719
it's not it's but I don't know that I

1141
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:49,969
chimed in on the subject matter I could

1142
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:51,649
tell you that like I like it's

1143
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:54,319
interesting because of let's talk about

1144
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:59,599
a variety called black lime reserve from

1145
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:02,600
aficionado THC is like 7% you know under

1146
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,900
10% but the terpene profile can be five

1147
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:09,679
to seven that's our world record I mean

1148
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:16,579
we've seen like 25 mils a pound in terms

1149
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:17,929
yes yeah yeah no it's significantly

1150
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:19,489
different than anything else I've ever

1151
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:22,309
seen some of the farmers that are

1152
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:24,109
growing that I asked them what they're

1153
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:25,730
doing because there was several

1154
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:28,160
varieties that they were called that

1155
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:32,599
they were cultivating and all of them

1156
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:36,440
were to the 3% and he said to study he

1157
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:40,009
studied he had studied he does like a

1158
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:43,760
no-till like I don't know live soil but

1159
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:45,740
he had added forget what he was doing

1160
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,600
with different kinds of minerals that he

1161
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:50,649
put into the soil but he studied

1162
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:55,190
cucumbers and he studied the effects of

1163
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:57,320
terpenes increasing terpene and terpene

1164
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,570
and flavonoids and fruits in different

1165
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,030
vegetables and cucumbers was something

1166
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:05,030
he was studying and he was this this

1167
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:07,100
farmer was able to - what I could see

1168
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:09,769
from the average people out there that

1169
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:12,440
were growing you know when you start

1170
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:15,139
seeing 2 3 4 or 5 percent coming from

1171
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,059
from a group of their flowers they're

1172
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:18,679
doing something different well you know

1173
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:19,909
what would you lower that tea it's funny

1174
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:21,949
for all these years so we kind of get

1175
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:24,259
the highest THC it's like really cause

1176
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:26,239
like you can distill that [ __ ] super

1177
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,610
easy from like any schwag oil

1178
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,319
why don't you bro the hydrocarbons the

1179
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:32,720
terpenes that are you just can't get

1180
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,670
them any other way like [ __ ] the THC

1181
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,939
yeah I would say on most all of those

1182
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:39,590
they weren't above 20% so there you

1183
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,150
could see like it was interesting

1184
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,230
because if you think about according to

1185
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,550
what we've

1186
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,980
talked about on this panel and I know I

1187
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,800
argue against some of it sometimes but I

1188
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:50,869
feel that there's you know the heads and

1189
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,930
the resin itself isn't the only thing as

1190
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:57,350
the carrier for these types of terpenes

1191
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:59,299
and and/or cannabinoids so you know

1192
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:02,179
there's something if you're looking at

1193
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,039
it like as a grape or you know you're

1194
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,358
looking at it in a macro level and you

1195
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:08,179
see those big heads you can see the

1196
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:11,569
different varieties it would be strange

1197
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:14,118
to have the THC lower and the terpenes

1198
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:15,289
higher if we're talking about just resin

1199
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:17,329
heads but if we're talking about

1200
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:20,509
terpenes overall terpenes on a plant

1201
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:22,369
material I it makes a little bit more

1202
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:25,160
sense because you would think the bigger

1203
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:27,470
the head the more the THC you would have

1204
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:28,819
but not in the case that I've seen if

1205
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:30,889
that's what it's producing though

1206
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,470
because think keep in mind that THC is

1207
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:40,599
produced from the building blocks of

1208
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:43,459
hydrocarbons and phenols so the the

1209
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:45,920
place where where we went from just on

1210
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,980
this particular grower in his style his

1211
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,220
approach so he was growing open-loop no

1212
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:55,250
co2 and with an old strain kosher cush

1213
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:57,980
that you know he had never modified or

1214
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:01,070
done anything with and he had tested his

1215
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,929
product before and he was at 0.19 and

1216
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:07,220
after with the addition of the bacteria

1217
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:09,829
it took him to 1.5 a fire now when I've

1218
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:12,108
seen with a lot of the extremes that if

1219
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:14,960
you go on and you look at the High Times

1220
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:20,108
best tasting buds in the world the the

1221
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:22,820
average is around two to three percent

1222
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:24,949
but the profiles are so different the

1223
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,019
profiles and you see one or two or three

1224
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:29,899
or four different types of terpenes but

1225
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:32,780
to get the plant that will correct

1226
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:36,410
biology to produce a much more

1227
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:38,869
comprehensive combination of the

1228
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:41,029
terpenes I really believe with all my

1229
00:54:38,869 --> 00:54:42,380
heart that if you can have nine or ten

1230
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:44,119
different types of proteins all at high

1231
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:48,800
levels you're gonna have a much more

1232
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:51,230
comprehensive efficacy to that will then

1233
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,890
then then isolating you know strains

1234
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,530
that are maybe just for just be showing

1235
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:58,319
that does

1236
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:59,010
Kersey doesn't mean that's all of a plan

1237
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,630
Tanis

1238
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:06,150
I mean me for example right I've always

1239
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,700
seen more than 50 terpenes every variety

1240
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,230
I've ever tested

1241
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:11,609
did you say maybe I missed something and

1242
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,170
I probably missed it on the last hash

1243
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,320
search or something did you say pecked

1244
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:18,059
the word bacteria yes is are you

1245
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,450
introducing bacteria to the plant to

1246
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:23,369
increase terpene level correct okay so

1247
00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:26,369
maybe that's pulling out some kind of

1248
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:29,819
defense mechanism in the immune system

1249
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:31,849
or something well it was like Sam was

1250
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,559
saying earlier it's like not a great

1251
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:37,049
stretch to know that if you grow your

1252
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,179
tomatoes with shitty store-bought food

1253
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,380
and a soilless mixture they're not going

1254
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:42,509
to taste as good as the heirloom

1255
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:45,450
tomatoes right proper genetics grown in

1256
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:48,240
the proper environment with living soils

1257
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:51,989
and like bacterias yeah we have us some

1258
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:53,879
farmers in California that they take

1259
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:56,519
their their Tomatoes down to the farmers

1260
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,079
market and they actually I mean I I know

1261
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,969
I don't want to like boast like our

1262
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,130
stuff is the best these growers are

1263
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:03,449
great organic farmers you take their

1264
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:05,250
product on to the farmers market and

1265
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:08,460
they literally have a line of people

1266
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:11,909
waiting to get these tomatoes and they

1267
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:15,380
sell out within hours because the flavor

1268
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:23,190
is so sweet and so Gator naturally drawn

1269
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:24,240
how can I get these Tomatoes I'll head

1270
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:26,130
down and check it out

1271
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:27,779
I used to have I used to have a raw food

1272
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:29,970
cafe so I know exactly what you're

1273
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,250
talking about because when I had my raw

1274
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:34,739
food cafe I was forced to get to know

1275
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:36,539
farmers there was no distribution

1276
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:38,429
companies that just you know what I mean

1277
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:40,259
it was independent relationships with

1278
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:42,659
farmers and so I got to know a couple of

1279
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,840
really amazing heirloom tomato growers

1280
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:49,199
and you know that I've never experienced

1281
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:51,090
the pride of tomatoes like almost on a

1282
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:53,759
level of cannabis pride like they were

1283
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:56,070
so proud of this work that they had done

1284
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,600
they it put love into these Tomatoes and

1285
00:56:56,070 --> 00:57:00,110
you could taste it with each and every

1286
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:04,110
bite it's it's also hard to find

1287
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:08,559
heirloom tomato shippers yes heirloom

1288
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:11,858
tomatoes split easy and you know it's

1289
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:15,430
what you got to do is either make a

1290
00:57:11,858 --> 00:57:17,438
tomato sauce out of it or eat it within

1291
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:19,298
a few days yeah he'd bring it in a big

1292
00:57:17,438 --> 00:57:20,920
basket and they'd all be kind of like

1293
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:22,958
have their own little things around them

1294
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,909
and the colors were just it was like

1295
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:28,149
I've never seen that many earth tone

1296
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:32,558
colors in a single box like unbelievable

1297
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:35,858
so impressive really cool so bugs are

1298
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,778
our friends well I'll tell you I'll tell

1299
00:57:35,858 --> 00:57:40,748
you how much that statement is true John

1300
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:42,789
old Rastafarian friend of mine named the

1301
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:44,708
doctor he was the guy with the 7-foot

1302
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:46,689
long dreads and I took Remo up to his

1303
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:48,548
place and I took Pete Brady photographer

1304
00:57:46,688 --> 00:57:51,879
from cannabis culture up there and I've

1305
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:53,858
done stories on this guy in the past he

1306
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,358
would take we'd be out in the bush and

1307
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:57,578
he'd be like oh do you want some

1308
00:57:55,358 --> 00:58:00,818
sugarcane he'd pull off of a cane and

1309
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:04,839
he'd hand crack and juice this cane in

1310
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:06,759
the bush hand juice sugar cane do you

1311
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:08,798
understand how [ __ ] hard that is he'd

1312
00:58:06,759 --> 00:58:10,719
smashed the middle with another piece of

1313
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:12,429
cane and then he turn it into a gourd

1314
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:15,130
and go get a little lime and a little

1315
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:18,489
passion fruit but he would always choose

1316
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:21,189
the fruit that the bugs were on because

1317
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:23,139
he said the bugs don't like poison so

1318
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:25,088
they don't go on the poisoned plants and

1319
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:27,578
I thought that is so [ __ ] genius

1320
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:29,288
where I come from people only eat the

1321
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:31,900
poison plants because they don't want

1322
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:33,489
bugs on their food listen to this

1323
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:38,349
concept with regard you guys have eight

1324
00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:41,798
bits right so uh an aphid sees in kind

1325
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:43,929
of like like a predator style like heat

1326
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:45,759
spectrum so that's their field of vision

1327
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:50,259
so this is a sustainable agricultural

1328
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:52,059
methodology to get rid of aphids so so

1329
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:54,130
an aphid when it's flying around

1330
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:55,660
if the macro micro nutrient levels

1331
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:59,079
within the leaf tissue are not in

1332
00:58:55,659 --> 00:59:02,678
balance and harmony the the aphid will

1333
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,719
see like a heat signature on the on the

1334
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:07,150
leaf kind of like the you know the

1335
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:09,188
predator in that movie sees so they'll

1336
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:11,979
actually Zone in and they'll concentrate

1337
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:15,909
and and and lay their eggs and begin to

1338
00:59:11,978 --> 00:59:17,828
ink colonize in that area and so if

1339
00:59:15,909 --> 00:59:22,308
you're able to properly balance the

1340
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:23,839
micro and the micro macros of that plant

1341
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:26,298
what will happen is the plant will

1342
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:30,578
create a natural ultraviolet frequency

1343
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:33,170
so it'll almost be like a blinding light

1344
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:35,298
to them so when ba that's flying over

1345
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:37,999
not only will they not go to the plant

1346
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:40,150
but it'll be so bright that they'll go

1347
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:40,149
away

1348
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:44,718
that's savage that's like the eighth it

1349
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,819
is like a lion really looking looking

1350
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,679
for the weakness you know there's the

1351
00:59:46,818 --> 00:59:51,079
weakness and you can you know it because

1352
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:55,548
people with the weakest grow rooms oh my

1353
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:57,859
god I can't even go in there but that

1354
00:59:55,548 --> 01:00:00,409
ignores the ultraviolet and goes right

1355
00:59:57,858 --> 01:00:02,900
for it well that would make sense with

1356
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:04,759
terpenes as a defense mechanism to while

1357
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,849
you're getting certain rises in certain

1358
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:11,349
certain ones you know because as you

1359
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:14,449
said as you introduced different proper

1360
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:16,759
techniques like that the plant and this

1361
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:18,380
particular plant loves to respond to a

1362
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:22,248
lot of things it's been on the planet a

1363
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:25,099
long time so you know I think that you

1364
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:27,498
can you can manipulate the outcomes

1365
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:28,939
without any kind of genetic manipulation

1366
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:31,278
by what you're talking about

1367
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:34,909
whether you're using spores there's

1368
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:37,159
people that use different types of like

1369
01:00:34,909 --> 01:00:41,989
spores in the soil and nematodes and

1370
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:43,548
different kinds of like beneficials and

1371
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:45,798
predators that will actually attack the

1372
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:47,809
things that are that are attacking the

1373
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:48,739
plant and so it likes it makes sense for

1374
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:50,839
what you're talking about

1375
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:52,880
that's pretty cool I'm with Todd in the

1376
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:55,670
sense that [ __ ] these these these other

1377
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,798
bugs being put on my plants because I if

1378
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,869
you're a macro photographer and you see

1379
01:00:57,798 --> 01:01:01,759
the bug [ __ ] I don't care if the bug

1380
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:02,959
[ __ ] comes from beneficial bugs or

1381
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:05,748
[ __ ] bad bugs

1382
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:08,899
it's bug [ __ ] and I don't want it on my

1383
01:01:05,748 --> 01:01:11,328
resin so I love the idea of creating

1384
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,249
this more sort of living you know

1385
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:14,719
symbiotic relationship I'm not sure if

1386
01:01:13,248 --> 01:01:16,608
you were in the room Tony but one of the

1387
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:18,798
things that Peter said that was really

1388
01:01:16,608 --> 01:01:20,778
interesting was his friend was going

1389
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,068
around collecting bacterias from all

1390
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:24,349
these different plants and all these

1391
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:26,208
different types of ecosystems and one of

1392
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:28,729
the bacterias they found was from the

1393
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:31,188
desert and so these desert bacterias

1394
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:33,139
when the rain comes you know the three

1395
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:35,279
to four inches that they get every year

1396
01:01:33,139 --> 01:01:36,690
it sort of pumps the roots in

1397
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,920
to overdrive saying hey hey hey the

1398
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,409
waters here we got to do this we got it

1399
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,180
and it's like this unique sort of aspect

1400
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:44,879
of taking that bacteria and putting it

1401
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:47,489
on a plant a little helper it was a very

1402
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,559
unique and of interesting yeah that's

1403
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:52,289
how we get our roots to grow so fast is

1404
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:53,730
we've put some of these desert strains

1405
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:55,460
that are signaling the route they're

1406
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:59,250
saying hey there's an enzymatic

1407
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:00,840
communication so the the microbial

1408
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:02,880
product industry has kind of been in a

1409
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:05,280
holding pattern for for several years I

1410
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,260
mean we use bacillus subtilis we use

1411
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,640
trichoderma we use mycorrhizae you know

1412
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,560
a lot of those were discovered in the

1413
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,779
1800s and they're great strains they do

1414
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,269
a good thing but we've been focused

1415
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:17,610
exclusively like on you know what a

1416
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:20,969
microbe can do on its own versus what

1417
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:22,620
they can generate together so we'll be

1418
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:24,750
looking at nitrogen fixation or

1419
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,279
phosphorus solubilization you know or

1420
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,980
certain things that these organisms can

1421
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,019
do what we've done is we've we've looked

1422
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,389
at what microbes concret news together

1423
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:35,670
that give them their efficacy kind of

1424
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:37,469
like us you know the Sergi of what's

1425
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:40,230
creating in this group is a much higher

1426
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:43,439
level and a much higher resonance then I

1427
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:45,420
I saw your website is that is I think

1428
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,809
two different microbes

1429
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:50,369
does that include two Khedira yeah yeah

1430
01:02:48,809 --> 01:02:53,159
they're great strains but again we're

1431
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:56,730
looking at what one can do versus what

1432
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:59,909
they can't know I'm asking about what

1433
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:02,309
what if one of the 50 to you used was

1434
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:04,589
pretty dormant and I'm glad to hear you

1435
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:08,279
do use it I found it to be beneficial

1436
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:10,650
I've used it for 30 40 years yeah yeah

1437
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:14,010
it's a great string yeah great strain so

1438
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:16,110
so what we've done is really focused

1439
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:18,720
amid the the majority of our company to

1440
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:20,730
try and understand what these guys

1441
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,989
produce in combination

1442
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,269
so what those are called as they're

1443
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:27,989
called secondary metabolites so it's

1444
01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:28,530
basically a microbe ship micro micro

1445
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:33,419
pissed

1446
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:36,030
so each organism will create like you

1447
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:40,200
know a certain enzyme or a chemical or

1448
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:41,820
an acid or a hormone and so when you

1449
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:43,909
when you have all these different

1450
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:46,350
strains and they're all you know

1451
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:47,679
creating what are called the secondary

1452
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:49,929
metabolites what

1453
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,849
they're if they're able to colonize the

1454
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:54,609
rhizosphere the root if they're raizo

1455
01:03:51,849 --> 01:03:56,920
bacteria they'll create like a like a

1456
01:03:54,610 --> 01:04:00,880
sludge together like a film like a

1457
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:02,619
biofilm that's just taking every they're

1458
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,140
like encumbering every centimeter of

1459
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:08,199
root the fine root hairs as well they

1460
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:10,179
protect that so so so it can work as

1461
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:11,829
like a natural chelating engine some of

1462
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:14,529
the some of the things that they do like

1463
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:15,969
for instance the acids that they create

1464
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:18,610
think about when you guys put your

1465
01:04:15,969 --> 01:04:20,919
fertilizer in and you've got a think

1466
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:24,610
about a microscopic level and you've got

1467
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:26,320
a piece of calcium right so so a piece

1468
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:28,090
of calcium could be like the size of an

1469
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,340
the Empire State Building and our

1470
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:33,240
microbes are the size of an ant and that

1471
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:35,650
calcium can't go into the root so if the

1472
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:37,689
microorganisms are creating an acid it

1473
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:40,630
works like a natural chelating agent to

1474
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:42,309
juice that calcium and allow it to beam

1475
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:45,070
it's called bioavailable or plants

1476
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:47,159
absorbable so we increase the efficacy

1477
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:49,210
of conventional and organic fertilizers

1478
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:53,079
exponentially but that's just one thing

1479
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:56,409
I think about about this concept so the

1480
01:04:53,079 --> 01:05:00,340
root is is communicating enzymatically

1481
01:04:56,409 --> 01:05:02,289
with certain strains so so what what our

1482
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:05,140
guys will do even in a hydroponic system

1483
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:07,230
is they'll they'll they'll find you know

1484
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:10,089
where the concentrations are of

1485
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:11,889
nutrients and that'll talk to the the

1486
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,200
plant and they'll say hey man grow your

1487
01:05:11,889 --> 01:05:16,509
root that way that's where the good

1488
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:18,159
stuff is for you to you know that's

1489
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:20,260
where some water is that's where some

1490
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:22,539
some food is because that's what they do

1491
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:24,910
naturally in the desert they say hey man

1492
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:26,949
the water's here all life has to have

1493
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:28,659
water and carbon and so what they'll do

1494
01:05:26,949 --> 01:05:30,609
is they'll be like okay it's time to

1495
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:33,009
grow this way or it's time to grow

1496
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:35,980
bigger or you know it's time to relax

1497
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:38,890
because again these guys innately want

1498
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:41,170
the best for the planet they're givers

1499
01:05:38,889 --> 01:05:43,779
they're they're all about improving the

1500
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:45,519
environment making sure that the

1501
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:47,460
sustainability of their species and

1502
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:50,320
their children and future generations

1503
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:53,260
has a healthy environment versus the

1504
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:55,450
pathogens the package only take for

1505
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,940
their short-term survival that type of

1506
01:05:55,449 --> 01:06:01,328
drought tolerance should be put into

1507
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:04,958
food crops I know that there's a concern

1508
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:07,209
rock tolerant horn and the types of corn

1509
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:11,259
that can grow and so like sub-saharan

1510
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:13,328
Africa that don't like I mean you know

1511
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:16,809
the moisture that we have over here in

1512
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:19,719
North America but you don't have to go

1513
01:06:16,809 --> 01:06:25,209
and see that much yeah there is dry

1514
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:29,588
farming so all plant life is absolutely

1515
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:32,169
connected to microbe life living in a

1516
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:34,179
microbial world like it or not no matter

1517
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:36,159
how much hand cleaner you think you

1518
01:06:34,179 --> 01:06:38,108
could use and no matter how much he you

1519
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,808
know flora clean you there's still a

1520
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:44,409
microbial mess in this world everywhere

1521
01:06:40,809 --> 01:06:47,140
you look at all forms the soluble carbon

1522
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:50,889
will be you know viewed as food for any

1523
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:54,159
kind of microbe and you know are winning

1524
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:57,429
an evolution of microbes I mean I think

1525
01:06:54,159 --> 01:07:00,159
that there's more microbial mass on this

1526
01:06:57,429 --> 01:07:02,828
earth right now like by a factor of ten

1527
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:06,219
then there are all other kinds of

1528
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:09,690
biology combined so there's more in your

1529
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:14,048
beard than there is humans on the planet

1530
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:16,599
the plant that actually got roots in the

1531
01:07:14,048 --> 01:07:19,298
ground the plant

1532
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:22,359
evolved I mean as opposed to in a

1533
01:07:19,298 --> 01:07:25,538
hydroponic system or in some flower pot

1534
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:28,239
somewhere always thought that the actual

1535
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:32,949
you know synergy that the plant has

1536
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:35,829
enjoyed for a millennia in the microbial

1537
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:38,499
world where the roots are which is down

1538
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:40,630
in the ground in the earth than the

1539
01:07:38,498 --> 01:07:44,759
earth not a recreation of the earth but

1540
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:47,229
they actual here--the itself puts a a

1541
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:48,579
different type of pressure and I think

1542
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:50,379
the kind of thing that you're you're

1543
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:55,329
seeing I mean not only with secondary

1544
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:57,249
metabolites but now using genomics and

1545
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:59,140
this is would be great to get Kevin in

1546
01:07:57,248 --> 01:08:01,389
on this discussion you could actually

1547
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:04,328
create an induced panel and look at all

1548
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:06,788
the known genes in variety of different

1549
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:11,019
pathways and look to see whether or not

1550
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:13,349
thieves types of assaults or you know

1551
01:08:11,018 --> 01:08:15,189
environmental assaults lead into the up

1552
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:17,619
expression of certain

1553
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:19,659
means that our hallmarks for turning on

1554
01:08:17,619 --> 01:08:22,269
certain pathways sort of like in drought

1555
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:25,599
tolerance I know that that's very well

1556
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:27,489
studied in both soybean and corn what

1557
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,350
happens and what makes a good drought

1558
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:31,419
tolerant plant and I think it was just

1559
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:33,190
straightforward plant breeding but

1560
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:36,759
ultimately they're able to engineer

1561
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:38,919
those pathways into the organisms itself

1562
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:41,229
to make them drought tolerant what I

1563
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,539
think the interesting you're doing if I

1564
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:48,179
could just finish it up is that recently

1565
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:51,278
there is a company looking for you know

1566
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:54,270
registration with the EPA and Scott

1567
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:58,120
Pruett just issued this two-page

1568
01:08:54,270 --> 01:09:00,190
response saying that you know cannabis

1569
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:03,189
is illegal and you know the he's not

1570
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:05,079
going to regulate on you know products

1571
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:06,789
that can be used in cannabis cultivation

1572
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:08,738
and so therefore I don't even know why

1573
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:11,380
we're being asked this of course the

1574
01:09:08,738 --> 01:09:14,318
answer's no [ __ ] you and basically

1575
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,210
turned around the document so once again

1576
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,730
thank you to everyone who voted for

1577
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:21,579
Donald Trump for putting this idiot in

1578
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:23,769
charge of EPA who basically could be

1579
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:26,109
making strides to help the cannabis

1580
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:28,319
industry by being able to take the

1581
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:30,730
initial steps to understand that

1582
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,489
biological warfare and biological

1583
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:35,829
control and as a level that you're

1584
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:39,009
talking about is the safest way to

1585
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:41,710
control diseases that could affect

1586
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:45,640
cannabis because no company right now

1587
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:48,100
has a data set to show that chemically

1588
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:50,440
or applied chemical pesticides or

1589
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:54,610
fungicides or herbicides or whatever

1590
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:56,109
are going to have any type of bad effect

1591
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:59,289
on humans because it's never been

1592
01:09:56,109 --> 01:10:01,089
studied and there's not likely going to

1593
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:02,890
be any company that's going to do that

1594
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:05,829
so these companies that are trying to do

1595
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:09,910
this with biological control have the

1596
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:12,189
exact you know this is the lever to turn

1597
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:14,619
here and it's the weighted you could

1598
01:10:12,189 --> 01:10:18,698
control as you see how these things

1599
01:10:14,619 --> 01:10:20,619
affect what goes on in a plant not just

1600
01:10:18,698 --> 01:10:23,469
because humans like them terpenes are

1601
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:25,689
there for a plant response to a defense

1602
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:27,850
an environmental and saw whether it's

1603
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,809
insects or whether it's fun to die or

1604
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,660
bugs or most

1605
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:35,350
microbes microbes are involved at every

1606
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:38,079
level and everything that goes on my

1607
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:40,090
insects rely on microbes because the

1608
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,069
microbes start doing the chewing on the

1609
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:44,350
the initial thing and then that rings

1610
01:10:42,069 --> 01:10:46,599
the dinner bell for a whole zoo of fungi

1611
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:49,630
that just follows after that so very

1612
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:52,090
intimate in the involve in any type of

1613
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:53,199
fungal attack microbes are there and

1614
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:55,420
bacteria are there from the very

1615
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:57,909
beginning so just recognize that yeah

1616
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:59,470
the plants need bacteria to live and I

1617
01:10:57,909 --> 01:11:02,309
think the approach that you and this

1618
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:04,960
other company are taking to use a

1619
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:09,670
microbiological way of enhancing the

1620
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:12,039
soils own biome better control plant

1621
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:14,920
disease is exactly what should be doing

1622
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:17,529
and [ __ ] the EPA Administrator because

1623
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:23,560
this guy and the administration needs to

1624
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:26,679
go thank you greed so question oh yeah

1625
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:30,280
sure I I recently have read some

1626
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:35,020
research where a biofilm was the subject

1627
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:37,179
of it that companies were looking to

1628
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:41,220
coat fruits and vegetables with a

1629
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:43,539
biofilm to increase the longevity and

1630
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:45,460
while they accomplished that the other

1631
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:49,689
thing they noticed was if this biofilm

1632
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:52,060
was applied to the base and the bottom

1633
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:54,279
part of the plants that insects that

1634
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:56,620
crawl up on these plants didn't

1635
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:59,800
recognize it as food any longer and so

1636
01:11:56,619 --> 01:12:09,300
therefore did not attack it mmm are you

1637
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:13,420
familiar with that at all I'll put a URL

1638
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:15,850
with mark for you to go yeah throw the

1639
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:19,050
throw the URL up did you want to finish

1640
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:22,020
what you were saying there before mark

1641
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:24,190
yeah it's a little bit about water

1642
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:29,430
because I think it's such an important

1643
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:32,859
issue for for our species and our planet

1644
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:35,320
so one of the things that our microbes

1645
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:37,569
are is they're saprophytic so what that

1646
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:41,000
means is a saprophyte is a type of

1647
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:44,239
organism that will actually live on and

1648
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,800
and decompose carbon or organic matter

1649
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:50,960
so what's interesting is is and this is

1650
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:56,000
kind of a unique content curator

1651
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:58,189
disclosed here but so we all understand

1652
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,020
that carbon sequestration you know is

1653
01:12:58,189 --> 01:13:02,539
done through plants right plants

1654
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:06,050
sequester carbon as they do so they

1655
01:13:02,539 --> 01:13:08,090
create different sugars and

1656
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:11,690
carbohydrates out of their roots that's

1657
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:15,940
what they turn the the carbon into now

1658
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:19,429
as the root does this are microorganisms

1659
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:20,929
and and most soil microorganisms do this

1660
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:23,990
we're just introducing them in larger

1661
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:25,780
numbers but these soil organisms are

1662
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:28,369
soil organisms specifically our

1663
01:13:25,779 --> 01:13:30,829
saprophytic so all of our strains are

1664
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:36,130
saprophyte so what that means is they

1665
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:40,579
will they will create a layer of

1666
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:42,619
insoluble hydrophilic houmous around the

1667
01:13:40,579 --> 01:13:45,859
the route around the within the

1668
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:49,880
rhizosphere so what that means in lay

1669
01:13:45,859 --> 01:13:51,500
terms is that the the organisms will

1670
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,210
actually use the different secondary

1671
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:56,869
metabolites that I was disclosing to you

1672
01:13:53,210 --> 01:14:00,319
and decompose almost like a composting

1673
01:13:56,869 --> 01:14:02,599
effect all around the root so that way

1674
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:05,750
it can it can create a substance called

1675
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:07,760
humans now houmous can hold 80 percent

1676
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,409
of its own weight in water so what we're

1677
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,680
finding right now with a lot of our

1678
01:14:09,409 --> 01:14:18,199
growers is that they're able to grow

1679
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:21,409
corn they're able to grow ten onions and

1680
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:23,809
beets and and carrots in Arizona out of

1681
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:30,220
season because what's happening is

1682
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:34,250
there's a layer a hydrophilic layer of

1683
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:36,199
water that's being held in within those

1684
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:38,090
bioavailable nutrients that's also part

1685
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:39,769
of the mineralization process there's a

1686
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:41,840
mineralization process that happens when

1687
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:43,640
you decompose carbon it makes the the

1688
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,710
macro micro is available to the plant

1689
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,980
like I was talking about the New York

1690
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:52,130
you know big building thing and how it's

1691
01:14:48,979 --> 01:14:53,699
it's turned into a bio bioavailable form

1692
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:56,489
well both of those process

1693
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:58,139
is our able to create a sustainability

1694
01:14:56,489 --> 01:15:01,460
factor in the rhizosphere so you're

1695
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:03,869
gonna have water when the plant needs it

1696
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:05,939
in those fine rears that you were

1697
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:07,680
talking about Sam which are protected by

1698
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:09,449
our product because we're also that

1699
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,579
biofilm that these microorganisms are

1700
01:15:09,449 --> 01:15:16,139
creating is a protective layer that

1701
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:18,269
disallow certain health issues to to

1702
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:20,789
encumber the plant so that's why one of

1703
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:23,460
the things that we disclose is we are

1704
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:26,279
able to keep the roots white and healthy

1705
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:29,489
for the duration of the crop cycle so

1706
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:31,679
yeah that's that's kind of it what we're

1707
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:33,960
seeing is that these plants will have

1708
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,300
water whenever they eat it so you can

1709
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:38,609
use a lot less water to cultivate your

1710
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:41,430
crops so like back to what Mark was

1711
01:15:38,609 --> 01:15:45,869
saying like if you go to a Home Depot or

1712
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:48,000
Walmart or Target Garden Center look at

1713
01:15:45,869 --> 01:15:49,979
like what the masses have access to not

1714
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,130
so much in California could walk into

1715
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:57,509
any you could walk into an herb and

1716
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:59,550
garden place and get you know any mix

1717
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:01,800
that you want live soils compost things

1718
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:04,470
but let's say the average American who

1719
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,869
has access to plants and soils they get

1720
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:09,840
they get Scott's

1721
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:11,430
soil they get micro they get what's the

1722
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,650
two most popular things we see is a

1723
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:19,320
Scott soil and what's the other one

1724
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:22,710
miracle-gro sorry and it's like it's

1725
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:24,299
it's a turn-off right so what and and I

1726
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:27,630
didn't know you had a product but you

1727
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:29,159
like late to the show here but if

1728
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:30,480
wouldn't you put it why wouldn't you

1729
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:31,710
want to try to get what you're talking

1730
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,659
about not just in the cannabis industry

1731
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:35,220
but maybe you are or maybe maybe you've

1732
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:36,779
come from a different industry but why

1733
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:39,030
wouldn't you get it out to the masses so

1734
01:16:36,779 --> 01:16:42,149
that we could correct our farming across

1735
01:16:39,029 --> 01:16:45,380
America I was reminded by a marketing

1736
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:49,109
guy that Miracle Grow is not a soil

1737
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:51,569
miracle grow is a brand you kind of

1738
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:54,269
schooled me on this yeah as well yeah it

1739
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:56,189
started as a chemical as a like this

1740
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:57,990
just for a miracle grow on your plants

1741
01:16:56,189 --> 01:16:59,729
and you don't have to ever feed it so it

1742
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:01,679
started as like a didn't it start as a

1743
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:05,179
nutrient and now it's just a brand that

1744
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:07,560
has lots of [ __ ] you know but Scott's

1745
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:10,110
got soil and miracle

1746
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:14,580
grow are both think owned by the same

1747
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:16,289
company so yeah yeah so Tony Kavita they

1748
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:18,239
wanted controlling interesting UV the

1749
01:17:16,289 --> 01:17:19,859
lights too so those people are

1750
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:23,519
definitely making a play into the

1751
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:25,259
cannabis space right go ahead but but

1752
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,670
it's it's it's it's not sustainable

1753
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,860
because as we know this plant is very

1754
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:32,250
interesting and the fact that it will

1755
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:34,549
mutate around and like it's it's it

1756
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:37,020
allows things to it you know it's

1757
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:40,350
everyone thinks growing cannabis without

1758
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:42,720
pesticides in a twenty percent THC or

1759
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:45,060
CBD with two to three percent terpenes

1760
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:49,500
is easy it's extremely hard in ninety

1761
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:51,270
percent of everyone fails so cannabis is

1762
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,579
the very tricky one because it's multi

1763
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:55,680
complex multi-dimensional hundreds of

1764
01:17:53,579 --> 01:17:58,319
cannabinoids hundreds of terpenes but if

1765
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:02,460
we talk about a tomato or a cucumber or

1766
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:04,529
lavender or I've got experiment plants

1767
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:07,260
and lemon plants and different herbs in

1768
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:10,380
time wouldn't we get start there at the

1769
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:13,409
foundation of our herbs in our and our

1770
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:15,659
our foods that are being our herbs that

1771
01:18:13,409 --> 01:18:17,069
are being grown by by everyone that's at

1772
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:18,750
home I'm not talking about the food you

1773
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:20,880
access let's start at the home grower

1774
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:23,399
because I'm growing ten herbs right here

1775
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,869
on my on my balcony you know some

1776
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:27,809
there's people that grow all of their

1777
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:29,880
little like basil and sweet mints and

1778
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:32,850
things like that but they're using Scots

1779
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:34,890
and Miracle Grow so that would be for me

1780
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:36,690
more of a start than cannabis even

1781
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:38,700
though I appreciate everything you're

1782
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:41,429
saying and doing for cannabis and we're

1783
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:43,529
talking about species as humans and

1784
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:45,030
we're talking about survival then it

1785
01:18:43,529 --> 01:18:48,149
would be implemented into the mainstream

1786
01:18:45,029 --> 01:18:50,369
first no absolutely that's that's where

1787
01:18:48,149 --> 01:18:52,409
we've we've been working for for the

1788
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:55,590
last twenty years and it's my life's

1789
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:57,000
work to to go back there so everything

1790
01:18:55,590 --> 01:19:00,720
that I've done has been to work with

1791
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,289
organic farmers we we have hundreds of

1792
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:06,420
thousands of acres that that were being

1793
01:19:04,289 --> 01:19:08,310
applied to with different forms of this

1794
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,590
biology with organic cultivators and

1795
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:14,130
that's and sustainable cultivators and

1796
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:17,250
conventional cultivators so so the

1797
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:19,560
product is getting out there but this

1798
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,969
this industry right now is producing

1799
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:26,310
something so sacred

1800
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:30,510
for children with seizures for you know

1801
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:32,070
for for mothers with tumors and we want

1802
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:33,960
to help we want to be a part of that we

1803
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:35,939
want to give to you guys we did it's

1804
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,770
supposed to be medicine right are you

1805
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:40,559
guys are the failures you know you guys

1806
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:43,590
are the stewards of our of our lands and

1807
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:47,580
our plants we're here to support you

1808
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:51,750
we've come to the product brings up a

1809
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:55,469
good point just in terms of for you Tony

1810
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:57,119
it's gonna be it's gonna be put out at a

1811
01:19:55,469 --> 01:19:59,520
price point where you guys can use this

1812
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:02,640
in abundance and you can really see the

1813
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,730
epic of all the things that we're

1814
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,130
talking about the sustainability in

1815
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:10,799
environmental and the help of the plant

1816
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:13,409
increase exponentially with it with the

1817
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:17,640
correct application of life to the soil

1818
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:20,670
so money made I'm here for a limited

1819
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:22,530
time to to to work with these cannabis

1820
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:25,230
cultivators because I believe that you

1821
01:20:22,529 --> 01:20:28,969
guys right now are are key to showing

1822
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:33,529
the world that we can produce a

1823
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:37,829
commodity in a safe environmentally

1824
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:39,779
friendly and conscious way and nurturing

1825
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:41,609
way you guys are to more tune in to your

1826
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:44,159
plants than any grower that I've ever

1827
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:46,349
met you guys you know there's there's

1828
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,819
cultivators out there that still believe

1829
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:49,800
that their granddaddy and the way they

1830
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:51,779
was always done is the right way and

1831
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,730
that's been a big battle for us to be

1832
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:58,109
able to transition a lot of these guys

1833
01:20:53,729 --> 01:21:00,448
to more sustainable conscious ways of

1834
01:20:58,109 --> 01:21:02,069
growing it's it's it's it's so it's a

1835
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:07,559
life's work for me and that's what I

1836
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:10,380
will never stop doing crime is written

1837
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,900
to actually help us get this message out

1838
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:14,400
and and and I don't have to do it I

1839
01:21:12,899 --> 01:21:16,469
don't have to say it I don't have to I

1840
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:18,960
just have to put the product out in you

1841
01:21:16,469 --> 01:21:20,880
guys will be the ones the light beings

1842
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,219
that will take this product out to the

1843
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,300
world and I believe that with all my

1844
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:26,460
heart and that's why we're in the

1845
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,929
cannabis space is because we need to do

1846
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:32,029
we need to have this in our food

1847
01:21:28,929 --> 01:21:35,630
right and you know for me what I would

1848
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:37,698
like to add is that I have kind of a way

1849
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:39,529
when I meet people when I could when I

1850
01:21:37,698 --> 01:21:41,388
have a conversation with people and it's

1851
01:21:39,529 --> 01:21:43,969
sort of you know sometimes it's just all

1852
01:21:41,389 --> 01:21:46,010
read people and you know the when I met

1853
01:21:43,969 --> 01:21:47,750
Tony you know I knew him for about five

1854
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:50,210
minutes before I was like holy [ __ ] like

1855
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:52,849
I'm gonna like end up spending a lot of

1856
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:55,069
time with this dude I have a feeling

1857
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:57,619
it's like I'm gonna meet and so Peter

1858
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:59,599
really resonated with me not only the

1859
01:21:57,618 --> 01:22:02,328
fact that he's highly intelligent and

1860
01:21:59,599 --> 01:22:04,819
articulate and his ability to share this

1861
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:07,219
information but that he's so conscious

1862
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:09,558
he's so like I believe him I believe

1863
01:22:07,219 --> 01:22:11,210
when he talks and he sounds like he

1864
01:22:09,559 --> 01:22:13,400
could almost break into tears because

1865
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:17,149
you really believe the guy loves this

1866
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:18,679
this is his life and so why we didn't

1867
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:20,149
want to go about him saying oh hey

1868
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:22,340
bubble man I'll send you this product

1869
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:24,768
you can try it on your crop if it works

1870
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:26,300
you can talk about it I I resonate it

1871
01:22:24,769 --> 01:22:27,860
with it in a way that I said well why

1872
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:29,779
don't we just bring it to church why

1873
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:31,518
don't we talk about it you've noticed we

1874
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:33,618
haven't been dropping the name of the

1875
01:22:31,519 --> 01:22:36,530
company a ton we're just sharing the

1876
01:22:33,618 --> 01:22:39,069
information but you know I want my youth

1877
01:22:36,529 --> 01:22:41,689
my listeners our audience our audience

1878
01:22:39,069 --> 01:22:43,038
to be able to be in a situation where if

1879
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:45,529
this is something they want to try they

1880
01:22:43,038 --> 01:22:47,479
can try it they can do it sort of along

1881
01:22:45,529 --> 01:22:49,488
with some of us that will end up trying

1882
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:51,589
it and it's gonna be transparent it's

1883
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:54,018
not gonna be some oh let's do this all

1884
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:55,849
behind closed doors and once we see no

1885
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:57,349
let's just make it transparent like it's

1886
01:22:55,849 --> 01:22:58,788
gonna work it's not gonna work we're

1887
01:22:57,349 --> 01:23:00,500
gonna see something we're not gonna see

1888
01:22:58,788 --> 01:23:02,268
something let's just let's just try it

1889
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,948
out I love the idea of going down this

1890
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:06,409
rabbit hole of knowledge because the

1891
01:23:03,948 --> 01:23:08,388
information that you're sharing Peter I

1892
01:23:06,408 --> 01:23:17,388
can tell you I know very little about

1893
01:23:08,389 --> 01:23:20,150
and I want to know more what interrupt

1894
01:23:17,389 --> 01:23:22,819
assembly but I really appreciate you

1895
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:24,319
having you know us here for what we're

1896
01:23:22,819 --> 01:23:28,880
trying to do and we're not anything

1897
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:31,759
special we're not like you know we we've

1898
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:34,130
just been fortunate and lucky to find

1899
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,039
the right biology that is really

1900
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:39,349
conducive to help increase the efficacy

1901
01:23:37,038 --> 01:23:41,420
of this plan and I can't tell you how

1902
01:23:39,349 --> 01:23:42,409
grateful I am for the space that you

1903
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:46,130
give it me to come

1904
01:23:42,408 --> 01:23:50,089
to talk about what agricultural crop is

1905
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:53,090
is your product mostly used on besides

1906
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:55,250
carapace everything I mean everything is

1907
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:58,880
if they're a single crop that you find

1908
01:23:55,250 --> 01:24:01,520
uses it better than any other crop we

1909
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:04,310
have different formulations of the

1910
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,070
microbes for different plants but I'll

1911
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:09,139
tell you what it's it's actually

1912
01:24:06,069 --> 01:24:11,238
unbelievable how well our product works

1913
01:24:09,139 --> 01:24:15,130
on cannabis it's almost mind-boggling

1914
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:18,908
that was my next question which there

1915
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:22,730
two microorganisms for different crops

1916
01:24:18,908 --> 01:24:26,509
for different species yeah yeah can we

1917
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:29,988
buy some where can we buy some for our

1918
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:34,210
strata we have a website set up called

1919
01:24:29,988 --> 01:24:37,099
soil balance procom so it's soil balance

1920
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:38,630
procom and yeah you'll get a feel for

1921
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:40,850
what we believe a little bit more about

1922
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:43,880
the technology the science I don't like

1923
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:45,620
to you know be a salesperson and you

1924
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:49,609
know but but we're we've made it

1925
01:24:45,619 --> 01:24:53,689
affordable so $14.50 or I think it's

1926
01:24:49,609 --> 01:24:58,429
14.95 we'll give you five grams and that

1927
01:24:53,689 --> 01:25:01,599
creates 50 gallons of liquid solution

1928
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:04,969
each gallon will have six point one

1929
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,440
trillion microbes per gallon and sixty

1930
01:25:04,969 --> 01:25:08,989
two different varieties all of

1931
01:25:06,439 --> 01:25:11,839
beneficial bacteria so when you

1932
01:25:08,988 --> 01:25:13,698
inoculate your soil like or even in

1933
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,119
hydroponics because these guys all live

1934
01:25:13,698 --> 01:25:19,819
on the root so the rise of confident

1935
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:22,488
bacterias they they will just regenerate

1936
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:24,500
and live on the roots for the duration

1937
01:25:22,488 --> 01:25:26,388
of the crop cycle and the more you put

1938
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:28,969
them on the higher titor's you'll get

1939
01:25:26,389 --> 01:25:31,389
the higher microbial titor's and and and

1940
01:25:28,969 --> 01:25:36,500
then the terpene even in even in a

1941
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:39,739
strain that's producing 5% protein

1942
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:43,158
levels could go higher and more and more

1943
01:25:39,738 --> 01:25:44,928
diverse I I smoked some of this stuff

1944
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:46,460
and I'd love to tell you guys one of

1945
01:25:44,929 --> 01:25:48,440
these days about the experience that I

1946
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:54,590
had smoked in this with nine different

1947
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:57,669
turkeys and we're listening okay

1948
01:25:54,590 --> 01:26:01,930
you don't understand that terpenes are

1949
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:07,310
expressed by the ability of the plant to

1950
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:11,119
to produce them which is controlled by

1951
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:14,030
the terpene synthases so if the plant

1952
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:17,449
doesn't have particular terpene synthase

1953
01:26:14,029 --> 01:26:21,800
it can't produce that terpene it's just

1954
01:26:17,449 --> 01:26:25,099
like cannabinoids it's if doesn't have

1955
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:30,199
the CBD synthase it cannot produce CBD

1956
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:32,090
we should sample show on on the syn face

1957
01:26:30,199 --> 01:26:33,649
I swear we should make a special panel

1958
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:36,920
for just that conversation because that

1959
01:26:33,649 --> 01:26:39,129
is that's a serious [ __ ] deep rabbit

1960
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:42,020
hole you're talking about right there

1961
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:45,380
like that is like not an offshoot of

1962
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:47,300
this conversation but it is the bottom

1963
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:49,369
line it that's what I mean it's super

1964
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:51,829
important it's really important and it's

1965
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:55,189
not just about tea the cannabinoids it's

1966
01:26:51,829 --> 01:26:56,899
the terpenes it's synthase I mean I it's

1967
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:59,059
another thing I don't understand

1968
01:26:56,899 --> 01:27:01,579
completely but that I would love to hear

1969
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:04,510
us talk about more and I'm sure the

1970
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:04,510
audience would as well

1971
01:27:05,539 --> 01:27:12,649
oh good no no go ahead Peter um okay so

1972
01:27:09,529 --> 01:27:18,619
so this this grower brought me some some

1973
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:21,679
stuff and I've been smoking grass and so

1974
01:27:18,619 --> 01:27:24,319
this is nine star flower right just

1975
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:27,440
joking gone I mean yeah I know what that

1976
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:29,210
mean because it'd be a call flower 1

1977
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:33,439
star cuz it doesn't melt but this is a

1978
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:36,289
nine star flower flower what actually

1979
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:41,479
melted into a liquid no I'm stopping go

1980
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:43,670
ahead the grinder yeah literally poured

1981
01:27:41,479 --> 01:27:45,919
out I couldn't even tip it over so I put

1982
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:47,659
it to my nose and it was like like so

1983
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,270
pungent that it was like a wasabi or

1984
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:53,269
like a like a horseradish right if I put

1985
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:55,880
it really close I was like oh it's so I

1986
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:58,070
could hold it about right here but if I

1987
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:00,590
put it here it was too smelly to even

1988
01:27:58,069 --> 01:28:03,259
put that close so so I grinded it up

1989
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:05,210
like I said I if poured out like it

1990
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:07,289
wouldn't come out so I leaked out into

1991
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:09,600
the bowl and then

1992
01:28:07,289 --> 01:28:13,560
and then when I smoked it it was kind of

1993
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,060
like like my kids watch out Willy Wonka

1994
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:17,190
and the Chocolate Factory and there's

1995
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:19,680
like violet book polo Riga they're

1996
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:22,289
bright Willy Wonka's gum and she's like

1997
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:25,020
hey Dad here comes the the blueberry

1998
01:28:22,289 --> 01:28:27,359
here comes the turkey dinner right so

1999
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:29,880
that's totally how it was it was like

2000
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:33,479
like I tasted chocolate I tasted

2001
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:37,140
blueberries I tasted lemon I taste it

2002
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:39,449
and I tasted like so many different

2003
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:41,369
flavors all your taste buds were going

2004
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:45,059
bananas as it went in and as you exhale

2005
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:46,979
just going bananas in every way yeah and

2006
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:48,210
and what was crazy about it was it was

2007
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:51,179
kind of like smoking a hookah like

2008
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:52,980
instead of you know how when you smoke a

2009
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:54,750
hookah it's like really light like air

2010
01:28:52,979 --> 01:28:57,059
like it's just you could like take a

2011
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:58,710
huge rip and it's just like fills like

2012
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:00,600
air when you're smoking a hookah well

2013
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:02,550
that's how this stuff was I had I didn't

2014
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:05,670
even have the slightest notion to calm

2015
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:08,670
like I had no like or any of that it was

2016
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:11,609
just like air like super light air and

2017
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:14,399
um and it was kind of like hash like a

2018
01:29:11,609 --> 01:29:16,589
like kind of like an edible so it was

2019
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:19,139
very conscious very clean you know not

2020
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:21,329
not super where I was really stoned out

2021
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:25,260
but but it but it worked like an edible

2022
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:26,909
because after like ten minutes I really

2023
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:28,590
peaked out I didn't pick her in the

2024
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:31,319
beginning but after about 10 15 minutes

2025
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:34,230
I was like really really feeling good

2026
01:29:31,319 --> 01:29:36,359
and it lasted forever it lasted like 4

2027
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:38,909
hours here's a pretty good question from

2028
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:41,460
someone in the chat room for you Peter

2029
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:44,579
is there products to avoid using when

2030
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:47,210
using your products then could

2031
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:51,000
potentially wipe out these beneficials

2032
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:53,699
yeah yeah there are so we've made this

2033
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,029
product really durable the soil balance

2034
01:29:53,699 --> 01:30:00,420
will I mean it will really stand up to

2035
01:29:57,029 --> 01:30:03,809
pesticides and most fungicides any type

2036
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:08,130
of fertilizer but systemic fungicides

2037
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:10,500
kick our ass I mean if you use a

2038
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:11,970
systemic it's gonna go into the plant

2039
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,979
it's gonna go through the vascular

2040
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:17,340
system of the plant and and in the root

2041
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:19,469
zone and our guys live on the root so

2042
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,420
anything else you can use we're friendly

2043
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:22,159
to any you

2044
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:23,869
we know a lot of you guys are protecting

2045
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:26,359
your crops it's a big investment you got

2046
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:28,729
money coming in so you can use your

2047
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:30,889
pesticides with this product if you have

2048
01:30:28,729 --> 01:30:31,988
to to protect your investment please

2049
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:36,020
don't

2050
01:30:31,988 --> 01:30:39,829
anybody who's using a fungicide systemic

2051
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:42,860
fungicide on cannabis to be hung up and

2052
01:30:39,829 --> 01:30:47,448
dried for real real

2053
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:50,329
that scares me yeah well and in you know

2054
01:30:47,448 --> 01:30:55,549
in CalPERS is the stomach or profit

2055
01:30:50,329 --> 01:30:57,439
people use sulfur yeah the one you you

2056
01:30:55,550 --> 01:31:00,440
know that that really that really not

2057
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:02,689
castel know but what you'll find with

2058
01:31:00,439 --> 01:31:06,049
using this the soil balance is you're

2059
01:31:02,689 --> 01:31:07,849
gonna have comprehensive health that's

2060
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:09,350
what we hope you find with using it you

2061
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:11,480
know it's kind of like our bodies if

2062
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:14,780
you've got a really good community and

2063
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:17,059
you've got a really high level of the

2064
01:31:14,779 --> 01:31:20,000
biology in your own body it's not going

2065
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:24,830
to be conducive to a bad ph or bad you

2066
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:28,159
know is it susceptible to copper will

2067
01:31:24,829 --> 01:31:31,329
copper to take it out no no then none of

2068
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:34,819
the organic you can use any any organic

2069
01:31:31,329 --> 01:31:38,329
pesticide or fungicide our art art

2070
01:31:34,819 --> 01:31:40,698
colonies or ask in any pesticide can

2071
01:31:38,329 --> 01:31:42,319
kill it which is cool so that's a first

2072
01:31:40,698 --> 01:31:44,750
in the industry as well there's there's

2073
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:46,159
most of these products you know have

2074
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:48,500
strains that when you put them into the

2075
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:50,539
acidity of the soil environment a lot of

2076
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:53,029
whom will die like for instance compost

2077
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:54,829
tea microbe strains you got to think

2078
01:31:53,029 --> 01:31:57,229
about compost I love compost tea I'm a

2079
01:31:54,829 --> 01:31:59,000
big advocate of it the the heat makes in

2080
01:31:57,229 --> 01:32:00,468
it the full mix all the the macro

2081
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,420
microbes are beautiful in that the

2082
01:32:00,469 --> 01:32:04,039
enzymes but think about the strains that

2083
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:07,069
are coming in from a compost tea you've

2084
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:09,380
got maybe strange that that live on the

2085
01:32:07,069 --> 01:32:10,759
plant tissue the biomass you've got

2086
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:14,449
strains that are coming from animal

2087
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:17,239
intestines so when you introduce those

2088
01:32:14,448 --> 01:32:19,460
to the root a lot of them will do a good

2089
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:21,619
job but some of them may die you know

2090
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:24,380
after a short amount of time so what

2091
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:26,719
we're doing is introducing regenerative

2092
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:31,429
soil microorganisms that exclusively

2093
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:32,170
live on the root and so we have maybe

2094
01:32:31,429 --> 01:32:34,779
two of the

2095
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:38,380
it's been tested with cannabis together

2096
01:32:34,779 --> 01:32:40,809
or in some sort of scientific study yeah

2097
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:42,489
we will that we worked so hard to get it

2098
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:44,410
to a point where we could make it

2099
01:32:42,488 --> 01:32:47,189
available for hydroponic and cannabis

2100
01:32:44,409 --> 01:32:49,599
yeah so that's that's been the

2101
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:52,178
scientific feat right that's been the

2102
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,660
big thing can we create a product that

2103
01:32:52,179 --> 01:32:58,690
will work without soil yes because we've

2104
01:32:55,659 --> 01:33:00,698
we've all 62 these are saprophytic which

2105
01:32:58,689 --> 01:33:03,250
means they're gonna live on the root

2106
01:33:00,698 --> 01:33:05,589
because the root produces sugars and

2107
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:08,409
carbohydrates that that will sustain

2108
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:11,440
them so so the the fact that there's

2109
01:33:08,409 --> 01:33:13,988
water there as well as that carbon on

2110
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:20,229
the root we just grow like crazy all

2111
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:24,299
over the guess what I was really asking

2112
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:27,899
was if the 52 different microorganisms

2113
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:30,429
were contributed at different ratios

2114
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:33,488
might it be better for different

2115
01:33:30,429 --> 01:33:35,079
varieties of cannabis or not I guess

2116
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:37,779
that's what I was really trying to say

2117
01:33:35,079 --> 01:33:40,529
you know we we've found that certain

2118
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:44,019
strains will be conducive for certain

2119
01:33:40,529 --> 01:33:48,189
plants but they can't be SIA family

2120
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:51,370
which includes hops we actually have

2121
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:53,979
refined these strains to work with that

2122
01:33:51,369 --> 01:33:56,140
plant family so it doesn't matter the

2123
01:33:53,979 --> 01:33:58,629
strain I mean and maybe that's limited

2124
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:00,579
thinking on my part maybe eventually we

2125
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:01,810
can do some some deeper analytics and

2126
01:34:00,579 --> 01:34:04,238
those are things that our laboratory

2127
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:05,710
once we you know get more sales and we

2128
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:08,759
build we're still kind of a boutique

2129
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:12,189
manufacturer you know we're coming out

2130
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:13,810
trying to grow with with you guys we you

2131
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:15,488
know we want to be a part of this this

2132
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:17,679
industry and be a part of you and the

2133
01:34:15,488 --> 01:34:21,579
growers and support you guys and be your

2134
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:23,800
servants that's that's the key so yeah

2135
01:34:21,579 --> 01:34:25,779
those types of questions I mean we we

2136
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:28,000
would like to eventually have a

2137
01:34:25,779 --> 01:34:30,279
laboratory where we can evolve to study

2138
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,920
that you know maybe really refine and

2139
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:35,979
tune in for each strength and how

2140
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:40,119
amazing would that be there's a lot of

2141
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:44,639
law cannabis are either varieties or

2142
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:44,640
cultivars bacteria are strains

2143
01:34:45,698 --> 01:34:54,529
so so he's selling a strain yeah that's

2144
01:34:51,288 --> 01:34:56,988
why I said that's why I said three

2145
01:34:54,529 --> 01:35:03,518
dollars a Grammy for buying tiny amounts

2146
01:34:56,988 --> 01:35:08,268
it was strange salesman I'm a microbe

2147
01:35:03,519 --> 01:35:09,860
cultivator and I try I try and whenever

2148
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:13,119
we sell these things I always try and

2149
01:35:09,859 --> 01:35:15,469
tune into to giving like a good

2150
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:16,819
gratitude and offering with these guys

2151
01:35:15,469 --> 01:35:19,130
because that's kind of what we're doing

2152
01:35:16,819 --> 01:35:21,529
to our plants you know and and working

2153
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:23,929
with this technology has really tuned me

2154
01:35:21,529 --> 01:35:26,418
into how important that unseen world of

2155
01:35:23,929 --> 01:35:29,359
light of life is you know to be able to

2156
01:35:26,418 --> 01:35:30,769
give life to the roots of plants is an

2157
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:33,799
amazing thing that I'm really grateful

2158
01:35:30,769 --> 01:35:36,708
for I try and just continually offer you

2159
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:40,369
know abundance and and and gratitude for

2160
01:35:36,708 --> 01:35:43,550
that have you guys taken macroscopic

2161
01:35:40,368 --> 01:35:45,768
photographs and Thea root systems you

2162
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:47,599
know we have it it's funny that you

2163
01:35:45,769 --> 01:35:49,689
mentioned that somebody was like hey you

2164
01:35:47,599 --> 01:35:51,860
got to start doing microscopic

2165
01:35:49,689 --> 01:35:55,039
photography okay we see it under than

2166
01:35:51,859 --> 01:35:57,828
sorry but we don't trust me trust me

2167
01:35:55,038 --> 01:36:00,498
should do that yeah yeah you said great

2168
01:35:57,828 --> 01:36:03,049
idea that's a great idea that's an

2169
01:36:00,498 --> 01:36:04,639
amazing idea I just get bubbleman to do

2170
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:09,110
it cuz it sounds like he really wants to

2171
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:11,498
you guys honestly Tony I'm up here I was

2172
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:15,348
gonna introduce them to you or dog

2173
01:36:11,498 --> 01:36:19,248
where's Peter you're down in California

2174
01:36:15,349 --> 01:36:19,880
aren't you Peter I'm in Arizona okay

2175
01:36:19,248 --> 01:36:22,698
okay

2176
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:24,349
closer still well people from Canada

2177
01:36:22,698 --> 01:36:27,498
think everything's close Arizona in

2178
01:36:24,349 --> 01:36:31,149
California Santa far away Thank You ver

2179
01:36:27,498 --> 01:36:35,300
yes yes definitely he's way closer to me

2180
01:36:31,149 --> 01:36:41,030
yes that's it I think that I've got a

2181
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:43,360
buddy in the industry that that you've

2182
01:36:41,029 --> 01:36:47,509
seen me support before with vital and

2183
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:49,748
they do a lot of different work in

2184
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:51,860
California with a lot of the farmers and

2185
01:36:49,748 --> 01:36:54,408
what you're talking about would fit

2186
01:36:51,859 --> 01:36:56,589
really really really well with the

2187
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:58,219
biodynamic sustainable farming and

2188
01:36:56,590 --> 01:37:01,400
practices that

2189
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:03,110
that are going on in California because

2190
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:06,710
they are doing greenhouses and

2191
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:08,359
controlled greenhouses and you have to

2192
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:09,800
you know you're dealing with you're not

2193
01:37:08,359 --> 01:37:12,409
growing indoor so you're dealing with

2194
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:15,350
everything that's out there and so

2195
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:17,720
everything can be a predator not just

2196
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:20,120
not just bugs all kinds of conditions

2197
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:22,159
whether you know the dynamic range

2198
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:23,630
between the daytime temperature in the

2199
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:26,930
night time temperature the way the plant

2200
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:28,940
transpires all kinds of all kinds of

2201
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:32,750
things so it sounds like you've you've

2202
01:37:28,939 --> 01:37:34,639
made almost eight like if I could kind

2203
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:38,710
of summarize what I'm hearing it sounds

2204
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:41,960
like you've made a water-soluble

2205
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:44,230
probiotic for the root system like when

2206
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:47,569
we go and get a kombucha you've made a

2207
01:37:44,229 --> 01:37:50,589
way to like create a water-soluble

2208
01:37:47,569 --> 01:37:54,079
colony that's that's in the trillions

2209
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:58,630
that that's kind of like a probiotic for

2210
01:37:54,079 --> 01:38:01,609
humans is that yeah that's dialed in and

2211
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:04,400
yeah that's exactly what we done okay

2212
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:06,380
just a bit something that Tony had

2213
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:08,829
pointed out before which is that you

2214
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:13,039
know the majority of the growing public

2215
01:38:08,829 --> 01:38:14,720
needs to know about this because of you

2216
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:16,880
know when they're going to buy groceries

2217
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:19,659
and maybe if they live up in the woods

2218
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:22,010
in Humboldt they only come down to

2219
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:23,840
civilization like once they're gonna go

2220
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:26,030
to a big-box retailer they're gonna go

2221
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,860
to a Walmart to Lowe's they're gonna go

2222
01:38:26,029 --> 01:38:28,579
to a Home Depot and what are they gonna

2223
01:38:27,859 --> 01:38:31,250
find there

2224
01:38:28,579 --> 01:38:34,970
they're gonna find Miracle Grow and

2225
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:37,460
Scots and all that other crap so it's

2226
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:40,720
important to get the word out on these

2227
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:44,869
kinds of things because until the EPA

2228
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:46,760
regulates restorations for those things

2229
01:38:44,869 --> 01:38:49,519
they're never gonna find their way into

2230
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,909
those retail channels and so you're

2231
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,820
right

2232
01:38:49,909 --> 01:38:56,840
Scott's miracle-gro they own the retail

2233
01:38:52,819 --> 01:38:59,960
channel if you if it's sold in a Home

2234
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:02,270
Depot today and if it's a plant insect

2235
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:05,300
control product chances are it comes

2236
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:08,240
from or you know in full of companies

2237
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:09,199
that hate or that channel access to that

2238
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:11,389
market

2239
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:14,538
so they're people who live up in the

2240
01:39:11,389 --> 01:39:17,090
woods who need to commute once a week

2241
01:39:14,538 --> 01:39:18,948
down to go get through supplies they're

2242
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:20,809
trapped because what store is available

2243
01:39:18,948 --> 01:39:23,238
the store that's available is the

2244
01:39:20,809 --> 01:39:24,860
Walmart or the whatever is so they're

2245
01:39:23,238 --> 01:39:28,399
gonna go there and they're gonna buy and

2246
01:39:24,859 --> 01:39:31,009
stock up on all of that crap do their

2247
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:34,728
homework in advance reach out to you on

2248
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:37,219
the web or whatever you channel you're

2249
01:39:34,729 --> 01:39:38,958
able to get your product out there to

2250
01:39:37,219 --> 01:39:40,969
let people know that there's an

2251
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:44,689
alternative your other than those

2252
01:39:40,969 --> 01:39:46,969
supplies that are sold no no no I'm sure

2253
01:39:44,689 --> 01:39:50,149
it's easier said than what you're right

2254
01:39:46,969 --> 01:39:51,229
now this is just lighting up and I kind

2255
01:39:50,149 --> 01:39:53,899
of want to tune into it

2256
01:39:51,229 --> 01:39:55,699
what you're saying right now that's why

2257
01:39:53,899 --> 01:39:57,408
we're in and it answers your question to

2258
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:59,658
Tony that's really why we're in this

2259
01:39:57,408 --> 01:40:02,748
cannabis space because there's no other

2260
01:39:59,658 --> 01:40:05,259
plant that we've ever worked with where

2261
01:40:02,748 --> 01:40:07,939
you can see the efficacy as prevalent

2262
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:10,070
than this cannabis plant it's almost

2263
01:40:07,939 --> 01:40:12,678
like a magical plant for what we're

2264
01:40:10,069 --> 01:40:15,380
trying to do with our mission because of

2265
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:23,868
the the quality enhancement the terpene

2266
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:33,050
expression it is magical hmm thank you

2267
01:40:23,868 --> 01:40:35,448
for that energy I love the differences

2268
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:37,340
of the of the panel like such different

2269
01:40:35,448 --> 01:40:39,288
personalities not to cut you off Tony

2270
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:40,969
you're gonna go in three seconds but I

2271
01:40:39,288 --> 01:40:42,469
just had to say right on for all of you

2272
01:40:40,969 --> 01:40:45,649
guys thanks for spending your time here

2273
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:47,569
every Sunday you know I was gonna say

2274
01:40:45,649 --> 01:40:49,759
that like you know when we think of the

2275
01:40:47,569 --> 01:40:52,099
plant and its evolution you have to also

2276
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,869
think of the actual endocannabinoid

2277
01:40:52,099 --> 01:40:55,519
system and it did actually exist and

2278
01:40:53,868 --> 01:40:57,589
maybe mark wouldn't agree with me but

2279
01:40:55,519 --> 01:40:59,599
I've seen some literature out there that

2280
01:40:57,590 --> 01:41:02,510
the endocannabinoid system has evolved

2281
01:40:59,599 --> 01:41:05,260
even pre pre human so it's something

2282
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:08,329
that's been around disagree with that

2283
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:10,880
okay all right well I think that's

2284
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:12,349
pretty well known that it is true all

2285
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:15,618
right all right well we're all on the

2286
01:41:12,349 --> 01:41:17,420
same page then so yeah it's a so it's

2287
01:41:15,618 --> 01:41:20,899
something that's evolved in nature to

2288
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:22,819
quality human rights created so that we

2289
01:41:20,899 --> 01:41:27,049
could fulfill our end okay

2290
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:28,670
have annoyed into yeah

2291
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:30,770
well that's I was gonna say so what heat

2292
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:33,260
what heat what's happened here is the

2293
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:35,870
plant has survived and the end the

2294
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:38,300
system itself of these of these of how

2295
01:41:35,869 --> 01:41:40,220
we absorb it became part of our

2296
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:42,739
fundamental DNA and it's part of life

2297
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:44,300
and what's interesting is that the key

2298
01:41:42,739 --> 01:41:46,399
word that Mark is talking about is

2299
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:48,560
probably why he's on hash search pushing

2300
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:51,079
cannabis and not in the mainstream is

2301
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,640
distribution so if we look at the look

2302
01:41:51,079 --> 01:41:55,159
at the soda industry we look at the

2303
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:57,350
music industry you look at any kind of

2304
01:41:55,159 --> 01:41:59,180
industry those who controls the channels

2305
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:02,300
in the in the way of distribution and

2306
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:04,010
retail control the consumer so same

2307
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:05,900
thing with music if you're if you're a

2308
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:09,800
huge record label and you're buying up

2309
01:42:05,899 --> 01:42:11,509
airtime on the radio and and you're oh

2310
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:16,610
great my computer's about to go to a

2311
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:18,770
kazillion checking's oh my god hold on a

2312
01:42:16,609 --> 01:42:21,109
second guys this always happens there we

2313
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:22,850
go and and they're able to control that

2314
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:25,429
just like like somebody's like oh I'm

2315
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:29,120
gonna create a new soda and I worked on

2316
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:32,300
this project in 2004 2005 the first Net

2317
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:34,159
Zero soda great idea helps you burn

2318
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:37,579
calories instead of giving in calories

2319
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:39,769
and it was this amazing type of thing

2320
01:42:37,579 --> 01:42:42,229
but guess who controls the distribution

2321
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:44,060
of soda so you there's only two

2322
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:46,429
companies and therefore you're gonna bow

2323
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:48,110
down and with what this guy's taught

2324
01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:51,680
what Peter's talking about here is he's

2325
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:54,909
like hey listen I made a made a trillion

2326
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:58,520
parts per million or a trillion parts

2327
01:42:54,909 --> 01:43:01,069
probiotic for four plants that will do

2328
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:04,100
all this amazing stuff that is a huge

2329
01:43:01,069 --> 01:43:06,949
need right now especially in the micro

2330
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:07,940
world and the distribution channels and

2331
01:43:06,949 --> 01:43:09,679
the people that are actually making

2332
01:43:07,939 --> 01:43:12,319
money are making money off of crap

2333
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:13,579
they're selling crap yeah and they're

2334
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:16,519
like hey this is great

2335
01:43:13,579 --> 01:43:19,220
Wow with no cannabinoids yeah okay

2336
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:21,770
basically that's the exacting is what I

2337
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:25,300
was gonna say it's like CRC bucks a case

2338
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:25,300
yeah they are

2339
01:43:25,368 --> 01:43:32,109
okay they sell roundup at Home Depot

2340
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:35,889
like it's a [ __ ] like a pepsi-cola

2341
01:43:32,109 --> 01:43:39,319
talents everywhere everywhere it's like

2342
01:43:35,889 --> 01:43:42,708
yeah you're so right on well so there's

2343
01:43:39,319 --> 01:43:44,208
so with the rate yo that's why Sirius

2344
01:43:42,708 --> 01:43:46,368
Radio came out that's why satellite

2345
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:48,889
radio no commercials because for a while

2346
01:43:46,368 --> 01:43:51,198
there and it's it's funny as you study

2347
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:53,510
these like these generational changes

2348
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:55,009
for a while there we only had radio and

2349
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:58,458
I was I was reading up on people that

2350
01:43:55,010 --> 01:44:00,979
are born between 78 and 83 which is 77

2351
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:02,719
and 83 which is myself where what's

2352
01:44:00,979 --> 01:44:04,550
called the micro generation right

2353
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:06,288
we're not the Generation Xers the

2354
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:08,748
millennium but we grew up in the stage

2355
01:44:06,288 --> 01:44:11,748
where as kids we had analog in college

2356
01:44:08,748 --> 01:44:13,698
we had digital and so there was a time

2357
01:44:11,748 --> 01:44:16,639
where there was no digital phones there

2358
01:44:13,698 --> 01:44:18,348
was no we took a picture and exposed it

2359
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,929
right away on our camera we had to wait

2360
01:44:18,349 --> 01:44:24,559
two weeks you know and what's happened

2361
01:44:20,929 --> 01:44:27,498
is in that boom in that generation they

2362
01:44:24,559 --> 01:44:30,139
they found ways to make money they found

2363
01:44:27,498 --> 01:44:32,208
ways to cut tape and now what Marc's

2364
01:44:30,139 --> 01:44:33,918
talking about the EPA now it's like oh

2365
01:44:32,208 --> 01:44:36,469
let's cut down the tape let's let's make

2366
01:44:33,918 --> 01:44:39,229
this easier for us to sell more crap and

2367
01:44:36,469 --> 01:44:41,090
what that does is it keeps Brits it's

2368
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:43,340
about money instead of about the human

2369
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:45,139
relationship and the species so I could

2370
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:47,239
see why you might have a tremendous hard

2371
01:44:45,139 --> 01:44:48,458
time getting this into the mainstream

2372
01:44:47,238 --> 01:44:51,138
but I could tell you in California

2373
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:53,148
versus the rest of the country for for

2374
01:44:51,139 --> 01:44:55,519
farming and growing herbs in your in

2375
01:44:53,149 --> 01:44:58,219
your for the consumer I would put them

2376
01:44:55,519 --> 01:45:01,550
at the highest consciousness and I think

2377
01:44:58,219 --> 01:45:03,198
your markets California yeah it really

2378
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:04,668
has been California has been great all

2379
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:06,708
the states have been great you know it's

2380
01:45:04,668 --> 01:45:09,529
just isolated pockets I mean let me

2381
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:12,469
expand the north the sorry the Northwest

2382
01:45:09,529 --> 01:45:13,938
so Washington Oregon California area of

2383
01:45:12,469 --> 01:45:16,069
the United States I don't want to leave

2384
01:45:13,939 --> 01:45:18,739
out my friends up north because that

2385
01:45:16,069 --> 01:45:21,618
they are all extremely conscious in

2386
01:45:18,738 --> 01:45:24,138
Oregon so what Mark was talking about is

2387
01:45:21,618 --> 01:45:27,348
is pretty pretty right on point because

2388
01:45:24,139 --> 01:45:28,368
you know what we're trying to do to get

2389
01:45:27,349 --> 01:45:30,878
the product on with regards to

2390
01:45:28,368 --> 01:45:34,158
distribution just to kind of give you a

2391
01:45:30,878 --> 01:45:37,279
very high-level overview of it we are

2392
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:39,219
really in the belief that the the

2393
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:41,408
product will speak and sell for its

2394
01:45:39,219 --> 01:45:43,328
so if I can put it in the hands of you

2395
01:45:41,408 --> 01:45:45,339
guys and put it in the hands of the

2396
01:45:43,328 --> 01:45:47,948
right people that can actually see for

2397
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:50,469
their own eyes the power of of just

2398
01:45:47,948 --> 01:45:52,748
simply adding the right biodiversity to

2399
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:55,149
their crop then you're you're gonna be

2400
01:45:52,748 --> 01:45:56,769
able to share this message and kind of a

2401
01:45:55,149 --> 01:45:58,799
grassroots movement and that's what

2402
01:45:56,769 --> 01:46:01,150
we're looking to do that's that's my

2403
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,409
ideal marketing strategy that's what

2404
01:46:01,149 --> 01:46:04,509
I've been doing for the long run and

2405
01:46:02,408 --> 01:46:06,219
that's why I have so many sustainable

2406
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:08,349
organic cultivators using this product

2407
01:46:06,219 --> 01:46:10,498
is not because I have a huge marketing

2408
01:46:08,349 --> 01:46:12,940
budget but I'm keeping the cost low I'm

2409
01:46:10,498 --> 01:46:15,010
working with the right light beings that

2410
01:46:12,939 --> 01:46:17,049
are able to get this out because they're

2411
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:19,869
tuning into how important it is for

2412
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:23,769
their own environment and in it and it

2413
01:46:19,868 --> 01:46:26,049
it almost like relates or it balances

2414
01:46:23,769 --> 01:46:29,380
out with the actual technology it's like

2415
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:31,119
us it's like a relative synergy so I eat

2416
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:32,710
them am I the only one that just saw the

2417
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:35,889
light beam come over his right shoulder

2418
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:39,489
over the last few minutes do you see the

2419
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:41,828
light beam yeah I saw I'm sorry as you

2420
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:43,448
were talking about that look to your

2421
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:45,399
look on camera and look where your

2422
01:46:43,448 --> 01:46:50,408
children's pictures are there's a beam

2423
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:54,429
of light is shining it's shining down as

2424
01:46:50,408 --> 01:47:01,058
you're talking that's why I ordered two

2425
01:46:54,429 --> 01:47:03,099
bags a bit beautiful you know what

2426
01:47:01,059 --> 01:47:05,498
you're probably right and what Mark was

2427
01:47:03,099 --> 01:47:08,110
talking about to shame because the epa's

2428
01:47:05,498 --> 01:47:10,630
like okay this is something that the mat

2429
01:47:08,109 --> 01:47:12,808
that's billions of dollars across the

2430
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:15,519
united states of consumption of cannabis

2431
01:47:12,809 --> 01:47:18,429
whether it's adult use or quote unquote

2432
01:47:15,519 --> 01:47:21,130
medicine that people in humans in the

2433
01:47:18,429 --> 01:47:25,510
public are consuming it is our fiduciary

2434
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:28,599
right and our duty to study the effects

2435
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:31,150
of pesticides on plants and it's

2436
01:47:28,599 --> 01:47:32,769
interesting that now they are and by the

2437
01:47:31,149 --> 01:47:35,649
way the beams in front of you so I know

2438
01:47:32,769 --> 01:47:37,239
it's not on on the wall yes on your it's

2439
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:41,408
right across you yeah look at that

2440
01:47:37,238 --> 01:47:42,518
um it's crazy a Peter let me paint a

2441
01:47:41,408 --> 01:47:46,179
different scenario

2442
01:47:42,519 --> 01:47:48,998
yes 280e goes away cannabis gets

2443
01:47:46,179 --> 01:47:51,519
delisted and you are bought hook line

2444
01:47:48,998 --> 01:47:56,198
and sinker by Scotts mirror

2445
01:47:51,519 --> 01:47:58,958
or another multinational corporation I'm

2446
01:47:56,198 --> 01:48:01,198
looking to get never gonna [ __ ] bro

2447
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:03,488
never gonna happen

2448
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:05,678
I'm just kind of like playing devil's

2449
01:48:03,488 --> 01:48:06,248
advocate that's all say the same thing

2450
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,739
to me

2451
01:48:06,248 --> 01:48:09,998
dude they said they'd say hey but didn't

2452
01:48:08,738 --> 01:48:12,578
Marquis to work for one of those

2453
01:48:09,998 --> 01:48:17,170
companies those guys I really I really

2454
01:48:12,578 --> 01:48:18,939
would like to have them assimilate this

2455
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:20,288
is this is something so important to me

2456
01:48:18,939 --> 01:48:23,618
that I'd love to kind of share with you

2457
01:48:20,288 --> 01:48:28,958
guys on on church well they're yes okay

2458
01:48:23,618 --> 01:48:32,408
listen to this idea so within the

2459
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:33,939
balance of of the micro world right

2460
01:48:32,408 --> 01:48:35,259
there's there's a light and there's a

2461
01:48:33,939 --> 01:48:37,478
dark there's a shadow and there's a

2462
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:38,829
light right the pathogens we see them as

2463
01:48:37,479 --> 01:48:41,708
shadow they take from our plants they

2464
01:48:38,828 --> 01:48:45,130
kill our plants if you extrapolate that

2465
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:48,698
to humans right we all have within

2466
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:50,078
ourselves in a shadow we have suffering

2467
01:48:48,698 --> 01:48:51,609
we have pain we have things that we're

2468
01:48:50,078 --> 01:48:55,359
trying to alleviate within a within

2469
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:58,058
ourselves and so the idea that I've seen

2470
01:48:55,359 --> 01:49:01,448
with our product which resonates so

2471
01:48:58,059 --> 01:49:04,599
clearly with us because I feel like

2472
01:49:01,448 --> 01:49:06,158
we're so here to to take care of the of

2473
01:49:04,599 --> 01:49:07,420
the plants and nurture the plants that's

2474
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:09,609
why we've been given all of these

2475
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:11,590
abilities these abilities to love and

2476
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:13,208
nurture and and want to be loved and

2477
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:15,578
cared for these plants that's why we can

2478
01:49:13,208 --> 01:49:18,908
energetically tune into the plants so if

2479
01:49:15,578 --> 01:49:20,799
we're actually able to to reach Hanul a

2480
01:49:18,908 --> 01:49:23,978
lot of that shadow energy that's coming

2481
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:25,538
into us you know a lot of that anger a

2482
01:49:23,979 --> 01:49:28,719
lot of that fear a lot of that pain

2483
01:49:25,538 --> 01:49:33,809
reach annal it into a compassionate

2484
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:36,248
place a a consciousness and actually

2485
01:49:33,809 --> 01:49:39,099
come from a place of giving in a place

2486
01:49:36,248 --> 01:49:41,849
of gratitude and abundance that energy

2487
01:49:39,099 --> 01:49:44,590
will extrapolate and then just like our

2488
01:49:41,849 --> 01:49:48,969
microorganisms do it doesn't allow room

2489
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:51,578
for a lot of those pathogens to gain

2490
01:49:48,969 --> 01:49:52,569
competency or gain traction or you know

2491
01:49:51,578 --> 01:49:55,538
there's just health

2492
01:49:52,569 --> 01:49:59,938
there's just abundance there's just you

2493
01:49:55,538 --> 01:50:02,668
know this high level energy of good good

2494
01:49:59,939 --> 01:50:04,409
love and and mostly compassion and

2495
01:50:02,668 --> 01:50:06,269
that's what I've seen this product work

2496
01:50:04,408 --> 01:50:08,638
it's like a compassionate product for

2497
01:50:06,269 --> 01:50:10,139
the clients it keeps them healthy and so

2498
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:12,300
what you're talking about with regards

2499
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:14,368
to distribution and you know the big

2500
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:17,038
evil guys they're they're not they're

2501
01:50:14,368 --> 01:50:18,630
not evil none of the humans on this

2502
01:50:17,038 --> 01:50:21,328
earth are evil we're all just in a

2503
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:23,099
certain place or a point of of suffering

2504
01:50:21,328 --> 01:50:24,538
they're just looking for a product to

2505
01:50:23,099 --> 01:50:27,630
push and that's the product they have

2506
01:50:24,538 --> 01:50:29,819
the push well yeah you know if we if we

2507
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:32,248
can break through to where we're all on

2508
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:33,688
a balance plane you'll then then you

2509
01:50:32,248 --> 01:50:35,819
know all these chemical companies could

2510
01:50:33,689 --> 01:50:38,550
help a technology like my bacon they

2511
01:50:35,819 --> 01:50:40,828
could they could embrace it and add it

2512
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:45,110
as a part of what they're innately been

2513
01:50:40,828 --> 01:50:47,969
created as a human being to do that's

2514
01:50:45,109 --> 01:50:51,359
that's why we're here yeah and I think

2515
01:50:47,969 --> 01:50:54,569
with Mark Steyn anti greed pill first

2516
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:56,848
because greed blinds everybody to

2517
01:50:54,569 --> 01:50:59,399
everything unfortunately when people

2518
01:50:56,849 --> 01:51:02,189
want to do stuff like that they just put

2519
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:05,009
their blindfold on of greed and we end

2520
01:51:02,189 --> 01:51:07,050
up with a bunch of other crap instead we

2521
01:51:05,010 --> 01:51:10,320
end up with chemical companies like

2522
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:13,380
Monsanto selling us Nigel passe and

2523
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:15,389
telling us what a great thing it is well

2524
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:17,639
it has to be great because now it's in

2525
01:51:15,389 --> 01:51:19,019
mother's milk wrecking their best

2526
01:51:17,639 --> 01:51:21,118
shuttle you have to recognize that

2527
01:51:19,019 --> 01:51:22,949
shadow and re channel it and allowed

2528
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:24,929
them to be channel it into into

2529
01:51:22,948 --> 01:51:26,339
compassion and they will if they're

2530
01:51:24,929 --> 01:51:31,708
given the opportunity and they have the

2531
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:34,168
right technology they may not ignore we

2532
01:51:31,708 --> 01:51:36,719
have to look at it openly and say look

2533
01:51:34,168 --> 01:51:38,488
these people are doing this you know I

2534
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:40,408
agree with what you're doing in fact I

2535
01:51:38,488 --> 01:51:42,988
just ordered two bags of it I think it's

2536
01:51:40,408 --> 01:51:45,328
a wonderful idea and I've been looking

2537
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:48,618
into living soil and plants for a long

2538
01:51:45,328 --> 01:51:52,768
time I've only grown in fresh rabbit poo

2539
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:55,049
earthworm stuff like that and I always

2540
01:51:52,769 --> 01:51:57,329
felt like the bugs and animals were not

2541
01:51:55,050 --> 01:52:00,869
clearly the best biology for plants you

2542
01:51:57,328 --> 01:52:02,609
know like they were the micro engineers

2543
01:52:00,868 --> 01:52:05,819
and they were they would attract the

2544
01:52:02,609 --> 01:52:08,578
rest of the work crews along they would

2545
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:10,978
make it and we always grew plants for 56

2546
01:52:08,578 --> 01:52:13,529
years between where we do really good

2547
01:52:10,979 --> 01:52:18,000
plants and never age

2548
01:52:13,529 --> 01:52:20,609
a lot of the things that seem to attack

2549
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,569
a lot of the plants nowadays that I hear

2550
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:26,009
friends have I'm just going based on

2551
01:52:24,569 --> 01:52:29,399
that we always try to make our soil

2552
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:31,500
alive and it always seems to be the

2553
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:33,359
right path for us but I love this stuff

2554
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:35,430
I just ordered two bags of it and I'm

2555
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:39,139
gonna use it this season on all of my

2556
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:45,210
urge and skunk plants that I'm going

2557
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:47,070
ordered a couple trillion a mark is

2558
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:48,569
saying is that if your strategy if you

2559
01:52:47,069 --> 01:52:51,960
create something that's good and your

2560
01:52:48,569 --> 01:52:54,539
and your mission is is is good for

2561
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:55,980
humans in the planet and you like you

2562
01:52:54,539 --> 01:52:57,600
said they're just put the you know the

2563
01:52:55,979 --> 01:52:58,949
distribution companies are just pushing

2564
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,900
what they're told to push they're like

2565
01:52:58,949 --> 01:53:03,510
hey we've got product day with that

2566
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:05,009
product B we're gonna set up 1,500 sales

2567
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:06,840
people across the country and they're

2568
01:53:05,010 --> 01:53:10,140
gonna sell product a and they're gonna

2569
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:12,090
sell product B but it's not a sellout if

2570
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:14,010
you get a contract with this with a

2571
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:17,130
distribution company or a record label

2572
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:21,350
if you will that says okay I just

2573
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:24,119
created something that's ten times

2574
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:26,280
better than what you have on the shelf

2575
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:28,380
and so you have to work on something

2576
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:31,109
that would be like a repeal and replace

2577
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:33,690
type of policy where you just you start

2578
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:36,119
implementing repeal and replace your

2579
01:53:33,689 --> 01:53:38,789
products with my products and if you

2580
01:53:36,119 --> 01:53:41,099
could find a distributor that says we

2581
01:53:38,789 --> 01:53:44,130
currently have ninety five percent of

2582
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:45,930
the market share were of crap that can

2583
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:47,850
harm you know humans in the environment

2584
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:50,119
you're like great I would like to see my

2585
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:53,430
product over the next 10 20 and 30 years

2586
01:53:50,119 --> 01:53:56,550
repeal and replace that ninety five

2587
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:58,380
percent down to zero well that's you

2588
01:53:56,550 --> 01:54:00,810
know that's literally what Paul Stamets

2589
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:03,420
is doing right now like he is literally

2590
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:05,190
producing all these incredible unique

2591
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:07,859
products based on things that he's

2592
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:11,039
learned from the mushroom and literally

2593
01:54:07,859 --> 01:54:14,460
like from pesticide and herbicide I mean

2594
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:16,409
he's able to control insects with with

2595
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:19,439
different funguses I mean you you're

2596
01:54:16,409 --> 01:54:25,579
aware of Paul's work I'm sure Peter I

2597
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:25,579
mean the way you put that mushrooms

2598
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:29,350
I've had a brief conversation with Paul

2599
01:54:27,609 --> 01:54:32,409
and he's doing some some amazing things

2600
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:34,030
I'm really happy for him and his work

2601
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:35,859
and it's very different than what we're

2602
01:54:34,029 --> 01:54:37,509
doing though you know we're different

2603
01:54:35,859 --> 01:54:40,929
but it's similar in the sense of what

2604
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:42,640
Tony was just saying to be able to like

2605
01:54:40,929 --> 01:54:45,039
his work is the same in the sense that

2606
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:46,960
everything he's doing is is beneficial

2607
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:48,789
and it's about giving and it's about

2608
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:52,329
producing this information that's like

2609
01:54:48,789 --> 01:54:55,569
right using nature instead of deadly

2610
01:54:52,329 --> 01:54:58,269
chemicals instead of like harsh poisons

2611
01:54:55,569 --> 01:55:00,939
it's that that's where the similarity I

2612
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:03,280
think was yeah yeah I mean we're we

2613
01:55:00,939 --> 01:55:06,009
really believe that you know one of the

2614
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:10,000
most advanced technologies on this earth

2615
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:14,880
that we can learn and utilize is nature

2616
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:18,130
I mean that's that's and retuning are

2617
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:21,340
energetic into that beautiful secret

2618
01:55:18,130 --> 01:55:23,199
command working in there's what a lot of

2619
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:24,789
you guys are already doing and you're

2620
01:55:23,198 --> 01:55:29,229
feeling that and that's such an

2621
01:55:24,789 --> 01:55:31,569
achievement for plants that you know it

2622
01:55:29,229 --> 01:55:33,399
went when when I talk about it I feel

2623
01:55:31,569 --> 01:55:35,500
like I really resonated with with a lot

2624
01:55:33,399 --> 01:55:39,009
of the mechanicus cultivators though

2625
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:40,630
understanding that that energetic

2626
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:43,510
connection that they have with their

2627
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:45,819
plants and and and and giving it the

2628
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:47,679
right things is just almost like this

2629
01:55:45,819 --> 01:55:50,049
this desire that you want to do you want

2630
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:53,050
to give it the best so that these guys

2631
01:55:50,050 --> 01:55:55,119
their energy can just help and heal and

2632
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:58,179
give to the to the people that you're

2633
01:55:55,119 --> 01:56:00,729
serving other humans and that resonance

2634
01:55:58,179 --> 01:56:02,770
is happening you know with or without me

2635
01:56:00,729 --> 01:56:04,329
or with or without what we're doing it's

2636
01:56:02,770 --> 01:56:07,210
already started and it's a beautiful

2637
01:56:04,329 --> 01:56:15,819
thing in my lifetime well it's just to

2638
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:20,170
be a part of you know it's the stomach

2639
01:56:15,819 --> 01:56:22,299
worm what one of the things I was

2640
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:24,819
talking to you about earlier was how our

2641
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:26,320
product creates human right so an

2642
01:56:24,819 --> 01:56:29,079
earthworm as it's going through the soil

2643
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:31,509
what it does is it eats carbon and it's

2644
01:56:29,079 --> 01:56:33,340
excrement is is actually human so it's

2645
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:36,340
the most bioavailable nutrients it's

2646
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:37,960
it's hydrophilic which means it retains

2647
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:39,670
moisture so it's very good for the soil

2648
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:42,250
all the nutrients in it are bioavailable

2649
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:45,190
think about that process but doing it

2650
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:47,199
exponentially faster with saprophytic

2651
01:56:45,189 --> 01:56:49,359
organisms that are found in soil balance

2652
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:51,460
so our guys will attach to carbon

2653
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:53,738
because saprophyte eat carbon just like

2654
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:56,710
a worm does we decompose it on a

2655
01:56:53,738 --> 01:56:57,879
microscopic level around the roots so

2656
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:59,529
figure you're getting a bunch of

2657
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:00,819
earthworms around your roots if you if

2658
01:56:59,529 --> 01:57:04,029
you want to think about it that way and

2659
01:57:00,819 --> 01:57:06,159
then it's decomposing all of that carbon

2660
01:57:04,029 --> 01:57:08,409
making it bioavailable right on your

2661
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:10,809
root right on your root with these small

2662
01:57:08,409 --> 01:57:12,960
little guys these little these little

2663
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:15,340
micro organisms and do your

2664
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:18,899
microorganisms live through the gut of

2665
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:21,699
worm so when it poops out are they

2666
01:57:18,899 --> 01:57:24,039
microorganism still active yeah yeah

2667
01:57:21,699 --> 01:57:26,619
yeah yeah we actually increase on all

2668
01:57:24,039 --> 01:57:28,899
kinds of worms we increase beneficial

2669
01:57:26,619 --> 01:57:31,479
nematodes did you know that beneficial

2670
01:57:28,899 --> 01:57:35,559
nematodes eat human and plant parasitic

2671
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:40,029
nematodes eat carbon yeah I've been

2672
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:42,370
using nematodes for almost 40 years yeah

2673
01:57:40,029 --> 01:57:44,409
we're good houmous the beneficial

2674
01:57:42,369 --> 01:57:47,890
nematodes grow naturally in our soils

2675
01:57:44,409 --> 01:57:50,550
it's amazing so there was a little off

2676
01:57:47,890 --> 01:57:56,110
subject but it reminds me of when I was

2677
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:57,880
2,000 maybe five back then I was a

2678
01:57:56,109 --> 01:58:00,488
general contractor and working with my

2679
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:02,440
brother in Florida but we had started a

2680
01:58:00,488 --> 01:58:05,829
construction site and they generally

2681
01:58:02,439 --> 01:58:08,559
give you engineering scoop and site

2682
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:10,539
plans that tell you like the last you

2683
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:12,489
know 40 60 years of what they have

2684
01:58:10,539 --> 01:58:15,279
documented depending on the city and how

2685
01:58:12,488 --> 01:58:17,589
well the the documents are done but we

2686
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:21,909
had started to drill the piles and stuff

2687
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:24,690
and hit a like an unforeseen oil tank

2688
01:58:21,909 --> 01:58:27,130
that somebody just buried on this land

2689
01:58:24,689 --> 01:58:28,659
and there was no permit for it or

2690
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:30,579
anything and we drilled right into it

2691
01:58:28,659 --> 01:58:34,210
and all of a sudden there was like you

2692
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:35,829
know 40 feet deep you know this is in

2693
01:58:34,210 --> 01:58:38,619
Florida so you're hitting water and now

2694
01:58:35,829 --> 01:58:40,719
there's like a barrier very very small

2695
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:44,380
between the top and then as the water

2696
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:46,060
table and so maybe it was probably maybe

2697
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:49,960
it wasn't 40 feet deep we were trying to

2698
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:51,639
drill deeper and we I think it was it

2699
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:54,609
might have been 10 feet under the soil

2700
01:58:51,639 --> 01:58:57,400
but it was buried we had to stop EPA had

2701
01:58:54,609 --> 01:58:59,319
to get involved and I'll never forget

2702
01:58:57,399 --> 01:58:59,979
this story because I was like man we are

2703
01:58:59,319 --> 01:59:01,238
[ __ ]

2704
01:58:59,979 --> 01:59:03,729
there's millions of dollars on the line

2705
01:59:01,238 --> 01:59:07,059
everybody you know you're building these

2706
01:59:03,729 --> 01:59:09,698
like projects and they had hired a

2707
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:12,130
specialist and I was to meet him because

2708
01:59:09,698 --> 01:59:13,000
I was the project manager and that this

2709
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:14,859
thing was shut down

2710
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,109
EPA everything like how you gonna clean

2711
01:59:14,859 --> 01:59:19,599
up the environment well the number came

2712
01:59:17,109 --> 01:59:22,389
in around 55,000 for the specialist to

2713
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:23,889
come in and he was my brother was like

2714
01:59:22,389 --> 01:59:26,050
yeah he's a bug specialist I'm like what

2715
01:59:23,889 --> 01:59:28,539
do you mean a bug specialist in well he

2716
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:30,460
invented and he creates these bio bugs

2717
01:59:28,539 --> 01:59:32,170
and I'm like what are you talking about

2718
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:33,760
he's like you'll see you'll see this

2719
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:37,118
guy's this guy's known around the

2720
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:39,010
country so he came in and we had a big

2721
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,500
hole on the site I'm talking you know

2722
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:43,780
you could walk around it it was probably

2723
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:46,779
good 40 feet around this thing all

2724
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:49,229
centered out and it was a guy was kind

2725
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:52,179
of uh not a cowboy hat but like a

2726
01:59:49,229 --> 01:59:54,250
adventurer hat if you will and he had

2727
01:59:52,179 --> 01:59:56,529
just like a button up and just seemed

2728
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:58,750
like a normal guy whatever and he said

2729
01:59:56,529 --> 02:00:01,029
yeah don't worry about it man he's like

2730
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:04,229
I've got this he's got two containers

2731
02:00:01,029 --> 02:00:08,109
about this big and he just went around

2732
02:00:04,229 --> 02:00:12,099
throwing these bugs microorganisms

2733
02:00:08,109 --> 02:00:14,859
around around the dirt not even on where

2734
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:17,980
the oil was and as as he went around

2735
02:00:14,859 --> 02:00:21,460
these things hit the dirt and went like

2736
02:00:17,979 --> 02:00:24,428
into the soil immediately they ate all

2737
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:26,439
of the oil they pooped out like

2738
02:00:24,429 --> 02:00:28,658
phosphorous or something and then died

2739
02:00:26,439 --> 02:00:30,819
and then they decomposed into some other

2740
02:00:28,658 --> 02:00:32,559
natural element and it was like the

2741
02:00:30,819 --> 02:00:35,618
craziest [ __ ] I've ever seen they ate

2742
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:38,590
all the oil in a course of five days he

2743
02:00:35,618 --> 02:00:41,079
put trillions of like these organism

2744
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:43,510
bugs that he designed and created yeah

2745
02:00:41,079 --> 02:00:46,359
and I I was like I looked like came back

2746
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:49,420
and I was like what the [ __ ] happened to

2747
02:00:46,359 --> 02:00:52,029
the oil and and then out then the next

2748
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:54,069
question of course came to me which was

2749
02:00:52,029 --> 02:00:55,988
well why don't they use this on other

2750
02:00:54,069 --> 02:00:58,210
oil spills and different things like in

2751
02:00:55,988 --> 02:01:00,039
the water you know and I and I remember

2752
02:00:58,210 --> 02:01:02,439
saying that to him and he's like I don't

2753
02:01:00,039 --> 02:01:05,590
know he's like but you know I work with

2754
02:01:02,439 --> 02:01:08,229
the EPA EPA sometimes and it seemed like

2755
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:09,940
it was a technology that was easy he

2756
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:12,039
could make a lot of it but there was a

2757
02:01:09,939 --> 02:01:14,888
lot of control and different elements

2758
02:01:12,039 --> 02:01:18,670
and agencies between the source and you

2759
02:01:14,889 --> 02:01:21,368
know reality and and you know bio

2760
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:24,940
products today it's it's kind of a

2761
02:01:21,368 --> 02:01:26,710
unique thing like there's a there's a

2762
02:01:24,939 --> 02:01:28,178
there's a fifth row law out there and

2763
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:33,368
there's so many crazy different things

2764
02:01:28,179 --> 02:01:35,429
that you know for for the EPA and how

2765
02:01:33,368 --> 02:01:38,408
they do their system it's like you know

2766
02:01:35,429 --> 02:01:42,190
if you're if you're a chemical it's

2767
02:01:38,408 --> 02:01:44,729
really easy to get passed through right

2768
02:01:42,189 --> 02:01:48,309
if you're if you're a natural product

2769
02:01:44,729 --> 02:01:49,629
that's not true but it's still it can it

2770
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:52,150
can be somewhat of a different process

2771
02:01:49,630 --> 02:01:54,969
so there's so many like Adi does try to

2772
02:01:52,149 --> 02:01:56,979
get rid of chemicals no quickly but not

2773
02:01:54,969 --> 02:01:59,349
I think he's referring to EPA

2774
02:01:56,979 --> 02:02:01,388
registration registration of an active

2775
02:01:59,349 --> 02:02:03,670
ingredient what you're saying is that

2776
02:02:01,389 --> 02:02:06,010
there's different through a chemical

2777
02:02:03,670 --> 02:02:07,840
than it is to read you're a biological

2778
02:02:06,010 --> 02:02:09,940
so I do have some experience in this one

2779
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:12,460
what I can tell you is that they have a

2780
02:02:09,939 --> 02:02:16,210
candidate to worry I have pesticides and

2781
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:19,420
bio pesticides are things like bacteria

2782
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:21,039
probiotics things like that um and you

2783
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:23,889
get those registered you still have to

2784
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:26,560
go through the same straw but the the

2785
02:02:23,889 --> 02:02:29,679
difficult thing about a bio pesticide is

2786
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:31,949
really the the production and the

2787
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:34,359
consistency of it and being able to

2788
02:02:31,948 --> 02:02:36,789
categorize it because you have to sort

2789
02:02:34,359 --> 02:02:38,529
of register what the active ingredient

2790
02:02:36,789 --> 02:02:42,130
is and obviously I mean this is a

2791
02:02:38,529 --> 02:02:46,420
biological thing it's not necessarily

2792
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:48,699
like a fungicide where there is like an

2793
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:51,190
active ingredient that's formulated at a

2794
02:02:48,698 --> 02:02:53,439
certain percentage that's right that's

2795
02:02:51,189 --> 02:02:55,750
grass for them it's easier to kind of

2796
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:58,329
understand because they know what the

2797
02:02:55,750 --> 02:03:01,539
toxicity of that one ingredient on us

2798
02:02:58,329 --> 02:03:02,920
other crap and starters that's in the

2799
02:03:01,539 --> 02:03:04,840
formulation really has nothing to do

2800
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:07,359
with it and it's just that single active

2801
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:10,239
ingredient and in that respect you're

2802
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:12,098
right it's clear that they can that

2803
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:14,049
active ingredient based on the safety

2804
02:03:12,099 --> 02:03:17,039
and the efficacy of that where with a

2805
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:20,440
biological it's a little bit more

2806
02:03:17,039 --> 02:03:21,880
you know I used the analogy throwing

2807
02:03:20,439 --> 02:03:27,009
sand down at the beach

2808
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:30,550
a biological additive into a

2809
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:34,929
pre-existing biological system it's

2810
02:03:30,550 --> 02:03:37,719
really hard in a way to your your

2811
02:03:34,929 --> 02:03:39,399
efficacy in terms of like a active

2812
02:03:37,719 --> 02:03:41,980
ingredient level like you would if it

2813
02:03:39,399 --> 02:03:44,799
were a single active ingredient or let's

2814
02:03:41,979 --> 02:03:47,589
forget about agrochemicals just think

2815
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:49,869
about aspirin right aspirins efficacy in

2816
02:03:47,590 --> 02:03:52,569
the human body is directly correlated to

2817
02:03:49,869 --> 02:03:55,738
the dose of aspirin you get right so the

2818
02:03:52,569 --> 02:03:59,859
dose of your product that's effective is

2819
02:03:55,738 --> 02:04:02,709
going to be really a it's just gonna be

2820
02:03:59,859 --> 02:04:05,589
a little bit more difficult to

2821
02:04:02,710 --> 02:04:07,600
characterize if it were a single

2822
02:04:05,590 --> 02:04:09,640
ingredient which were just happens to be

2823
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:11,770
a chemical that's exactly right but I

2824
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:15,880
think the thing with with biological

2825
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:17,770
control and as far as I know we are

2826
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:20,619
actually part of a team that registered

2827
02:04:17,770 --> 02:04:23,020
a insect repellent underneath the FIFRA

2828
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:25,750
guidelines of oath what is a bio

2829
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:27,880
pesticide so it was based on a plant oil

2830
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:32,710
we chemically modified a plant oil and

2831
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:34,779
we created this new insect repellent we

2832
02:04:32,710 --> 02:04:38,319
still had to get it tested for both

2833
02:04:34,779 --> 02:04:41,710
efficacy and human safety and it turns

2834
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:44,679
out the human safety tests alone just to

2835
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:46,719
warrant bringing that package to the

2836
02:04:44,679 --> 02:04:48,969
Environmental Protection Agency who then

2837
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:51,130
is gonna look at it and say okay based

2838
02:04:48,969 --> 02:04:53,619
on your safety based on your use rate

2839
02:04:51,130 --> 02:04:55,900
based on how this is manufactured we

2840
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:58,539
grant you a registration to sell that

2841
02:04:55,899 --> 02:05:01,509
product right and so that's the really

2842
02:04:58,539 --> 02:05:05,679
high expensive hurdle that you typically

2843
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:09,039
need to have some big-ass company take

2844
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:11,199
the expense on and be able to do all the

2845
02:05:09,039 --> 02:05:13,960
talk studies and be able to do like what

2846
02:05:11,198 --> 02:05:15,639
is the impact not just on the soil which

2847
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:19,000
is where your product comes in contact

2848
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:21,760
but what's the impact systemically on

2849
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,738
other things that could be affected when

2850
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:25,300
your products administered I mean I

2851
02:05:23,738 --> 02:05:27,039
think it's a great thing what you're

2852
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:29,380
doing Peter and I think it's going to be

2853
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:30,038
difficult for the EPA to get their arms

2854
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:32,559
around

2855
02:05:30,038 --> 02:05:35,259
registering stuff for cannabis use and

2856
02:05:32,559 --> 02:05:39,279
especially for you know in light of this

2857
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:41,309
latest thing from from the EPA from from

2858
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:44,168
Scott Pruett where he basically is just

2859
02:05:41,309 --> 02:05:45,519
taking the the position of oh this is

2860
02:05:44,168 --> 02:05:48,338
going to enable the cannabis industry

2861
02:05:45,519 --> 02:05:50,019
which is federally illegal so BAM we're

2862
02:05:48,338 --> 02:05:52,269
not going to give anyone registrations

2863
02:05:50,019 --> 02:05:54,309
for anything having to do with this and

2864
02:05:52,269 --> 02:05:57,729
this doesn't help the industry it

2865
02:05:54,309 --> 02:06:00,489
doesn't really help to make that kind of

2866
02:05:57,729 --> 02:06:03,239
decision so but I'm just to go back to

2867
02:06:00,488 --> 02:06:06,578
your notion the bio

2868
02:06:03,238 --> 02:06:10,838
ethical means to control I think is

2869
02:06:06,578 --> 02:06:12,698
gonna be what we're gonna rely on it

2870
02:06:10,838 --> 02:06:15,729
it's what like if you look at the list

2871
02:06:12,698 --> 02:06:17,348
of what's a lot in Colorado and it's the

2872
02:06:15,729 --> 02:06:19,479
same list as what's allowed in

2873
02:06:17,349 --> 02:06:23,019
Washington and order you know it's

2874
02:06:19,479 --> 02:06:25,809
basically the minimum use rate sort of

2875
02:06:23,019 --> 02:06:27,159
pesticides minimum you know advocacy I

2876
02:06:25,809 --> 02:06:29,260
mean they don't really have a whole lot

2877
02:06:27,158 --> 02:06:31,868
of efficacy you know work very well some

2878
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:33,760
of them are biological control agents I

2879
02:06:31,868 --> 02:06:36,698
think what your company is looking to do

2880
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:38,378
is improve on that from the roots down

2881
02:06:36,698 --> 02:06:41,469
to me that's a much much better

2882
02:06:38,378 --> 02:06:43,358
application than say applying something

2883
02:06:41,469 --> 02:06:45,760
to the vascular system of the plant

2884
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:48,909
itself one of the one of the things that

2885
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:51,189
a lot of people microbots that point in

2886
02:06:48,908 --> 02:06:55,118
robot and is that if you're making

2887
02:06:51,189 --> 02:06:57,639
compost tea right so you are are you

2888
02:06:55,118 --> 02:06:59,948
have you've created an aerobic beautiful

2889
02:06:57,639 --> 02:07:03,069
houmous compost i know how to do it I've

2890
02:06:59,948 --> 02:07:09,428
made gorgeous composts there's still

2891
02:07:03,069 --> 02:07:12,489
gonna be pockets that are unaccompanied

2892
02:07:09,429 --> 02:07:15,248
create a tea there are some some very

2893
02:07:12,488 --> 02:07:19,298
small microscopic pockets that uh that

2894
02:07:15,248 --> 02:07:21,639
are gonna possess undecomposed pathogens

2895
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:23,618
so as you as you create a compost tea

2896
02:07:21,639 --> 02:07:25,659
you have to be really careful that your

2897
02:07:23,618 --> 02:07:28,179
your good guys or higher than your bad

2898
02:07:25,658 --> 02:07:31,118
guys and that's really where where our

2899
02:07:28,179 --> 02:07:33,338
product comes in we got to get really

2900
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:36,448
high amounts of good guys so that the

2901
02:07:33,338 --> 02:07:39,788
bad guys don't have a chance to you know

2902
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:42,788
infect you so we're not a we're not a we

2903
02:07:39,788 --> 02:07:43,509
make no claims as any type of a bio

2904
02:07:42,788 --> 02:07:45,429
fungicide

2905
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:47,980
a pesticide or any of that we we've

2906
02:07:45,429 --> 02:07:50,260
never even tested for that we we don't

2907
02:07:47,979 --> 02:07:53,038
know if our product works on that all we

2908
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:57,190
do know is that the health is

2909
02:07:53,038 --> 02:07:59,349
exponentially enhanced when you know you

2910
02:07:57,189 --> 02:08:01,178
have just a ton of good guys I mean

2911
02:07:59,349 --> 02:08:03,038
that's what organic growers are finding

2912
02:08:01,179 --> 02:08:04,779
all over the country so we've done is

2913
02:08:03,038 --> 02:08:08,109
we've taken those same good guys that

2914
02:08:04,779 --> 02:08:10,719
are conducive ly found on the roots of

2915
02:08:08,109 --> 02:08:12,549
those soils and those healthy you know

2916
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:15,250
plants that that just are healthy and

2917
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:16,599
we've just increased them and we're

2918
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:17,800
adding them to the cannabis plant and

2919
02:08:16,599 --> 02:08:19,239
larger number so they're the same

2920
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:21,369
strains that you could just pull right

2921
02:08:19,238 --> 02:08:23,558
out of the soil you can eat them you

2922
02:08:21,368 --> 02:08:27,279
know and and and from that from the

2923
02:08:23,559 --> 02:08:29,288
EPA's standpoint you know they're okay

2924
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:30,788
with that right now so mycorrhizae but

2925
02:08:29,288 --> 02:08:33,460
bacillus subtilis all these strains

2926
02:08:30,788 --> 02:08:35,500
they're getting out there and and people

2927
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:38,529
are starting to really see the benefit

2928
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:40,569
of adding probiotics to their plants

2929
02:08:38,529 --> 02:08:43,689
just like we do our own bodies and

2930
02:08:40,569 --> 02:08:45,250
believe it or not as you do that a lot

2931
02:08:43,689 --> 02:08:48,518
of the strains and what they'll create

2932
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:51,899
will actually enhance the natural

2933
02:08:48,519 --> 02:08:54,280
strains that are found in that that

2934
02:08:51,899 --> 02:08:57,698
environment that you're cultivating in

2935
02:08:54,279 --> 02:08:59,229
you know it's almost like one talks to

2936
02:08:57,698 --> 02:09:00,939
the other and they all kind of come come

2937
02:08:59,229 --> 02:09:06,038
alive again and they're there they're

2938
02:09:00,939 --> 02:09:10,558
ready and so that's just a absolute lot

2939
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:13,268
to do with the minimal capacity of a lot

2940
02:09:10,559 --> 02:09:15,760
more holding capacity and what you're

2941
02:09:13,269 --> 02:09:19,179
doing is you're populating the biome

2942
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:23,349
down there that again creates as well as

2943
02:09:19,179 --> 02:09:25,328
it consumes and so now I totally believe

2944
02:09:23,349 --> 02:09:26,980
in the approach you're taking in you

2945
02:09:25,328 --> 02:09:30,250
know wish you all the best in trying to

2946
02:09:26,979 --> 02:09:32,828
get these products distributed real

2947
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:34,630
quick in districts yeah so that's been

2948
02:09:32,828 --> 02:09:36,429
kind of the interesting thing I'm really

2949
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:38,319
trying to keep the price low I mean

2950
02:09:36,429 --> 02:09:42,250
that's that's the goal with this thing

2951
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:44,259
like I'm trying to stick to our roots

2952
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:45,939
which is to be able to give this product

2953
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:48,309
to the cannabis cultivator at an

2954
02:09:45,939 --> 02:09:54,178
affordable price we're not here to you

2955
02:09:48,309 --> 02:09:55,429
know rape the market or or like you know

2956
02:09:54,179 --> 02:09:57,618
take

2957
02:09:55,429 --> 02:09:59,840
Vantage of the margins that you guys are

2958
02:09:57,618 --> 02:10:01,458
making you know I studied the industry I

2959
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:05,719
know that the margins aren't epic you

2960
02:10:01,458 --> 02:10:08,510
know so we're not here to you know but

2961
02:10:05,719 --> 02:10:11,179
we are here to utilize the connection

2962
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:13,070
that you guys have and the fact that you

2963
02:10:11,179 --> 02:10:15,170
guys believe can believe in the biology

2964
02:10:13,069 --> 02:10:18,618
because you can see it so well within

2965
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:20,748
your tripping profile and so so for us

2966
02:10:18,618 --> 02:10:23,509
we know we're gonna grow we're gonna be

2967
02:10:20,748 --> 02:10:25,849
able to get the product out on its own

2968
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:28,039
accord because of the efficacy I mean in

2969
02:10:25,849 --> 02:10:31,489
30 days you can see what this product

2970
02:10:28,038 --> 02:10:34,969
will do I mean it'll be a parent and

2971
02:10:31,488 --> 02:10:37,938
with that being said once we once we're

2972
02:10:34,969 --> 02:10:41,029
able to get enough people and and good

2973
02:10:37,939 --> 02:10:43,130
growers and you know good energies

2974
02:10:41,029 --> 02:10:44,920
involved in this it'll just naturally

2975
02:10:43,130 --> 02:10:47,300
spread and and a lot of those

2976
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:50,149
distribution channels and business and

2977
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:52,788
economic models you know hopefully we'll

2978
02:10:50,149 --> 02:10:55,998
be able to circumvent a lot of that and

2979
02:10:52,788 --> 02:10:57,978
price low if I grow big I'm gonna try

2980
02:10:55,998 --> 02:10:59,630
and keep this price even lower you know

2981
02:10:57,979 --> 02:11:02,090
so that he gets out even more and more

2982
02:10:59,630 --> 02:11:04,719
and more because adding life to the soil

2983
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:07,670
is is conducive to our long-term

2984
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:09,498
sustainment so my job is to give and I

2985
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:10,998
want to align with other givers it's how

2986
02:11:09,498 --> 02:11:12,469
I was raised maybe I was raised by an

2987
02:11:10,998 --> 02:11:16,130
Italian mother taught me to just give

2988
02:11:12,469 --> 02:11:17,748
you know but that's that's how I do it

2989
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:20,118
and that's how I hope the people that I

2990
02:11:17,748 --> 02:11:22,639
align with will give will pay it forward

2991
02:11:20,118 --> 02:11:25,368
and and and there won't be just one

2992
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:27,199
channel of energy it will be an

2993
02:11:25,368 --> 02:11:29,808
awareness where we all realize we are

2994
02:11:27,198 --> 02:11:31,188
that light and if we grasp onto it and

2995
02:11:29,809 --> 02:11:33,288
continue to give and take care of our

2996
02:11:31,189 --> 02:11:38,209
plants and virtue our environment will

2997
02:11:33,288 --> 02:11:41,118
be here forever for a long time and will

2998
02:11:38,208 --> 02:11:41,779
and we will have a light beacon shine in

2999
02:11:41,118 --> 02:11:43,728
this galaxy

3000
02:11:41,779 --> 02:11:45,139
you know if we're able to really heal

3001
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:47,780
and nurture that environment with

3002
02:11:45,139 --> 02:11:49,849
compassion we all want to do that we

3003
02:11:47,779 --> 02:11:52,488
just need the tools to do it and the

3004
02:11:49,849 --> 02:11:55,550
tools that we have you know have been

3005
02:11:52,488 --> 02:11:58,819
involved right now and we're finding

3006
02:11:55,550 --> 02:12:01,070
that they're not working very well hey I

3007
02:11:58,819 --> 02:12:02,779
wanted to welcome chimera to the room he

3008
02:12:01,069 --> 02:12:04,880
popped in a little while ago and it's

3009
02:12:02,779 --> 02:12:06,859
been nice and quiet not to disturb him

3010
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:08,659
how you doing there chimera not too bad

3011
02:12:06,859 --> 02:12:11,420
excellent conversation really great con

3012
02:12:08,659 --> 02:12:16,099
rebuke Peter thank you camera yeah

3013
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:19,190
really cool so camera just got back from

3014
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:24,829
the event out in what was at the ice ers

3015
02:12:19,189 --> 02:12:29,299
or the i-r-s see ers have annoyed

3016
02:12:24,829 --> 02:12:31,329
Research Society they have a conference

3017
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:34,460
every year with all the top minds in the

3018
02:12:31,329 --> 02:12:37,699
from the neuroscience field that are

3019
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:39,770
studying cannabinoid receptors and how

3020
02:12:37,699 --> 02:12:41,239
you know how the cannabinoid receptors

3021
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:43,900
and all the different all the entire

3022
02:12:41,239 --> 02:12:46,939
endocannabinoid system really works and

3023
02:12:43,899 --> 02:12:50,479
so it's a lot of it's a lot of synthetic

3024
02:12:46,939 --> 02:12:54,649
compounds and my studies and all that

3025
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:58,309
kind of everything but they also look at

3026
02:12:54,649 --> 02:12:59,899
you know cannabis a little bit or as

3027
02:12:58,310 --> 02:13:01,670
many really big talks on cannabis there

3028
02:12:59,899 --> 02:13:04,069
was a bunch of posters on cannabis and

3029
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:07,730
then mark where and you know all those

3030
02:13:04,069 --> 02:13:09,500
folks did some presentations on all the

3031
02:13:07,729 --> 02:13:10,609
human studies that are being done so

3032
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:14,779
it's it's really interesting

3033
02:13:10,609 --> 02:13:16,309
conference people don't typically they

3034
02:13:14,779 --> 02:13:17,960
ask you not to share the info because

3035
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:20,180
it's such a small community what what it

3036
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:21,710
is is people you know they all get

3037
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:23,480
together in their shape they share their

3038
02:13:21,710 --> 02:13:26,210
data before it gets published and that

3039
02:13:23,479 --> 02:13:31,609
helps kind of self peer review the

3040
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:32,600
community but you know they don't people

3041
02:13:31,609 --> 02:13:34,189
don't really like it when you share

3042
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:35,539
their their info but I did get

3043
02:13:34,189 --> 02:13:41,599
permission from one of the groups to

3044
02:13:35,539 --> 02:13:43,939
share something awesome so yeah how you

3045
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:45,530
guys all do it doing pretty good you

3046
02:13:43,939 --> 02:13:48,289
know it's been a pretty good

3047
02:13:45,529 --> 02:13:51,949
conversation about bacteria and terpenes

3048
02:13:48,289 --> 02:13:54,439
and Sam had a really good sort of point

3049
02:13:51,949 --> 02:13:56,869
talking about the sin face and you know

3050
02:13:54,439 --> 02:13:58,159
whether if the synthase isn't there you

3051
02:13:56,869 --> 02:13:59,750
you know you're not going to get that

3052
02:13:58,159 --> 02:14:01,970
particular production of that this

3053
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:03,680
cannabinoid or that terpene maybe

3054
02:14:01,970 --> 02:14:06,440
another conversation for another day you

3055
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:09,320
might want to be a part of y'all have to

3056
02:14:06,439 --> 02:14:14,299
review what he said so I know the

3057
02:14:09,319 --> 02:14:15,979
conversation absolutely so this one of

3058
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:18,220
you guys can actually see the screen I'm

3059
02:14:15,979 --> 02:14:20,389
sharing at this point in time oh yeah

3060
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:21,530
okay so we just try and make it nice and

3061
02:14:20,390 --> 02:14:23,950
big actually I'm gonna go about this

3062
02:14:21,529 --> 02:14:23,949
different

3063
02:14:24,099 --> 02:14:27,199
so there's a company called nae pro

3064
02:14:26,179 --> 02:14:30,679
research they're based down in

3065
02:14:27,198 --> 02:14:33,678
California and they do support for

3066
02:14:30,679 --> 02:14:34,908
cultivators and dispensaries and some

3067
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:37,039
people might know of a company called

3068
02:14:34,908 --> 02:14:40,729
fight X which is Ethan Rio sales company

3069
02:14:37,039 --> 02:14:42,649
and they they approached this whole

3070
02:14:40,729 --> 02:14:44,689
terpene thing trying to figure out a

3071
02:14:42,649 --> 02:14:47,629
terpene classes it was it was mentioned

3072
02:14:44,689 --> 02:14:49,729
briefly on church last week so I just

3073
02:14:47,630 --> 02:14:52,578
wanted to put up the analytical method

3074
02:14:49,729 --> 02:14:53,658
that they used some people have an

3075
02:14:52,578 --> 02:14:57,738
understanding and they can go and look

3076
02:14:53,658 --> 02:14:59,029
it up and you know see that this is the

3077
02:14:57,738 --> 02:15:00,888
this is the method here that they use

3078
02:14:59,029 --> 02:15:04,929
that for all the all the work that's

3079
02:15:00,889 --> 02:15:07,310
going to follow hmm

3080
02:15:04,929 --> 02:15:09,050
it's called a development of about and

3081
02:15:07,310 --> 02:15:10,520
validation of a reliable and robust

3082
02:15:09,050 --> 02:15:14,270
method for the analysis of cannabinoids

3083
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:17,360
and terpenoids I'm familiar with this

3084
02:15:14,270 --> 02:15:21,020
paper great yeah it's a great paper it's

3085
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:24,189
really easy it's really the first paper

3086
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:26,150
where they showed a very you know

3087
02:15:24,189 --> 02:15:28,129
laborious method for actually

3088
02:15:26,149 --> 02:15:31,098
quantifying terpenes the way that we

3089
02:15:28,130 --> 02:15:32,779
quantify cannabinoids a lot of the

3090
02:15:31,099 --> 02:15:34,940
previous works were I don't know mark

3091
02:15:32,779 --> 02:15:36,340
shall dawn might care to comment on this

3092
02:15:34,939 --> 02:15:39,678
but I think there are really more

3093
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:42,679
approximations well we were doing pretty

3094
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:46,760
much what they did and we were doing it

3095
02:15:42,679 --> 02:15:52,010
20 years earlier we were using the GCF

3096
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:53,840
ID to determine terpene yes the

3097
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:57,739
statistical robustness of this

3098
02:15:53,840 --> 02:16:00,380
particular paper is pretty solid and

3099
02:15:57,738 --> 02:16:04,939
yeah I guess my comment was predicated

3100
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:08,179
on the fact that terpene analysis in

3101
02:16:04,939 --> 02:16:09,919
cannabis has been done for you know more

3102
02:16:08,179 --> 02:16:11,960
over than half a century now so I mean

3103
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:14,149
the first people to look at it you know

3104
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:16,489
where it was early on just to sort of do

3105
02:16:14,149 --> 02:16:18,859
it in a very descriptive way but then it

3106
02:16:16,488 --> 02:16:21,379
was actually you know isolated and

3107
02:16:18,859 --> 02:16:25,279
things were fractionated and Inter pians

3108
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:29,840
were sort of you know became more

3109
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:31,880
prevalent I guess when Ethan and others

3110
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:35,119
started looking at the the so-called

3111
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:37,949
entourage effect

3112
02:16:35,119 --> 02:16:40,199
right and I think what since this

3113
02:16:37,949 --> 02:16:43,460
analysis method apart is that it was the

3114
02:16:40,199 --> 02:16:47,279
really the first method to robustly

3115
02:16:43,459 --> 02:16:49,738
quantify terpenes you know per milligram

3116
02:16:47,279 --> 02:16:53,069
in a sample would you say that's true

3117
02:16:49,738 --> 02:16:55,349
mark mm-hmm yeah maybe yeah at that

3118
02:16:53,068 --> 02:16:57,388
would statistics statistically valid

3119
02:16:55,349 --> 02:17:00,988
yeah yeah because people have measured

3120
02:16:57,388 --> 02:17:02,879
again I go back to the papers from the

3121
02:17:00,988 --> 02:17:04,679
mid-70s where people did measure that

3122
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:06,929
but you know this is just more

3123
02:17:04,679 --> 02:17:10,710
statistically robust on modern

3124
02:17:06,929 --> 02:17:15,568
fermentation and you reviewed by a more

3125
02:17:10,709 --> 02:17:19,678
knowledgeable peer I agree this is that

3126
02:17:15,568 --> 02:17:21,808
it'll have to agree also because 20

3127
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:24,808
years ago this is basically the

3128
02:17:21,808 --> 02:17:27,629
methodology we were using but and the

3129
02:17:24,808 --> 02:17:31,018
reason we came to that conclusion was by

3130
02:17:27,629 --> 02:17:35,339
talking to the very top people in the

3131
02:17:31,019 --> 02:17:36,988
field of terpene analysis being done

3132
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:39,869
with cannabis mmm-hmm

3133
02:17:36,988 --> 02:17:43,439
and when they carried it out to this end

3134
02:17:39,869 --> 02:17:47,479
and published in 2005 yeah they came to

3135
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:50,158
a very similar conclusion absolutely

3136
02:17:47,478 --> 02:17:52,408
yeah I've seen this one too this this is

3137
02:17:50,158 --> 02:17:54,420
it does give you the quantified of like

3138
02:17:52,408 --> 02:17:56,578
milligrams it and everything interesting

3139
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:59,248
so this page is good it's good we all

3140
02:17:56,578 --> 02:18:01,439
agree this paper is to help is this

3141
02:17:59,248 --> 02:18:04,619
going to be like the method that labs in

3142
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:09,510
the future will will use to know it's

3143
02:18:04,619 --> 02:18:11,340
what they should use Yeah right that's

3144
02:18:09,510 --> 02:18:14,189
one method yeah these things always

3145
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:16,889
develop over time but the one of the

3146
02:18:14,189 --> 02:18:20,300
interesting thing in headspace analysis

3147
02:18:16,888 --> 02:18:22,858
algorithms into the nut modern cannabis

3148
02:18:20,299 --> 02:18:25,349
instrumentation that's being sold these

3149
02:18:22,859 --> 02:18:27,809
are shimasu instruments but both shimasu

3150
02:18:25,349 --> 02:18:31,109
and Agilent instruments do make

3151
02:18:27,808 --> 02:18:33,238
basically the same the thing that

3152
02:18:31,109 --> 02:18:34,769
measured it's basically the volatile so

3153
02:18:33,238 --> 02:18:37,049
if you're gonna be measuring either a

3154
02:18:34,769 --> 02:18:39,210
sample if you're rejecting it or if

3155
02:18:37,049 --> 02:18:41,818
you're just measuring headspace I think

3156
02:18:39,209 --> 02:18:43,498
headspace is really cool if you can do a

3157
02:18:41,818 --> 02:18:45,238
temperature ramp especially with hash

3158
02:18:43,498 --> 02:18:48,010
because you can look look to see what

3159
02:18:45,238 --> 02:18:50,318
kind of volatilization of the terpenes

3160
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:52,090
actually getting because you know that

3161
02:18:50,318 --> 02:18:55,659
you know everything that goes through a

3162
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:57,279
GC is being heated up and so there is

3163
02:18:55,659 --> 02:18:58,779
some chemistry that could happen at

3164
02:18:57,279 --> 02:19:01,599
these temperatures with these fragile

3165
02:18:58,779 --> 02:19:03,609
molecules yeah and I've got something

3166
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:07,750
else to talk about on that topic they

3167
02:19:03,609 --> 02:19:10,840
also tested headspace analysis and found

3168
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:13,478
it appropriate for if you want to

3169
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:18,429
determine what your terpene percentages

3170
02:19:13,478 --> 02:19:20,438
and profiles are yeah I was thinking

3171
02:19:18,429 --> 02:19:23,260
kind of like what what Marcus and I have

3172
02:19:20,439 --> 02:19:25,750
discussed in previous episodes with the

3173
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:30,609
serfs so if you wanted to like multiple

3174
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:32,620
eyes off of like a titanium versus a you

3175
02:19:30,609 --> 02:19:36,130
know ceramic versus the different types

3176
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:39,309
of impact on what the headspace

3177
02:19:36,129 --> 02:19:42,638
molecules can be just because of the

3178
02:19:39,308 --> 02:19:45,188
different yeah you know clean services

3179
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:47,259
whether or not it's there's a few

3180
02:19:45,189 --> 02:19:51,850
differences it would be interesting to

3181
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:54,609
determine what those are yeah absolutely

3182
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:57,159
absolutely you know just like when I

3183
02:19:54,609 --> 02:19:58,960
make water hash certain terpenes stay

3184
02:19:57,159 --> 02:20:01,090
present right till the end and they're

3185
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:03,148
profound and they're loud and other ones

3186
02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:07,299
get washed away in the water

3187
02:20:03,148 --> 02:20:09,369
it would be interesting to see if there

3188
02:20:07,299 --> 02:20:12,728
are certain terpenes that are more

3189
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:15,340
easily preserved from surface he markets

3190
02:20:12,728 --> 02:20:19,209
to to taste you know versus other ones

3191
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:21,189
that go ahead ever so this is kind of

3192
02:20:19,209 --> 02:20:25,469
goes back to that cannabinoid water

3193
02:20:21,189 --> 02:20:28,270
thing has anyone tested their hash water

3194
02:20:25,469 --> 02:20:30,219
for you know what trace amounts of

3195
02:20:28,270 --> 02:20:32,979
cannabinoids or terpenes might be in

3196
02:20:30,219 --> 02:20:37,478
there and is there a product concept

3197
02:20:32,978 --> 02:20:39,608
around you know spent water from hashing

3198
02:20:37,478 --> 02:20:40,898
operations that could be I'm not

3199
02:20:39,609 --> 02:20:42,550
thinking about maybe for a human

3200
02:20:40,898 --> 02:20:44,709
consumable but we were talking about a

3201
02:20:42,549 --> 02:20:48,188
little bit on the facebook chat which

3202
02:20:44,709 --> 02:20:50,528
was maybe putting it into animal feed in

3203
02:20:48,189 --> 02:20:54,068
animal food because it's giving him some

3204
02:20:50,529 --> 02:20:56,880
sort of phytochemical extract fraction

3205
02:20:54,068 --> 02:20:59,949
god knows what the hell's in there but I

3206
02:20:56,879 --> 02:21:01,459
would say this much without being you

3207
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:03,320
know even having a sign

3208
02:21:01,459 --> 02:21:06,228
degree without knowing much about much

3209
02:21:03,319 --> 02:21:08,119
any old human you know especially if you

3210
02:21:06,228 --> 02:21:11,269
have a fondness for cannabis if you

3211
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:12,490
smell the cold bubble water and even

3212
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:19,670
taste it

3213
02:21:12,489 --> 02:21:22,549
it's just good long conversation the

3214
02:21:19,670 --> 02:21:26,180
other day space and I'm just drinking

3215
02:21:22,549 --> 02:21:28,189
the water and just drink the water that

3216
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:29,960
comes out of it it'll give you you know

3217
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:33,020
different rinses the first rinse versus

3218
02:21:29,959 --> 02:21:36,228
the second have you ever tested to see

3219
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:38,180
like how much cannabinoids I mean be

3220
02:21:36,228 --> 02:21:42,289
that cannabinoids are not water-soluble

3221
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:46,100
but that's a matter of well it depends

3222
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:48,800
if we're looking at ppb and ppm levels

3223
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:51,979
can we find cannabinoids because this

3224
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:55,039
cannabinoid water that is being sold for

3225
02:21:51,978 --> 02:21:57,969
60 bucks a case I you know again if you

3226
02:21:55,040 --> 02:22:01,910
do the calculation and try to figure out

3227
02:21:57,969 --> 02:22:04,819
they would have to drink of that water

3228
02:22:01,909 --> 02:22:07,430
to get like an efficacious dose for like

3229
02:22:04,819 --> 02:22:10,459
an epilepsy patient right it would be

3230
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:14,090
like a train car full of water I mean

3231
02:22:10,459 --> 02:22:17,389
there's there's not enough cannabinoid

3232
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:19,370
in some of those now the questions aside

3233
02:22:17,389 --> 02:22:23,930
on whether or not that actually has some

3234
02:22:19,370 --> 02:22:26,150
type of you know homeopathic biological

3235
02:22:23,930 --> 02:22:28,639
efficacy in the body when you're just

3236
02:22:26,149 --> 02:22:31,069
drinking water that has trace amounts of

3237
02:22:28,639 --> 02:22:33,949
well AB annoyed let me let me say this

3238
02:22:31,069 --> 02:22:36,559
mark now recently Tony sent me the

3239
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:41,390
terpene sugars and the terpene syrups

3240
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:43,309
and I guess I put a glass full of water

3241
02:22:41,389 --> 02:22:45,319
and tried the terpene syrup and put a

3242
02:22:43,309 --> 02:22:47,899
little of the the xylitol the turqu

3243
02:22:45,319 --> 02:22:49,369
sugar as he calls it in there and he's

3244
02:22:47,899 --> 02:22:51,529
like yeah I have a sip I'm like oh yeah

3245
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:53,840
wow that's tasty well yeah it kind of

3246
02:22:51,530 --> 02:22:55,610
reminded me of bubble water to a degree

3247
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:59,030
other than the fact it was totally clean

3248
02:22:55,610 --> 02:23:02,000
and the way it dispersed was alien like

3249
02:22:59,030 --> 02:23:03,920
it was like what [ __ ] it's just like I

3250
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,270
dropped this syrup in and it just turned

3251
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:07,219
into these little worms and then the

3252
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:08,479
worms turned into blur and then all of a

3253
02:23:07,219 --> 02:23:11,059
sudden the water kind of was a little

3254
02:23:08,478 --> 02:23:13,340
foggy I was like that's [ __ ] trippy

3255
02:23:11,059 --> 02:23:14,520
anyway I tasted this [ __ ] I you know

3256
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:16,530
he's talking to me on the phone

3257
02:23:14,521 --> 02:23:19,650
oh that's neat oh yeah it tastes really

3258
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:23,940
good well I sit down at my desk and I'm

3259
02:23:19,649 --> 02:23:27,000
like hi okay

3260
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:28,771
I'm hot I'm like what the [ __ ] I'm like

3261
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,360
dude I almost feel like the way I feel

3262
02:23:28,771 --> 02:23:33,239
like when you heat mushrooms and you're

3263
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:35,579
not quite sure you know but you know

3264
02:23:33,239 --> 02:23:40,351
you're about to get there like it was a

3265
02:23:35,579 --> 02:23:42,840
climbing sort of like what's crazy about

3266
02:23:40,351 --> 02:23:45,120
that as we as far as the terpenes are

3267
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:48,060
conserved trying to find a way to get

3268
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:50,700
them to go into water the right way but

3269
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:54,000
without using as much to bring the price

3270
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:56,540
way down and not have any THC or CBD but

3271
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:59,129
then as we got to that pure level

3272
02:23:56,540 --> 02:24:01,050
something happens because it's like okay

3273
02:23:59,129 --> 02:24:02,939
well if terpenes are found in fruits and

3274
02:24:01,049 --> 02:24:05,039
vegetables and cannabis and they

3275
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:07,260
definitely play a significant part in

3276
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:08,820
our endocannabinoid system whatever

3277
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:13,319
they're turning on whatever they're

3278
02:24:08,819 --> 02:24:15,569
doing I found water was a very water or

3279
02:24:13,319 --> 02:24:18,750
liquids was a really good way was a

3280
02:24:15,569 --> 02:24:20,579
really good way have you ever tried

3281
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:21,989
before we get too deep into the

3282
02:24:20,579 --> 02:24:24,149
conversation I want to reiterate that

3283
02:24:21,989 --> 02:24:26,129
okay I'm not claiming the terpenes

3284
02:24:24,149 --> 02:24:28,681
themselves got me high I'm always

3285
02:24:26,129 --> 02:24:32,189
dabbing all day long so I had victim

3286
02:24:28,681 --> 02:24:34,431
tonight yeah I had dabbed fifteen or

3287
02:24:32,190 --> 02:24:36,420
twenty minutes prior but listen I

3288
02:24:34,431 --> 02:24:39,149
understand the feeling and the

3289
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:40,530
difference from that dab and then 15

3290
02:24:39,149 --> 02:24:42,869
minutes later drinking this Turkey and

3291
02:24:40,530 --> 02:24:44,280
water especially without any like he

3292
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:46,550
wasn't like oh how do you feel how do

3293
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:49,230
you feel I told him I was like dude I

3294
02:24:46,549 --> 02:24:50,909
feel high and he's like well you know we

3295
02:24:49,229 --> 02:24:52,439
talked about modulation I mean you're

3296
02:24:50,909 --> 02:24:54,959
obviously your body is full of

3297
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:57,060
cannabinoids right now don't you think

3298
02:24:54,959 --> 02:24:59,129
that there would and I didn't think that

3299
02:24:57,060 --> 02:25:01,500
there would be not the same way I smoke

3300
02:24:59,129 --> 02:25:04,049
and experience it yeah but maybe maybe

3301
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:06,450
[ __ ] it was undeniable in your

3302
02:25:04,049 --> 02:25:09,029
particular case the water soluble

3303
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:12,480
fraction unlocks something you know I

3304
02:25:09,030 --> 02:25:13,980
have no idea it's not that I did it go

3305
02:25:12,479 --> 02:25:15,629
ahead yeah I was just gonna say now the

3306
02:25:13,979 --> 02:25:19,619
water that we're talking about from the

3307
02:25:15,629 --> 02:25:21,119
hash there's a there's another market to

3308
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:22,860
it you know there's a there's a ever

3309
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:23,851
there's ever booming markets in

3310
02:25:22,860 --> 02:25:26,909
California what we're talking about

3311
02:25:23,851 --> 02:25:27,870
terpenes and fragrances and if he pulls

3312
02:25:26,909 --> 02:25:29,459
up that other chart

3313
02:25:27,870 --> 02:25:32,610
okay so you see so there was another

3314
02:25:29,459 --> 02:25:33,810
chart that chimera had that he didn't

3315
02:25:32,610 --> 02:25:36,900
want to show us it was like

3316
02:25:33,810 --> 02:25:41,729
color-coordinated maybe if you could

3317
02:25:36,899 --> 02:25:42,149
show us that one real quick yeah there

3318
02:25:41,729 --> 02:25:44,819
you go

3319
02:25:42,149 --> 02:25:47,729
well it's down a little bit oh he missed

3320
02:25:44,819 --> 02:25:49,020
it now there was another one there was a

3321
02:25:47,729 --> 02:25:50,489
different chart you had that you didn't

3322
02:25:49,021 --> 02:25:53,311
want to show us yet but this is good

3323
02:25:50,489 --> 02:25:55,440
enough this is fine so essentially

3324
02:25:53,310 --> 02:25:57,569
what's happening is like I you know it's

3325
02:25:55,440 --> 02:26:01,290
a Trader Joe's I got some water that had

3326
02:25:57,569 --> 02:26:04,760
like lemon and ginger natural flavoring

3327
02:26:01,290 --> 02:26:08,010
in water added the Jack Frost to it and

3328
02:26:04,760 --> 02:26:09,930
I tried the Jack Frost on its own in

3329
02:26:08,010 --> 02:26:13,380
water and then I tried it paired with

3330
02:26:09,930 --> 02:26:15,440
lemon and ginger okay which is you could

3331
02:26:13,379 --> 02:26:17,459
see the lemon that's on this chart and

3332
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:19,739
there was another different it was

3333
02:26:17,459 --> 02:26:21,359
another slightly different feeling so

3334
02:26:19,739 --> 02:26:22,949
and I didn't do it right away I tried

3335
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:26,000
them you know spaced out different

3336
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:29,130
different days so I can tell you that

3337
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,810
there is some something happening on a

3338
02:26:29,129 --> 02:26:33,299
level there it would be interesting to

3339
02:26:30,810 --> 02:26:35,369
pair it with probiotics and terpenes now

3340
02:26:33,299 --> 02:26:38,100
that we're talking about probiotics and

3341
02:26:35,370 --> 02:26:40,021
what what profound effects we could work

3342
02:26:38,101 --> 02:26:44,060
on in the gut for people that have leaky

3343
02:26:40,021 --> 02:26:48,989
gut IBS Crohn's poor digestive systems

3344
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:52,829
not functioning properly enzymes but you

3345
02:26:48,989 --> 02:26:55,469
know ultimately these the the the water

3346
02:26:52,829 --> 02:26:56,819
that's coming from the hash water will

3347
02:26:55,469 --> 02:26:58,560
have a different lots of different

3348
02:26:56,819 --> 02:27:00,989
markets so there's there's people

3349
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:03,329
selling rose water hydrosol sprays just

3350
02:27:00,989 --> 02:27:06,021
for your face like it's not it's not in

3351
02:27:03,329 --> 02:27:08,940
the men's industry as much but you know

3352
02:27:06,021 --> 02:27:11,940
somebody sprayed me with like a like a

3353
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:14,640
rose water with some kind of cannabis

3354
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:16,050
hydrosol in the face you know and I was

3355
02:27:14,639 --> 02:27:16,859
like oh that's really Pleasant you know

3356
02:27:16,049 --> 02:27:19,949
I was like a mist

3357
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:22,170
so there's definitely when you're

3358
02:27:19,950 --> 02:27:25,409
talking about not just drinking it but

3359
02:27:22,170 --> 02:27:27,299
definitely something in the hash water

3360
02:27:25,409 --> 02:27:29,129
that's fragrance it's it's really

3361
02:27:27,299 --> 02:27:30,689
Pleasant it's nice it could be used as

3362
02:27:29,129 --> 02:27:33,209
maybe bong water it could be used as a

3363
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:34,950
spray but I'm definitely going to the

3364
02:27:33,209 --> 02:27:37,589
next step that I'm going to do is test

3365
02:27:34,950 --> 02:27:39,329
the flower test the resin that's made

3366
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:41,850
from the flower with all of the microns

3367
02:27:39,329 --> 02:27:44,609
that have been separated dry the flower

3368
02:27:41,850 --> 02:27:46,949
out test that dried flower and then take

3369
02:27:44,609 --> 02:27:48,899
that water like you just said and test

3370
02:27:46,949 --> 02:27:50,908
that for cannabinoids and test that for

3371
02:27:48,898 --> 02:27:53,219
terpenes and then I'm going to vac

3372
02:27:50,908 --> 02:27:56,549
freeze that and try to separate the

3373
02:27:53,219 --> 02:27:58,528
water out and it's it there are people

3374
02:27:56,549 --> 02:27:59,879
that are boiling that with a sill but

3375
02:27:58,529 --> 02:28:01,890
I'm gonna try to do without any

3376
02:27:59,879 --> 02:28:03,688
temperatures and then I could test

3377
02:28:01,889 --> 02:28:06,809
everything and then maybe we would have

3378
02:28:03,689 --> 02:28:09,720
something a little bit I don't make

3379
02:28:06,809 --> 02:28:12,389
let's make some space for Ryan for a

3380
02:28:09,719 --> 02:28:15,599
second so he can yeah I mean something

3381
02:28:12,389 --> 02:28:19,978
yeah go for it they tied back to that

3382
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:24,180
but yes opening are you there Ryan he's

3383
02:28:19,978 --> 02:28:26,879
there he's opening opening well I think

3384
02:28:24,180 --> 02:28:30,270
it comes back to the lobby part I'll

3385
02:28:26,879 --> 02:28:31,738
call back and what the significance of

3386
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:34,590
whether his first opening conversation

3387
02:28:31,738 --> 02:28:36,299
was the testing factors you know so we

3388
02:28:34,590 --> 02:28:40,228
have to get an accurate way to test

3389
02:28:36,299 --> 02:28:42,090
these things and and really be have a

3390
02:28:40,228 --> 02:28:43,500
standard you know so that like Aaron

3391
02:28:42,090 --> 02:28:45,210
says oh that's you're using this

3392
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:50,068
equipment with this headspace with this

3393
02:28:45,209 --> 02:28:53,398
thing this is the standard these two the

3394
02:28:50,068 --> 02:28:58,618
two discussed in the paper the GCF ID

3395
02:28:53,398 --> 02:29:02,549
and the HPLC method that's a really good

3396
02:28:58,619 --> 02:29:05,850
start at that kind of a thing but it

3397
02:29:02,549 --> 02:29:10,709
would have to be widely used before it's

3398
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:12,119
a standardized method so yeah I know it

3399
02:29:10,709 --> 02:29:13,889
was a little bit drawn-out and like we

3400
02:29:12,119 --> 02:29:15,659
can tend to get a little bit distracted

3401
02:29:13,889 --> 02:29:16,799
but I just I hope you guys can just kind

3402
02:29:15,658 --> 02:29:18,689
of follow with me cuz I'm trying to

3403
02:29:16,799 --> 02:29:20,459
paint like a long story picture so that

3404
02:29:18,689 --> 02:29:22,318
you can see the whole process of how

3405
02:29:20,459 --> 02:29:24,000
these guys went about this work so

3406
02:29:22,318 --> 02:29:25,920
anyway this is the analytical method we

3407
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,260
talked about a little bit and they use

3408
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:30,988
it to generate a lab report format

3409
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:36,478
called the phyto fax okay so these here

3410
02:29:30,988 --> 02:29:39,809
are fight this is a spy no fax the phyto

3411
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:42,420
fax layout okay and there's a webpage

3412
02:29:39,809 --> 02:29:46,079
that's called fight Oh fax dot info and

3413
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:48,329
you can go and plug in like blue green

3414
02:29:46,079 --> 02:29:50,760
or P or you know some of these keywords

3415
02:29:48,329 --> 02:29:52,829
push and you'll start seeing all the

3416
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:55,290
final Prats final prints come up okay

3417
02:29:52,829 --> 02:29:56,309
though the final print is a really

3418
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:58,940
or the photo facts are really

3419
02:29:56,309 --> 02:30:01,529
interesting lab report format that

3420
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:03,450
provides information on you know

3421
02:30:01,530 --> 02:30:06,930
obviously flour samples and hatch

3422
02:30:03,450 --> 02:30:09,690
samples or even terpene samples and so

3423
02:30:06,930 --> 02:30:13,050
it consists of this bar graph on top

3424
02:30:09,690 --> 02:30:15,271
which shows your quantified levels of

3425
02:30:13,049 --> 02:30:17,909
cannabinoids terpenoids moisture content

3426
02:30:15,271 --> 02:30:19,680
hmm say you got see you actually you can

3427
02:30:17,909 --> 02:30:21,600
see that like this one is a twelve point

3428
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:24,360
three twelve point three six percent

3429
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:27,050
total cannabinoids one point three four

3430
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:29,930
percent total terpene complement and

3431
02:30:27,049 --> 02:30:33,149
it's just under seven percent moisture

3432
02:30:29,930 --> 02:30:36,090
the second part here is called what they

3433
02:30:33,149 --> 02:30:38,159
call the canna dial and it represents

3434
02:30:36,090 --> 02:30:40,829
the ratio of the top to terpene or the

3435
02:30:38,159 --> 02:30:44,159
top you cannabinoid sorry so in this

3436
02:30:40,829 --> 02:30:46,829
case it's the small sliver is CBG acid

3437
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:51,049
and the big piece of the pie is THC acid

3438
02:30:46,829 --> 02:30:54,389
okay then we go down at the bottom and

3439
02:30:51,049 --> 02:30:57,029
we've got which is essentially a terpene

3440
02:30:54,389 --> 02:31:00,389
fingerprint that's done based on color

3441
02:30:57,030 --> 02:31:02,250
and it's a really interesting way to

3442
02:31:00,389 --> 02:31:03,989
look at it I know when you first look at

3443
02:31:02,250 --> 02:31:05,639
it you don't really it doesn't make it

3444
02:31:03,989 --> 02:31:07,771
doesn't make a whole lot of sense but

3445
02:31:05,639 --> 02:31:10,439
eventually what happens is you learn the

3446
02:31:07,771 --> 02:31:12,180
colors of the terpenes yeah and you

3447
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:13,500
don't have to go back and read like you

3448
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:15,989
know you'll know that limonene for

3449
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:18,719
example is yellow right the Pennines are

3450
02:31:15,989 --> 02:31:21,420
green little all is this like purple

3451
02:31:18,719 --> 02:31:24,299
color and Meers through this lavender

3452
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:26,430
kind of color and miR seen is this more

3453
02:31:24,299 --> 02:31:28,529
dark maroon kind of color dude I love it

3454
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:36,210
they've taken a page out of the bubble

3455
02:31:28,530 --> 02:31:37,470
bag page but yeah you're right it's in

3456
02:31:36,209 --> 02:31:40,219
that same way that you know that the

3457
02:31:37,469 --> 02:31:43,079
color right the 73 is the yellow the 19

3458
02:31:40,219 --> 02:31:44,760
yeah you don't have to go and look it up

3459
02:31:43,079 --> 02:31:48,889
every time once you see the yellow bag

3460
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:51,960
you just know that's the 73 exactly so

3461
02:31:48,889 --> 02:31:53,449
you know it's not like SC labs format

3462
02:31:51,959 --> 02:31:56,639
where they have you know they actually

3463
02:31:53,450 --> 02:31:58,230
demonstrate 34 or 32 or whatever it is

3464
02:31:56,639 --> 02:32:00,930
terpenes on a graph

3465
02:31:58,229 --> 02:32:03,329
these guys are limited to 17 because the

3466
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:07,530
17 these 17 are all known to be

3467
02:32:03,329 --> 02:32:09,049
pharmacologically active for one but two

3468
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:10,970
they're also the most prevalent ones

3469
02:32:09,049 --> 02:32:14,329
appear in like the majority of cannabis

3470
02:32:10,969 --> 02:32:17,809
samples okay and so they're the most

3471
02:32:14,329 --> 02:32:21,709
useful for discriminating a class system

3472
02:32:17,809 --> 02:32:23,809
you can use to separate you know what we

3473
02:32:21,709 --> 02:32:26,269
the wine analogy before it separates

3474
02:32:23,809 --> 02:32:28,989
like a merlot from a Pinot Noir from a

3475
02:32:26,270 --> 02:32:32,390
Shiraz right mm-hmm

3476
02:32:28,989 --> 02:32:35,568
so these this terpene data you see here

3477
02:32:32,389 --> 02:32:37,879
at the bottom is actually what the aroma

3478
02:32:35,568 --> 02:32:40,639
and the entre so you can see this left

3479
02:32:37,879 --> 02:32:43,039
side of this panel here is the aroma and

3480
02:32:40,639 --> 02:32:44,568
the flavor you can see there's two

3481
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,880
different graphs laid over top of each

3482
02:32:44,568 --> 02:32:48,529
other and then the right panel is the

3483
02:32:46,879 --> 02:32:51,199
predicted entourage effect from the

3484
02:32:48,530 --> 02:32:54,020
flower that fascinates me right there

3485
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,909
that's interesting all right this is

3486
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:58,280
super coming this is it is gonna be the

3487
02:32:55,909 --> 02:32:59,780
way of the future you know because

3488
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:03,109
people you can go into a dispensary I

3489
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:05,120
really like that profile of the plant

3490
02:33:03,109 --> 02:33:08,020
and then you can say you know this is

3491
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:11,090
the type of effect that it's gonna have

3492
02:33:08,020 --> 02:33:13,939
so it's super cool check out the web

3493
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:15,100
page again it's phyto facts dot info

3494
02:33:13,939 --> 02:33:18,710
oops

3495
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:20,420
phyto facts so you think most

3496
02:33:18,709 --> 02:33:22,478
laboratories would be able to adopt

3497
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:25,030
something like like that type of

3498
02:33:22,478 --> 02:33:28,279
disclosure of information within their

3499
02:33:25,030 --> 02:33:31,399
license their methodology and they're

3500
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:34,850
there they're fine oh packs you can

3501
02:33:31,398 --> 02:33:37,340
license a permit nice very user friendly

3502
02:33:34,850 --> 02:33:39,380
which is nice so for example I just

3503
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:40,969
searched dream to pull up like blue

3504
02:33:39,379 --> 02:33:42,379
dreams but like tears there's a bunch of

3505
02:33:40,969 --> 02:33:44,929
different varieties that are all based

3506
02:33:42,379 --> 02:33:47,299
on different blue dream hybrids it looks

3507
02:33:44,930 --> 02:33:50,148
like but so we'll just look at blue

3508
02:33:47,299 --> 02:33:51,829
dream for a second so you can see again

3509
02:33:50,148 --> 02:33:56,000
mere scene is this purple one at the

3510
02:33:51,829 --> 02:33:57,709
bottom it's the dominant terpene which

3511
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,870
is really City you know a sedative right

3512
02:33:57,709 --> 02:34:01,519
as I said a sedative terpene and then

3513
02:33:59,870 --> 02:34:04,510
this sample has more pineys than the

3514
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:06,950
last one and actually very little lemony

3515
02:34:04,510 --> 02:34:07,639
so anyway go around and play with all

3516
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:10,220
that kind of stuff

3517
02:34:07,639 --> 02:34:15,049
search whatever terms you want on the

3518
02:34:10,219 --> 02:34:16,090
search engine and I think I think you'll

3519
02:34:15,049 --> 02:34:20,029
find it interesting

3520
02:34:16,090 --> 02:34:22,398
so once the once they searched once they

3521
02:34:20,030 --> 02:34:22,820
did like you know hundreds or thousands

3522
02:34:22,398 --> 02:34:24,469
and

3523
02:34:22,819 --> 02:34:29,809
the tests where do they get their

3524
02:34:24,469 --> 02:34:33,529
biological data from their efficacy like

3525
02:34:29,809 --> 02:34:35,930
what's gonna you know you said that you

3526
02:34:33,530 --> 02:34:39,560
had one graph where they showed you know

3527
02:34:35,930 --> 02:34:42,319
a recommendation I I'm not not for a

3528
02:34:39,559 --> 02:34:45,170
disease or a therapeutic area but can

3529
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:49,879
you go back to that one chart you're

3530
02:34:45,170 --> 02:34:52,460
asking how do they tie this data to

3531
02:34:49,879 --> 02:34:56,899
effect yeah what so so what is this

3532
02:34:52,459 --> 02:34:59,119
exactly I'm trying to okay well so see

3533
02:34:56,899 --> 02:35:01,309
realization right you can see this one

3534
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:05,960
behind relaxations it's also high in

3535
02:35:01,309 --> 02:35:08,149
mere scene right so that's that sedative

3536
02:35:05,959 --> 02:35:10,189
property of how many how many stretch

3537
02:35:08,149 --> 02:35:12,709
cultivars they have in the database the

3538
02:35:10,190 --> 02:35:15,350
first 14 i typed in none came up until I

3539
02:35:12,709 --> 02:35:17,059
typed in Gorilla Glue okay but do

3540
02:35:15,350 --> 02:35:18,110
something like type in gorillas or glue

3541
02:35:17,059 --> 02:35:21,020
because a lot of times you get

3542
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:22,909
variations on the name right it's like

3543
02:35:21,021 --> 02:35:24,950
god it didn't have granddaddy purp so it

3544
02:35:22,909 --> 02:35:28,280
didn't have true G you mean just like

3545
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:31,159
type in Oh G type Turks type perps type

3546
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:32,989
og okay like look for example I'll just

3547
02:35:31,159 --> 02:35:36,950
go to the top and type og oh there we go

3548
02:35:32,989 --> 02:35:39,619
alright size of the relaxation wedge

3549
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:45,470
just a statistical correlation to how

3550
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:48,010
much mersin is in a sample more or less

3551
02:35:45,469 --> 02:35:50,420
it's heavily weighted on near scene

3552
02:35:48,010 --> 02:35:54,979
right but again all the other terpenes

3553
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:59,569
do have effects right okay so but what

3554
02:35:54,979 --> 02:36:01,309
are the other categories of effects so

3555
02:35:59,569 --> 02:36:05,930
they had relaxation was one that's the

3556
02:36:01,309 --> 02:36:09,139
mercy one wouldn't it be more I mean I

3557
02:36:05,930 --> 02:36:11,329
would say like I like the words I don't

3558
02:36:09,139 --> 02:36:13,479
know I get that's not a medical term but

3559
02:36:11,329 --> 02:36:17,180
I mean more of like a hypnotic or

3560
02:36:13,479 --> 02:36:18,859
medical remember duty in the late States

3561
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:20,600
and you can't use I mean it's like yeah

3562
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:25,940
you're right you're right yeah so what

3563
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:29,440
is it focus energy inspiration right

3564
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:33,230
inspiration is highly diverse we mean oh

3565
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:35,300
cool really focus is isn't is is which

3566
02:36:33,229 --> 02:36:36,671
one again pining yeah it's time to

3567
02:36:35,299 --> 02:36:38,290
pining which is weird on this

3568
02:36:36,671 --> 02:36:40,181
because the paintings are actually all

3569
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:43,661
there the third dominant terpene right

3570
02:36:40,181 --> 02:36:46,810
it's a small effect so they have a less

3571
02:36:43,661 --> 02:36:48,761
weighted score and the overall I'm not

3572
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:51,040
again I'm not exactly sure the exact

3573
02:36:48,761 --> 02:36:53,261
algorithm but there's obviously not

3574
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:55,870
rhythm behind it so how would I pull up

3575
02:36:53,261 --> 02:36:58,211
any sour DS on this or just try anything

3576
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:59,770
type sour or diesel like let's go did

3577
02:36:58,210 --> 02:37:03,700
nothing came up

3578
02:36:59,771 --> 02:37:06,011
maybe I'm [ __ ] here so maybe they

3579
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:08,470
just don't have it

3580
02:37:06,011 --> 02:37:14,531
there's no data on Saturday source hour

3581
02:37:08,470 --> 02:37:18,671
anything it's almost right chem see if

3582
02:37:14,531 --> 02:37:20,531
they're in the Kemp family no opening

3583
02:37:18,671 --> 02:37:24,271
Time Machine preferences oops

3584
02:37:20,531 --> 02:37:27,041
don't you just hate computer sometimes

3585
02:37:24,271 --> 02:37:31,091
they have crushes like classic public

3586
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:32,950
pushes I like that I like the whole

3587
02:37:31,091 --> 02:37:34,751
layout and everything day where are they

3588
02:37:32,950 --> 02:37:36,850
located too so people can get things

3589
02:37:34,751 --> 02:37:39,070
tested or get their information I it's

3590
02:37:36,851 --> 02:37:40,781
not a public laboratory you can't okay

3591
02:37:39,070 --> 02:37:42,251
service laboratory they only work with

3592
02:37:40,781 --> 02:37:46,901
certain dispenser eating cultivated

3593
02:37:42,251 --> 02:37:49,421
clients their data really somebody gets

3594
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:52,630
a better system theirs is the best

3595
02:37:49,421 --> 02:37:56,081
system for some time so let's go

3596
02:37:52,630 --> 02:37:58,930
downsize muji cushion what's unique

3597
02:37:56,081 --> 02:38:04,570
other than a nice color-coded graph

3598
02:37:58,931 --> 02:38:06,431
thing I mean we could finish yeah you

3599
02:38:04,570 --> 02:38:08,050
get bogged down in the in the in the

3600
02:38:06,431 --> 02:38:10,421
thing I was that was just a tool that I

3601
02:38:08,050 --> 02:38:12,610
was showing you to go and play with and

3602
02:38:10,421 --> 02:38:14,591
an experiment I'm not trying to present

3603
02:38:12,611 --> 02:38:16,631
idle backs okay I'm just trying to

3604
02:38:14,591 --> 02:38:18,791
present you something greater here which

3605
02:38:16,630 --> 02:38:21,760
is this so after running tons and tons

3606
02:38:18,790 --> 02:38:24,430
of tests they started to of these

3607
02:38:21,761 --> 02:38:26,740
terpene classes started to emerge which

3608
02:38:24,431 --> 02:38:29,581
is what Josh was talking about her sorry

3609
02:38:26,740 --> 02:38:32,950
what Alec was talking about last week

3610
02:38:29,581 --> 02:38:35,800
okay but this is really the work that

3611
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:37,570
predated all of it and you can see like

3612
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:40,689
for example let's look at limonene okay

3613
02:38:37,570 --> 02:38:42,611
right so this limonene class here these

3614
02:38:40,690 --> 02:38:46,451
are all different types of samples where

3615
02:38:42,611 --> 02:38:48,401
limonene is the highest terpene present

3616
02:38:46,450 --> 02:38:50,510
in the sample okay which is what we were

3617
02:38:48,400 --> 02:38:52,540
talking about what you

3618
02:38:50,511 --> 02:38:55,490
talking about a couple of weeks ago with

3619
02:38:52,540 --> 02:38:58,340
Tim's County Fair right you were basing

3620
02:38:55,490 --> 02:39:00,411
it on right the five dominant terpenes

3621
02:38:58,341 --> 02:39:04,461
right and I was saying I mean it's a

3622
02:39:00,411 --> 02:39:06,440
start but it doesn't really show you the

3623
02:39:04,460 --> 02:39:08,210
variation that can occur within that

3624
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:10,521
within plants that are all alive and in

3625
02:39:08,210 --> 02:39:13,729
dominance so what this has done and

3626
02:39:10,521 --> 02:39:16,701
broken it down you can see that what we

3627
02:39:13,729 --> 02:39:18,261
cut was called the gold clasp or the

3628
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:21,350
gold sub class in the limonene

3629
02:39:18,261 --> 02:39:23,601
superclass that is when limonene is

3630
02:39:21,351 --> 02:39:26,121
roughly equal to carry off lien and

3631
02:39:23,601 --> 02:39:28,371
roughly equal to mere seen okay very

3632
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:32,720
cool and that's gonna have a different

3633
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:36,200
effect when limonene is greater than

3634
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:38,331
carry off lien and roughly equal to mere

3635
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:40,430
seen and that's interesting because

3636
02:39:38,331 --> 02:39:42,440
Peter came in earlier and talked about

3637
02:39:40,431 --> 02:39:44,961
having some of the plants that they had

3638
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:48,319
grown with his probiotics that bacteria

3639
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:49,819
is that that a high or like instead of

3640
02:39:48,319 --> 02:39:52,640
two or three there was like eight or

3641
02:39:49,819 --> 02:39:55,640
nine classes of terpenes that had

3642
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:57,470
similar amounts like you know what I

3643
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:59,240
mean like we don't see that very often

3644
02:39:57,470 --> 02:40:01,279
like I haven't anyway one that I just

3645
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:05,120
got let's see if I can show my screen

3646
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:07,280
here this is a cool way to so at this

3647
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:09,260
conference real quick this is what you

3648
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:11,780
went to and there this is a really cool

3649
02:40:09,261 --> 02:40:14,440
way to start start the process of really

3650
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:18,351
dialing it's like that it's like the

3651
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:20,931
table of elements for cannabis and

3652
02:40:18,351 --> 02:40:24,461
terpene classifications this was the

3653
02:40:20,931 --> 02:40:28,181
first really comprehensive

3654
02:40:24,460 --> 02:40:30,950
classification system for terpenes and

3655
02:40:28,181 --> 02:40:33,560
so you can see if you count the classes

3656
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:35,470
it's got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 it's got eight

3657
02:40:33,560 --> 02:40:37,490
different terpene classes in this one

3658
02:40:35,470 --> 02:40:39,831
whereas the County Fair that they were

3659
02:40:37,490 --> 02:40:43,399
they're only using five different

3660
02:40:39,831 --> 02:40:44,931
classes right right they didn't have a

3661
02:40:43,399 --> 02:40:46,399
no sameen class they didn't have a

3662
02:40:44,931 --> 02:40:50,421
little little class well I didn't have a

3663
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:52,161
human now look at what Peter's got see

3664
02:40:50,421 --> 02:40:54,740
this buddy see if you have anything that

3665
02:40:52,161 --> 02:41:00,341
matches this what he's got on this try

3666
02:40:54,740 --> 02:41:03,411
that did this chest he he was at 0.3

3667
02:41:00,341 --> 02:41:04,159
before he used the soil balance again

3668
02:41:03,411 --> 02:41:06,829
and out

3669
02:41:04,159 --> 02:41:09,200
Rick not a master grower like you guys

3670
02:41:06,829 --> 02:41:11,719
this is just a regular guy right

3671
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:14,061
not a cannabis cup dude like you guys

3672
02:41:11,719 --> 02:41:19,719
are just a humble guy who's creating

3673
02:41:14,060 --> 02:41:23,539
medicine in his yard no co - op'

3674
02:41:19,719 --> 02:41:26,569
open-loop this is how we did it and and

3675
02:41:23,540 --> 02:41:28,730
so what in this laboratory only tests

3676
02:41:26,569 --> 02:41:31,010
for these particular ones this is all

3677
02:41:28,729 --> 02:41:33,049
they test for but this guy the

3678
02:41:31,010 --> 02:41:36,979
laboratory they said that they had three

3679
02:41:33,049 --> 02:41:37,909
others that were over 0.1 but these were

3680
02:41:36,979 --> 02:41:41,810
the only ones at that particular

3681
02:41:37,909 --> 02:41:44,840
laboratory just like it probably was up

3682
02:41:41,810 --> 02:41:49,069
for close few rounds percent they're all

3683
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:51,920
relatively very close except one

3684
02:41:49,069 --> 02:41:53,420
one thing that is makes you know and I

3685
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:55,310
it's really interesting to look at

3686
02:41:53,420 --> 02:41:59,149
individual results and I'm not trying to

3687
02:41:55,310 --> 02:42:00,529
talk smack about those results but what

3688
02:41:59,149 --> 02:42:02,270
one thing that we know that happens when

3689
02:42:00,530 --> 02:42:05,210
you go from cultivation - cultivation -

3690
02:42:02,271 --> 02:42:07,370
cultivation the environmental the

3691
02:42:05,209 --> 02:42:09,169
environmental conditions change and that

3692
02:42:07,370 --> 02:42:14,450
can actually impact the order of the

3693
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:15,890
terpenes on the in the sample and this

3694
02:42:14,450 --> 02:42:20,601
was that look at this though he's got a

3695
02:42:15,890 --> 02:42:22,489
kosher Kush where his Mersin except the

3696
02:42:20,601 --> 02:42:24,560
li-ming's just a little bit higher but

3697
02:42:22,489 --> 02:42:26,090
he's almost fitting right into your Gold

3698
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:28,369
Series I'm just looking at the chart

3699
02:42:26,090 --> 02:42:30,140
that's there there's a couple of them on

3700
02:42:28,370 --> 02:42:33,500
there that have three or four that equal

3701
02:42:30,140 --> 02:42:35,090
each other right so one of the things

3702
02:42:33,500 --> 02:42:37,521
that they did in this is that all the

3703
02:42:35,090 --> 02:42:40,549
all the plants were grown in the same

3704
02:42:37,521 --> 02:42:42,079
exact same conditions right and when you

3705
02:42:40,549 --> 02:42:46,219
do that you eliminate the environmental

3706
02:42:42,079 --> 02:42:49,159
effects mm-hmm and therefore you can get

3707
02:42:46,219 --> 02:42:50,840
a better representation of the actual

3708
02:42:49,159 --> 02:42:53,629
impact of the genetics on the flavor

3709
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:55,460
profile right let's see so so so this is

3710
02:42:53,629 --> 02:42:58,339
coming in consistently for us you guys

3711
02:42:55,459 --> 02:43:01,699
we're getting like all balanced levels

3712
02:42:58,340 --> 02:43:04,219
but of eight nine of these of these

3713
02:43:01,700 --> 02:43:05,870
terpenes which is again most

3714
02:43:04,219 --> 02:43:07,100
laboratories have seen like what your

3715
02:43:05,870 --> 02:43:11,450
samples were the ones that you just

3716
02:43:07,101 --> 02:43:13,851
showed you have you know four that were

3717
02:43:11,450 --> 02:43:16,880
really high level maybe five but to get

3718
02:43:13,851 --> 02:43:17,520
that many like above seven or eight or

3719
02:43:16,879 --> 02:43:19,408
nine but

3720
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:21,078
that's something that most laboratories

3721
02:43:19,408 --> 02:43:23,788
we've talked to have never seen before

3722
02:43:21,078 --> 02:43:27,898
so you know again you guys are

3723
02:43:23,789 --> 02:43:30,180
completely right each each strain and

3724
02:43:27,898 --> 02:43:32,338
each cultivation methodology is going to

3725
02:43:30,180 --> 02:43:34,049
vary within the amounts of terpenes like

3726
02:43:32,338 --> 02:43:35,850
a cannabis cup level guys gonna produce

3727
02:43:34,049 --> 02:43:37,439
a much higher terpene level because

3728
02:43:35,850 --> 02:43:39,149
there's a ability to understand the

3729
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:41,459
correct macro micronutrients I mean you

3730
02:43:39,148 --> 02:43:44,038
need the physics to actually be able to

3731
02:43:41,459 --> 02:43:47,430
have something conducive so the client

3732
02:43:44,039 --> 02:43:52,409
can generate this this type of biomass

3733
02:43:47,430 --> 02:43:54,359
this term I mean so so if that's correct

3734
02:43:52,408 --> 02:43:56,759
if you're a good cultivator you know and

3735
02:43:54,359 --> 02:43:58,289
you know you're [ __ ] and you're putting

3736
02:43:56,759 --> 02:44:00,389
in the right macro micro the right

3737
02:43:58,289 --> 02:44:03,140
nutrients right carbon sources their

3738
02:44:00,389 --> 02:44:06,448
biology is going to come out in such

3739
02:44:03,139 --> 02:44:09,259
balanced expressions because it's it's

3740
02:44:06,449 --> 02:44:12,088
it's going to allow the plant to absorb

3741
02:44:09,259 --> 02:44:14,100
exactly what it needs so that it can

3742
02:44:12,088 --> 02:44:17,578
reach again what you guys say it's full

3743
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:19,408
Jinhua and and to complement what you're

3744
02:44:17,578 --> 02:44:22,228
saying that what's skunkman and what

3745
02:44:19,408 --> 02:44:24,628
what come here saying here is if you're

3746
02:44:22,228 --> 02:44:27,269
if you're probiotic for the plant allows

3747
02:44:24,629 --> 02:44:29,609
the plant to reach potential expressions

3748
02:44:27,270 --> 02:44:32,220
of which genetically there and if you

3749
02:44:29,609 --> 02:44:34,498
look at this archive of cultivar your

3750
02:44:32,219 --> 02:44:36,628
and you say okay a kosher kush is in

3751
02:44:34,498 --> 02:44:38,609
this classic OG Kush gold where the

3752
02:44:36,629 --> 02:44:40,829
limonene equals the beta carotene equals

3753
02:44:38,609 --> 02:44:42,720
the mersin and you're able to and you

3754
02:44:40,828 --> 02:44:45,509
look at that particular test you show

3755
02:44:42,719 --> 02:44:47,219
that's a kosher cush so so what we were

3756
02:44:45,509 --> 02:44:52,049
asking earlier which was okay let's

3757
02:44:47,219 --> 02:44:57,748
apply your your probiotic to a o green

3758
02:44:52,049 --> 02:44:59,819
candy Riya or apply it to a proprietary

3759
02:44:57,748 --> 02:45:01,588
hybrid or these different these

3760
02:44:59,818 --> 02:45:04,378
different classifications were like a

3761
02:45:01,588 --> 02:45:07,469
mercy and classification and see what

3762
02:45:04,379 --> 02:45:09,209
that does to those levels so the it

3763
02:45:07,469 --> 02:45:11,188
would be interesting if you grow all of

3764
02:45:09,209 --> 02:45:13,770
the same and you have these

3765
02:45:11,189 --> 02:45:16,588
classifications he's showing us what the

3766
02:45:13,770 --> 02:45:18,629
what the probiotic what effects would

3767
02:45:16,588 --> 02:45:21,298
have on these terpene profiles now if

3768
02:45:18,629 --> 02:45:22,859
they all if every single classification

3769
02:45:21,299 --> 02:45:25,560
of genetics that was grown by the same

3770
02:45:22,859 --> 02:45:26,818
farmer and they all use this probiotic

3771
02:45:25,559 --> 02:45:29,458
and every single one of the

3772
02:45:26,818 --> 02:45:31,409
classifications evened out you would

3773
02:45:29,459 --> 02:45:33,090
have a phenomenal like weird

3774
02:45:31,409 --> 02:45:34,110
something you know what I mean like you

3775
02:45:33,090 --> 02:45:36,329
would have something that's just like

3776
02:45:34,110 --> 02:45:37,979
unbelievable that's not gonna happen

3777
02:45:36,329 --> 02:45:40,770
that's not gonna happen

3778
02:45:37,978 --> 02:45:41,909
I don't believe so either that's so I

3779
02:45:40,770 --> 02:45:45,290
don't think that would happen what it

3780
02:45:41,909 --> 02:45:49,648
would do is it's almost like a probiotic

3781
02:45:45,290 --> 02:45:52,830
in enhancement so you're being able to

3782
02:45:49,648 --> 02:45:57,029
like have the plant reach its maximum

3783
02:45:52,829 --> 02:45:58,770
terpene classification so I think that's

3784
02:45:57,030 --> 02:46:01,530
what your probiotic would do in each one

3785
02:45:58,770 --> 02:46:03,210
of these classifications agree we have a

3786
02:46:01,530 --> 02:46:05,550
grow right now it's the Central Coast

3787
02:46:03,209 --> 02:46:07,109
trees actually I just finished 18

3788
02:46:05,549 --> 02:46:10,648
different strains that have been

3789
02:46:07,110 --> 02:46:13,829
cultivated with the the soil balance and

3790
02:46:10,648 --> 02:46:15,299
so we're gonna you know maybe I can come

3791
02:46:13,829 --> 02:46:17,398
back on here and show those to you guys

3792
02:46:15,299 --> 02:46:19,079
once we have them in and SC Labs is

3793
02:46:17,398 --> 02:46:21,930
gonna do the analysis I love this

3794
02:46:19,079 --> 02:46:24,600
classification chart down tonight I just

3795
02:46:21,930 --> 02:46:26,069
wanna but this is you know I showed you

3796
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:27,750
the close-up so that you could see the

3797
02:46:26,069 --> 02:46:30,090
actual terpene breakdown but this is

3798
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:33,270
actually the really cool thing about it

3799
02:46:30,090 --> 02:46:34,170
and it relates to have the you know what

3800
02:46:33,270 --> 02:46:37,319
we were talking about with the

3801
02:46:34,170 --> 02:46:38,790
emerald-cut the the county fair and and

3802
02:46:37,319 --> 02:46:40,949
creating terpene classes and then

3803
02:46:38,790 --> 02:46:43,260
competing within the class so if you

3804
02:46:40,950 --> 02:46:46,380
look at the purple subclass right it's a

3805
02:46:43,260 --> 02:46:50,969
mere scene carry off lean and then

3806
02:46:46,379 --> 02:46:53,909
pining look look here all these

3807
02:46:50,969 --> 02:46:55,438
different plants right but whatever the

3808
02:46:53,909 --> 02:46:56,700
this is not the purple cush that we have

3809
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:59,189
in canada but it was a sample in

3810
02:46:56,700 --> 02:47:01,740
california called purple cush the purple

3811
02:46:59,189 --> 02:47:05,460
girl the purple who do the GDP the rate

3812
02:47:01,739 --> 02:47:09,360
the granddaddy perps and the blue dream

3813
02:47:05,459 --> 02:47:11,219
they all have the same more or less

3814
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:13,319
stripping profile at least with regard

3815
02:47:11,219 --> 02:47:15,898
to these major seventeen terpenes okay

3816
02:47:13,319 --> 02:47:19,398
and so this is how it fits in to what we

3817
02:47:15,898 --> 02:47:20,699
were talking about you know like the dog

3818
02:47:19,398 --> 02:47:22,379
the dog

3819
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:23,579
what are they dog breeding competition

3820
02:47:22,379 --> 02:47:25,289
right it's like that's what they were

3821
02:47:23,579 --> 02:47:27,389
doing with with lining up terpene

3822
02:47:25,290 --> 02:47:30,390
classes is that you allow the plants

3823
02:47:27,389 --> 02:47:35,129
with the similar flavors to compete for

3824
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:37,590
the same set of awards right yeah yeah

3825
02:47:35,129 --> 02:47:39,839
and so those are different for example

3826
02:47:37,590 --> 02:47:41,909
from the silver subclass right Bubba

3827
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:44,220
cush Master cherry slider cherry cough

3828
02:47:41,909 --> 02:47:49,021
in the legend oh gee

3829
02:47:44,220 --> 02:47:50,609
right they all have limonene is greater

3830
02:47:49,021 --> 02:47:54,360
than carry off lean and then roughly the

3831
02:47:50,610 --> 02:47:57,030
same as nursing right so on that white

3832
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:58,950
widow one I don't know the white widow

3833
02:47:57,030 --> 02:48:01,381
I've ever seen I haven't seen like it I

3834
02:47:58,950 --> 02:48:04,650
wouldn't classify it as a purple but

3835
02:48:01,380 --> 02:48:06,630
it's classified there because not of its

3836
02:48:04,649 --> 02:48:08,489
look but more of its terpene profiles

3837
02:48:06,630 --> 02:48:10,921
what you're saying it's classified

3838
02:48:08,489 --> 02:48:14,130
only bias terpene okay the repeat

3839
02:48:10,921 --> 02:48:15,569
classification system okay even though

3840
02:48:14,130 --> 02:48:18,000
the flowers look different the chemical

3841
02:48:15,569 --> 02:48:19,949
profiles are up juicing and there's

3842
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:21,450
there's minor variations again it's only

3843
02:48:19,950 --> 02:48:23,480
based on the top seventeen most

3844
02:48:21,450 --> 02:48:27,000
predominant in most occuring terpenes

3845
02:48:23,479 --> 02:48:28,649
your minor Terps like you know alpha

3846
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:30,450
Basava Lal and Y all and all these

3847
02:48:28,649 --> 02:48:33,720
things they can drastically change the

3848
02:48:30,450 --> 02:48:34,829
flavor yeah I was gonna say that was I

3849
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:36,390
thought there might be a correlation

3850
02:48:34,829 --> 02:48:37,739
there but there's I mean for the

3851
02:48:36,390 --> 02:48:41,130
majority of what you have there's a

3852
02:48:37,739 --> 02:48:43,709
correlation of mersin being higher I

3853
02:48:41,130 --> 02:48:45,421
think that's what your chart shows in

3854
02:48:43,709 --> 02:48:47,340
that particular category I believe

3855
02:48:45,421 --> 02:48:49,649
mersin is the dominant one and each one

3856
02:48:47,341 --> 02:48:54,511
of those which would wonder if that has

3857
02:48:49,649 --> 02:48:57,209
a certain reaction when there's a the

3858
02:48:54,511 --> 02:48:59,431
phosphorus that's kind of slowing and I

3859
02:48:57,209 --> 02:49:01,859
guess quote-unquote bruising in the

3860
02:48:59,431 --> 02:49:03,931
plant creating the purple genetic look I

3861
02:49:01,860 --> 02:49:05,489
thought that maybe mercy and tied to but

3862
02:49:03,931 --> 02:49:08,881
then the white widow doesn't really grow

3863
02:49:05,489 --> 02:49:10,709
purple at all so it didn't that's all

3864
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:13,949
the rest of those all have purple in

3865
02:49:10,709 --> 02:49:15,869
them and the purple kush is that's also

3866
02:49:13,950 --> 02:49:19,200
another very there could be one called

3867
02:49:15,870 --> 02:49:21,150
the perfect plan or aka the dirty perps

3868
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:23,070
like Oregon dirty perps that's where

3869
02:49:21,149 --> 02:49:25,890
that purple pushes and I think all

3870
02:49:23,069 --> 02:49:28,050
purple and Ken's GDP is purple the

3871
02:49:25,890 --> 02:49:31,289
purple Voodoo's all purple blue dream

3872
02:49:28,050 --> 02:49:33,060
has some purple and blue and you know

3873
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:35,011
hints of blue but a lot of purple in it

3874
02:49:33,060 --> 02:49:37,529
I thought maybe there was correlation

3875
02:49:35,011 --> 02:49:39,210
between the terpene and the no because

3876
02:49:37,530 --> 02:49:41,311
they're independent traits and you have

3877
02:49:39,209 --> 02:49:43,439
morphology in that chemistry this is all

3878
02:49:41,310 --> 02:49:45,060
based on camera yeah yeah one thing that

3879
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:48,710
is interesting in that class Toni is

3880
02:49:45,060 --> 02:49:50,579
that I mean GDP and the the oracles and

3881
02:49:48,709 --> 02:49:52,319
that you know they're all they're really

3882
02:49:50,579 --> 02:49:55,021
popularly at least they work for a few

3883
02:49:52,319 --> 02:49:57,719
years in the Bay Area yeah right and

3884
02:49:55,021 --> 02:50:00,149
what other plant was also hugely popular

3885
02:49:57,719 --> 02:50:02,278
in the Bay Area with Blue Dream huge and

3886
02:50:00,148 --> 02:50:04,049
so I had wondered if that was like a

3887
02:50:02,279 --> 02:50:08,430
regional preference for a chemical

3888
02:50:04,049 --> 02:50:10,259
flavor mmm easy well if you look at the

3889
02:50:08,430 --> 02:50:12,600
Bay Area you need to be like a little

3890
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:13,978
sedated and hypnotic then like I mean

3891
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:15,840
there's a lot going on over here this is

3892
02:50:13,978 --> 02:50:18,269
ground zero for a lot of [ __ ]

3893
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:20,728
so maybe just those particular varieties

3894
02:50:18,270 --> 02:50:23,729
just made everyone chill out you know it

3895
02:50:20,728 --> 02:50:25,289
could be but it's alright but I mean

3896
02:50:23,728 --> 02:50:28,619
like you know like in Spain for example

3897
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:33,600
it's critical you know critical cluster

3898
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:35,220
critical some ashanty sirens are really

3899
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:38,100
popular there but many of you go to

3900
02:50:35,219 --> 02:50:39,119
Austria it's it's the chronic right like

3901
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:41,279
mm-hmm

3902
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:43,439
west coast of BC west coast BC it's like

3903
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:46,290
pk the purple kush right at least it was

3904
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:50,370
for a few years and we do develop these

3905
02:50:46,290 --> 02:50:51,630
like it's like it's like a local I are

3906
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:54,090
call it a flavor preference but it's

3907
02:50:51,629 --> 02:50:55,769
like a local fashion right that develops

3908
02:50:54,090 --> 02:50:57,960
in an area that people like so pull out

3909
02:50:55,770 --> 02:51:00,090
on that chart real quick cuz that's also

3910
02:50:57,959 --> 02:51:02,669
like kind of I mean maybe it's maybe

3911
02:51:00,090 --> 02:51:04,680
it's a dialect if T if terpenes are the

3912
02:51:02,670 --> 02:51:12,139
con are the language like Peter was

3913
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:16,020
saying earlier yeah that's one of those

3914
02:51:12,139 --> 02:51:20,340
I believe it's a silver is that chard

3915
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:24,750
available online yet no well it is now

3916
02:51:20,340 --> 02:51:26,790
that we've got it on yeah what I meant

3917
02:51:24,750 --> 02:51:29,010
was that Ethan

3918
02:51:26,790 --> 02:51:35,790
sent me a copy but I was wondering if

3919
02:51:29,010 --> 02:51:37,920
somebody point to an internet site where

3920
02:51:35,790 --> 02:51:39,989
they could grab it like the hash Church

3921
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:41,700
yeah like probably in the next 25

3922
02:51:39,988 --> 02:51:44,039
minutes this will be recreated in a

3923
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:48,180
spreadsheet all color-coordinated in

3924
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:50,310
someone else's - no one else's deck so

3925
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:52,559
it also recreated it put it out there

3926
02:51:50,309 --> 02:51:54,689
and OB and Tuesday are Wednesday's

3927
02:51:52,559 --> 02:51:57,238
publication and then they'll claim it

3928
02:51:54,689 --> 02:51:59,100
yeah well it's I mean it's published it

3929
02:51:57,238 --> 02:52:02,340
was published with the ICRS and I like I

3930
02:51:59,100 --> 02:52:03,988
said mark dr. Lewis from from nay pro

3931
02:52:02,340 --> 02:52:06,450
gave me permission to put this up so

3932
02:52:03,988 --> 02:52:08,209
this is super cool this is their you

3933
02:52:06,450 --> 02:52:10,439
know this is their work when we you know

3934
02:52:08,209 --> 02:52:11,788
this they were the first to do the

3935
02:52:10,439 --> 02:52:15,639
terpene classic

3936
02:52:11,789 --> 02:52:19,498
isn't shout out shout out down it's Ryan

3937
02:52:15,638 --> 02:52:31,868
I have to show you something on my wall

3938
02:52:19,498 --> 02:52:35,199
did you protect the whole thing he's got

3939
02:52:31,869 --> 02:52:38,139
it right up on the wall I development

3940
02:52:35,199 --> 02:52:41,668
that's a pretty big oh [ __ ] you printed

3941
02:52:38,138 --> 02:52:44,348
it out in full as you go down this door

3942
02:52:41,668 --> 02:52:46,209
there you go down to the printer well

3943
02:52:44,349 --> 02:52:48,639
he's he's muted right now for some

3944
02:52:46,209 --> 02:52:50,039
reason he's probably talking and doesn't

3945
02:52:48,638 --> 02:52:53,888
realize it

3946
02:52:50,039 --> 02:52:55,629
he already trademarked it okay so let me

3947
02:52:53,888 --> 02:52:57,208
go into the next piece of the story then

3948
02:52:55,629 --> 02:53:00,369
okay

3949
02:52:57,209 --> 02:53:02,199
so what they've done is knowing that you

3950
02:53:00,369 --> 02:53:04,629
can have terpene profiles that are that

3951
02:53:02,199 --> 02:53:06,309
are replicatable and you know things fit

3952
02:53:04,629 --> 02:53:07,959
into the same flavor profile that meant

3953
02:53:06,308 --> 02:53:11,528
that there is a genetic component to it

3954
02:53:07,959 --> 02:53:13,509
so they started breeding plants and it's

3955
02:53:11,529 --> 02:53:17,408
unfortunate it's not easy to tell on

3956
02:53:13,509 --> 02:53:20,199
this variety but on this poster I can

3957
02:53:17,408 --> 02:53:22,868
you guys seen this poster I can see like

3958
02:53:20,199 --> 02:53:24,549
limonene superclass and you know for the

3959
02:53:22,869 --> 02:53:26,379
most part we could see it I thought you

3960
02:53:24,549 --> 02:53:28,869
said have we never seen it you can't see

3961
02:53:26,379 --> 02:53:30,789
like the the accurate graphs of which

3962
02:53:28,869 --> 02:53:32,709
each one is doing you'd have to zoom in

3963
02:53:30,789 --> 02:53:34,629
a little bit more on those ones but let

3964
02:53:32,709 --> 02:53:36,338
me zoom in on the terpene superclass

3965
02:53:34,629 --> 02:53:38,649
here so essentially what you have if you

3966
02:53:36,338 --> 02:53:40,449
look at the terpene fingerprints on the

3967
02:53:38,648 --> 02:53:42,759
bottom right 1 2 3

3968
02:53:40,449 --> 02:53:45,699
mm-hmm they're pretty much the same

3969
02:53:42,759 --> 02:53:47,289
right yeah there are small variations

3970
02:53:45,699 --> 02:53:48,609
but they are pretty much the same but

3971
02:53:47,289 --> 02:53:49,869
the interesting thing is if you look at

3972
02:53:48,609 --> 02:53:52,869
the canid i'll which is the ratio

3973
02:53:49,869 --> 02:53:54,699
between the top to terpenes this one

3974
02:53:52,869 --> 02:53:56,439
here on the left is a type 1 plant its

3975
02:53:54,699 --> 02:53:59,379
THC dominant with a little bit of CBD

3976
02:53:56,439 --> 02:54:01,389
wow look at that they're different the

3977
02:53:59,379 --> 02:54:04,719
middle one has is a type 2 plant with

3978
02:54:01,388 --> 02:54:08,458
the company Oct and CBD and then on the

3979
02:54:04,718 --> 02:54:12,058
right this is another hybrid that has

3980
02:54:08,459 --> 02:54:16,209
majority of the the cannabinoids are are

3981
02:54:12,058 --> 02:54:18,878
CBD with a little bit of THC so you have

3982
02:54:16,209 --> 02:54:20,499
been profile the inter pean profile was

3983
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:24,099
varying cannabinoid Wow

3984
02:54:20,498 --> 02:54:25,449
and so now we're in a situation where

3985
02:54:24,099 --> 02:54:26,620
you can take these 3

3986
02:54:25,450 --> 02:54:28,960
and you can start using them for

3987
02:54:26,620 --> 02:54:30,610
clinical trials because what you've done

3988
02:54:28,959 --> 02:54:33,669
is you've stabilized the terpene

3989
02:54:30,610 --> 02:54:35,440
complement but you're varying the

3990
02:54:33,670 --> 02:54:39,040
cannabinoid content between treatment

3991
02:54:35,440 --> 02:54:46,120
groups how do we get those well you'd

3992
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:48,431
have talked to dr. Lewis so and again

3993
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:54,370
same thing in the pining superclass

3994
02:54:48,431 --> 02:54:56,200
right now these are both super cool I

3995
02:54:54,370 --> 02:54:58,271
mean they're knocking about pining

3996
02:54:56,200 --> 02:54:59,860
superclass limonene superclass this one

3997
02:54:58,271 --> 02:55:03,489
here the beta carry off mean superclass

3998
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:05,409
is a little bit different the top the

3999
02:55:03,489 --> 02:55:08,260
first to the left one is again type one

4000
02:55:05,409 --> 02:55:11,530
pre THC predominant with a little bit of

4001
02:55:08,260 --> 02:55:14,440
CBD type two as a mixture of CBD and THC

4002
02:55:11,530 --> 02:55:17,561
but this one here on the right is a

4003
02:55:14,440 --> 02:55:19,329
really incredible plants and it's so

4004
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:20,890
it's you can see the colors are a little

4005
02:55:19,329 --> 02:55:23,319
bit different on the canid aisle and

4006
02:55:20,890 --> 02:55:26,560
that's because the top two to the top

4007
02:55:23,319 --> 02:55:31,810
two cannabinoids in this variety are CBD

4008
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:36,069
and CBD B Wow okay so CBD and CBD V or

4009
02:55:31,810 --> 02:55:38,289
cannabinoids that are really effective

4010
02:55:36,069 --> 02:55:40,989
for epilepsy okay that's where GW is

4011
02:55:38,290 --> 02:55:43,330
chasing them down for different for

4012
02:55:40,989 --> 02:55:46,601
different kinds of epilepsy as well

4013
02:55:43,329 --> 02:55:51,039
correct like CBD a acts differently than

4014
02:55:46,601 --> 02:55:54,431
CBD V is that correct I don't think we

4015
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:55,960
know why I thought I saw Ethan Russo

4016
02:55:54,431 --> 02:56:02,050
talking a little bit about it and the

4017
02:55:55,959 --> 02:56:03,579
CBD V is for a frontal epilepsy he spoke

4018
02:56:02,049 --> 02:56:05,590
about it recently when he was here in

4019
02:56:03,579 --> 02:56:08,950
Vancouver you can we can catch up on

4020
02:56:05,590 --> 02:56:10,931
yeah for sure I would let Ethan be your

4021
02:56:08,950 --> 02:56:12,220
guide on that if you say that yeah but

4022
02:56:10,931 --> 02:56:14,470
this Co but what you're saying is

4023
02:56:12,219 --> 02:56:18,219
somebody specifically bred these what's

4024
02:56:14,469 --> 02:56:20,920
left letsa let me finish it's Evie and

4025
02:56:18,219 --> 02:56:22,600
CBD but if you look at the terpene cup

4026
02:56:20,920 --> 02:56:26,290
background it's high in beta-carotene

4027
02:56:22,601 --> 02:56:28,960
and high in little and both of those

4028
02:56:26,290 --> 02:56:30,630
terpenes are also anticonvulsant and

4029
02:56:28,959 --> 02:56:32,680
antispasmodic

4030
02:56:30,629 --> 02:56:34,719
so what it is is they take the

4031
02:56:32,681 --> 02:56:36,760
cannabinoids that are designed for a

4032
02:56:34,719 --> 02:56:38,260
specific condition in this case epilepsy

4033
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:39,250
and they put it in the terpene

4034
02:56:38,260 --> 02:56:41,680
background

4035
02:56:39,250 --> 02:56:44,829
that also has an entourage that has the

4036
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:46,450
same effect right so this is really a

4037
02:56:44,829 --> 02:56:48,789
case where it was a cultivar that was

4038
02:56:46,450 --> 02:56:50,230
designed well great you know a lot of

4039
02:56:48,790 --> 02:56:51,630
people that they look at we only need to

4040
02:56:50,229 --> 02:56:53,590
figure out what strains work for which

4041
02:56:51,629 --> 02:56:56,019
conditions where this is a totally

4042
02:56:53,590 --> 02:57:00,280
opposite approach this was let's create

4043
02:56:56,020 --> 02:57:04,420
a variety that is targeting and who bred

4044
02:57:00,280 --> 02:57:06,040
that who's doing this well this is work

4045
02:57:04,420 --> 02:57:07,920
that was done with a probe through one

4046
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:10,990
of their clients Wow

4047
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:12,670
that's killer man that's that's like the

4048
02:57:10,989 --> 02:57:15,340
coolest [ __ ] I've seen in a long time to

4049
02:57:12,670 --> 02:57:17,200
be honest with you yeah that's why I

4050
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:19,450
wanted to lay out the whole story for

4051
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:21,550
you guys from analytical method all the

4052
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:23,530
way through people sure now we need to

4053
02:57:21,549 --> 02:57:25,840
get that into farmers to grow it so we

4054
02:57:23,530 --> 02:57:29,620
can extract it and get it into medicine

4055
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:32,319
to people so no first we need to set up

4056
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:37,770
a call with dr. what was it named dr.

4057
02:57:32,319 --> 02:57:40,090
Lewis dr. Lewis get it into the farmers

4058
02:57:37,770 --> 02:57:43,239
yeah you got to get these varieties out

4059
02:57:40,090 --> 02:57:46,120
there with the trillion probiotic

4060
02:57:43,239 --> 02:57:48,940
formula step up the growing game get

4061
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:52,150
this stuff out in the masses yeah a

4062
02:57:48,940 --> 02:57:54,550
trillion I mean the amount of work that

4063
02:57:52,149 --> 02:57:56,139
went into these plants and these this

4064
02:57:54,549 --> 02:57:58,509
method I mean these you're not gonna

4065
02:57:56,139 --> 02:58:00,159
find these clones on the market no any

4066
02:57:58,510 --> 02:58:01,750
time school he's got a contract it

4067
02:58:00,159 --> 02:58:03,729
though you know they'll be yeah they

4068
02:58:01,750 --> 02:58:06,790
will find people you know people that

4069
02:58:03,729 --> 02:58:08,199
are serious partners will be licensed

4070
02:58:06,790 --> 02:58:12,670
the technology and all that kind of [ __ ]

4071
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:15,850
right it's [ __ ] awesome this is this

4072
02:58:12,670 --> 02:58:18,010
is good progress yeah right people are

4073
02:58:15,850 --> 02:58:19,239
doing good work you know it's like just

4074
02:58:18,010 --> 02:58:20,829
because you don't know about it

4075
02:58:19,239 --> 02:58:22,360
necessarily doesn't mean it's not

4076
02:58:20,829 --> 02:58:25,809
happening out there and every once in a

4077
02:58:22,360 --> 02:58:28,270
while you get wowed awhile moment from

4078
02:58:25,809 --> 02:58:31,000
time era and the good people at Nate Pro

4079
02:58:28,270 --> 02:58:35,110
yeah you gotta gotta give credit to the

4080
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:40,299
neighborhood folks of course yeah

4081
02:58:35,110 --> 02:58:41,920
absolutely we give all credit then it

4082
02:58:40,299 --> 02:58:44,199
was up but you came and shared it so I

4083
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:45,190
give you a little bit of credit too no

4084
02:58:44,200 --> 02:58:48,400
it's very cool

4085
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:50,200
the I had a question for you guys cuz

4086
02:58:48,399 --> 02:58:52,728
that kind of was something I was gonna

4087
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:54,229
bring up today what and

4088
02:58:52,728 --> 02:58:58,849
skel don't we'll probably be all over

4089
02:58:54,228 --> 02:59:05,208
this one to answer it but we did some we

4090
02:58:58,850 --> 02:59:08,509
did some tests on converting th da to

4091
02:59:05,209 --> 02:59:10,609
THC and or to CBN and figured out some

4092
02:59:08,509 --> 02:59:13,488
different different methods of how to do

4093
02:59:10,609 --> 02:59:17,890
this but there was something while we

4094
02:59:13,488 --> 02:59:20,948
were doing doing this process we were

4095
02:59:17,889 --> 02:59:23,658
like in the Jack Frost example when we

4096
02:59:20,949 --> 02:59:28,328
used Jack Frost terpenes with Jack Frost

4097
02:59:23,658 --> 02:59:30,408
flower oil and and had it from a

4098
02:59:28,328 --> 02:59:33,578
originally tested which would be

4099
02:59:30,408 --> 02:59:37,038
probably I'd say under 3% active

4100
02:59:33,578 --> 02:59:42,798
applying no heat to it but just actually

4101
02:59:37,039 --> 02:59:46,399
soaking it in its own terpenes at a say

4102
02:59:42,799 --> 02:59:48,770
20 or 30% range we found over a course

4103
02:59:46,398 --> 02:59:53,118
of time organically with no heat that it

4104
02:59:48,770 --> 02:59:55,908
actually converted 60 70 percent of the

4105
02:59:53,119 --> 02:59:58,850
THC over to THC when I tested it later

4106
02:59:55,908 --> 03:00:04,998
what's your thoughts on the way that

4107
02:59:58,850 --> 03:00:07,969
other terpenes can play so converting

4108
03:00:04,998 --> 03:00:09,770
the THC a to THC basically just

4109
03:00:07,968 --> 03:00:13,368
activating it without any heat but

4110
03:00:09,770 --> 03:00:17,299
rather an organic just using terpenes

4111
03:00:13,369 --> 03:00:18,949
just a saturation of terpenes oh and you

4112
03:00:17,299 --> 03:00:22,249
and you think did that sped up the

4113
03:00:18,949 --> 03:00:25,879
decarboxylation rate of THC I just just

4114
03:00:22,248 --> 03:00:28,218
what you thought the potential was yeah

4115
03:00:25,879 --> 03:00:30,919
I mean there's all kinds of things that

4116
03:00:28,218 --> 03:00:35,269
can catalyze that heat is one thing but

4117
03:00:30,918 --> 03:00:37,699
also light and air and other things and

4118
03:00:35,270 --> 03:00:41,088
yeah I think that if it was in a solid

4119
03:00:37,699 --> 03:00:44,539
form and if its crystalline it's one

4120
03:00:41,088 --> 03:00:46,789
thing because you have the low energy

4121
03:00:44,539 --> 03:00:49,279
form of the crystalline lattice to break

4122
03:00:46,789 --> 03:00:51,229
up to overcome but once you do make a

4123
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:54,799
solution can you increase this

4124
03:00:51,228 --> 03:00:59,179
degradation rate absolutely I could see

4125
03:00:54,799 --> 03:01:00,459
that happen how long did it take to do

4126
03:00:59,180 --> 03:01:03,020
that

4127
03:01:00,459 --> 03:01:05,449
so this was like just what we were just

4128
03:01:03,020 --> 03:01:06,409
what we were calling are like you know

4129
03:01:05,449 --> 03:01:10,730
when you were creating a high

4130
03:01:06,409 --> 03:01:14,030
terpene rosin this was over a period of

4131
03:01:10,729 --> 03:01:16,399
I'd say not that long maybe a couple

4132
03:01:14,030 --> 03:01:18,800
months to three months we tested it once

4133
03:01:16,399 --> 03:01:20,629
and then we tested again and I noticed

4134
03:01:18,799 --> 03:01:23,449
by the third time I was like wow there's

4135
03:01:20,629 --> 03:01:25,850
a 50% conversion here and it didn't it

4136
03:01:23,450 --> 03:01:28,820
didn't change the container or exposure

4137
03:01:25,851 --> 03:01:33,260
to light or change temperature it was

4138
03:01:28,819 --> 03:01:35,869
actually kept like 50 degrees yeah I

4139
03:01:33,260 --> 03:01:38,271
could see that it is exposed to light or

4140
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:42,530
is it kept in the dark light no low

4141
03:01:38,271 --> 03:01:44,780
light yeah I don't know so I said these

4142
03:01:42,530 --> 03:01:46,970
are HPLC results obviously cuz you're

4143
03:01:44,780 --> 03:01:49,641
measuring acid right yeah we go through

4144
03:01:46,969 --> 03:01:52,189
se labs I have like a bulk account we're

4145
03:01:49,640 --> 03:01:54,350
always testing like everybody stuff that

4146
03:01:52,190 --> 03:01:55,610
comes to us for pesticides whatever you

4147
03:01:54,351 --> 03:01:57,860
have a small amount of the original

4148
03:01:55,610 --> 03:02:00,050
sample so you know that that first data

4149
03:01:57,860 --> 03:02:01,851
point is actually valid yeah I do

4150
03:02:00,049 --> 03:02:03,890
I was just curious what you thought

4151
03:02:01,851 --> 03:02:07,010
about it or what people thought because

4152
03:02:03,890 --> 03:02:08,930
it appears it would make sense kind of

4153
03:02:07,010 --> 03:02:11,989
on this topic of conversation where

4154
03:02:08,930 --> 03:02:13,940
people are breeding now that there's

4155
03:02:11,989 --> 03:02:17,090
people breeding like varieties out there

4156
03:02:13,940 --> 03:02:19,130
for specific terpene profiles with

4157
03:02:17,090 --> 03:02:22,880
specific ratios of those particular

4158
03:02:19,129 --> 03:02:25,159
cannabinoids what the chemical or with

4159
03:02:22,879 --> 03:02:28,100
that what that then would lead down into

4160
03:02:25,159 --> 03:02:31,399
an extraction process so that person has

4161
03:02:28,101 --> 03:02:34,069
now a CBD CB V with a certain terpene

4162
03:02:31,399 --> 03:02:37,010
expression and perhaps we can create an

4163
03:02:34,069 --> 03:02:40,159
organic chemical reaction with utilizing

4164
03:02:37,010 --> 03:02:42,351
the terpenes themselves as a catalyst

4165
03:02:40,159 --> 03:02:44,209
instead of heat or light because we came

4166
03:02:42,351 --> 03:02:47,180
up with something else now I can convert

4167
03:02:44,209 --> 03:02:50,329
I have figured out a way not with

4168
03:02:47,180 --> 03:02:54,530
terpenes but a different way to convert

4169
03:02:50,329 --> 03:02:57,229
our hash rosin or flour rosin to cbn

4170
03:02:54,530 --> 03:02:59,271
without losing any volume of weight but

4171
03:02:57,229 --> 03:03:01,250
rather convert yeah I thought your

4172
03:02:59,271 --> 03:03:04,280
eyebrows would go up on that so if I

4173
03:03:01,250 --> 03:03:08,780
start with a thousand grams of 70

4174
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:11,150
percent of flour rosin or hash rosin or

4175
03:03:08,780 --> 03:03:14,500
an 80 percent distillate

4176
03:03:11,149 --> 03:03:16,940
I can convert that to CBN without any

4177
03:03:14,500 --> 03:03:20,219
without any of your traditional lighter

4178
03:03:16,940 --> 03:03:22,470
Heat in another way

4179
03:03:20,219 --> 03:03:27,170
that we developed without any chemicals

4180
03:03:22,469 --> 03:03:29,639
that will convert that thousand grams to

4181
03:03:27,170 --> 03:03:33,450
well some other things it's it's not

4182
03:03:29,639 --> 03:03:35,099
that it's it's it's not really my tech

4183
03:03:33,450 --> 03:03:37,260
to share but some other scientists that

4184
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:39,479
I worked on with it for a while they

4185
03:03:37,260 --> 03:03:41,639
came up with it and obviously had me

4186
03:03:39,478 --> 03:03:44,278
sign some paperwork but I was looking

4187
03:03:41,639 --> 03:03:46,139
for it for our p4 because I wanted to

4188
03:03:44,279 --> 03:03:48,000
upscale it because we originally I

4189
03:03:46,139 --> 03:03:50,459
talked about it before and release that

4190
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:52,859
in Toronto how we sift and then we use

4191
03:03:50,459 --> 03:03:55,818
heat and oxygen to break the SIF down so

4192
03:03:52,859 --> 03:03:58,770
we have like 250 milligrams of THC a

4193
03:03:55,818 --> 03:04:01,909
converged about 70 milligrams of CBN

4194
03:03:58,770 --> 03:04:04,738
it's just a really long tedious

4195
03:04:01,909 --> 03:04:06,539
laborious process and it's really like

4196
03:04:04,738 --> 03:04:10,289
kind of a degra gated nasty blood

4197
03:04:06,540 --> 03:04:12,720
looking oil at the end but it's just

4198
03:04:10,290 --> 03:04:14,880
people are individual so how do you

4199
03:04:12,719 --> 03:04:16,108
scale it up was converting converting

4200
03:04:14,879 --> 03:04:20,629
this without losing weight so now we

4201
03:04:16,109 --> 03:04:23,130
could take like a 70 or 80 percent THC a

4202
03:04:20,629 --> 03:04:25,559
rosin or hashish rosin or flour rosin or

4203
03:04:23,129 --> 03:04:28,318
distillate if you will even if it's THC

4204
03:04:25,559 --> 03:04:30,719
convert that to CBN without losing any

4205
03:04:28,318 --> 03:04:32,488
weight at a 50 percent so if I'm 70

4206
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:35,728
percent flour rosin when I'm done I'm

4207
03:04:32,488 --> 03:04:39,260
350 milligrams of CBN with under the

4208
03:04:35,728 --> 03:04:44,789
point one THC without losing any volume

4209
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:46,350
of the weight so in that process I

4210
03:04:44,790 --> 03:04:49,739
started thinking about how terpenes

4211
03:04:46,350 --> 03:04:52,170
could be catalyst for converting THC by

4212
03:04:49,738 --> 03:04:54,180
just having just these random little

4213
03:04:52,170 --> 03:04:55,770
experiments going along the side I just

4214
03:04:54,180 --> 03:04:57,329
didn't know what you thought about it I

4215
03:04:55,770 --> 03:04:59,729
thought maybe I was crazy there's no

4216
03:04:57,329 --> 03:05:02,459
nothing compelling in most cannabis

4217
03:04:59,728 --> 03:05:04,438
terpenes to promote decarboxylation if

4218
03:05:02,459 --> 03:05:06,869
they would why would they just

4219
03:05:04,439 --> 03:05:08,818
decarboxylate on the plants right they

4220
03:05:06,870 --> 03:05:10,220
could exist on the plant you know now

4221
03:05:08,818 --> 03:05:12,449
what you're saying is you're somehow

4222
03:05:10,219 --> 03:05:15,090
extracting them and combining them and

4223
03:05:12,450 --> 03:05:19,500
doing some kind of you know most that

4224
03:05:15,090 --> 03:05:25,130
would be catalytic as you're just

4225
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:25,129
lowering the activation energy to

4226
03:05:25,459 --> 03:05:30,318
decarboxylation happens at room

4227
03:05:27,450 --> 03:05:32,939
temperature it happens quicker at

4228
03:05:30,318 --> 03:05:34,019
elevated temperature and everywhere in

4229
03:05:32,939 --> 03:05:36,600
between it's just as

4230
03:05:34,020 --> 03:05:40,710
you know the amount of decarboxylation

4231
03:05:36,600 --> 03:05:44,189
has to do with you know either thermal

4232
03:05:40,709 --> 03:05:47,578
history typically it's seen but I can't

4233
03:05:44,189 --> 03:05:54,029
think of anything off top my head why it

4234
03:05:47,578 --> 03:05:57,629
would be promoting decarboxylation but

4235
03:05:54,029 --> 03:06:02,819
um the dehydrogenation event is

4236
03:05:57,629 --> 03:06:05,599
interesting to to to CBN right so you

4237
03:06:02,818 --> 03:06:09,510
say that you have a method to convert

4238
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:13,439
THC to CBN which is always yeah I mean

4239
03:06:09,510 --> 03:06:17,010
it's so Arnaz PhD dissertation you can

4240
03:06:13,439 --> 03:06:19,738
do that stoichiometrically using

4241
03:06:17,010 --> 03:06:21,898
selenium based oxidation or sulfur or

4242
03:06:19,738 --> 03:06:26,279
sofox I'd there's a lot of other ways

4243
03:06:21,898 --> 03:06:31,698
that I'm not saying it's there's that at

4244
03:06:26,279 --> 03:06:35,430
all the point is is that yeah when it's

4245
03:06:31,699 --> 03:06:37,710
oxidized all that those terpenes and all

4246
03:06:35,430 --> 03:06:40,139
of those other fragile thermally

4247
03:06:37,709 --> 03:06:42,959
sensitive molecules are are just going

4248
03:06:40,139 --> 03:06:45,238
to create just pollard aggravated

4249
03:06:42,959 --> 03:06:47,750
colored compounds and that's all the

4250
03:06:45,238 --> 03:06:50,698
crap because the Sam will attest to

4251
03:06:47,750 --> 03:06:53,818
CBN's a white colorless solid I don't

4252
03:06:50,699 --> 03:06:55,408
think it has any color to it at all

4253
03:06:53,818 --> 03:06:56,850
so I mean you know that's one thing I

4254
03:06:55,408 --> 03:06:59,520
was going to say that this is opaque

4255
03:06:56,850 --> 03:07:02,880
gray the cvn that we're getting in the

4256
03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:04,859
oil when I'm done with that you should

4257
03:07:02,879 --> 03:07:08,068
try recrystallizing it I think it's

4258
03:07:04,859 --> 03:07:10,109
recrystallized from methanol I think is

4259
03:07:08,068 --> 03:07:11,519
usually where it's okay because I was

4260
03:07:10,109 --> 03:07:15,000
going to say that on the crystallization

4261
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:17,578
of CBN to get it into crystallization

4262
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:19,469
and like terpenes being yeah nine

4263
03:07:17,578 --> 03:07:21,420
non-polar well everything I'm trying to

4264
03:07:19,469 --> 03:07:23,250
do is chemicals but that's what the

4265
03:07:21,420 --> 03:07:26,010
scientists I mean other people would say

4266
03:07:23,250 --> 03:07:27,629
yeah did it say you could recrystallized

4267
03:07:26,010 --> 03:07:29,609
right here oh the purity and then you

4268
03:07:27,629 --> 03:07:32,129
can analyze it and when you only find

4269
03:07:29,609 --> 03:07:34,140
one compound that it's CB n then you

4270
03:07:32,129 --> 03:07:36,778
know that all this [ __ ] that you

4271
03:07:34,139 --> 03:07:38,969
purified away if you do have a solid

4272
03:07:36,779 --> 03:07:41,340
coming out of that it probably is CB n u

4273
03:07:38,969 --> 03:07:43,349
s-- need to purify it you can flash it

4274
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:45,210
down a little chromatography column or

4275
03:07:43,350 --> 03:07:47,579
do whatever you need to do to hang up

4276
03:07:45,209 --> 03:07:50,579
any of the other bodies because I think

4277
03:07:47,579 --> 03:07:54,180
and I think Sam has actually shown a

4278
03:07:50,579 --> 03:07:57,049
sample here on hash Church white

4279
03:07:54,180 --> 03:07:58,200
crystalline solid it's like white is as

4280
03:07:57,049 --> 03:08:00,420
THCA

4281
03:07:58,200 --> 03:08:02,370
I mean it's it's a white crystalline

4282
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:06,750
solid I I do believe come on I've never

4283
03:08:02,370 --> 03:08:12,690
seen it myself but could you say suspend

4284
03:08:06,750 --> 03:08:16,459
the the oil and ethanol and bubble pure

4285
03:08:12,690 --> 03:08:16,460
oxygen through it to convert it

4286
03:08:18,690 --> 03:08:25,530
I would I would just not use oxygen I

4287
03:08:22,290 --> 03:08:30,030
would just use air right because I don't

4288
03:08:25,530 --> 03:08:31,950
like heating up oxygen because oxygen if

4289
03:08:30,030 --> 03:08:35,340
you have things that will do higher

4290
03:08:31,950 --> 03:08:37,860
oxidation yeah it could be really really

4291
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:39,630
bad thank you really all you need is air

4292
03:08:37,860 --> 03:08:44,940
now can there's difference you can

4293
03:08:39,629 --> 03:08:46,799
accelerate that you can add basically I

4294
03:08:44,940 --> 03:08:49,260
I'm not going to give away anyone's IP

4295
03:08:46,799 --> 03:08:50,939
and I probably shouldn't talk about it

4296
03:08:49,260 --> 03:08:53,340
but the point is is that look in the

4297
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:55,950
literature there are methods for the

4298
03:08:53,340 --> 03:08:58,909
stoichiometric conversion of THC the CBN

4299
03:08:55,950 --> 03:08:58,909
we'll just leave it at that

4300
03:08:59,239 --> 03:09:10,199
yeah I was just musing I was thinking

4301
03:09:05,540 --> 03:09:12,271
oxygen and I wouldn't yeah oxygen oxygen

4302
03:09:10,200 --> 03:09:14,730
under pressure with any kind of yeah

4303
03:09:12,271 --> 03:09:20,550
it's it could be explosive well I don't

4304
03:09:14,729 --> 03:09:24,959
even I mean I'm talking about bubbling

4305
03:09:20,549 --> 03:09:27,270
some yeah I tried I tried taking once

4306
03:09:24,959 --> 03:09:29,429
upon a time we tried taking like pump

4307
03:09:27,271 --> 03:09:32,460
just air through regulators through oil

4308
03:09:29,430 --> 03:09:35,159
tried to heat it I tried to take rosin

4309
03:09:32,459 --> 03:09:39,989
in the past and tortured it like 500 600

4310
03:09:35,159 --> 03:09:44,420
800 degrees none of that seemed to do

4311
03:09:39,989 --> 03:09:47,639
the trick and it's definitely something

4312
03:09:44,420 --> 03:09:49,021
that I was interested in and these two

4313
03:09:47,639 --> 03:09:51,539
other guys are discovered it they're

4314
03:09:49,021 --> 03:09:52,920
very techie scientists people I'm like I

4315
03:09:51,540 --> 03:09:54,030
think you guys fight

4316
03:09:52,920 --> 03:09:55,469
you know it's through their company I

4317
03:09:54,030 --> 03:09:58,170
was like think you guys might like have

4318
03:09:55,469 --> 03:09:59,699
a patentable thing here and they're like

4319
03:09:58,170 --> 03:10:01,408
what do you mean I'm like I don't know

4320
03:09:59,700 --> 03:10:03,119
anyone else doing this and

4321
03:10:01,408 --> 03:10:06,708
I've seen a lot of the different stuff

4322
03:10:03,119 --> 03:10:09,328
and I just put idea in their head and

4323
03:10:06,709 --> 03:10:10,770
you know I try to you know trying to

4324
03:10:09,328 --> 03:10:13,378
figure out things without chemicals but

4325
03:10:10,770 --> 03:10:15,719
yeah at the end the polarity plays a big

4326
03:10:13,379 --> 03:10:17,520
difference because THC a and it's a

4327
03:10:15,718 --> 03:10:21,358
polarity on like a hexane or a

4328
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:23,399
hydrocarbon the non-polar effect allows

4329
03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:26,939
it to crystallize very easily but when

4330
03:10:23,398 --> 03:10:28,728
you get to CB n polarity plays a big

4331
03:10:26,939 --> 03:10:32,158
part in how you would crystallize that

4332
03:10:28,728 --> 03:10:34,349
at least naturally so the only viable

4333
03:10:32,158 --> 03:10:36,328
solution was probably a chemical like

4334
03:10:34,350 --> 03:10:39,029
you're saying just to just to get it

4335
03:10:36,328 --> 03:10:41,248
done just to say okay here it is let's

4336
03:10:39,029 --> 03:10:42,629
test it you know hey I got a quick point

4337
03:10:41,248 --> 03:10:44,578
another thing I wanted to bring up from

4338
03:10:42,629 --> 03:10:46,079
the ICR just kind of on topic and it's

4339
03:10:44,578 --> 03:10:49,679
something that dr. shel Doan has been

4340
03:10:46,078 --> 03:10:51,779
saying for a long time but these guys

4341
03:10:49,679 --> 03:10:53,429
who actually went through and the the

4342
03:10:51,779 --> 03:10:56,129
researchers name was Melissa Lewis

4343
03:10:53,429 --> 03:10:57,869
unrelated to mark and she's working in

4344
03:10:56,129 --> 03:10:59,338
Toronto with one of the universities

4345
03:10:57,869 --> 03:11:01,140
there are a few of the universities

4346
03:10:59,338 --> 03:11:03,718
there and anyway they did a bunch of

4347
03:11:01,139 --> 03:11:05,608
extracts using supercritical and ethanol

4348
03:11:03,718 --> 03:11:07,738
and a bunch of different extract types

4349
03:11:05,609 --> 03:11:12,418
and then they ran the extracts through

4350
03:11:07,738 --> 03:11:14,009
an MSO GCMs device and they noted that

4351
03:11:12,418 --> 03:11:17,189
there was a whole bunch of chemistry

4352
03:11:14,009 --> 03:11:19,728
that actually had gone on in the in the

4353
03:11:17,189 --> 03:11:21,838
process and they showed that some

4354
03:11:19,728 --> 03:11:25,528
compounds were created and some

4355
03:11:21,838 --> 03:11:28,918
compounds were removed from the from

4356
03:11:25,529 --> 03:11:31,408
matrix just just by the process of doing

4357
03:11:28,918 --> 03:11:34,109
the extraction so you know again what

4358
03:11:31,408 --> 03:11:35,668
Mark has been saying for for months and

4359
03:11:34,109 --> 03:11:39,498
months and months now probably longer

4360
03:11:35,668 --> 03:11:42,179
yeah when you're doing these extractions

4361
03:11:39,498 --> 03:11:43,949
there's chemistry that's going on and

4362
03:11:42,179 --> 03:11:46,559
it's not you're not just pulling it

4363
03:11:43,949 --> 03:11:49,529
pulling out what is in there right it's

4364
03:11:46,559 --> 03:11:52,798
all about optimizing the process so that

4365
03:11:49,529 --> 03:11:54,209
you're capturing what's in the flower

4366
03:11:52,799 --> 03:11:55,409
you know otherwise you are doing

4367
03:11:54,209 --> 03:11:56,009
chemistry and you're changing it into

4368
03:11:55,408 --> 03:11:57,718
something else

4369
03:11:56,009 --> 03:12:00,509
anyhow I asked her if I could take a

4370
03:11:57,718 --> 03:12:01,678
photo of her data to share it and she

4371
03:12:00,509 --> 03:12:03,629
said no because they're gonna be

4372
03:12:01,679 --> 03:12:05,100
publishing so they're gonna be

4373
03:12:03,629 --> 03:12:08,640
publishing it sometime hopefully in the

4374
03:12:05,100 --> 03:12:10,408
next six months and we'll be able to go

4375
03:12:08,639 --> 03:12:12,658
it over go over things a little more in

4376
03:12:10,408 --> 03:12:14,449
depth at that point in time did she see

4377
03:12:12,658 --> 03:12:17,029
the formation of a she

4378
03:12:14,450 --> 03:12:19,040
I'm just curious was that like a

4379
03:12:17,030 --> 03:12:23,300
degradation product that she found in

4380
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:25,760
her in her work no but there was some

4381
03:12:23,299 --> 03:12:27,739
really interesting things that I'll tell

4382
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:29,510
you offline well that's something we

4383
03:12:27,739 --> 03:12:32,719
could look at when I'm gonna do this

4384
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:34,969
experiment again for you mark then and

4385
03:12:32,719 --> 03:12:36,949
for everyone that's listening and see if

4386
03:12:34,969 --> 03:12:39,500
there is I now that I'm gonna do it

4387
03:12:36,950 --> 03:12:42,530
specifically with Jack Frost again I'll

4388
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:44,540
start with the flour or rosin get it

4389
03:12:42,530 --> 03:12:46,880
tested then I'll have the terpenes

4390
03:12:44,540 --> 03:12:49,220
tested then I'll combine the two then

4391
03:12:46,879 --> 03:12:51,409
I'll monitor it over one month to six

4392
03:12:49,219 --> 03:12:53,899
months get the degradation see the

4393
03:12:51,409 --> 03:12:56,360
conversion and see if it see if that

4394
03:12:53,899 --> 03:12:58,579
happens you know we'll do make sure -

4395
03:12:56,360 --> 03:13:02,659
room to make sure you're using lab that

4396
03:12:58,579 --> 03:13:05,059
has GCMs because most people are using f

4397
03:13:02,659 --> 03:13:06,590
ID and they don't know that is what does

4398
03:13:05,059 --> 03:13:09,199
SC labs use because that's what we've

4399
03:13:06,590 --> 03:13:10,460
been using they use GCF ID so they're

4400
03:13:09,200 --> 03:13:12,409
they've run like an algorithm

4401
03:13:10,459 --> 03:13:14,779
essentially has computers pull out the

4402
03:13:12,409 --> 03:13:16,219
known Peaks but hash oisin is not going

4403
03:13:14,780 --> 03:13:18,590
to be a Terp that they're looking for

4404
03:13:16,219 --> 03:13:21,019
who can I send that to well they might

4405
03:13:18,590 --> 03:13:24,110
have a mess I'm not sure but I believe

4406
03:13:21,020 --> 03:13:26,840
they probably do have a GCMs but you're

4407
03:13:24,110 --> 03:13:28,790
gonna have to go in and say hey I don't

4408
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:31,960
want your standard turf test I want you

4409
03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:34,760
to look for the presence of hashing okay

4410
03:13:31,959 --> 03:13:37,009
okay right because if they're there

4411
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:41,960
they're typical turf tests they run on

4412
03:13:37,010 --> 03:13:43,850
GCF ID won't pick it up yeah and and

4413
03:13:41,959 --> 03:13:46,188
that wasn't actually the the mechanism

4414
03:13:43,850 --> 03:13:49,130
that was implicated by the authors in

4415
03:13:46,189 --> 03:13:52,069
that paper was a photo lytic mechanism

4416
03:13:49,129 --> 03:13:55,279
where you got a recombination of the die

4417
03:13:52,069 --> 03:14:00,049
radical that's formed formed when Mir

4418
03:13:55,280 --> 03:14:02,689
seen is is irradiated with light so I

4419
03:14:00,049 --> 03:14:05,478
mean again some of these things happen

4420
03:14:02,689 --> 03:14:07,250
thermally as well as photo lytic ly but

4421
03:14:05,478 --> 03:14:10,279
that particular one it would be

4422
03:14:07,250 --> 03:14:14,329
interesting to do that on a mere scene

4423
03:14:10,280 --> 03:14:17,020
enriched variety like this data shows to

4424
03:14:14,329 --> 03:14:20,840
take someone that has a lot of Mir seen

4425
03:14:17,020 --> 03:14:22,819
those types of degradation components in

4426
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:26,049
there and that was you know one there

4427
03:14:22,819 --> 03:14:27,851
are several thermal pathways that

4428
03:14:26,049 --> 03:14:30,069
terpenes

4429
03:14:27,851 --> 03:14:32,230
especially with the Marcin skeleton and

4430
03:14:30,069 --> 03:14:34,720
will either rearrange to give the

4431
03:14:32,229 --> 03:14:36,790
terpene turpentine

4432
03:14:34,720 --> 03:14:39,550
Sabbatini I mean there's a whole family

4433
03:14:36,790 --> 03:14:42,010
of them and they're just ice American

4434
03:14:39,550 --> 03:14:44,199
where the double bonds are and when

4435
03:14:42,011 --> 03:14:47,711
those things are formed thoroughly

4436
03:14:44,200 --> 03:14:50,740
they're usually formed a mixture of like

4437
03:14:47,710 --> 03:14:53,109
four or five compounds so uncommon turns

4438
03:14:50,739 --> 03:14:55,659
to four five like instantly just because

4439
03:14:53,110 --> 03:14:57,551
of these thermal degradation routes but

4440
03:14:55,659 --> 03:15:00,190
yeah thanks for pointing that in that

4441
03:14:57,550 --> 03:15:03,130
right I've shaded do you remember the

4442
03:15:00,190 --> 03:15:07,511
original paper what the conversion rate

4443
03:15:03,130 --> 03:15:09,880
was from mersin to hash machine I know

4444
03:15:07,511 --> 03:15:11,200
but they measured it I mean I'd have to

4445
03:15:09,880 --> 03:15:13,659
pull it up I don't have it off the top

4446
03:15:11,200 --> 03:15:16,120
my head yeah because he did was tested

4447
03:15:13,659 --> 03:15:19,060
it after the fact and not before maybe

4448
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:22,240
but well I thought in that paper they

4449
03:15:19,060 --> 03:15:25,091
actually intentionally did it on mersin

4450
03:15:22,239 --> 03:15:26,890
itself to look for it and also I think

4451
03:15:25,091 --> 03:15:29,860
found literature precedent for this

4452
03:15:26,890 --> 03:15:32,649
reaction variously and it hadn't been

4453
03:15:29,860 --> 03:15:35,021
observed I guess on hash but and I guess

4454
03:15:32,649 --> 03:15:37,479
the the point maybe that you're trying

4455
03:15:35,021 --> 03:15:42,311
to raise him is that this is thought of

4456
03:15:37,479 --> 03:15:46,421
as sort of like the-- the thermodynamic

4457
03:15:42,310 --> 03:15:48,790
dead end of hash that's been shined the

4458
03:15:46,421 --> 03:15:51,581
light on for a long period of time it

4459
03:15:48,790 --> 03:15:54,430
was ultimately night will be versus but

4460
03:15:51,581 --> 03:15:57,909
maybe it's just been pressed with heat

4461
03:15:54,431 --> 03:16:01,631
and it's a little bit old and it's

4462
03:15:57,909 --> 03:16:03,550
present maybe I don't really know right

4463
03:16:01,630 --> 03:16:05,140
maybe the conversion was done in

4464
03:16:03,550 --> 03:16:10,300
planteth maybe was done when it was long

4465
03:16:05,140 --> 03:16:12,880
ago plan that's funny I have my doubts

4466
03:16:10,300 --> 03:16:15,970
but I could be wrong you know we don't I

4467
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:19,779
mean it was because the tests were done

4468
03:16:15,970 --> 03:16:23,831
by French police one on seized samples

4469
03:16:19,780 --> 03:16:26,851
oh we have no idea where in the chain of

4470
03:16:23,831 --> 03:16:28,690
custody that conversion happened right

4471
03:16:26,851 --> 03:16:33,870
yeah I could do all those little

4472
03:16:28,690 --> 03:16:37,360
experiments we could run wash it to six

4473
03:16:33,870 --> 03:16:39,940
variety that's easy I mean that's we

4474
03:16:37,360 --> 03:16:41,770
could take a I mean we could there's

4475
03:16:39,940 --> 03:16:44,859
access to blue dream which is

4476
03:16:41,770 --> 03:16:46,899
honestly very very very high in mercy

4477
03:16:44,859 --> 03:16:48,970
that season no I tried look for Tony is

4478
03:16:46,898 --> 03:16:51,099
looking for athlete f qu e is like I've

4479
03:16:48,969 --> 03:16:52,840
got tons of that we got it out here if

4480
03:16:51,100 --> 03:16:54,850
you see the phenotype that's almost

4481
03:16:52,840 --> 03:16:57,789
exclusively mere scene there's one out

4482
03:16:54,850 --> 03:17:00,189
there that might okay that one's

4483
03:16:57,789 --> 03:17:01,750
absolutely prevalent and you know what's

4484
03:17:00,189 --> 03:17:09,059
interesting that one's usually from the

4485
03:17:01,750 --> 03:17:09,059
guys that I get that ones 25% plus THC -

4486
03:17:09,238 --> 03:17:19,629
you know okay that's pretty cool

4487
03:17:15,270 --> 03:17:21,729
everybody's got homework yeah we do damn

4488
03:17:19,629 --> 03:17:23,978
did he ever drop out fast after saying

4489
03:17:21,728 --> 03:17:30,250
that that was like I should end church

4490
03:17:23,978 --> 03:17:33,519
one day like that ah man oh yeah so

4491
03:17:30,250 --> 03:17:37,029
we're also like mark created in the same

4492
03:17:33,520 --> 03:17:39,970
type of process rosin distillate again

4493
03:17:37,029 --> 03:17:45,158
without winterizing with alcohol Wow

4494
03:17:39,969 --> 03:17:47,769
he's CEO he's back he's back but yeah

4495
03:17:45,158 --> 03:17:48,939
we're creating these different I was

4496
03:17:47,770 --> 03:17:50,529
just trying to create different products

4497
03:17:48,939 --> 03:17:53,260
because we've got public man and I got

4498
03:17:50,529 --> 03:17:57,279
some other projects in the horizon but

4499
03:17:53,260 --> 03:17:59,199
it was how do we create like you know a

4500
03:17:57,279 --> 03:18:01,869
distillate out of rosin without

4501
03:17:59,199 --> 03:18:04,989
winterizing and in that same process it

4502
03:18:01,869 --> 03:18:10,300
was like alright well we can do that but

4503
03:18:04,988 --> 03:18:12,459
we could also do a conversion in the CBN

4504
03:18:10,299 --> 03:18:15,250
so next week I should have some

4505
03:18:12,459 --> 03:18:17,169
hopefully and I'll show it to you and as

4506
03:18:15,250 --> 03:18:23,199
you tell tell me what was the chemical

4507
03:18:17,170 --> 03:18:25,359
you ever spoke cBAM I smoked our CBN but

4508
03:18:23,199 --> 03:18:30,609
that was a using heat and degra gated

4509
03:18:25,359 --> 03:18:32,529
this is this won't use it yeah yeah but

4510
03:18:30,609 --> 03:18:34,809
we have it in pill form in sublingual

4511
03:18:32,529 --> 03:18:37,510
form CBD and CBN for like four years now

4512
03:18:34,809 --> 03:18:40,359
is all from but it's a different process

4513
03:18:37,510 --> 03:18:43,630
it's it's a long process and then to

4514
03:18:40,359 --> 03:18:49,630
discover 64 and Fort Collins and we'll

4515
03:18:43,629 --> 03:18:51,639
run an NMR and HPLC okay the nth degree

4516
03:18:49,629 --> 03:18:54,309
of everything that you have in there

4517
03:18:51,639 --> 03:18:55,478
very cool what's the what was the

4518
03:18:54,309 --> 03:18:57,879
chemical you were saying

4519
03:18:55,478 --> 03:19:00,278
to crystallize that I'll try it no I

4520
03:18:57,879 --> 03:19:04,538
would say a good place to start would be

4521
03:19:00,279 --> 03:19:05,979
maybe methanol or ethanol I mean again

4522
03:19:04,539 --> 03:19:09,189
just try to make a saturated solution

4523
03:19:05,978 --> 03:19:11,769
material boil it up so it dissolves and

4524
03:19:09,189 --> 03:19:14,289
then just you know look to see if you

4525
03:19:11,770 --> 03:19:17,078
can crystallize it like you would grow a

4526
03:19:14,289 --> 03:19:19,840
piece of rock candy you know it is is a

4527
03:19:17,078 --> 03:19:23,590
polar molecule okay yeah that one would

4528
03:19:19,840 --> 03:19:26,380
work methanol yeah well methanol or

4529
03:19:23,590 --> 03:19:32,699
ethanol it's toxic you may want it what

4530
03:19:26,379 --> 03:19:34,988
about purified like 95% ethanol like a

4531
03:19:32,699 --> 03:19:38,140
organic what about an organic ethanol

4532
03:19:34,988 --> 03:19:39,609
like from great like it doesn't make a

4533
03:19:38,139 --> 03:19:41,948
difference just you're just trying to

4534
03:19:39,609 --> 03:19:45,908
crystallize I got something I have an

4535
03:19:41,949 --> 03:19:49,119
organic one yeah I know what to use for

4536
03:19:45,908 --> 03:19:53,288
that alright cool

4537
03:19:49,119 --> 03:19:55,180
we shall see so the the other thing I

4538
03:19:53,289 --> 03:19:58,060
wanted to get back to what Peter was

4539
03:19:55,180 --> 03:20:01,090
saying and that is that um you know you

4540
03:19:58,059 --> 03:20:04,648
were talking about sense and like human

4541
03:20:01,090 --> 03:20:07,299
sense of a big part of the human

4542
03:20:04,648 --> 03:20:09,760
effluent is actually you know there's

4543
03:20:07,299 --> 03:20:13,929
lactic gases a lot of lactic acid that's

4544
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:15,850
actually given off by people and that

4545
03:20:13,930 --> 03:20:17,498
has to do with just islands of

4546
03:20:15,850 --> 03:20:20,498
biochemical processes that are happening

4547
03:20:17,498 --> 03:20:24,670
but turns out that's one of the things

4548
03:20:20,498 --> 03:20:27,609
that mosquitoes hold it on a goal marker

4549
03:20:24,670 --> 03:20:30,219
that mosquitoes actually use to identify

4550
03:20:27,609 --> 03:20:33,488
a blood meal so it's thought of that

4551
03:20:30,219 --> 03:20:36,448
deep and other insect repellents somehow

4552
03:20:33,488 --> 03:20:39,788
interfere with the insects ability to

4553
03:20:36,449 --> 03:20:43,180
detect lactic acids like they have a

4554
03:20:39,789 --> 03:20:46,539
particular sensor way of doing that sort

4555
03:20:43,180 --> 03:20:51,970
of chemo specifically and that some

4556
03:20:46,539 --> 03:20:55,420
humans have more lactic acid to the in

4557
03:20:51,969 --> 03:20:57,459
are more attractive to do to mosquitoes

4558
03:20:55,420 --> 03:21:00,520
and other I think like my wife will get

4559
03:20:57,459 --> 03:21:02,889
bit before I will like her system like

4560
03:21:00,520 --> 03:21:05,078
she's like more of mosquito target than

4561
03:21:02,889 --> 03:21:08,260
I am I don't know if it's like that with

4562
03:21:05,078 --> 03:21:09,399
other different people but lactic acid I

4563
03:21:08,260 --> 03:21:13,100
know is a

4564
03:21:09,399 --> 03:21:15,590
for a lot of people has a lot to do with

4565
03:21:13,100 --> 03:21:22,690
the biological you know biome that

4566
03:21:15,590 --> 03:21:22,690
actually lives on your skin right

4567
03:21:24,521 --> 03:21:32,420
are you meeting I was muted I was oh no

4568
03:21:30,021 --> 03:21:35,950
yeah actually it Peter isn't muted but I

4569
03:21:32,420 --> 03:21:41,420
can't hear him now that's weird

4570
03:21:35,950 --> 03:21:44,870
here no you might have mosquitoes in the

4571
03:21:41,420 --> 03:21:48,200
fact that my wife always got bit before

4572
03:21:44,870 --> 03:21:50,690
me and then after she had a serious

4573
03:21:48,200 --> 03:21:52,640
illness and took huge amounts of

4574
03:21:50,690 --> 03:21:54,940
medication they wouldn't bite her

4575
03:21:52,639 --> 03:22:00,459
anymore and instead they would bite me

4576
03:21:54,940 --> 03:22:04,450
huh that's what you say crazy

4577
03:22:00,459 --> 03:22:07,219
yeah certainly it has a lot to do with

4578
03:22:04,450 --> 03:22:08,750
live on your skin I think there's quite

4579
03:22:07,219 --> 03:22:12,260
a bit of bacteria to deal with on

4580
03:22:08,750 --> 03:22:17,180
people's skin naturally hello yes come

4581
03:22:12,260 --> 03:22:19,370
back burgers wait come back well we've

4582
03:22:17,180 --> 03:22:22,190
almost rocked three and a half hours so

4583
03:22:19,370 --> 03:22:25,460
far pastures today not bad not bad at

4584
03:22:22,190 --> 03:22:28,850
all and people were wondering if you

4585
03:22:25,459 --> 03:22:30,829
were standing the whole time yeah I like

4586
03:22:28,850 --> 03:22:34,340
to stand out but I feel like if I'm

4587
03:22:30,829 --> 03:22:36,739
sedentary if I'm just you know City my

4588
03:22:34,340 --> 03:22:39,110
body just starts to you know I'd like to

4589
03:22:36,739 --> 03:22:41,360
be up and I channel better that way

4590
03:22:39,110 --> 03:22:43,670
awesome three plus hours of standing

4591
03:22:41,360 --> 03:22:47,180
this morning well done a PITA and I'm

4592
03:22:43,670 --> 03:22:49,579
probably now gonna go do Despicable Me

4593
03:22:47,180 --> 03:22:52,340
with the little guys so nice oh you will

4594
03:22:49,579 --> 03:22:58,549
you stand in the theater as well yes I

4595
03:22:52,340 --> 03:23:00,559
will that's awesome well played well

4596
03:22:58,549 --> 03:23:04,579
played yes yes I'll be the guy in the

4597
03:23:00,559 --> 03:23:07,489
back stabby corner but yeah I really

4598
03:23:04,579 --> 03:23:09,860
enjoyed I can't thank you enough man for

4599
03:23:07,489 --> 03:23:12,920
having me all you guys I really thank

4600
03:23:09,860 --> 03:23:15,170
you for for hand of the year it's been a

4601
03:23:12,920 --> 03:23:17,000
it's been beautiful absolutely well

4602
03:23:15,170 --> 03:23:20,000
we'll continue the conversation for sure

4603
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:22,549
I have one more question for Peter and

4604
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:26,030
they do

4605
03:23:22,549 --> 03:23:29,688
manufacture your own microorganisms or

4606
03:23:26,030 --> 03:23:31,750
do you purchase them and mix them what

4607
03:23:29,689 --> 03:23:36,470
is it that your company actually does

4608
03:23:31,750 --> 03:23:38,260
yes so we actually around the world

4609
03:23:36,469 --> 03:23:40,699
I mean multiple countries multiple

4610
03:23:38,260 --> 03:23:44,930
environments and we actually isolated

4611
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:46,579
each individual string we we we studied

4612
03:23:44,930 --> 03:23:48,648
and tried to find them so we do

4613
03:23:46,579 --> 03:23:51,139
manufacture them ourselves which is kind

4614
03:23:48,648 --> 03:23:53,478
of nice because you know if you if you

4615
03:23:51,139 --> 03:23:56,719
think about certain things or certain

4616
03:23:53,478 --> 03:23:59,179
products there can be such a diversity

4617
03:23:56,719 --> 03:24:01,369
of strains and you don't really know

4618
03:23:59,180 --> 03:24:04,639
what exactly is going in there I mean

4619
03:24:01,370 --> 03:24:07,609
biology is so diverse so what we've done

4620
03:24:04,639 --> 03:24:10,309
is we have 62 strains at the exact same

4621
03:24:07,609 --> 03:24:12,050
amounts every single time so where we

4622
03:24:10,309 --> 03:24:15,109
take great pride in the fact that our

4623
03:24:12,049 --> 03:24:16,579
product is consistent and and for what

4624
03:24:15,109 --> 03:24:18,890
you guys are talking about and how that

4625
03:24:16,579 --> 03:24:23,209
relates it's it's gonna be so nice to

4626
03:24:18,889 --> 03:24:25,090
actually quantify the the different

4627
03:24:23,209 --> 03:24:30,049
strains and what they're able to produce

4628
03:24:25,090 --> 03:24:33,139
you know those terpenes in combination

4629
03:24:30,049 --> 03:24:36,259
with with these microbial so there could

4630
03:24:33,139 --> 03:24:38,119
be a bitter effect if you use more we

4631
03:24:36,260 --> 03:24:42,760
could see a better effect if we use less

4632
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:45,410
of certain types of terpene strains so

4633
03:24:42,760 --> 03:24:47,568
yeah so that's I guess the best way to

4634
03:24:45,409 --> 03:24:51,189
answer the question the the product is

4635
03:24:47,568 --> 03:24:54,680
consistent and we create them ourselves

4636
03:24:51,189 --> 03:24:56,510
well we don't create three strains

4637
03:24:54,680 --> 03:24:58,609
they're part of Mother Nature we've just

4638
03:24:56,510 --> 03:25:01,520
found them and we recreate that we grow

4639
03:24:58,609 --> 03:25:04,250
them at high numbers so I Oh affecting

4640
03:25:01,520 --> 03:25:05,569
by out you're a bio prospector right in

4641
03:25:04,250 --> 03:25:08,898
yeah exactly

4642
03:25:05,568 --> 03:25:11,779
that's what your bio mining hey thanks

4643

we're gonna give it a run here to it

4650
03:25:24,590 --> 03:25:27,889
sounds like a great product thank you

4651
03:25:26,239 --> 03:25:29,539
guys thank you so much that's that's

4652
03:25:27,889 --> 03:25:31,340
what we're really hoping so that's

4653
03:25:29,540 --> 03:25:33,350
that's why I'm your rank hey you know

4654
03:25:31,340 --> 03:25:34,960
I'd love to give you guys some product

4655
03:25:33,350 --> 03:25:36,818
so you can know

4656
03:25:34,959 --> 03:25:39,429
test it out and see what you think I'm

4657
03:25:36,818 --> 03:25:40,659
really excited for you to see it you

4658
03:25:39,430 --> 03:25:43,029
know it's one thing to talk about it

4659
03:25:40,659 --> 03:25:45,068
it's one thing to come in your but for

4660
03:25:43,029 --> 03:25:47,620
you to see it and to be able to smell it

4661
03:25:45,068 --> 03:25:49,719
and and the colors and the trichome

4662
03:25:47,620 --> 03:25:50,649
production is just gonna exceed your

4663
03:25:49,719 --> 03:25:52,719
expectations

4664
03:25:50,648 --> 03:25:54,760
I know that and I'm projecting that

4665
03:25:52,719 --> 03:25:56,170
energy out there because I know it you

4666
03:25:54,760 --> 03:25:59,949
know it's happened right now we've got a

4667
03:25:56,170 --> 03:26:01,629
92% repurchase rate on this product

4668
03:25:59,949 --> 03:26:04,149
after trial so the people that are

4669
03:26:01,629 --> 03:26:07,898
actually putting it in the ground are

4670
03:26:04,148 --> 03:26:09,459
rebind 92% of them that's pretty any

4671
03:26:07,898 --> 03:26:12,670
business that's been our biggest

4672
03:26:09,459 --> 03:26:15,759
challenge to be honest is you know

4673
03:26:12,670 --> 03:26:20,260
having these growers just to use it you

4674
03:26:15,760 --> 03:26:23,829
know if we humble everybody we have a

4675
03:26:20,260 --> 03:26:25,359
gentleman up there his name is ty ty

4676
03:26:23,829 --> 03:26:30,850
Israel I don't know if you know I'm up

4677
03:26:25,359 --> 03:26:32,738
in Humboldt you know ty Tony yeah after

4678
03:26:30,850 --> 03:26:34,510
that I've heard of him I think I might

4679
03:26:32,738 --> 03:26:36,698
have met him before - you'd probably be

4680
03:26:34,510 --> 03:26:38,829
upset if I've met him multiple times and

4681
03:26:36,699 --> 03:26:41,109
said I think but it's dead name sounds

4682
03:26:38,829 --> 03:26:42,789
extremely familiar he's he's put it on

4683
03:26:41,109 --> 03:26:45,729
his plans he sent me some pictures he

4684
03:26:42,790 --> 03:26:47,590
said the the ten grows you know said

4685
03:26:45,728 --> 03:26:50,769
they've never seen anything like it

4686
03:26:47,590 --> 03:26:53,770
before the the the plant leaves just

4687
03:26:50,770 --> 03:26:56,170
started coming up doing this so they

4688
03:26:53,770 --> 03:26:58,329
were really you know elevated with with

4689
03:26:56,170 --> 03:27:00,100
a different kind of energy and so once

4690
03:26:58,329 --> 03:27:03,370
he saw that he contacted me and said I'd

4691
03:27:00,100 --> 03:27:05,590
like to you know get this out Bulgaria

4692
03:27:03,370 --> 03:27:09,340
so now it's if it's spreading like

4693
03:27:05,590 --> 03:27:12,250
wildfire just just through use have you

4694
03:27:09,340 --> 03:27:17,909
tried you probably already working on it

4695
03:27:12,250 --> 03:27:22,719
but have you tried a any type of foliar

4696
03:27:17,909 --> 03:27:24,609
feeding yeah yeah you can you know not

4697
03:27:22,719 --> 03:27:27,429
on say the buds but I would say as a veg

4698
03:27:24,609 --> 03:27:29,710
product but if it's all-natural and

4699
03:27:27,430 --> 03:27:31,540
people don't have to use a pesticide you

4700
03:27:29,709 --> 03:27:34,959
know what I mean I've never said that

4701
03:27:31,540 --> 03:27:36,640
no you yeah well you don't have to use

4702
03:27:34,959 --> 03:27:38,139
pesticides on cannabis that's people's

4703
03:27:36,639 --> 03:27:40,478
choice so that's just their growing

4704
03:27:38,139 --> 03:27:42,579
methods it's about controlling

4705
03:27:40,478 --> 03:27:44,500
environment and and keeping a healthy

4706
03:27:42,579 --> 03:27:46,779
plant the plant will push off the pests

4707
03:27:44,500 --> 03:27:48,728
the bugs if they're healthy so if

4708
03:27:46,779 --> 03:27:50,828
they're what you're saying like if you

4709
03:27:48,728 --> 03:27:52,420
using a probiotic in the soil and the

4710
03:27:50,828 --> 03:27:53,469
plant does what it says it's supposed to

4711
03:27:52,420 --> 03:27:55,930
like you're saying then it should

4712
03:27:53,469 --> 03:27:57,519
naturally ward off those those things so

4713
03:27:55,930 --> 03:27:59,648
I was just curious if you guys have

4714
03:27:57,520 --> 03:28:04,119
developed anything in that same realm

4715
03:27:59,648 --> 03:28:06,129
that's a foliar that would also help as

4716
03:28:04,119 --> 03:28:08,680
a beneficial that doesn't you know the

4717
03:28:06,129 --> 03:28:09,998
people use tea compost and they spray

4718
03:28:08,680 --> 03:28:13,029
all kinds of stuff on their plants

4719
03:28:09,998 --> 03:28:15,369
during veg and stuff yeah so we're we're

4720
03:28:13,029 --> 03:28:18,100
hoping to get to a point down the road

4721
03:28:15,369 --> 03:28:20,498
where we can sell enough of this product

4722
03:28:18,100 --> 03:28:23,380
and begin you know with the quality to

4723
03:28:20,498 --> 03:28:25,180
to bring in more scientists to

4724
03:28:23,379 --> 03:28:27,158
continually develop those types of

4725
03:28:25,180 --> 03:28:31,238
foliar applications that would be

4726
03:28:27,158 --> 03:28:33,340
conducive to colonization that happens

4727
03:28:31,238 --> 03:28:35,129
when the soil borne pathogens such as

4728
03:28:33,340 --> 03:28:37,600
Pythium Fusarium verticillium

4729
03:28:35,129 --> 03:28:39,578
rhizoctonia guy oh man oh my sees

4730
03:28:37,600 --> 03:28:43,149
botrytis Pythium all of those guys that

4731
03:28:39,578 --> 03:28:46,510
you deal with especially the the para

4732
03:28:43,148 --> 03:28:49,059
nós pura like the the powdery and downy

4733
03:28:46,510 --> 03:28:51,219
mildew x' those are all incubating

4734
03:28:49,059 --> 03:28:52,359
within your soil and they get to a point

4735
03:28:51,219 --> 03:28:54,639
of confidence here where they actually

4736
03:28:52,359 --> 03:28:56,220
colonize the stem of the plant and

4737
03:28:54,639 --> 03:29:01,568
that's how you get your disease

4738
03:28:56,219 --> 03:29:03,698
topically and so to elicit an immune

4739
03:29:01,568 --> 03:29:07,359
response as well as add the correct

4740
03:29:03,699 --> 03:29:12,819
strains conducive to pathogen

4741
03:29:07,359 --> 03:29:16,779
suppression on the leaf biofilm

4742
03:29:12,818 --> 03:29:18,969
is something that we will be getting

4743
03:29:16,779 --> 03:29:22,988
into down the road once you know we get

4744
03:29:18,969 --> 03:29:24,908
to a place or a space where where we can

4745
03:29:22,988 --> 03:29:26,920
afford those types of people and

4746
03:29:24,908 --> 03:29:28,238
scientists so we're kind of like uh in

4747
03:29:26,920 --> 03:29:30,219
some ways we're couldn't like Tesla

4748
03:29:28,238 --> 03:29:33,158
right now or just starting now we have a

4749
03:29:30,219 --> 03:29:34,328
we have a regenerative sustainable

4750
03:29:33,158 --> 03:29:36,309
technology that can help the environment

4751
03:29:34,328 --> 03:29:38,379
and we need the support of all these

4752
03:29:36,309 --> 03:29:40,959
people that are tuned into their plants

4753
03:29:38,379 --> 03:29:42,879
to help us grow we want it rode with you

4754
03:29:40,959 --> 03:29:44,738
we're all we're all kind of in the same

4755
03:29:42,879 --> 03:29:47,618
boat right now you guys are doing

4756
03:29:44,738 --> 03:29:49,510
something that's federally illegal you

4757
03:29:47,619 --> 03:29:51,609
know and and we're doing something right

4758
03:29:49,510 --> 03:29:54,189
now that's off the charts as well we're

4759
03:29:51,609 --> 03:29:56,078
a joke what's your website again so we

4760
03:29:54,189 --> 03:29:59,590
get it out there for people yeah thank

4761
03:29:56,078 --> 03:30:02,629
you it's so it's soil balance procom I

4762
03:29:59,590 --> 03:30:04,939
would just say that my license is

4763
03:30:02,629 --> 03:30:10,579
federal I don't know what about what you

4764
03:30:04,939 --> 03:30:13,700
guys are up to but we're all we're all

4765
03:30:10,579 --> 03:30:15,439
doing something that is I really it's

4766
03:30:13,700 --> 03:30:17,120
light work you know it's it's it's

4767
03:30:15,439 --> 03:30:21,590
coming from a place of giving and it's

4768
03:30:17,120 --> 03:30:24,530
coming for a little and so it's coming

4769
03:30:21,590 --> 03:30:28,790
inside all of us it's coming from the

4770
03:30:24,530 --> 03:30:30,560
stem of human consciousness it is it is

4771
03:30:28,790 --> 03:30:32,060
it's a beautiful thing to be a part of

4772
03:30:30,559 --> 03:30:33,109
right now you look at I was just talking

4773
03:30:32,059 --> 03:30:34,789
about this with a friend of mine the

4774
03:30:33,110 --> 03:30:36,319
other day you look in the Dark Ages

4775
03:30:34,790 --> 03:30:38,479
you know where people were so inundated

4776
03:30:36,319 --> 03:30:40,309
with shadow you know pain and suffering

4777
03:30:38,478 --> 03:30:42,409
and killing each other and and we've

4778
03:30:40,309 --> 03:30:44,180
come through such a nice point of

4779
03:30:42,409 --> 03:30:47,569
evolution too now where we're actually

4780
03:30:44,180 --> 03:30:49,850
able to that have abundance and at being

4781
03:30:47,569 --> 03:30:51,500
able to hopefully elevate to a really

4782
03:30:49,850 --> 03:30:52,790
high level of consciousness and part of

4783
03:30:51,500 --> 03:30:55,670
that is going to be tuning back into

4784
03:30:52,790 --> 03:30:58,630
nature like like every every grower

4785
03:30:55,670 --> 03:31:01,790
feels as they tune into their plant they

4786
03:30:58,629 --> 03:31:05,299
resonate they understand that part of

4787
03:31:01,790 --> 03:31:08,990
our responsibility in my opinion as

4788
03:31:05,299 --> 03:31:11,989
organisms on this planet as human beings

4789
03:31:08,989 --> 03:31:13,699
is to take care of the predominant

4790
03:31:11,989 --> 03:31:16,159
species on this planet which is our

4791
03:31:13,700 --> 03:31:17,780
plants and if we tune in to them they'll

4792
03:31:16,159 --> 03:31:19,879
tune back into us they'll give us our

4793
03:31:17,780 --> 03:31:24,020
food they'll give us our medicine you

4794
03:31:19,879 --> 03:31:26,329
know they'll heal this whole environment

4795
03:31:24,020 --> 03:31:28,399
and with with what's going on and and

4796
03:31:26,329 --> 03:31:31,129
that's why I named the product soil

4797
03:31:28,398 --> 03:31:41,109
balance because you know the time for

4798
03:31:31,129 --> 03:31:43,938
balance is now you know you know no

4799
03:31:41,110 --> 03:31:47,180
nothing happens without a response like

4800
03:31:43,939 --> 03:31:49,040
I think probably before we started

4801
03:31:47,180 --> 03:31:52,460
wearing shoes athletes but it wasn't a

4802
03:31:49,040 --> 03:31:54,830
thing you know so our bodies responded

4803
03:31:52,459 --> 03:31:57,109
by allowing a funghi to go in them

4804
03:31:54,829 --> 03:32:00,920
because we're wearing shoes which isn't

4805
03:31:57,110 --> 03:32:07,340
really the norm although it's become the

4806
03:32:00,920 --> 03:32:09,020
norm yeah so so yeah if you guys have

4807
03:32:07,340 --> 03:32:11,600
any questions about the biology how the

4808
03:32:09,020 --> 03:32:13,300
mode of action works I'd love to go into

4809
03:32:11,600 --> 03:32:16,360

4810
03:32:13,299 --> 03:32:21,939
