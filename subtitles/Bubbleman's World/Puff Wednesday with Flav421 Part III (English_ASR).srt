all right so got to a little set of

61
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:48,500
islands here deep in the house sound

62
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:52,400
just in front of the back end of Gambier

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,129
up in the North End where anvil islands

64
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,679
and Diamond Head are towards Whistler

65
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:00,620
and you can see this little island is

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,790
just teeming with happy little life we

67
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,569
got birds

68
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,569
we got seals

69
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,810
they're chill

70
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,649
[Music]

71
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:28,709
but bubble man's world nature right

72
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,689
[Music]

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,999

74
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,998
cool guys

75
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:59,620
hard to hold the camera steady and give

76
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,050
them a good show I think we're just

77
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,459
gonna go around I think you'll be

78
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,759
packing bowls real soon that's what I

79
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,759
think

80
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:26,300
well here we are amongst the seals the

81
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:29,839
mountains and the ocean and the flavin

82
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:40,819
aiders loading the fat glass so I kill

83
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:44,689
the boat it's gonna take us over to bird

84
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:46,490
island there and I'm not sure if I want

85
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,689
to go around the back of Gambia take us

86
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,579
all the way around

87
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:52,029
let's go back over in Hanover and hit

88
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:54,139
another bullet Bowen yeah another one

89
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:56,389
okay so we'll go to Hockett bay then

90
00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:04,279
yeah all right so we're hitting the bowl

91
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:12,949
here though start this session up we've

92
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:14,269
got Marcel amazing seals good dirty

93
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:19,909
window you guys are probably picking up

94
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:23,529
on through the Sun but okay skill the

95
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,740
sake and the lighting skill

96
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:29,149
I'll tell you

97
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,150
it's we're out into the ocean

98
00:07:41,870 --> 00:08:01,069
champion and it's still lit I'm not sure

99
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:06,849
I've ever hit a piece that heady on a

100
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:06,849
boat honestly

101
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,230
yeah

102
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,158
right here

103
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:43,849
it's a truck well I mean I'll my hands

104
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,848
yeah you job

105
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:12,679
have a tote that's really we've hit the

106
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:23,449
Marcel I think we're either gonna head

107
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:25,309
over well let's head over to and then

108
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,780
it's a quick boot right across to Bowen

109
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,779
Island and on our way back we can get

110
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,210
[Music]

111
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:50,949
so this is Hawk at bay

112
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:54,059
you want to go pop it

113
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,060
maybe mark in this

114
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,960
how you feeling with the Phoenix

115
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,240
it'll look so good on the boat

116
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,100
just unique you know we don't always

117
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:11,600
take these pieces out like this

118
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,600
pushing boundaries here

119
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,600
we're taking the peace to a place that's

120
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,600
of equivalent beauty of it

121
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:35,589
all right but I think this is where

122
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:37,240
we're gonna hit it awesome

123
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,670
[Music]

124
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:45,528
yeah this is real it's real sweet ever -

125
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:51,289
dude well real sweet so hock it BAE all

126
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:53,948
right all right so we're like like on

127
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,948
rocks dude

128
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:05,959
I did them right there I'd say we're

129
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,289
eight feet away we just about [ __ ] the

130
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,290
dog

131
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,689
so we're gonna have to be careful it's

132
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,840
pulling in pretty fast

133
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,840
[Music]

134
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,170
think

135
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,590
we're gonna be puffing and it's gonna

136
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,320
take a little while so I think I'm gonna

137
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:32,379
have to pull out a little bit I can't

138
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,450
believe where we just were dude holy

139
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,779
[ __ ] I look down oh it would have been

140
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:42,170
brought my vibe down

141
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:45,149
oh for sure killing your hai no like

142
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:46,259
[ __ ] around either and so I think I

143
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,379
recorded all that yeah I did

144
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,240
awesome here well start it over so I

145
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,450
don't have to seems like all right well

146
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,820
you guys missed that but I pulled this

147
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,710
up I set everything up and then we were

148
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,600
like literally eight feet from the rocks

149
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,910
the boat the wind is blowing in pretty

150
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:12,830
strong yeah so I guess we're gonna have

151
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:12,829
this quick session you require hashish

152
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:43,559
bringing us back to our rocks licensed

153
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:47,689
yes good we take a nice long break in

154
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:50,089
between rips around all stoned

155
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,860
well not inconsiderate I find that

156
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,690
cannabis makes me more aware and I'm

157
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,190
less likely to want to do anything like

158
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,740
drive or operate any type of heavy

159
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:05,450
machinery when I just don't you just

160
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:15,409
want to sit around for just sort of sit

161
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:22,220
here for an hour after music tiny little

162
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:33,230
Hockett baby looks like they also have a

163
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:35,690
Marcel custom piece and they're wearing

164
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,519
a Marcel shirt and we're like we've got

165
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:46,490
the Marcel Phoenix and we have a J Lee

166
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:47,750
shirt on well no I think I don't think

167
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,340
it's anything to do with that I think

168
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,639
it's that my position I feel pretty good

169
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,639
about it

170
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:27,190
nice herpe hit though right master be

171
00:14:20,169 --> 00:15:20,699
hit perfect flame placement right on the

172
00:14:27,190 --> 00:15:20,700
hashish Terps boat Terps pretty close so

173
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,509
that's the thing once again sideways

174
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:28,679
there on the wave banks you're done just

175
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,679
since you turn the boat off

176
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,170
awesome well we're gonna chill here in

177
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:58,878
Hoggett Bay for a bit and we're gonna

178
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:04,128
find ourselves another spot to go for

179
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:06,079
sure maybe Bowen Island alright so we're

180
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,778
just driving making our way I guess what

181
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,338
would you call this straight straight

182
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:12,269
between the straight straight between

183
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,810
the straight yeah exactly

184
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,659
this attaches West Vancouver the water

185
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,250
to Sunshine Coast and then you can

186
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,149
escape out through the back end there

187
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,669
which

188
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,990
Vancouver Island I guess Paisley and

189
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,000
some other islands are back there as

190
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,190
well so

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,190

197
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:38,939
Stumbo 20 miles away sleeping on the job

198
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,649

199
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,960
for the tuition we cheese and we throw

200
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,860
out all right so let's start that over

201
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,200
again so this house is an island on an

202
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,359
island it's separated only by a small

203
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,000
little area and the land the land is

204
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,879
just right under that water and that

205
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,390
water goes into a cave you see that day

206
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,190
of the cave and that's his driveway

207
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,460
that's how he gets on to his island

208
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:11,180
where he has his home and his windmill

209
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,180
so that is pretty effing cool

210
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:17,000

here all the way on and all the way

333
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:06,039
around is completely on in half

334
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:07,740
it's always icy bald eagles

335
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:09,539
seals see

336
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,000
some Dolphins around here it's a very

337
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:13,710
active nature zone I've even seen this

338
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,980
wall right here when the water goes down

339
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,539
full of purple starfish like a thousand

340
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,269
of them so it's a really really

341
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:24,490
beautiful area but just you know the

342
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:27,940
different types of trees the jus

343
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,720
douglas-fir and our beauties it's just

344
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,390
beautiful

345
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,980
look what more can you say really other

346
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,130
than maybe we should hit a beautiful

347
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:39,120
glass pipe with some really nice hash in

348
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,120
the setting of this

349
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,880
it's probably good idea claps shaking

350
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,679
his head up and down yeah yeah I would

351
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,830
have to say that that's pretty good at

352
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,830
night

353
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,140
all right

354
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:57,210
so you were saying about Amsterdam um

355
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,250
we're gonna be taking a lot of fat class

356
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,110
to Amsterdam we're gonna have a lot of

357
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,329
really really melty hash a lot of really

358
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:04,918
nice prices and even today whether it

359
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:07,879
happens or not one of the ideas I put

360
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,620
forward to Craig Gregg sorry and

361
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,240
yourself was that we would shoot some of

362
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:19,908
the glass that would be in the gallery

363
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:22,319
show and that we would and that we would

364
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:23,820
take some really beautiful photos of the

365
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,418
pieces in nature in these sort of

366
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:30,149
settings you know high end photos print

367
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,130
them G clay prints you know not too too

368
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,470
big but not too small and then do a

369
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,610
gallery show with like I don't know if

370
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,750
you're doing a half a dozen or a dozen

371
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:41,009
pieces or ten pieces or what it is but

372
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,808
you know and then have a picture for

373
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:45,119
each one that's hanging in the gallery

374
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:46,889
maybe the piece isn't for sale maybe

375
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,259
it's for sale but you can't afford it

376
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,970
the picture might be and it would be a

377
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:51,779
nice collab to if you bought yourself a

378
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,558
piece like that

379
00:28:51,779 --> 00:29:08,730

399
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:51,850
water in this thing so yeah if you were

400
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,460
missing water we could definitely sort

401
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:56,139
it out and then we're floating on

402
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,569
oh geez I don't know what do you think

403

800 trillion metric tons or something

404
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:12,750

405
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:12,750

I'll be a pain in the butt bro I mean

410
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:07,080
come on so happy you know I've spent

411
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:10,889
time actually with Marcel in this sound

412
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:13,769
on kayaks over the years he used to come

413
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:16,530
up and we'd chill out and he was one of

414
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:19,579
the people a few people actually that

415
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:19,579
would come out on the kayaks

416
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:38,569
did I get the last one well it does

417
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:38,569
because we're looking for the lighter

418
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,359
Luton actually you know what you did

419
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,929
yeah cuz I felt like I just literally

420
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:53,928
took a hit there's a seal right there

421
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:05,339
beauty of the day I mean honestly in

422
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:06,928
this moment really for me the only way

423
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:08,819
to make it you know a slight bit better

424
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:11,880
would be to see the pod of killer whales

425
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:13,740
or the pod of dolphins come in yeah

426
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,630
not even to hang out for long even if

427
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:21,390
they just ripped by oh it would just be

428
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:22,710
like so for those of you that don't live

429
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,009
here but that might want to have this

430
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,929
experience you can go to Horseshoe Bay

431
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:32,490
there's a place called sewells marina

432
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:34,679
sewa LLS and sewells marina rents these

433
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,179
little boats and they're perfect for the

434
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,890
job of getting out on the house sound

435
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,409
ripping around to all the spots that

436
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,360
Slav and I just hit today

437
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:44,130
there's maps on the boat that shows you

438
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,019
specific names and where you're going

439
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,090
and it's very easy sound to not get lost

440
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,889
in I would only say that it isn't a lake

441
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:51,329
there's tons of dead heads and trees and

442
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,360
you can really muck up your boat if you

443
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:56,939
don't pay attention but what have we

444
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,678
been out on the water for two hours come

445
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,110
on that's good

446
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,480
we were on Gambia you're over by anvil

447
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:05,548
in the islands we were on Bowen and if

448
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,349
you don't stop like we did it only takes

449
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:08,668
you like thirty minutes to do it all

450
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:10,889
well yeah exactly

451
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:13,947
the real the real fun is in the stopping

452
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,948
