modulating strains with uh more THC to

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
see where the genetics could have gone

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,920
you know we know we got tons of turbs

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,759

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,360
some CO2 extract or some crazy

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,759
Sak Sak it's always fun to go through

these little videos with Horatio cuz he

80
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,079
literally puts thought into these things

81
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,518
and I know that uh we're going we're

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,760

87
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:02,239
690 de and it's on the uh silicon

88
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,318
carbide hole so you'll want to carb that

89
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,920
with that because it is the only carb on

90
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:12,119
the table that will actually fit cover

91
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:16,839
this that one goes in that one goes in

92
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,840

94
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,759
mangoes it tastes it's more complex than

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:36,800
that H that's nice that's um very

96
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:39,800
citrusy but there is the mercine and the

97
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,079

girl scale it was just these giant huge

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,280
nuggets but they were covered in resin

105
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,360
like I couldn't believe it bigger than

106
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,159
his whole arm I mean if you guys watch

107

111
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,039
no shortage of it oh he's got it that

112

00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,759
that that's perfect

114
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:27,240
perfect

115
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,240
yay we got sessions to do here that is

116
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,479
quite yeah I mean you t a fair bit of

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,038
different extracts there something

118
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,839
special to that something different you

119
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,360
know

120
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,638
special who would have thought I didn't

121
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,439
expect it to be

122
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,400
so cheers brother that's what happen I

123
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:49,199
mean every time I it's like a balance

124
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,599
you literally go is if every TP is a

125
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,439
solvent the better you do the more

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,039
unstable but is you know no of a snow

127
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:00,000
like when is that a true guide until you

128
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,519
hit something that's like that sappy but

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,759
the experience doesn't match or is it

130
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:08,079
just sappy and kind of men it's sappy

131
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,479
yeah so at this point I'm like that

132
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,560
experience compared to we know we added

133
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,719
chch on top of this and it's getting

134
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,918
sappy it's funny cuz you after you get

135
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,479
that muches your expectations get a

136
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,478
little bit more of you get a grape

137
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,199
after nice very nice after taste on

138
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:30,038
that's that's nice it I wish they just

139
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,160
picked a true name cuz on it own I

140
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:35,079
really like the strain when it's um when

141
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,599
you know shouting it out isn't getting

142
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,519
us an international beef yeah it's not

143
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,120
what we're trying to do we're just

144
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,478
trying to enjoy some

145
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,959
TPS yeah that's just tasty as well do

146
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:49,758
taste incredible it's incredible good

147
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,598
like a like a mango orange fruit roll up

148
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,960
it's got such a beautiful consistency to

149
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:53,959
it as

150
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,319
well goes so smooth super and then this

151
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,479
is just that refined

152
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,039
you simp you pretty much you can you can

153
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,918
look at this and you go well if that's

154
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,680
what I end up with when I drop the turf

155
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,918
experience when I'm now obviously the

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,240
color of this final product um before

157
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,279
that process is going to be pretty

158
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,560
similar this is right you know ooey

159
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,519
gooey good but um I'm looking if I

160
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,879
looked at this and I would literally say

161
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm going to get 60% yield by the time I

162
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,720
took it takeen into that right and the

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,879
more turps that's one of the things I

164
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,680
know the more turps the more loss so you

165
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,120
would hope that um somehow there would

166
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,759
be a balance between isolating turps or

167
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,160
pulling turps away from material for a

168
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,400
process like this right and then seeing

169
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,240
out where else could it be reintroduced

170
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,918
cuz if I obviously if I if I don't pull

171
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,639
the turbs they'll come out burnt and

172
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,318
they'll come out reincluded in a way

173
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,639
that um is not fun to dab right but um

174
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,158
if I could pull these turps out and keep

175
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,000
them beautiful beautiful mhm and make

176
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:57,360
that process that there's a lot of

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,839
ultimate goals where we're literally

178
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
like this has still got too much flavor

179
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,878
to make that out of how can we get this

180
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,280
flavor out because um even if it's later

181
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,720
it may help in the orally like being

182
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,079
preserved in the pure smell um versus

183
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,680
the cooked version but sh smells so good

184
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,680
dude yeah like it's kind of ridiculous

185
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,439
crazy

186
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:31,158
lot it sure hits nice off the sick you

187
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:33,278
must like it off the sick Horatio

188
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:36,439
cuz I know he's very particular on what

189
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,519
sort of surface that he hits it off of

190
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,399
that's why I was like yeah yeah well I

191
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,240
don't think you didn't have this pipe

192
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,158
last time I hit the sick and I was

193
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,799
you're right yeah and I was like yeah if

194
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,720
I I just want this in a small or more

195
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,319
restricted experience now the Taurus is

196
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,759
the perfect experience right look at

197
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,360
that it's lighting up

198
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:58,078
again all right let's dive into some set

199
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,959
that is a nice nice rip so that was your

200
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,319
your guys's first time hitting

201
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,159
first time I'm impressed nice like the

202
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,879
flavor yeah it's got nice flavor smooth

203
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,559
you know it's what's interesting to me

204
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:13,399
is the first time I hit Horatio's LH now

205
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,599
he's figured out Pro he's furthered his

206
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,240
refinement process since then always

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
every but even when I first hit it I was

208
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,120
like oh you know I really taste that La

209
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,879
the D lemonade he'd be like okay yeah

210
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,679
but like but tell me what you taste

211
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,799
beyond that and it was like I didn't

212
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,000
understand the how you could get stuck

213
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,958
at that door but as like got to know him

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,440
better and I I went in deeper and then

215
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:38,078
he refined things deeper I learned to

216
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,440
taste these other flavors these almost

217
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:45,159
minty flowery flavors that are below

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,920
that initial sort of yeah I some kind of

219
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,679
someone mentioned it even on hash church

220
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,120
or maybe it was just on a Facebook post

221
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:55,120
about the potential of the delimine as a

222
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,759
solvent altering tpes right so it's like

223
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,959
that process as well like there's no

224
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:05,480
doubt about that something going on in

225
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:07,119
there is is special I I have a high U

226
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,159
I'm I'm sensitive in the same way that

227
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,440
heratio sensitive I can't really deal

228
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,958
with chemicals I can't really deal with

229
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,920
you know I don't even like to be around

230
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,000
you know cigarette smoke or any sort of

231
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,120
things like that it's one of the reasons

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,480
I've always stayed away from the

233
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,959
hydrocarbons because I just I just don't

234
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,920
trust that people know what they're

235
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,919
doing I still feel that well I just

236
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,599
don't trust that anyone's even close to

237
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,559
touching the research to know what if

238
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,120
you know the thing is I'm like look you

239
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,559
know I can do something with this you

240
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,039
know it's different but you know it's

241
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,319
different trusting nature as anything

242
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,240
that's going to happen is going to be in

243
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,120
line I'm like we don't know anything

244
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,639
about trying the other route we just

245
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,519
know it works you said it off camera but

246
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,440
it was a great quote and you said I

247
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,600
selftaught myself all of this and I

248
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,399
chose to do it with something that

249
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,639
wouldn't kill me it's like self- teing

250
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,639
yourself with

251
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,000
butane is insane it's insane and this is

252
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,879
like I'm not calling out the people who

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,679
are you know this is their focus and

254
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,480
their passion right now I'm really I'm

255
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,359
I'm talking to the guys and the girls

256
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,039
that are watching right now the youth

257
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,759
that is looking for something to focus

258
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,159
on what I would say to you is start with

259
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,519
something safer you know there's a get

260
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,000
some Bubble Bags there's a big

261
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,278
solventless uh quiver to be had out

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,078
there and uh you know there's ways to

263
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,399
access these different resins uh that

264
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:30,519
are safer than potentially you know

265
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,879
blowing yourself up about people who's

266
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,200
blown thems up and now see rosin and

267
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,399
they're like oh my God where was this

268
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,600
where was this a great thing where was

269
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,919
this is so much smoother and tastier I

270
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,920
think it's a nice it's a nice option for

271
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,240
people that want to experience dabs if

272
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,519
you think that the dry SI is too far

273
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
away or you're like oh I'm never going

274
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,839
to be Horatio I got to go to this party

275
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,720
tonight yeah it's like all right well

276
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
you know grab grab some 25 micro on

277
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,200
screen and your hair straightener and

278
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
and press up something what do we got a

279
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,600
pound of bubble over there on the table

280
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,519
maybe we can press some of that out

281
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,120
later brought a couple of ring options

282
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
what you got do some Seven Star Seven

283
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,000
Star you're going big too thank you sir

284
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
and I'm going in the puking beagle yeah

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
some that around got water in there you

286
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,000
can barely tell at

287
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:25,560
that it's cool how kind bre that

288
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:28,399
is I mean the thing is as you start to

289
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,559
just like anything with some of us have

290
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,679
start learned how to enjoy a cigarette

291
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,879
some of us learned how to enjoy alcohol

292
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:38,838
it wasn't a oh yeah that is that b yeah

293
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,480
yeah I know this I I'm no you literally

294
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,440
try to reinforce you told your brain

295
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,839
this is good I want this my homies are

296
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,279
doing it and you train yourself into it

297
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,240
well with anything especially if you're

298
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,000
coming from whatever you normally smoke

299
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,560
um cuz I'm always coming from that's my

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,720
regular experience so if I try a

301
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,399
hydrocarbon extract I'm like whoa is

302
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,839
this how you rip up your chest every day

303
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,958
and I could see how in a week I could

304
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,560
get used to this because I smoke

305
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,599
cigarettes and I know how that started

306
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,198
all right so I need to I need to

307
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,040
literally say how [ __ ] incredible

308
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:16,838
that tasted that tasted better than the

309
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,759
LH show I'm telling you right now that a

310
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,839
good thing I made it and it's not just

311
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,120
like it's it's well here's the thing

312
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:27,959
about the l i i find the L to be a damn

313
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,799
near like well when he turns it into

314
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,159
that it's medicine

315
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,078
that's like almost a shame to dab right

316
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,360
unless you're dabbing for massive pain

317
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,799
relief or some sort of like instantane

318
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,399
instantaneous like important pain relief

319
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,879
it's like that is the stuff that like

320
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,679
super strong cures colon cancer and

321
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,240
[ __ ] shrinks tumors out of people's

322
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,078
heads and like that's the [ __ ] that you

323
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,600
want to access if you just found out you

324
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,599
have a terminal cancer you really want

325
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,159
to get some of that it's the weirdest

326
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,159
thing CU that's kind of that's kind of

327
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,480
why I'm like even when extracting this I

328
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,240
know I'm actually with this solvent

329
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,560
pulling more than what the conventional

330
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,198
thought of what you can get out of it is

331
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,479
extracted so it's carrying more

332
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,679
potential when I go this route sure um

333
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,399
and that so I'm really excited about

334
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:18,679
refinement cuz I I forget it was it was

335
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,120
somebody who was asking me about a test

336
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,359
of some really really black try they

337
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,240
were like is it CBN is this raw CBN and

338
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,199
I'm like I don't know um and they were

339
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,560
asking you know do all the canono come

340
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,559
over and um it's there's these people

341
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,239
they're seeing these un unknown spikes

342
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,119
you see these unknown spikes and unless

343
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,560
the client is interested in furthering

344
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,120
the research it just they just don't

345
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,439
know it just goes off as an unknown

346
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,519
Spike so I'm expecting to find unknown

347
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,120
spikes of why it makes a success

348
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,440
compared to the other routes that you

349
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,198
can extract um CO2 being a route

350
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,079
conventional hydrocarbon being a route

351
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,519
the tur sift just now dissipated in my

352
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,838
in my mouth like that flavor lasted so

353
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,039
long and nice out of the Sports dude I'm

354
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,079
telling you I think that's the proper uh

355
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,838
oh everybody that's a that's a full bong

356
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,719
rip there's only one pin standing you

357
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,880
just you just knocked over the whole all

358
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,879
the

359
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,399
pins dude that tasted so good what tell

360
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,198
me what tur that was that's the

361
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,198
Pineapple Express the pineapple the same

362
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:22,719
one we kept and now I guess this would

363
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:24,919
be um 3 Monon cure or four month cure it

364
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,160
went into Pineapple Express sift yeah

365
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:30,159
that's the key yeah no I don't uh I

366
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,759
don't that was the luck of

367
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,759
nature nature knows what it's doing well

368
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,680
the thing is I want to know that these

369
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,278
turps are not even just the sift and

370
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,559
we're all exploring strains to find out

371
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,198
what Nature has to say but when I add

372
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:48,479
this I'm like now nature what did you

373
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:52,318
really have to say when we just stick to

374
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,039
matching da I'm enjoying watching Rick

375
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,078
watch

376
00:15:54,039 --> 00:16:00,879
Ron I'm checking his reaction you know

377
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,599
dude it's tasty as [ __ ] amazing right I

378
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,198
mean it literally and you can tell it's

379
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,159
like it's like you said it's that

380
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,318
fraction that you it's that you

381
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,519
literally you go is this what live rosin

382
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:14,679
would be live Rin if I tried to if I

383
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,440
tried to if you tried to just basically

384
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,838
stress yeah a live plant would it taste

385
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,440
like this I was calling it live

386
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,959
sift I what did I call it the first time

387
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,000
you came over here and I thought it was

388
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:29,159
live SI we have TP SI I I go yeah

389
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,600
there's TP SI and then I was like P andw

390
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:35,759
style seven star and then we just go

391
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,199
through the gam talk fresh Fri you

392
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,360
talking that had more dude I thought had

393
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,479
more punch to

394
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,318
it it did yeah more of a punch and how

395
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,800
long did that flavor last in your mouth

396
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:48,919
on your lips and [ __ ] it's still there

397
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,278
like it lasted for me like cuz Horatio

398
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,919
was talking for quite a while I didn't

399
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,240
want to interrupt but I was literally

400
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,120
like I can still [ __ ] taste that [ __ ]

401
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,919
in my

402
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,919
mouth in a nice way not in this sort of

403
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,519
overdone way where it's like I just took

404
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,678
a pierce turp drop and it's like that

405
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,439
was a good ratio that was a good ratio

406
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,439
well he is hor

407
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,839
ratio one thing the man can do is get a

408
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,400
ratio correct try too how [ __ ] tasty

409
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,519
is that very little sift with turbs

410
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,038
little so we started out with the L it's

411
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:28,160
nice that it matches the same turs is

412
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:30,279
it's it's what this high that you're

413
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,960
experiencing right now I was about it's

414
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:34,599
yeah I know I love Pineapple Express but

415
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,558
maybe the key to that strain is in the

416
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,399
Lost portion not in the sav portion

417
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,720
never know and that's the point of and

418
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,120
then you find out it's a whole different

419
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,319
High than what it said in the booklet

420
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,399
it's definitely a very nice high it's a

421
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:50,639
strong one right off the back oh yeah

422
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,200
modulated we like to modulate while

423
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,520
we're while we're smacking modulate the

424
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,120
modulation we haven't even gotten into

425
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,119
we going to be modulating this with

426
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,079
that's well it's a whole that I haven't

427
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,439
everyone's like you smoking on the TC

428
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:07,319
I'm like I believe I've had to get some

429
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,360
syringes done I don't play as much as

430
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,480
people think um so we're going to try to

431
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,918
get in that open yeah cat wants to come

432
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,240
in come on in

433
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,120
Sakira got let the cat in so we're going

434
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,798
to do a little bit of playing T night

435
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:23,879
it's 10 after 1 it's nice and late we

436
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:28,240
are getting turpy oh yeah we're about to

437
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,840
get Ted out T up you know what and it's

438
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,279
so nice to have the line of

439
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,558
motherships to hit everything out of the

440
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,399
egg and the Taurus and the [ __ ] like

441
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:40,558
it's just this is the clear collection

442
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,400
right it's the clear collection I I'm

443
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,839
uh I I haven't really I'm not much for

444
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,440
like worked a $20,000 piece is like I

445
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,798
find already it's a pretty big

446
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,279
responsibility just to put 12 G's in the

447
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:57,240
pipes to be honest also a lot of people

448
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,798
work the rigs and stuff I'm I'm person

449
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,960
I'm really fond of clear glass I love it

450
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,519
because I like to see what I'm dabbing

451
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,000
function yeah like I want to see the

452
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,319
function as I'm taking it so I don't

453
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,119
feel surprised absolutely sometimes I

454
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,439
feel like what you got back just loading

455
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:14,879
up room with some uh

456
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,080
THC we're going to first before going

457
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,760
into modulating with I just want to show

458
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:23,359
the people at home so they have half a

459
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:25,960
clip yes so here we go this is what he's

460
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:30,199
talking about right here so you can see

461
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:34,679
that that's just pretty much white

462
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:39,400
and yeah there you go sir and

463
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:42,120
yeah I mean white look at it on the gold

464
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,120
modulation modulate the

465
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,678
modulators C so this is this is an

466
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,918
experiment that I remember skunkman Sam

467
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,840
talking about years ago pure THC pure

468
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,919
canabo modulating with the

469
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:59,558
tpin uh at the time they weren't all

470
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,600
cannabis tpin he was buying single

471
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,558
single tpin yeah from the internet but

472
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,359
their tpin are tpes for sure when you

473
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,558
get them pure anyway these These are oh

474
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,199
this is wrong you're going to see how it

475
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:13,079
responds with what you've already got in

476
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,480
your system you should be specific as

477
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:20,158
well and mention that these tpin are are

478
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,159
profiles of tpin none of them are pure

479
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:28,918
fractions so these are all messages in

480
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:31,158
themselves so uh usually when everyone

481
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,720
thought of oh yeah well it's against the

482
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,280
what's the point yeah that totally went

483
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,519
that was cool I went to like grab it but

484
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,240
was everyone's like you know why would

485
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,400
you smoke straight TC and I'm like well

486
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,839
no one said that's all you have to smoke

487
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
and we didn't start this session just

488
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:47,279
hitting that so with the turps that are

489
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,320
already you know a profile in your body

490
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,759
does this make the last experience come

491
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,480
back in an intensity or is it its own

492
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,839
experience is kind of that first

493
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,798
question that has a flavor of something

494
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,798
like I'm really bad at describing

495
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:05,558
flavors but hit that it

496
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:08,879
has all

497
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:13,038
right all right I will

498
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,039
then cuz I mean the only thing I can say

499
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:19,440
this process was talked to taught to me

500
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:21,879
by uh analytical Mike is um there's no

501
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,320
chemicals to the process so someone go

502
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,240
well I've seen high high you know 99

503
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,599
100% THC and I'm like well if the

504
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,400
difference between 100% THC and 99 % is

505
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,359
another wash in a chromatography column

506
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,559
with petroleum ethm ether I'll pass the

507
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,439
Discover is about just High Purity THC

508
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,558
sure absolutely um just like this is

509
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,720
it's not about trying to get it to 100%

510
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:46,038
because there should be a decent percent

511
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,400
man 99's good enough I've tried

512
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,480
supposedly like pure crystallin THC it

513
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,159
wasn't interesting it was it's boring

514
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,079
onedimensional y but um getting close

515
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,640
enough gives us a an approximation of

516
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,558
like I said put this through your

517
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,640
current High and then we'll start

518
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,720
dabbling

519
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,840
in bringing back strange through um a

520
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,360
set amount of

521
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,359
THC yeah thank

522
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,880
you don't worry about it just

523
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,720
C W it's in there now toothpaste yeah

524
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,839
sells like toothpaste thank you

525
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,839
bro sells like

526
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,839
toothpaste

527
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,400
yeah hang in there

528
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:50,519
bro I'll be okay man I'll be okay

529
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,519
remember me yesterday

530
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,840
bro so what kind of bong rip is it when

531
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,679
you drop the actual Dabber twice

532
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:02,639
accidentally once on purpose it was

533
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,038
really nice but it's still hitting like

534
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,559
a lot it's that sick factor I heard you

535
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:12,119
mentioned that um come and come again uh

536
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:15,399
factor out of it cuz it's like it's not

537
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,158
charring it so you can actually that's

538
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,000
the cool part of that dude I just got

539
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,760
like six hits out of that nice that was

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,200
delicious really

541
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:27,200
delicious put this the test

542
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,079
let's see what we got going on here with

543
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:39,640
these try to keep my uh try to keep from

544
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,639
crossing my there we go we're

545
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,880
good yeah that's super slow like you'll

546
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,880
be able to hit that for the next minute

547
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,840
straight I find this sick no matter how

548
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,200
high I turn it up it just hits like a

549
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:10,558
low temp it refuses to degrade to it

550
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,120
refuses to degrade 616 yeah we low

551
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,119
temping it it's

552
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,079
nice so yeah I don't know how to

553
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,359
describe the effects of that it was by

554
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,480
no means overwhelming but it's

555
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,759
definitely

556
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,759
there kind of like in the back of my

557
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,759
head

558
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:37,960
aw it's interesting it's different it's

559
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:40,480
uh it's it's it's like I said it's

560
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,880
single dimensional it's not now

561
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,480
comparing it to is it the alter ego to

562
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,480
this being inactive it's yeah it's

563
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,759
something totally different that is like

564
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,839
that's

565
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,599
multi-dimensional it's multi-dimensional

566
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:58,480
you can put skin you can dab it you can

567
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:01,558
eat it the simplification seems to yeah

568
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,480
it is bro you guys hit it the other day

569
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,960
9% thca and this is like so we just went

570
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,798
from like heavy night what was before

571
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,720
this was quite a heavy impact this is

572
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:14,119
light this is very light and bring back

573
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,240
up this is what I thought is this would

574
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,158
bring the if if the turps would lead you

575
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,000
in a sativa Direction it may only be low

576
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,039
TC that sends you down I don't know if

577
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,480
it's undimensioned it I don't know if

578
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,558
it's like removing Dimension from the

579
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,880
from it but it does like he says it

580
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:31,599
brought it up yeah it kind of just made

581
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,480
it more like cuz this seems to be an

582
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,558
energy dose where this is like a yeah

583
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,679
this is like a balancing like oh I like

584
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,918
it yeah and this that's a great product

585
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,600
for when you're like filming a bubble

586
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,159
Man's World episode and you got to Puff

587
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,398
like say 11 rips with D4 20K of a full

588
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,159
melt dryft you might want to take a hit

589
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:51,639
of that halfway through just to level

590
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,159
out that could be great during cannabis

591
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,480
cups where you're testing Y and you want

592
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,840
to come back each time you're like all

593
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,720
right let's just click it's almost

594
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,759
clearing cuz it was like a fruity like

595
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,480
like a minty toothpaste a bit right

596
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,960
that's what I figured is

597
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,038
this that mintiness that goes this way

598
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,399
unprocessed by heat this is where it um

599
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:20,398
starts out at that gets you excited for

600
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:21,839
more session oh yeah session booster yes

601
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,479
that's what I thought I thought if you

602
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,639
had something in your system in your

603
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,200
system it goes to on you but if you just

604
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,240
hit it on your own you like what's going

605
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,440
on I love sativa so personally like sure

606
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,480
you know the the the heavy the heavy is

607
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,399
nice for right before bed but it's not

608
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,798
ideal when you're filming an episode and

609
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:41,678
you're watching Four Guys and all of a

610
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,119
sudden they're all sitting there like

611
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,200
heavy eyed and barely talking all right

612
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,319
so we're going to get to six still just

613
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,278
hitting yeah that that got that got some

614
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,240
slave on it you want me to knock it up

615
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,919
you you want to do the real just carve

616
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,640
it and if you hit it if you hit it real

617
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:02,000
low like don't pull so hard on it

618
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,320
you build the The Vapor headit up nice

619
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,558
I'm going put this thing up to nine and

620
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:08,879
then keep knocking it down at six what

621
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:11,038
you like is L that is tasty low okay all

622
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,559
right so now let's pick a strain to we

623
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,119
know that H it's we can let's modulate

624
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,558
that's what I'm saying that's what I'm

625
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:20,038
all right so you want to go death bub

626
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,079

in your system it's a it becomes the

645
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:17,639
modulator like you figured we could just

646
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,879
hit some turs and go in a different

647
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,440
direction so it's really nice that's one

648
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,320
I'll take an

649
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,278
ounce that's what everyone's going to

650
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,839
write in the comments I'll take one too

651
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,519
all right so let's

652
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,439
I don't know what happens when you

653
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,839
readminister hey wait let's show them

654
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,600
that all right that just looks so nuts

655
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:43,079
science with Horatio cannabis so we got

656
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,798
TPS on one side and dude that [ __ ] is

657
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,798
white

658
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,679
bomb all right so you got your thing

659
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,240
you're doing your thing there's I don't

660
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,240
know if it presses I've

661
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,200
never I've never considered it wonder if

662
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,539
I could use an L filter and just film

663
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,360
right through it

664
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,720
[Music]

665
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,199
let's see what happens when we come out

666
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,880
of the press did you get turpy with it

667
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,278
yet yeah well I put the turps against

668
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,960
the wall ah I see I see okay oh boy all

669
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:15,000
right and now it's now we got some

670
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:19,640
pressed cake perfect so um pressed cake

671
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,640
it is I support that the

672
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:26,480
swabs see if we can pick

673
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
this all right we've been at it for 30

674
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,599
minutes puff and tough hitting HS all

675
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,038
right feeling

676
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:38,240
better maybe not quite 30 minutes maybe

677
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:41,480
it was 15 I don't know that go yeah's

678
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,720
getting modulated dep of

679
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,159
it see how that makes you feel when you

680
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,159
go that way

681
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,839
I love the bio assay really you know

682
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,600
when you're not sitting in a lab with

683
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:07,398
millions of dollars in scientific

684
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:10,319
equipment a bio say is a pretty damn

685
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:11,639
accurate way to get the job done doesn't

686
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,200
take long to know what you love people

687
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,799
can laugh they're like oh you know I

688
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,840
love what you guys are doing and all but

689
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,599
this whole sitting around smoking I want

690
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:20,558
some data that tells me it's good this

691
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,278
whole sitting around smoking is how we

692
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,278
learn this

693
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,559
[ __ ] so okay so and we want the data too

694
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:30,278
we're excited all right so you're

695
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,079
registering the tur so you can register

696
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:36,679
The Taste and um did you register The

697
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,319
Taste there did you get some I

698
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,919
definitely tasted that Bubba interesting

699
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,918
all Bubba tured up now was it did it

700
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,640
keep you up there or is it more of a are

701
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,600
you still in it oh yeah let me hit that

702
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,600
still some more coming up

703
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,759
this cool thing about a bioassay too is

704
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,719
it works different for different people

705
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,960
we're all different we all have

706
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,720
different endoc can avonoid systems and

707
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,639
uh I'm sure that I feel the right hand

708
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,278
behind my eyes a bit oh yeah yeah little

709
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:11,519
different yeah P one was like more up

710
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,398
here in the hi and so that was a profile

711
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,200
of Tarpin an entire yeah that's

712
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,079
basically asking death Bubba what do you

713
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,639
have to say on the um subtle end of

714
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:23,798
basically increasing the THC of that

715
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:25,759
death Bubba so that's the you can if you

716
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:28,319
can get something consistent and go okay

717
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,558
well with this part how far do you go we

718
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,119
eventually go you know what I liked it

719
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:34,398
when you pour it on top or you know what

720
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,719
that was too much turs but when we first

721
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,638
hit it this was

722
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,360
my I'll let you all main thing main

723
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:44,240
thing I noticed was it was more of a

724
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,000
thick thick hit like a more of a full

725
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,399
hit the other one was slightly slightly

726
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,798
more light light and just wispy we're

727
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:52,479
going to have so much stuff to talk

728
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,839

that I really want to get them but this

741
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,519
session

742
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:29,519
is getting pretty good and started so I

743
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,159
don't where we'll end up if I can

744

745
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,559
that you phoned me and had this all

746
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,240
happen I thought these guys were just

747
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:37,440
going to come over after having a day

748
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,638
out in Adventure Land and just it was

749
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,720
going to be really kind of like not much

750
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:43,398
happening and then the next thing you

751
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,919
know we were at a party introducing them

752
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,398
to all these people and then all of a

753
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,960
sudden you're like I'm at your door M I

754

760
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,240
yeah thank you I me you know what I mean

761
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:11,558
[ __ ] visiting it's like you going and

762
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:14,200
visiting your bro in Germany Str yeah

763
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:17,440
it's like that pretty much or Paris he

764
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,120
could go to the US be there quicker how

765
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,120
many hours do a drive

766
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,038
Couple full b day

767
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,038
it's worth the

768
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,119
trouble it completely increased the

769
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,319
bubbling factor that [ __ ] melted into a

770
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,158
liquid before but it didn't really

771
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:50,079
bubble tur bubble now with a simple

772
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,639
bioassay and two different dabs you know

773
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:57,359
the truth forever and um when it comes

774
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:57,359
to the type of reactions you see exactly

775
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,678
T and it's it's actually as um Dr Mal

776
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,000
Shon told me he's like the tpin are what

777
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,119
lower the melting point and make it more

778
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,358
violent unstable if you're really at

779
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,559
real THC it should be a steady

780
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,960
nonviolent reaction to the most part Mak

781
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,838
sense

782
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:23,960
yeah so now we see a little bit of TPS

783
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:23,960
it's very tpy that yummy

784
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:36,118
grab me by my throat way more than the

785
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,639
P I mean it's still

786
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:43,399
gone it was turs the pure was so light

787
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:45,079
now the Bubba taste was a little less

788
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,319
than I thought it would be I thought it

789
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:50,000
would be more pronounced I definitely

790
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,000
taste it on my

791
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,440
lips interesting about the high it's

792
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,199
definitely heavier have you done this

793
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,200
before it's

794
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,559
heavier all

795
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,679
these my chest cuz all these things

796
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,800
would have to

797
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:13,519
come that happened at

798
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,079
first but now I got it behind my eye

799
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,559
about five I love Hitting off the

800
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,720
different sources too I got to say that

801
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,039
silicon carbide nail is it's that's a

802
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,639
serious must for the quiver yeah I can't

803
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,920
really go home without that but when I

804
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,480
see no well D have to figure

805
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,079
compl you hooked up no problem man those

806
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,039
guys are good guys they'll sort you out

807
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,320
you can use the old discount my code

808
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:39,119
this month actually for the rest of the

809
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,440
month is bubbleman 420 and that's at

810
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,160
dna.com website any any of your D nail

811
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,119
needs you get a discount with that code

812
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:49,399
and uh I believe they have the silicone

813
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,000
carbide nail they have two so make sure

814
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,440
you order the proper one they have one

815
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,719
that has a saire insert that sits inside

816
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,880
of

817
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,799
it uh and then they have this one which

818
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,440
is just the p and then they got the

819
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,920
under the under nail what is it the the

820
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,519
flat coil the flat coil yes exactly the

821
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,358
other nail is this one they they mount

822
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:11,960
it on a piece of titanium for me so a

823
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:16,239
coil goes around it it's kind of a

824
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,000
unique uh silicon head nice I see that

825
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,358
the basically super highend

826
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,239
ceramic definitely more heavy feel it

827
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,759
more heavy than the it is all right I

828
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,399
know cuz it's just slowing me down now

829
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,480
do you want to step in

830
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,240
the last we can step into some My Little

831
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,519
Pony which is the last sounds like it's

832
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,679
almost over no no no it's the last of

833
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,559
this Dimension another round oh yeah

834
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,559
this is this we're going through

835
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,920
feelings okay so the next feeling hey

836
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,358
wait we're guys let's just stick with

837
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,720
feeling

838
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:51,519
look I've got one feeling dabs feeling I

839
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,519
don't want to flipflop but the this is a

840
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,800
different feeling so let's smell this

841
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,599
and see if we can decipher what going

842
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,560
nrow Leaf drug cultivar now that's this

843
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:04,000
is MK Ultra so this is the research

844
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,279
mystery it should be another Downer but

845
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,280
there's a definite different purpose

846
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,200
between a death Bubba and an MK Ultra

847
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,160
they both cushy but so differently cushy

848
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:16,799
that it's like wow eh that one really is

849
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:19,559
like that's that's something right there

850
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,400
there's like a I wish we could fraction

851
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,119
that and see it sitting in front of us

852
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,280
in all the different things because we'd

853
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,838
be able to smell it right at the end

854
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,040
when you smell it there's something

855
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:29,920
that's Sharp

856
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,000
that goes into your nose it's like as

857
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,639
you're pulling it away it's almost like

858
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,559
you don't get it when you're smelling it

859
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:38,400
it's just as you stop smelling it that

860
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:40,799
you're like oh you get this little blast

861
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,838
that's the tpine I want to know what I

862
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,920
that's what makes me so crazy is knowing

863
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:46,880
these are only the Turin nobody smells

864
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,079
once they get a bag of weed that I'm

865
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,119
like no all generation every pack SM

866
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,039
them The Growers know them but the

867
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,039
usually if some only some Growers

868
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:02,599
dedicate themselves to one smell like

869
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:04,559
the guy um so for instance the the train

870
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,280
wreck grower now he has a room of true

871
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,920
train wreck so he lives this profile to

872
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,960
the point where I'm like are you serious

873
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,639
it's just too strange you smoke and he's

874
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,440
like this is the only thing I need this

875
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:19,000
is got more of that OG Pine kind of oh

876
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,920
yeah that's so it at the end awesome I

877
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,480
love

878
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,119
that the real turps the real

879
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,119
turps you you have to it's like cuz

880
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,079
we're can't smell them direct it's like

881
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,440
an

882
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,039
a mean was doing it in like that yeah

883
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,480
well that's how we started doing it the

884
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,679
the first time I ever saw them it was

885
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,440
like you had to waft them that's what

886
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:44,159
these are good for cuz this little Thin

887
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,318
Line when you in and out that now we're

888
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,519
getting modulated there the wreck yeah I

889
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:49,000
got to say I really like how you put

890
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,559
them in them little perfume bottles cuz

891
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,480
then you can really I'm used to smelling

892
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:57,799
those sticks as and you get a real I do

893
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,000
worry about the plastic that that's my

894
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,280
first question cuz this shouldn't be

895
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,358
regular plastic if this is a graded

896
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,839
style in the in the those are for

897
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:07,519
perfumes well that's the thing is this

898
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,799
is just a side so I'm like how could we

899
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,599
damn those tping are costic well that's

900
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,560
the question now the

901
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,240
pecs I see no degradational leaking of

902
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,519
life for

903
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:21,039
instance now was that one cuz I gave you

904
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:25,119
water and alcohol as well this is a

905
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:28,800
special top that doesn't break down in

906
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,920
like costic materials this these

907
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,400
normally have just like a rubber grommet

908
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,119
in there those are bad you can't put

909
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,880
that [ __ ] these are proper tops I

910
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,800
suspect these are it's a black version

911
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,720
of it cuz it would be insane to be able

912
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,720
to create this and then be like ah these

913
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,919
are just for S perfumes are essential

914
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,559
oils and those essential oils are tpin

915
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,159
and turboid that and we know those

916
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,679
things have to go for a very long time

917
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,279
just like we're pulling out PEX for for

918
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,919
strain and as you can tell everybody

919
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,079
we're learning pretty much a

920
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,358
with you guys you're watching us

921
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,839
learn this is how it's going you know

922
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,078
that's what I love about hash Church the

923
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:10,679
open dialogue is really breaking open

924
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,680
the um W the ability for people to come

925
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,759
upideas it's okay we can save

926
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:20,919
that um train wreck was also the highest

927
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,480
yielding T so so we using that no so we

928
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,400
have okay so we have

929
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,679
some let's do it wow yeah do you want to

930
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,039
show the camera before I I wonder if

931
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,838
we're going to run out of THC we're not

932
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,639
going we're so going to run out of THC

933
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,920
all right well you know what let's do a

934
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,039
straight modulation

935
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,880
you no no hold on hold on hold on hold

936
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:43,519
hold we got this under control we got

937
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,240
this under control we got this under

938
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,239
control um we're not going before we

939
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,838
even modulate it I love when this

940
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:54,479
happens this Happ has happened to me a

941
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:56,719
few times all right hold on we got so

942
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,719
much to all right you ready grab your

943
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:02,159
rig

944
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,078
okay just put all right just put that

945
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:07,838
the to hold on you got to wait for them

946
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,720
to work off okay I'll close the deal

947
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,759
nice close the deal it's

948
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,039
opportune we're going to watch now this

949
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,680
so This basically we inadvertently jump

950
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,559
straight into tur

951
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:23,118
modulation before we yeah does everyone

952
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:25,318
feel yeah we're buzzing everyone's

953
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,880
buzzing okay all right now we're not

954
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:32,000
going to bump this sea of opportunity no

955
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,760
that would not be but that's just tur

956
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,440
soup bro we could just grab a little bit

957
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,160
of this dude did you purge that dude

958
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:43,119
this is so purged man like I harvested

959
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:46,559
this on day one it's that fresh just

960
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,559
drop that in I need to update

961
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,280
your just pure rack is that what that is

962
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,800
yeah we were supposed to modulate it

963
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,640
with some THC but I guess we're just

964
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,880
going to modulate the last hit with pure

965
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:02,358
chps crazy how no Vapor comes out but

966
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,599
you can still taste that [ __ ] crazy Co

967
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:10,799
in the nice oh yeah all right now let's

968
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,800
L it up all right so my art for

969
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:16,919
definitely this is illogical everyone's

970
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:19,679
going to be like they're wasting turps

971
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,680
I'm like I bumped

972
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,960
it this isn't scripted people

973
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,679
try to fit all these [ __ ] in

974
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,119
they keep leaning

975
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:36,118
out lean

976
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:44,640

00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:45,719
table if it leaves its

999
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,280
boundaries don't worry about the table

1000
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,598
man look someone already messed it up

1001
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,880
with a cup they left on the table ouch

1002
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:57,480
not blaming anyone whoever that

1003
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:01,440
was Co next all right obviously train

1004
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,199
wreck is got to cover a lot of something

1005
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,280
um we'll press something into this do

1006
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,519
you want to put some bubble there's a

1007
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,960
bunch of bubble right

1008
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,280
there you want to do the honors sure

1009
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,800
start pressing that out to something

1010
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,280
ridic wait iish back hold on do we need

1011
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,119
the what do you need like half a gram a

1012
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
gram two grams what do you think for

1013
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,800
this much turs yeah it just all depends

1014
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,599
on how Wild you want to live well it's

1015
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,079
up to you guys what do you mean are you

1016
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,440
seeing how I'm I'm just going to

1017
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:31,920
approach this real quick real quick I it

1018
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,920
won't burn and this is extra CL this is

1019
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,358
powder

1020
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,400
nice yes dude I wish I had the camera up

1021
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:44,279
close for that cuz that was insane that

1022
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,559
was insane he says he wants one of those

1023
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,880
going have to do that I've got a great

1024
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:53,400
one but I want to see that on the camera

1025
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:58,720
tipping all right hold on hold on ready

1026
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,800
sir yep we're tipping wait for it

1027
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:04,199
oh my God I missed

1028
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,839
it there it is so much

1029
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:09,039
tipping he's tripping tipping oh where's

1030
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:09,039
the

1031
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,919
C oh

1032
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:20,598
no we're hitting

1033
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,639
Turin modulated you got modulated all

1034
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:25,960
right swing it over modulate T

1035
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:30,440
HCA get

1036
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,920
from that is the thca we are the

1037
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,000
modulators all right he's dripping we're

1038
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,639
just dealing with excess resources

1039
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,639
capping this is just out of

1040
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:40,759
control all right all right all right

1041
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:44,519
all

1042
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,520
right all right now overload

1043
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:48,639
overload all right now we can put that

1044
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:51,639
bubble in there just put a little here

1045
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,759
or you know or wait hold on hold on I I

1046
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:55,759
got an even better idea cuz since we're

1047
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,640
going to be sublimating yes do you want

1048
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,040
to roll this in silver Haze or

1049
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,440
UBC what if be like I got the are you

1050
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,759
kidding me did you see the hit he gave

1051
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,280
me yeah good

1052
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:11,800
he do that yeah should this just mop up

1053
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,839
mop up a little completely 100% all

1054
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,640
right hold on Ramon Ramon's going to mop

1055
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,880
up some that's what expr you know what

1056
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,519
you just called it bro we are we're

1057
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,000
doing a mop up trip now for those of you

1058
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:28,318
that ever um took uh Crystal LSD by the

1059
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,719
Graham and turned it into liquid liid um

1060
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,079
and then maybe even took that liquid and

1061
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:34,118
turned that into sheets uh eventually

1062
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,599
you had to clean all your tools and

1063
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:38,680
generally when you cleaned all your

1064
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,640
tools it was called a mop up trip so you

1065
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:44,199
clean all your little vials and get it

1066
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,960
all dude this is a mop up T just

1067
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:48,039
smothered well the thing is we smothered

1068
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,599
some peex and TPS which so now we're

1069
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:51,679
crossing the line it means

1070
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,760
we're what do you got there he had some

1071
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,399
Pineapple Express untp just pressed

1072
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,480
remember when we press dry sip just to

1073
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,160
press it to see what was going on

1074
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,119
and um now it's Ted well yeah I mean all

1075
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:05,719
you have to do is make a slight trip to

1076
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,519
the interated to the Seven Star right

1077
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:12,799
there it just jumped to Seven Star just

1078
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:14,800
by taking a quick swim all right so S I

1079
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,960
got to say these are not the average

1080
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,000
Tarpin what I'm used to tasting May

1081
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,639
either I've tried a few these are the

1082
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:26,280
real Tarpin bro I just wanted to say

1083
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:28,039
that quit give ratio some serious credit

1084
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,599
for his work let me get in here I think

1085
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:32,838
I'm cutting myself out of the amazing so

1086
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:34,200
we're going seven star yeah should I hit

1087
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:36,279
it off the sck or can I go off the

1088
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:39,358
quartz whichever way you I think we want

1089
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,319
to go quartz yeah wow bro so we'll just

1090
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:45,719
cut swabs of that we'll just kill that

1091
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:48,000
off just trying to use the pressure on

1092
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:48,000
this

1093
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,079
paper all right we're breaking off a few

1094
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:59,440
skins just skin just a few skin flakes

1095
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,440
right now that is

1096
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,519
insane

1097
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:15,879
wow oh that's a better way to carb

1098
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,078
that make the mushroom there's a carb

1099
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,400
right there on the too

1100
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:27,079
so all right so now we busted through a

1101
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,760
few lines of modulation

1102
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,880
cuz um you've already jumped into

1103
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:35,520
pineapple train red my eyelids are

1104
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:38,000
Blinky yeah that was great but um very

1105
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:40,960
tasty what statements do we have about

1106
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,440
um just the straight turs chasing

1107
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,000
up you know what it's just so exciting

1108
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,920
that it's almost hard to like even it

1109
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,239
might take me a week to really give you

1110
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,680
an accurate description but I'll say

1111
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:56,000
this much it's exciting it's fun and

1112
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,719
it's different well I'm not feeling down

1113
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,400
right now I'm feeling buzzing I'm

1114
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,118
buzzing pretty good I have to say like

1115
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,639
not in a coffee kind of way but more in

1116
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,480
just a sort of the closest thing we get

1117
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,759
to it naturally I guess excited like

1118
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,000
it's like whatever this is is is good

1119
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,319
yes you know what I mean there's some

1120
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,679
positive modulation that this is

1121
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,599
probably [ __ ] they don't want us knowing

1122
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:20,759
about this is this is why it doesn't

1123
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,480
just jump out there into the open field

1124
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,280
because um here comes the buddy with the

1125
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,599
fake modulators to just try to jump in

1126
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,798
and anything safe like no I'm this could

1127
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:32,760
be unsafe it's the plant I'm trusting

1128
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:36,199
that makes it safe that I'm only asking

1129
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,960
the plant to put the ratios

1130
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:40,399
together well I tell you um the few

1131
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,440
times when I first started doing this

1132
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,119
with Tony he was really the first person

1133
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,920
to to pull out the pure turps um I found

1134
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,798
that we were hitting too much hitting a

1135
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,318
pure even your TS pure didn't close my

1136
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:54,920
lungs that's the funny thing cuz I'm

1137
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:56,838
like okay we're going hard and I

1138
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,960
remember Tony saying whoa you're going

1139
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,880
hard I'm like some of the turs Tony had

1140
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,639
had some crazy like powerful like you

1141
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:07,280
take a little hit and it was literally

1142
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:08,558
like long just stop then it's a

1143
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,599
different

1144
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,000
um do you think it's more of a

1145
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,160
concentration of the whole plant they

1146
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,838
sure smelted amazing though holy Christ

1147
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:20,239
the jelly beam and the he he had like

1148
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:22,199
three different flavors this one time

1149
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:25,358
and each one were like perfect

1150
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:28,039
representations yeah of uh of what they

1151
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,119
were I remember like two meters across

1152
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:32,358
the room sitting in a chair across the

1153
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:34,838
room he came in the doorway yeah and he

1154
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:38,119
opened it up and he just went

1155
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:40,159
like exactly he looked at me in my eyes

1156
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,559
and he

1157
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,399
just and then I just grinned back and I

1158
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,680
was like whoa you got something special

1159
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,440
right there so now that's a good

1160
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:51,159
question now did it smell more like the

1161
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,440
dried weed or more like the weed grown

1162
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:57,039
when it comes to being after like like I

1163
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,480
would say gr I would say grown I that's

1164
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:01,079
it what's that I another one I just hit

1165
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,039

1169
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,480
we're just finishing the paper that had

1170
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,838
the grand SP you H it yeah going back to

1171
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,679

1172
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:20,318

1173

1174
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,880
subate that looks so cool with a c

1175
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,880
reload it with a little bit of

1176
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:34,920
dude all right so we got some trre

1177
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:37,078

1178
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,480
the morning all right all right all

1179
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,559
right all right all right all right all

1180
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,199
right yes what's the next move I think

1181
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:46,280
we should pull this sublimator out soon

1182
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:48,439
well pretty much just like we got the

1183
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,760
sublimator H activated right yeah that

1184
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,639
goes with the sublimator do you want to

1185
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,079
hit one activated yeah let's hit one

1186
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:56,639
activated before we sublimate and then I

1187
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,599
think that's a w what would you like

1188
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,719
like to hit the activated through just

1189
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:05,760

00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,280
to split it before I come back and it's

1214
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,079

1215
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,559
situation

1216
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,199
interesting yeah it's pretty incredible

1217
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:29,679

to seven so it's in the green not the

1258
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,119
red so it's we could do low temp dabbing

1259
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,838
off the top or we could just put herb in

1260

the bowl and I'll put we're going to

1261
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:55,119
just put her in the

1262
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:57,719
bowl can't say it herb in the bowl yeah

00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,639
I heard it all mangled on video I'm like

1266
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:05,440
it's not going to go down good on it's

1267
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:07,679
going to sound like Earl in the bowl

1268
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,880
yeah I put Earl in the bowl Wait no

1269
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,318
that's what I wanted to say it's it it

1270
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,480
doesn't deserve the term Earl but um

1271
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:18,838
yeah put some herb in the bowl and put

1272
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,798
some Earl in the bowl and some Earl on

1273
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:23,239
top of the herb rather than dab off the

1274
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,759
top cuz it is different to well the

1275

double decker the thing where you load

1276

been going around the B

1290
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,039
prob I didn't think you'd pass it that

1291
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,400
oh no I didn't think you would grab it

1292
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:05,079
it's actually not so grippy it's

1293
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,760
actually not that bad the funny thing is

1294
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:08,119

I'm going do this I'm going just keep

1305
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:40,559
hitting it till Oblivion or the

1306
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,838
ambulance wakes me up

1307
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,440
and I'm going see how many rips I can

1308
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:47,279

00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,798
500°

1311
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,798

1312
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:56,798
body that's the good thing about the E I

1313
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,838

1314
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,639
just keeps going so I'm just going to

1315
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:04,838
top in top see I can't believe he handed

1316
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:04,838
it to me that place I burnt

1317
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:12,038
myself you know when I first grabbed it

1318
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:14,400
it was hot but then I just took like 11

1319
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:16,319
hits of that yeah and I can't even

1320
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,639
remember where it was

1321
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,639
hot like at all came back hotter just I

1322
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:23,480
tapped it real quick so maybe tomorrow I

1323
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:25,798
might feel it somewhere on my hands but

1324

set holy my shoulder was hurting and it

1327
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,480
stopped hurting that [ __ ] is pain relief

1328
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,519
straight up it really is like

1329
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:42,559
instantaneous get your toes

1330
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:44,639
high get your toes high

1331
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,760
yes by then you guys will have heard the

1332
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:50,558
story on hash Church of how I put an axe

1333
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:54,280
in my foot and the only thing I could go

1334
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:56,760
for was this at um I basically just hit

1335
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:01,400
it with iodine twice and then

1336
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:04,119
caked it shut and um with that in it

1337
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:07,160
stuck a bunch of L in your foot finger

1338
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:08,640
basically it's a big open Kass and you

1339
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:12,118
fill up your finger and it was like just

1340
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:14,558
trying to cap the Grand Canyon with a

1341
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:16,200
barrier cream and I just capped it and

1342
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,440
let it ooze

1343
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:23,558
and and just mind me I'm going to take

1344
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,000
a within an hour and a half I was um

1345
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:28,039
obviously working on one of these things

1346
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,760
for tonight and

1347
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:32,760
I start to trip and I'm like what the

1348
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,520
[ __ ] I haven't been dabbing and nor only

1349
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,680
only when you're on this or like oh

1350
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:38,440
right you realized how high you were

1351
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:40,798
from your foot the fact well the number

1352
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:44,200
one thing was that without my

1353
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:46,440
traditional sub lingual tpin and

1354
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:49,199
additives to pass the um under tongue

1355
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,720
bar I had no potential thought that um

1356
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,558
the skin being more of a sublingual

1357
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,038
experience that it could pass through

1358
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,798
you didn't need a sublingual you put

1359
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:59,000
that right into your body but this

1360
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,759
pass through like the subl lingo would I

1361
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,880
didn't need a li didn't you put it into

1362
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,000
a wound I put it in a wound in my foot

1363
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,920
the furthest that's what I mean I'm like

1364
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,159
this passed through without a liver I

1365
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,920
didn't have to send this through my

1366
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:14,159
gastric system and I didn't have to add

1367
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:17,400
basically whatever turpine remainder is

1368
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:19,480
qualifying as a sublingual barrier

1369
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,318
normally I use cin see this is what

1370
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,599
David uh Allan was talking a little bit

1371
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:26,119
about on hash Church some weeks or even

1372
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,720
months ago now sorry in regards to

1373
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:29,519
you'll remember this conversation about

1374
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:31,519
how he was talking about getting it he

1375
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,719
wanted an Esther that you could apply to

1376
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,280
the heart exact and I was like H you're

1377
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:37,199
going to have to use chemicals but even

1378
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,599
like phyto canabo that you were able to

1379
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,519
hook up to like if you go to the

1380
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:43,160
hospital and you just have a bag of like

1381
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:45,719
sing Solution that's fill of filled with

1382
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:48,118
phyto canabo just saturating the endoc

1383
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:50,399
canabo system right off the bat that's

1384
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:53,720
like there's a future in that occasion

1385
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,240
of War solubles well just the fact that

1386
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:58,078
I'm like I didn't have to use what I all

1387
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,798
my trans what I thought I needed is

1388
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,359
transports like for transdermal close

1389
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:05,599
you know on the surface you need your

1390
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,358
other tools to get transdermal but as

1391
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:11,519
soon as I was exploded to blood and

1392
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:13,119
plasma and the actual system clearly you

1393
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,280
can't go from your foot to your liver

1394
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,160
through your gut um I didn't swallow it

1395
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,960
and I didn't use my sub cheet the Turpin

1396
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:25,558
that leaning is left me qualify as

1397
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:27,400
direct it's I think what whatever it is

1398
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,400
it's antic at the same time it's the

1399
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,160
antiseptic quality and it's also the

1400
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,440
fact that it bypasses it you don't if

1401
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:33,960
you're in I don't know what you're

1402
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,519
bleeding out but sometimes the liver is

1403
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,000
not available whether it's your

1404
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:40,798
drunk the fact I didn't have to eat it I

1405
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,599
thought oh well you know it was taking a

1406
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:45,679
long time too the fact it took no

1407
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,920
different time it it took the exact same

1408
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:49,159
amount of time to get high as it would

1409
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,480
as if I ate it an hour and 45 minutes

1410
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:51,480
and I was like oh my God oh my God

1411
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,469
they're not going to get the sift

1412
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,550
they're not going to get the sift

1413
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:56,549
[Music]

1414
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:59,838
there's not going to be any sip tomorrow

1415
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,880
and I'm typing to my buddy and I'm like

1416
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,880
hey hey bro words

1417
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:12,720
tough like Mel wait a minute so I chose

1418
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:15,480
this for its pain relief THC I didn't go

1419
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:17,078
the CBD normally everyone thinks CBD

1420
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,440
inflammation is everything some things

1421
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:21,160
aren't inflammation some things are

1422
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:24,000
still acute pain trauma and that was

1423
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:26,239
panic attack trauma and um because I

1424
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,519
couldn't even sit on the foot later find

1425
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,159
out but the fact that it went through at

1426
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:33,119
such a level that I actually had to

1427
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:34,318
watch how much I fed my foot if I had

1428
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,920
have given that to my wife she would

1429
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:39,599
have trip trip

1430
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,240
um I'm more amazed at it that it went

1431
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,359
through the blood that way than anything

1432
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:46,519
I could have eaten or dab but um I'm

1433
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:49,119
very very pleased with um that new

1434
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:51,000
paradigm and Tony will have a lot to say

1435
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,838
um because he's gone the transdermal

1436
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,318
route but I never knew if the prol line

1437
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:57,480
could be used in an open room situation

1438
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:59,639
right where this being a distillate

1439
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,519
you've kind of already done your trial

1440
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:05,118
by fire and um as long as you don't D

1441
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:07,119
dip your finger in it he's definitely

1442
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,240
he'll open the capsules and put it on

1443
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,519
skin and then the drops I've seen him

1444
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:15,639
rub as well somewh so then he then he

1445
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:18,519
then they they qualify as um hypo

1446
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:21,000

interesting does it feel too sweet and

1477
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:43,519
Candy likee cuz I'm questioning browers

1478

their their Bud Candy and how much that

1479
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,119
this up however you load a sublimator

1480
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:48,759
you're the boss of your unit well I

1481

1482
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,440
not let me see if it's right here

1483

1484
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:57,639
[Music]

1485
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:57,639
let's more water

1486
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:14,639
so we're just going back in

1487
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:17,920
on a lot

1488
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:19,400
of all right go for it it gets yeah it's

1489
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,240
going to get all super hot I got my

1490
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:26,160
Urban grower of grinder

1491
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:28,558
ug yeah you know Remo gave me this years

1492
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:31,598
ago like I'm talking some years ago and

1493
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:35,119
I never used it ever and then now that

1494
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:36,480
I'm uh back on my sublimator here it's

1495
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,960
quite nice

1496
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,760
to I think get back to the flavors of

1497
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,318
cannabis after going in over to Remos

1498
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,119
that's kind of when I was like God there

1499
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:47,838
is something if I could I even bought a

1500
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:49,960
vitalizer and that's good for the road

1501
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:53,400
but for this kind of experience with the

1502
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,720
men's um getting a nice grind pound and

1503
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,358
just working through it and now that

1504
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:01,519
we're adding

1505
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:04,000
lemony anyway that seems to be the tone

1506
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,639
cuz um we'll see about the high maybe

1507
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,278
but it's not um it's not as crystally as

1508
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:10,400
a normal silver haze would be so should

1509
01:06:07,278 --> 01:06:12,079
I light this up or what yeah does the

1510
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,079
bear [ __ ] in the

1511
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,278
woods well for my dirt biking uh that

1512
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:20,519
I've done he mostly shits on the

1513
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:22,599
path not so much oh wait a minute only

1514
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:24,000
on the the path when we ride wait a

1515
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:26,400
minute what I'm waiting no I was going

1516
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,318
to say did you grind up the train wreck

1517
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,680
um bud no I ground up just the little

1518
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,159
bud that you just okay so I did give you

1519
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:33,679
a new bud so I was going to say the

1520
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,239
train wreck will be [ __ ] ton full of

1521
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:38,598
leonine but no no it's new okay I just

1522
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:40,598
double checking the whatever that little

1523
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:42,400
bud was that you just passed me over cuz

1524
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:44,160
this is the new question with all these

1525
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,519
growing methods and then with all the

1526
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:48,639
confusion about genetics every name

1527
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:51,679
strain

1528
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:53,199
just it doesn't feel as hazy as a lot of

1529
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,199
it doesn't feel like silver Haz as I

1530
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,480
know it it definitely feels more candied

1531
01:06:56,199 --> 01:07:01,278
here's where the

1532
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:04,278
experience yeah makes you this makes

1533
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:04,278
you

1534
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,679
y she hit

1535
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:23,759
before it's always

1536
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,760
hot specializ

1537
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,240

01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,920
someone mentioned in the comments that

1564
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:00,559
after Todd Todd had tried his um he was

1565
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,920
on I think it was Neville's hay someone

1566
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,440
had commented that he was on and then he

1567

01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,838
never got it yeah pass that

1570
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:18,400

no down to this um High yeah yeah I'm

1572

going to I'm going to have to agree with

1573
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,600
you on that it might have started out a

1574
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:26,319
little heavy I think we hit the L at

1575
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,600

1578
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,600

1595
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:31,559
was that that's um the I'm going to put

1596
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:33,319
BC in front of everything I do until we

1597
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:36,000
get to some true men with some true

1598
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:38,519
genetics this is the BC silver haze so

1599
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,840
that can't be um silver hazee I've tried

1600
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,320
in the past and it can't be home state

1601
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,119
um for you silver haze but it's

1602
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:48,599
definitely like everything has got a

1603
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:50,119
candy spin on the strain um silver haze

1604
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,800
but I do feel

1605
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:55,439

01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:31,519
for air no yeah told we smoking the [ __ ]

1618
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,520
out of my house if you look at the

1619
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:37,120
lights no tobacco functional I just I

1620
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:37,879
seen like in so many other scenarios

1621
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:41,399
like

1622
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,199
even Nails end up more dirty but um I'm

1623
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:45,039
not choking like now you smoke all

1624
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,599
around the world typically when you go

1625
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:50,800
into concentrate sessions do you walk

1626
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:54,880
out um with feeling like you left with

1627
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:57,400
plaque um like weight like some block of

1628
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:00,560
air cuz I'm more sensitive so I I'll

1629
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:03,719
seize up even from the her different

1630
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:06,039
than that might do it for me the

1631
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:08,198
otherwise if it's good resin or I have a

1632
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:10,399
problem with the tobacco that's the one

1633
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:11,919
thing even being in the same environment

1634
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:14,638
I don't like that I've experienced that

1635
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:19,359
a lot in Spain can't deal with it like

1636
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:23,119
me really is remember in uh Barcelona

1637
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:24,799
uh I remember it was kind of a bummer

1638
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:27,039
it's crazy how many people I've been cuz

1639
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,560
I've been with them burning it down I

1640
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,679
can't smoke this weed give us cuz

1641
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,159
basically you are just modulating your

1642
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,840
cigarette the whole night is about how

1643
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:36,599
do oh are you modulating your cigarette

1644
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,679
with hash has it got a subtle Berry

1645
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,320
flavor I'm modulating my cigarette with

1646
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:43,560
uh herb but that's how they approach the

1647
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:46,599
world it's through the cigarettes eyes

1648
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:49,080
not through um the medicine first as

1649
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:51,639
it's primary I've been there and done

1650
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:53,840
that I think we should do a double

1651
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:56,119
decker hit each it time it's it time I

1652
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,039
think we should yeah we've been chatting

1653

1685
01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:32,439
Urban grower Urban grower that's his

1686
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:35,199
favorite I had to um I had a one most

1687
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:37,519
favorites he smoks P that [ __ ] ins I had

1688
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:39,719
a friend uh you know sick enough that

1689
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,800
it's like I need to know if this strain

1690
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:46,239
has the magic I'm like well let's find

1691
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,239
out opened it up by uh making sure we

1692
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,678
get you the strongest tur

1693
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:53,119
profile yeah he was very kind enough to

1694
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:55,920
share that cut with me about a year ago

1695
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:59,639
that was a special cut

1696
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,639
I shared it with some friends as

1697
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:09,320
well it's like sure guess what Remo

1698
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:12,960
could have taken that cut and grown it

1699
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:13,880
and bred it and sold it as Remo's push s

1700
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,480
some

1701
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:19,319
lemon but I think he was happy to share

1702
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:21,799
it with people I think do you find that

1703
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:25,039
like when people don't breed something

1704
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,159
they just actually try to grow it to

1705
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:29,359
almost back to if it was a land race

1706
01:15:27,158 --> 01:15:32,479
it's version of its land race experience

1707
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:34,319
like get it as cushy as UBC can get

1708
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,919
right um through you know learning the

1709
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:37,479
plant versus just running out and trying

1710
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,639
to oh you know what this needs it just

1711
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:42,839
needs a little dash of this strain and

1712
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:44,440
that'll fix it Dash instead of um

1713
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,960
learning if you should have grown it

1714
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:49,198
with uh better lights so you get more

1715
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,760
Mercy all right so there's your double

1716
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:53,079
decker body lock I can feel that body

1717
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,920
lock he needs it all right we're

1718
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:56,920
ninjaing in yeah go ahead

ninja

1720
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:16,600
wow that double that and cushion it whoa

1721
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,599
we lowered that time

1722
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:24,239
so we'll know how high we are when we

1723
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:25,519
see when I go on Bubble Man par and I'm

1724
