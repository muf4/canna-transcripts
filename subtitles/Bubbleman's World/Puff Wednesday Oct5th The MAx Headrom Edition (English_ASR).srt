10
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,120
if we took you to a couple of cool spots

11
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:46,159
uh where we enjoy uh puffing so we've

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,759
got uh the Horseshoe Bay Park we've got

13
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,919

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,039
parking lot in Horseshoe Bay which is

57
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,560
coincidentally enough where this Trail

58
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,079
starts private property private property

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,199
no trespassing danger danger yeah that's

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,440
where I'm going don't [ __ ] around there

61
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,039
it is all

62
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,680
right

63
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,519
okay so this isn't a very long trail

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,519
Johnny B I think you'll be good to go

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,719
just make sure you watch your

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,719
step so you don't have any slippages

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,598
figured we would

68
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,759
do this spot first there's a little bit

69
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,119
more of a trail here

70
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,798
I guess it heads

71
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,640
in to the area of that

72
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,280

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
corner I was like trying to like I want

172
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:19,959
to like take a picture I was like wow

173
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,560
this is like it's a good spot it's cool

174
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,279
think it's there Johnny I mean it's like

175
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,759
toughen spots for VC I I love it I love

176
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,799
I love I love I love the scenery and

177
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,800
what we can see absolutely

178
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,038
yeah these trails are great this is epic

179
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,840
no dude I'm telling you like super epic

180
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,598
just do a quick peek on the water here

181
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,399
there's little benches

182
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,719
everywhere Tugboat pulling some

183
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:50,000
trees so yeah this is it Lighthouse Park

184
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,240
but uh I think I

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,759
think I think we can do better than this

186
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,759
so follow me Johnny B I follow

187
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,598
oh you okay I'm fine ship's great in the

188
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,639
Pelican case you know it's fine I didn't

189
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,319
even cares

190
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,759
like right

191
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,280
away Johnny Be oh I see this is where it

192
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,560
splits so we want to get over we want to

193
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,638
go back this

194
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,918
way because otherwise there's a cool

195
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,360
little beach that goes down there and

196
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,120
it's real private but I want to take you

197
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,240
to this rock over here and we'll have a

198
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,360
nice little couple of Puffs overlooking

199
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,360

200
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,879

208
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,720
transition but

209

raining what you say Johnny

221
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
B right

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
here

223
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,879
Johnny there you are

224
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,599
there you are that's what I'm I'm

225
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,919
doing I always pay attention to my feet

226
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,079
where I'm stepping I think that's a

227
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,719
great idea I don't really you know this

228
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:16,278
this looks like the safer

229
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,278
back right along the top

230
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,278
beautiful

231
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,399
wow not bad huh do you want to go over

232
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,239
to that island and walk across those

233
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,639
rocks and then go to the other side and

234
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,639
have a little sash

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,639
I have to say I'd be lying said I don't

236
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:43,879
well let's do it it's a long walk it'll

237
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,879
take us it'll take us 10

238
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,680
minutes we're doing it all right

239
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:55,319
dude I think we got to our spot Johnny

240
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,159
B like right here that's the safest spot

241
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,800
this is really good right here I think

242
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,879
we got a nice little Zone here mother

243
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,639
ship's

244
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:07,159
safe I can have a

245
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,159
sit what do you say

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,000
bud so we cheated a little bit we

247
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,320
decided against going across to the

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,639
island over there and the main reason is

249
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,639
is that a the water tide the tide goes

250
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,560
up and down and when it goes down it's

251
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,560
great and life is wonderful but when it

252
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,838
goes up uh it becomes a little bit more

253
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,479
problematic and we're not interested in

254
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,240
getting caught might be going up right

255
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,680
it always is going up and down so it's

256
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,919
you're 50/50 on that one anytime so we

257
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,439
found ourselves a good spot here on the

258
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,879
peninsula as you can see nice drop down

259
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,720
behind me and I think this drop down I

260
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,958
think this is where we're going to set

261
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,440
up a nice little sesh for uh for puff

262
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,559
Wednesday it could be the last sesh I

263
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,959
don't know if we're going to make it to

264
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:55,479
the third spot I hope so but if not

265
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,000

358
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,799
off the

359
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,879
chart so because I have a quartz and he

360
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,958
has a

361
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,679
ceramic yeah I wouldn't wait much more

362
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,318
than 50 seconds on yours total I do W 35

363
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,318
because I don't have a carb oh but you

364
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:14,360
have the carb cap I do have the carb

365
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,519
borrow that carb cap see I I seem to

366
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,560
forget the carb cap and last time I

367
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,919
forgot the whole quartz

368
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,879
Banger and then I brought the drop down

369
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:25,198
mine didn't get that hot surprisingly

370
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,759
yeah I'm going to hit it soon here H

371
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,719
soon soon enough so I at least get a rip

372
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,120
and it's not all cold doing the same

373
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,519
thing it's cold out here and the wind is

374
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,519
really cold out here so you definitely

375
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,198
have to adjust how long you let your

376
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
bowl cool for a lot to different time

377
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,240
than you would normally in like a room

378
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,000
temperature room it's probably about 50°

379
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,919
that's a big ass boat I'll need that in

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,919
about 10

381
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,440
seconds pass that thing right

382
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,318
over the glass is already nice and cool

383
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,680
