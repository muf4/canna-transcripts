60
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:43,358
that I remember the last video where we

00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,969
to Jamaica ever once Jamaica is pretty

68
00:02:56,378 --> 00:03:00,370
cool when it really comes down to it

69
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,229
let's be honest I don't want to be in

70
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,209
the same room as a 50k pipe my friend

71
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:06,969
Hilary used to just say no thanks that

72
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,069
she'd be like no no thank you

73
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:14,378
I'd go to Pastor the big crazy piece and

74
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:16,560
she'd just be like I am okay don't need

75
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:19,349
it

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,959
yeah that was a tank wasn't it hey there

77
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,219

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,009

79
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,620
there's one with flap four two one where

80
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,479

81
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,230

82
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:38,519

87
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,829
there's no breaks he was just so chill I

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,590
guess that's how it is sometimes when

89
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:56,010
you just don't have any [ __ ] to give if

90
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,000
you have no [ __ ] to give there are no

91
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:02,818
[ __ ] to giveth that's just how it goes

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,340
alright so let's do this shall we

93
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:07,729

such a nice way to clean the pipe it

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,040

108
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,139
excellent drew and you should be

109
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,030
perfectly happy with your $75 rig

110
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,789
absolutely you know have someone having

111
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,309
a nice rig should certainly not take

112
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,460
away anything from someone's you know

113
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,519
plain and simple rig I mean I Drive a

114
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,349
pretty plain truck and when I'm driving

115
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,889
in Vancouver and I see all these kids

116
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,900
literally kids they're in their 20s

117
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:47,349
driving around in supercars like

118
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:48,819
McClaren's and Gallardo z-- and all the

119
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,980
craziest cars you can ever imagine

120
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,990
I feel great for them I'm stoked for

121
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,090
them I never feel bad about myself I

122
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,100
never feel bad about my own vehicle and

123
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:59,019
that it's not up to par I think to

124
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,640
myself man those kick those guys are in

125
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:04,329
their 20s and they get to drive a car

126
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,459
like that good for them that's for sure

127
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:08,079
I try not to do the whole keeping up

128
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:10,810
with the Joneses thing in life you know

129
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,310
just acquire the things that you want

130
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,970
acquire and don't feel too bad about

131
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,839
other people's acquirements it's like

132
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,669
when I fly I get I fly coach 99% of the

133
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,449
time I don't fly first-class very often

134
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:26,149
and would be interested in printed

135
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,430
articles on how

136
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:30,500
HT panelists and Bowman's world

137
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,660
knowledge I'm not too sure grant you

138
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,519
sent me the email I got the email it was

139
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,070
a very nice offer I'm trying to figure

140
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:40,879
out what I can I can get printed at your

141
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:43,069
company I'm really not too sure we'll

142
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,449
have to talk about it in in person but

143
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,300
at this point in time I did get your

144
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:50,150
email and trying to get it returned to

145
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,949
you and I just haven't really been able

146
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:55,638
to think other than maybe some pamphlets

147
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:59,030
or flyers I'm not too sure who knows I

148
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,590
like the idea there's a guy well we've

149
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:02,569
got our own Rob Moore who's been doing

150
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:05,269
funny cartoons but what I really liked

151
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:08,149
is these cartoons that I saw that a guy

152
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:10,279
was doing for Joe Rogan and it's

153
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,319
basically really simple it's the three

154
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,538
or four or two of them sitting around

155
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,990
the table and he's just created a

156
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:19,610
cartoon of the actual voices so he's

157
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,530
taking they're real voices and he's

158
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,300
putting it into the cartoon I'm gonna

159
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:24,939
see if Rob Moore can do a little of that

160
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,770
even just some of the most magical

161
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:29,810
powerful you know 1/2 minute

162
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:32,000
three-minute things that happen on hash

163
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,918
Church if we could get a cartoon of that

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,139
made up and a collection of those

165
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,269
cartoons made up and I'm not looking for

166
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,860
the funny sounds and the like the comedy

167
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:41,180
aspect of it I think that's great but

168
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,580
I'm talking about something very

169
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,889
different something like that's us in

170
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:49,788
caricature form talking in the hash

171
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:51,800
Church panels and sort of you know with

172
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:53,209
with this breakdown of whatever we

173
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,430
happen to be saying cuz you guys know

174
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:57,799
the knowledge drops aren't consistent

175
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,110
they happen there are little gems that

176
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,060
get dropped here and there so hopefully

177
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,580
we can ask Rob about that I like the

178
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,139
idea of of getting something like that I

179
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:07,519
saw these Joe Rogan ones and I thought

180
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,860
this is a great way to share information

181
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,379
it's hard to share a four-hour house

182
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,449
church but imagine like Jessica Hawkins

183
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:20,029
telling the story about naya first

184
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:22,250
trying cannabis oil I mean that is yeah

185
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:25,279
you know it alpha beta you know where

186
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,639
I'm at so I think that would be a cool

187
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,989
idea

188
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,340
I know Rob's not in the room right now

189
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,870
otherwise he would always already be

190
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,788
replying but we'll hit him up and we'll

191
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,720
see what's going on and we'll see if we

192
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,848
can't get some of those

193
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,889
more serious cartoons don't know because

194
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,210
I think it's a great way to share first

195
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,879
of all the knowledge that is being

196
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,310
shared sometimes is very let's say not a

197
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,939
joke it's it's not a joke it's very

198
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:49,649
serious but it would be nice to sort of

199
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,020
you know paint it up in a way that puts

200
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:53,939
it into a cartoon so you can get these

201
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,350
serious knowledge drops but at the same

202
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,670
time kind of be watching a little

203
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,759
cartoon I don't know if you guys saw the

204
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:03,839
one recently where Vice put it up and it

205
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,189
was ninja from die Antwoord word and I

206
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,750
guess he's telling the story of going

207
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,910
over to Kanye West's house and playing

208
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,429
basketball with Drake it's a funny story

209
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:13,529
they do it all in this cartoon form and

210
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:15,659
I liked it I thought it was really good

211
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:19,049
I'd seen a similar thing prior and

212
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,730
someone had even mocked that they had

213
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:22,529
jacked it from someone else so I'm not

214
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,170
trying to get vice the credit I'm sure

215
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,759
it was someone else's before vice did

216
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:29,279
this concept an idea but it was pretty

217
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,250
funny it was good it made me think man I

218
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,870
loved the idea of having I would love to

219
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,080
be able to tell a story like that and

220
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,299
then having a cartoonist be able to

221
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,160
produce a cartoon out of it because we

222
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,439
got some hilarious stories I mean the

223
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,659
hashed Church series alone from Sam and

224
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,030
in Juris stories those two guys have

225
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,620
some pretty incredible stories

226
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:52,409
Todd McCormick has some pretty

227
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,330
incredible stories as does a TA I mean

228
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,980
most of them really just have incredible

229
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,330
stories they're all incredible people so

230
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,490
why wouldn't they have incredible

231
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,980
stories even Dee 420k who's been quiet

232
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:07,080
lately I can promise you has some really

233
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:09,779
crazy crazy stories oh yes Charlie

234
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,210
Murphy there you go well Charlie

235
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,799
Murphy's dead r.i.p rest in peace

236
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,440
Charlie Murphy I was happy to puff a

237
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,669
bowl with Charlie and sit one evening

238
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,170
just lucky enough you know it was

239
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:20,909
through Mark low-keyed he was having his

240
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,789
event the cush cup and he always hired

241
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:26,639
these guys to come and be there I was

242
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:29,669
never one to try and meet you know these

243
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,710
guys I would not try to get my way in I

244
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:35,189
always felt the energy was awkward so I

245
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:38,220
told mark that I would come with my wife

246
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,770
and we would watch the show and so we

247
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,050
showed up a little bit late we saw the

248
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:44,699
end of the show of Charlie show and then

249
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,529
Mark was like oh here I'll you know sit

250
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,960
back here it's a little more private and

251
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,720
he had the

252
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,200
little table in a corner and so my wife

253
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,600
and I sat there and it ended up being

254
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,129
Charlie Murphy and his bodyguard who

255
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
traveled with him all the time big guy

256
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,570
can't remember his name

257
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,790
sat down with us and it was pretty

258
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,560
[ __ ] cool to have Charlie Murphy at a

259
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:07,929
table with just my wife and his

260
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:10,809
bodyguard telling stories you know

261
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:12,489
telling we kind of got into the true

262
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:15,250
Hollywood stories and the Chappelle's

263
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,680
Show and and what it was like being

264
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,230
Eddie Murphy's brother in the 80s like

265
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,759
holy [ __ ] Eddie Murphy was our rock star

266
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,580
in the eighties man I'm telling you

267
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,500
maybe late seventies whenever whenever

268
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,259
that stand-up that he did came out I

269
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,769
can't believe I'm brain farting the name

270
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:34,149
but yeah Eddie Murphy's stand-up I'm

271
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:38,259
sure someone's gonna put it up right

272
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:40,120
away but very cool I love it I think

273
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,649
comedy should stay alive I think if

274
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,810
Charlie Murphy came up with that he

275
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,209
should absolutely Eddie Murphy raw there

276
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,459
you go thank you it was kind of paused

277
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,320
out uh you know I'm smoking on a variety

278
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,629
of things I'm just finishing up that

279
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,580
Justin Trudeau Kush actually I think

280
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,649
that's what's gonna go down in the next

281
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,740
ball it's kind of amazing how much was

282
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,929
stuck in this little jar myself one more

283
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,560
little dab there probably gonna go in

284
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:07,239
for a Terp dip because well I can it's

285
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,399
hard not to when you got the Flav's give

286
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,200
thanks to Tony V for this beautiful

287
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,059
little gift not the terpenes themselves

288
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,430
although thank him for that as well

289
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,899
but this little case with the carabiner

290
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,549
I'm telling you he gave me this one year

291
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,500
in Amsterdam and I kind of remember

292
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:22,959
maybe it was Barcelona I don't remember

293
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:27,070
I was watching some of the videos from

294
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,200
2014 and we were talking about you know

295
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:32,440
we were hitting some of the first Terp

296
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,830
melts some of the first terpenes added

297
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,100
to hashish that I had never known about

298
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,590
anyway you know from that we're going

299
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,930
you know soon to be available I never

300
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,660
tried cannabis profiled terpenes it was

301
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,849
always just single terpenes that were

302
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:52,600
you know the food-grade ones that I now

303
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,800
really don't suggest to people that they

304
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,360
inhale those into their lungs are you

305
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,609
independently wealthy how do you support

306
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,960
all this how do i sum

307
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,110
all that well that's a very personal

308
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,610
question I guess I am independently

309
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,050
wealthy in the sense that I came to

310
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,370
British Columbia with $6,000 to my name

311
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:16,799
that's how much money I had when I moved

312
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:18,419
here and so now I have about $7,000 but

313
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,379
I have a whole bunch of other stuff too

314
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:25,740
so I worked hard bubble bags was very

315
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,360
good good to me over the years it's been

316
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,500
almost 20 years that we've been selling

317
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,870
bubble bags and yeah man I don't know I

318
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,870
guess it's all what people's versions of

319
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,580
wealthiest when I hear wealthy I always

320
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,980
I mean I obviously feel that if you're

321
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,750
living in North America generally

322
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,269
because I do have you know friends that

323
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,370
have grown up in ghettos if you're

324

Karma's [ __ ] oh my god hey there

350
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:29,009
Kayleigh mmm I know hanky boy you know

351
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,829
the only reason I kind of haven't or

352
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,120
don't is because it's a pain in the ass

353
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:34,078
every morning I go live I think of

354
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,839
solvent less mind

355
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,748
we've talked but he said he would come

356
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,509
on but he's probably sleeping in I'm up

357
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:45,149
early it just doesn't always line up and

358
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,589
so I definitely thought about it this

359
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,999
morning I thought how cool also I've

360
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:49,529
been doing all of these on my phone

361
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,499
that's really giving me the freedom to

362
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:53,999
do them as wat as almost anywhere as I

363
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:56,490
have been doing them because I don't

364
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:59,339
even need the internet to do them that

365
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,289
being said if I invite a guest on I have

366
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,880
to do it through my computer because

367
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,919
there's no way for me to

368
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,320
and the live link when I go through my

369
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,929
phone it actually is going live through

370
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,210
YouTube and when I go live through the

371
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:21,239
computer it goes live through Google

372
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:23,759
live Google chats so I don't know that's

373
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:30,360
just so firming delicious it's so

374
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:34,500
delicious it's like a very delicious all

375
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:38,220
right I'm getting texts from mr. t while

376
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,990
this is going on I think I am going to

377
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,550
be at the Karma Cup this year yes I've

378
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:48,930
talked to Sarah I have to yet to give

379
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:51,089
her a solid yes but I'm wanting to go

380
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:55,799
there I always have a good time at the

381
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:59,580
karma Cup Sarah does a good job it's a

382
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:01,649
nice event and I guess you know the

383
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,110
bottom line is she really brings people

384
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,519
out like a lot of people came by a lot

385
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,639
of people checked out my booth it's a

386
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:12,629
worthwhile experience for you know small

387
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,240
companies like Blue River and the many

388
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:19,319
others to go there and show their wares

389
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,939
and you know do a decent amount of

390
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,349
business because these trips cost money

391
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,300
you're gonna end up spending close to a

392
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:27,059
grand on a hotel and maybe close to a

393
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:29,009
grand on a on a flight so and if you

394
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,849
have to pay for two or three grand for a

395
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:35,250
booth now you have to do about seven to

396
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:37,079
eight thousand dollars in business to

397
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,240
make that all pay off now keep in mind

398
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,740
if you did a little bit less even if it

399
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,630
cost you a couple grand there's the

400
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,910
advertising aspect of it the same way

401
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,800
you might do an ad in a magazine going

402
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,019
there if it costs you money at least you

403
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,089
were there you were seen you know you

404
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:58,079
got people to see what you were all

405
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:58,619
about so ooh quality hash I'm not too

406
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,909
sure

407
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:05,069
good morning Abraham all right on to a

408
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,110
cannabis yeah dude well hopefully it'll

409
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:08,579
be there again and we'll be able to my

410
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,659
booth was super simple it's funny that

411
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:12,059
you would say it's awesome because

412
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,370
really all my booth was was a table a

413
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:17,740
little sort of sheet laid down and

414
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:20,829
and some turps on top with us hidden

415
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,359
bowls so I guess that's just all you got

416
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:25,509
to do to have an awesome booth I do

417
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,949
appreciate your kindness but we sure

418
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:29,319
didn't go out of the way and spend too

419
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,000
much money on it did we

420
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,159
well the properly made full mouth hash

421
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,349
will have a dry consistency like sand

422
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,480
even it has a bunch of turkeys Wow full

423
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:40,569
mouth hash can be made into a sand like

424
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,190
consistency but if it's allowed to yes

425
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:46,569
I've been to why us Falls if it's a lot

426
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:49,529
been allowed to get warm it will congeal

427
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:53,859
and melt into a solid puck for sure

428
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:58,960
every chance that it can get jaha

429
00:18:53,859 --> 00:19:00,819
freedom in says Allen schanberg it's

430
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,980
nice that Bingle Lombardi won today that

431
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:09,539

432
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:11,920

433
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,500
although I would check out a seeds

434
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,610

the Tiger's milk and the what is it

436
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:23,889
called the the Roja something Roja it's

437
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:27,400
like the red

438
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:30,130
oh the Angola Angola Roja as well as

439
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,309
Congolese they've got a whole bunch of

440
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:37,090
pretty nice exotic cultivars going on

441
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:40,480

guys the Angola red yeah I traded some

445
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:55,509
Angola red I believe it was something

446
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:59,080
like the bangy haze crossed with the the

447
00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:01,000
Angola Roja the Angola red that produced

448
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,699
the Congo I could be wrong I don't want

449
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,529
to say anything that's wrong but back in

450
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,558
the day quite a while ago when I

451
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:11,049
originally traded my son bubble bags for

452
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,058
some seeds from Rana Ganga Rana Ganga

453
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:14,480
was of course married to lamanno negra

454
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:17,059
and lamanno

455
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,180
who was Alex was the one who collected

456
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:24,950
the original Congo seeds in Africa that

457
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,450
ended up here in in Vancouver as well as

458
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,360
all the way down the coast in San

459
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,670
Francisco as well I'm not too sure je

460
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,259
cannabis I like a lot of cultivars it's

461
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,150
really hard to say yeah it's a horrible

462
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:37,730
name for sure Nicholas although you know

463
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:41,269
I don't have really a big connection to

464
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,180
heroin so it's not quite as bad but yeah

465
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:47,089
I'm always opposed to sort of like the

466
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,640
chemos and sort of like just the you

467
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,740
know the MKULTRA all sorts of names that

468
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,020
are like man those are like some [ __ ]

469
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,990
up things to be named in that after but

470
00:20:54,019 --> 00:21:00,200
and what are you gonna do hey listen the

471
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,730
wait chimera put it but and I believe it

472
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,360
and I think it's the future as well is

473
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:07,430
that that the future of cannabis is not

474
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,589
these names that we know them by those

475
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:12,440
might be secondary

476
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:14,929
you know tags but really what they are

477
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,940
going to be named is the constituents of

478
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:21,560
which they are so what is the

479
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,390
cannabinoid profile and what is the

480
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,639
terpene profile those are the two things

481
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,610
that I really want to know now do I need

482
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,040
to know every single one maybe not maybe

483
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:32,599
initially it'll be just you know the

484
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,700
dominance you know these are the three

485
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,549
dominant terpenes so the cultivar could

486
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,600
be called you know like chimera had here

487
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:43,970
the other day the pine the lime and the

488
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,409
terpene alene say his didn't have it but

489
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,390
say it had it you could have the top

490
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,029
three or the top two or the top one you

491
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:53,870
could have dominant terpenes and

492
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:56,089
dominant cannabinoid profiles and I'm

493
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:59,689
sure those things now specifically

494
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:02,569
terpenes especially will show that they

495
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:06,850
are different in the afghan grown in the

496
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:10,309
arid dry mountain range compared to the

497
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:12,859
tropical exotic narrow leaf drug

498
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:16,129
cultivar that is grown in an extremely

499
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:18,859
humid area I'm convinced that the

500
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,540
terpene profile will be specific for

501
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:23,839
each of those areas and that those

502
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:26,569
terpenes will be specific to say things

503
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,250
like resisting powdery mildew but my

504
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:30,319
be a specific terpene that allows

505
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,509
cannabis to resist powdery mildew when

506
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,189
it's grown in the tropics versus Afghan

507
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,759
ease that just don't have that terpene

508
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,639
profile and because of it get these

509
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:43,038
mildews this is just a theory but it's

510
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:45,048
one that fits in my brain and I could

511
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,879
see it coming true we're going to find

512
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:48,528
the truth to all of these questions in

513
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,330
the very near future as more and more

514
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:53,409
people are getting out of school young

515
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:55,759
people going into university

516
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:56,210
specifically for jobs in the cannabis

517
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,378
sector

518
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,340
yeah milled out I love when he says that

519
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,798
that's awesome

520
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:06,619
what a trip life is a hash is so

521
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:08,269
different - yeah but man's world would

522
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,699
you ever spray terpenes on the plant

523
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:12,829
um no I would not spray our beans on a

524
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,740
plant you spelled episode oh yeah my

525
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:17,898
phone actually doesn't weird

526
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,690
autocorrect it does this thing and it

527
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:23,239
makes it Ella sewed so it's not a big

528
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:28,190
deal I can I can change it pretty quick

529
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:32,569
in fact it is already changed Sam's the

530
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:37,210
man absolutely love the old schoolers

531
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:39,230
love their stories you know absolutely

532
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,058
till they tell us we're wrong our

533
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,740
theories are perfect this is my favorite

534
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:45,200
Ella soda yeah this is my favorite Ella

535
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,638
sewed - well no it's not my favorite

536
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,509
Ella so do you remember that Ella sewed

537
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:55,128
like back about 23 Ellis Oates that one

538
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:59,210
was a kick-ass Alice ode to real I mean

539
00:23:55,128 --> 00:24:02,269
[ __ ] yeah as far as Ellis ODEs go that

540
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:05,720
was as solid as an Ellis ode as as I had

541
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:09,798
ever experienced in an Ellis ode just

542
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,990
saying there's a shock any tips for

543
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:13,940
starting older seeds yeah you know DJ

544
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,528
short gave me this tip you know I do it

545
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,210
just like ever regular do whatever

546
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:19,450
you're gonna do your soma method in the

547
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:22,308
water and your until it sinks or your

548
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,100
your your wet paper towel I like a

549
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:27,079
couple of plates I put some moist towel

550
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:29,388
it in i put the seeds down and then i

551
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,308
put it on like my stereo receiver and it

552
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:34,250
just keeps it this perfect temperature

553
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:35,759
like not so warm that it dries the paper

554
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,250
towel oh but warm enough

555
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,740
that in it creates that warmth of like

556
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,690
yeah let's crack I cracked 20 year old

557
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,960
seeds that way now if they don't crack

558
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,029
what DJ short said to me is that he's

559
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,360
actually helped them crack with his

560
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,339
fingers he's actually and he's imagine

561
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,079
how gentle you have to be to be able to

562
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:58,230
do this this kind of goes to show the

563
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,579
level of passion that the man had but

564
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,970
yeah he would just give it a gentle

565
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:06,389
gentle pinch until the tip popped open

566
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,370
or until he saw a slight crack and yeah

567
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,020
he's just cracking seeds with his hands

568
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:12,359
I never was forced to do it but it's a

569
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:15,660
great tip from a guy who had a lot of

570
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:18,529
old seeds back before I really knew

571
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:22,800
anyone who had a lot a lot of old seeds

572
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:24,750
well Jay Henrik's short DJ short has you

573
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,029
know saved some nice genetics doing it

574
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,740
so it's a last resort but if you have to

575
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:30,629
do it if it's not going to crack

576
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,029
normally because what I said was if you

577
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,190
listen to me try it all normal first and

578
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:37,559
if that doesn't work then you can give

579
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,990
it a little help that's it

580
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,659
DJ short he told me that while we were

581
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,579
spinning a batch of bubble hash in a

582
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,440
school bus that Marc Emery had rented

583
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:49,649
and was driving around the city of

584
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,500
Vancouver not really it was leaving MPC

585
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,720
or whatever CC HQ or the other million

586
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,519
names it's had ever since and it was

587
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,140
going to a restaurant for the tokers

588
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,750
Bowl but it seemed like it was driving

589
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,090
around downtown Vancouver for a while

590
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,099
and me and DJ were mixing up the

591
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:07,409
medicine I had the five gallon bucket

592
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,719
started it actually in Marc's store in

593
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,130
the basement at Pot TV but then we're

594
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,990
like everyone we gotta go and I'm like

595
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,760
alright well this is the beauty of water

596
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,589
hash it's portable so I picked up the

597
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,900
bucket with the water in the bud and the

598
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:21,419
ice and I just carried it on to the bus

599
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,300
and we sat in the two front seats and we

600
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,670
just gave it a spin 'man min and I

601
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:29,940
remember we let it settle on the ride

602
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,740
from there to getting to the restaurant

603
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,370
and when we got to the restaurant we

604
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:40,559
pulled the bags and collected the hash

605
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:42,059
so Wow very cool I don't know if there's

606
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,129
there has to be footage of that

607
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:46,289
absolutely now I don't know who would

608
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,920
have it I was making hash so I didn't

609
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,599
have my cash

610
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,279
and we were it was definitely a little

611
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,250
bit before the time where we were like

612
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,990
always had someone filming us so I would

613
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:58,829
suspect someone who was at the tokers

614
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:03,960
Bowl either the O 3 or the O 4 tokers

615
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:06,179
Bowl might have footage of that um was

616
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,430
Mark Emma and I friends I'm not too sure

617
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,650
about that I've known mark a long time I

618
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,450
guess I could innocent you know we've

619
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,070
never really gone to dinners he's always

620
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:17,400
invited I think it was been a more

621
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:19,230
professional relationship you know I

622
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,840
mean I would call him a friend in the

623
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,730
sense that you know I I appreciated what

624
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,649
he was doing in the community back in

625
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,180
the day for all the money he was

626
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:31,050
donating to people that were getting in

627
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,759
trouble for growing his seeds and his

628
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,409
store was really cool he was donating

629
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,240
all the money wasn't keeping it he was

630
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,759
just putting it back putting it into the

631
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,490
activist hands and promoting events and

632
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,950
he was just kind of doing cool [ __ ] so I

633
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,900
liked him in that sense but he was

634
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,240
always more business you know I wrote

635
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,280

651
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:45,990
website yeah check the website and I

652
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,870

654
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:57,629
Anthony you got a card listen this is a

655
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,459
I see that there's there's some customer

656
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,639
service that

657
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,519
has that is not getting done because

658
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:06,319
blue river extract CA gets a lot of

659
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,329
calls a lot of emails and a lot of

660
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,878
people in my social media asking me

661
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:13,009
about blue river extracts us I think

662
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:16,519
blue river extracts us has made it

663
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:18,139
pretty clear but you guys might want to

664
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,778
put a phone number up if you're still

665
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:22,729
watching Michael so people can contact

666
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:24,528
you and ask you these questions because

667
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,089
you might not see it but what they're

668
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:29,210
doing is they're asking me these

669
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:32,480
questions and I can promise you it's

670
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:34,850
taking up like time in my life I get a

671
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,669
lot of phone calls actually from from my

672
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:41,959
website about it and yeah I don't know

673
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:43,129
just figure it out guys very clear they

674
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,840
are only bit in only

675
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:46,819
business-to-business now okay well great

676
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,769
so that's it I mean if that's it that's

677
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:50,089
it it's as simple as that still I would

678
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:52,220
put up a phone number with someone just

679
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:54,949
saying that or even an answering machine

680
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,360
because people look they can't get it

681
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,069
from just that they look at the website

682
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,658
they look what do you mean not selling

683
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:02,538
anymore does that mean they're not

684
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:04,610
selling they want to ask the question so

685
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:07,220
I don't know for me for my company I

686
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:09,199
would have like a phone number up with a

687
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,538
recording if I didn't want to answer it

688
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,850
so people could also hear it we're no

689
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:17,450
longer selling you know person-to-person

690
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:20,990
we're only doing business-to-business

691
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:23,690
so any tips on pressing the eater out of

692
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:30,200
the puck of hash before I sieve it the

693
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:33,019
eater would that be the moisture what

694
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,798
are my views on psychedelics well I like

695
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:40,038
them a lot I think they're great I think

696
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:44,658
that it's nice that people can go inward

697
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:46,609
instead of outward I guess it's a

698
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:48,528
business as someone that would be

699
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:50,388
purchasing wholesale probably but once

700
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:51,888
again if they had a phone number these

701
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:54,918
are things that although they have a

702
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:57,798
website I'm sure you can email them info

703
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,480
at and ask them that very question or

704
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:01,460
you guys could just continue to hit me

705
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,259
up on my social media while we're doing

706
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,960
a wake and bake I guess it's up to you I

707
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:07,759
guess it's what depends on what you want

708
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,649
to hear most of how much would you

709
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,650
typically process in a one-gallon versus

710
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:13,679
a five-gallon bag

711
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,930
well 56 grams is the maximum dry that I

712
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,440
would put in a one gallon 200 grams dry

713
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:22,920
as the maximum I put it in a 5-gallon 56

714
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,250
DRI is close to 200 grams wet and 200

715
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,220
grams dry is around a thousand grams wet

716
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,619
but I like to do it around 800 fresh

717
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,100
frozen 800 grams into a five-gallon

718
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:34,799
bucket

719
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:37,109
200 grams fresh frozen into a one gallon

720
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,139
bucket so it's pretty simple about four

721
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:42,869
times the the weight of dry will be

722
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,750
fresh do you tip at a restaurant in

723
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:48,449
Canada yes chase 20% always and every

724
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,549
time servers work hard unless the

725
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,009
service is absolutely horrible and the

726
00:31:50,549 --> 00:32:00,180
food is [ __ ] even then I still have a

727
00:31:53,009 --> 00:32:03,420
hard time not doing it yep that's right

728
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:06,240
melty heads what's your fave dabbler at

729
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,220
the moment my fave dabbler I'm not sure

730
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,079
what that even means hey how's it going

731
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,059
from Korea what's the difference between

732
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,309
the effects of low temp dabs and a vape

733
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,539
like a volcano well they're very

734
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,960
different they're just very different

735
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:22,589
ones like light ones very light you know

736
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:27,210
like a one course and ones very heavy

737
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:28,919
like a seven-course does fresh frozen

738
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,710
get dry at all when it's in the freezer

739
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,360
it can it can especially if it's allowed

740
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,130
like you know the freezer sometimes can

741
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,579
act as a desiccant and pull moisture out

742
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:42,030
of things

743
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:43,289
Nate sizzle good name good name sticks

744
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,329
that would be up to you they're

745
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:50,000
certainly not illegal at the border but

746
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:52,349
I just sell them here in Canada I'm not

747
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,450
have you seen that guy Alex free-climb

748
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:59,369
I'll cut Mountain in four hours yeah I

749
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,769
saw Alex Honnold free-climb El Cap it

750
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:05,459
was unbelievable

751
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:08,849
pretty insane really insane actually

752
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:11,519
it's kind of like wow dude no safety no

753
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:15,119
ropes no nothing just going for it it's

754
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,069
like I'm glad people like that exist

755
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,049
though I gotta say it's amazing it's

756
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:21,028
it's inspirational really right I mean

757
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:24,118
who doesn't watch that and think

758
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:26,219
I'm a human I should be able to do human

759
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:28,858
[ __ ] like that although I'm pretty sure

760
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:30,449
that's not human [ __ ] even if you've

761
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:32,489
ever looked at his fingers they're just

762
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:34,859
like these huge sausages I think they

763
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:38,119
can probably hold an insane amount of

764
00:33:34,858 --> 00:33:40,798
weight compared to most people's fingers

765
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:42,688
no we're still far away from it we're

766
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:46,618
still far away from legalizing cannabis

767
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:49,288
axel monster hey what's going on from

768
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:51,808
the Kootenay z-- what's going on Nikola

769
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:53,638
gamer so you think Puff Wednesday's are

770
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:55,408
done for now well I mean for now you

771
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:57,208
know maybe let's say we're not it's not

772
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,979
like we've retired it forever it's just

773
00:33:57,209 --> 00:34:02,278
not happening if it's just started

774
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:04,919
happening you know if John's got his

775
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:06,538
life on track right now he's super busy

776
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,389
as businesses growing he's got his

777
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:11,190
girlfriend they moved in together plus

778
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,710
he's got all his channel and all the

779
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,528
other you know clean stuff that he's

780
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,838
constantly doing that's new and then I

781
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:21,239
myself am at least that busy and more

782
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,989
because I have three children etc etc so

783
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:27,719
between the two of us we got so busy I

784
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,608
think when I first met John he had the

785
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,459
most time out of anyone he was retired

786
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:34,500
he just he got his pension from getting

787
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,230
hurt and he didn't have to do anything

788
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,898
he had literally seven days a week to do

789
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,548
whatever he wanted to do and so that's

790
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:43,259
when he started hanging out with me four

791
00:34:41,548 --> 00:34:44,878
or five days a week he would come we

792
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:47,818
would film all the time he just had

793
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,798
nothing else to do but since we started

794
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:53,250
doing that filming he has become an

795
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:58,730
incredibly busy gentleman so good for

796
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,730
him is right fucking-a I'm not too sure

797
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:03,750
no I do not suggest dry ice dry ice is

798
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,239
the worst thing you could do stay away

799
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:08,068
from dry eyes dry ice is not your friend

800
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,768
it's going to make it look like you get

801
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:13,170
a lot but that lot that you get is less

802
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:15,538
head and more contaminant it's

803
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,278
counterintuitive it's convincing you one

804
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:18,930
thing while the reality is saying

805
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:22,108
another and it's going to make cleaning

806
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:25,440
that material even harder when you try

807
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:27,750
to get out just the heads and even if

808
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,179
you just press it it still ends up

809
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,278
getting this weird funky darkness to it

810
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:33,419
from the contaminant that you're

811
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:36,869
pressing along with the

812
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,880
heads I'm not a huge fan of live resin

813
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:41,039
myself I think that I've always

814
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,588
appreciated bud that was properly cured

815
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,630
and that bud that's popularly cured is

816
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:47,308
not just the plant matter releasing

817
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,220
moisture but it's the resin glands

818
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:52,650
releasing extremely caustic terpenes

819
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:53,879
that evaporate and volatize first prior

820
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,750
to any of the other ones they're the

821
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,849
ones that are we are burping out of the

822
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,880
weed in the curing process and i like

823
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:05,700
them to be out of my hash as well so i

824
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,160
prefer a nice strong hash that smooth on

825
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:11,789
the throat but still gonna grab me by

826
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:16,469

want to be a real youtuber you need

889
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:28,480
drone footage that's funny well I've got

890
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,710
drone footage I haven't pulled my drone

891
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,570
out for a while because I didn't feel

892
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,179
like people wanted to see the same old

893
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:36,340
drone footage over and over again which

894
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:38,529
is really you know what a lot of my

895
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,660
drone footage would be at this point you

896
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:44,890
really need to take a trip and go

897
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:46,599
driving and spend a day with a bunch of

898
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:49,779
different batteries and chargers so you

899
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:53,139
could go out and you know get some

900
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:55,240
really epic drone footage some b-roll if

901
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:58,000
you will that you could take later

902
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:00,069
and cut into your videos I myself am an

903
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,320
idiot and I just do it all the same day

904
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:04,180
I get all the footage that day I do all

905
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,610
the editing that day I film everything

906
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:08,859
it's it's completely insane and it

907
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,660
becomes difficult as you can see these

908
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,930
live videos are much easier

909
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:17,170
the filmed edited videos are much harder

910
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:19,859
I think some of its pretty cool

911
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,860
absolutely

912
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:27,400
yeah but Chrisman or you could become a

913
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:29,380
business and buy wholesale fill a niche

914
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,329
because you see all these people want to

915
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,070
buy these turps but can't buy them why

916
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,349
don't you go buy a huge wholesale batch

917
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:40,180
from them and then start selling them

918
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:43,860
through your own portals you know rather

919
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:47,069
than you know don't let an obstacle

920
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:52,360
remain an obstacle turning into a

921
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:53,950
opportunity I am not sure about that you

922
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:59,619
look extra medicated in your eyes well

923
00:40:53,949 --> 00:41:03,099
maybe I am maybe you talked [ __ ] you

924
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:05,410
stupid [ __ ] really I don't even know if

925
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:07,449

931
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:25,449
negativity you must remain positive hey

932
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:26,949
what's going on from Japan it's nice to

933
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,079
see some people coming in from other

934
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:31,739
places posting some other languages

935
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:34,179

937
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:37,629
you or at least if YouTube would

938
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,280
