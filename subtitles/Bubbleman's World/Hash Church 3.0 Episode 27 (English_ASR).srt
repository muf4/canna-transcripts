21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,358
something that was some months ago so

22
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,239
much happened people have passed away

23
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,680
and people have celebrated birthdays and

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,240
there's all sorts of things going on in

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,640
the world right now and I can't really

26
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,959
keep up but uh hopefully you guys are

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,478
all doing really well over in Amsterdam

28
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,118
and over in the

29
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:21,039
CPS oh oh although things are blowing up

30
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,200
here they had riots in the Del last

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,400
night and they had riots in

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,920
roddam because a lot of people they

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,759
don't want to be vaccinated but yet they

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,879
want to be able to freely travel and uh

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,438
they're demonstrating to the point of

36
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,280
extremity damn yeah it's going on all

37
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,639
over right

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,320
now yeah I heard that there a lot of

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,399
people are not necessarily uh

40
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,359
um you know out there in the streets

41
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,640
because they're against vaccines they're

42
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,159
out there in the streets because they're

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,399
against the

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,960
mandates and there's a lot of people who

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,560
are fully vaccinated are against the ma

46
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,399
mandates and I think there's a really

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,640
big difference between being pro-choice

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,479
and then being mandated so I think

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,520
that's what a lot of people are ups and

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,680
then there's a lot of Dutch anarchists

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,480
who just like to stir up

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,719
[ __ ] and for that we're

53
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,000
thankful well unless they're harming

54
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,800
things and that's not cool we understand

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,199
no no exactly I just changed my mic cuz

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,879
someone told me I sounded like a phone

57
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,479
call so hopefully that's a little bit

58
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:33,479
better there uh oh Johnny B's coming in

59
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,039
you guys might not recognize Johnny B

60
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,000
there's only two-thirds of Johnny B uh

61
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,158
that used to be here I think he's lost

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,840
like 70 pounds or some ridiculous thing

63
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:45,158
rocking the push-ups rocking the situps

64
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,680
doing the walking and the healthy eating

65
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:51,598
Johnny [ __ ] B in Toronto at Lyft dude

69
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,719
in on of the Roger Center I did 15

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,360
push-ups in front of the CN tower then I

71
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,039
did another 15 push-ups overlooking the

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,680
CN Tower and everything else and then I

73
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,318
did another 10 so I'm past that point um

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,840
I feel fantastic good morning everybody

75
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,318
well I what I like about it is that

76
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,680
means I don't have to do any exercise

77
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:23,958
you did it for me see that's the whole

78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,920
idea you got me going you got me going

79
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,799
I've been doing 50 push-ups for the last

80
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,518
10 days or however long it's been since

81
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,080
you uh challenged me it's a 50-day

82
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,680
challenge we're doing we're pushing into

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
2022 with just a new push of life and

84
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,920
you know what a little healthiness a

85
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,158
little bit of exercise just nothing

86
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,158
major just 50 a day you could do five 10

87
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,759
times a day 10 five times a day I'm up

88
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,399
to 18 then I have to break and then I

89
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,318
could do another five and three that's

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,519
my Max and I have to rest well your

91
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,919
timing is perfect brother because uh we

92
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,760
were just kind of talking about

93
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,078
something we probably won't get too deep

94
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,280
in talking to today because it's such a

95
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,159
triggering and de divisive conversation

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,120
but I love that you came in right at the

97
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:09,120
time to show people that you know during

98
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,599
this hectic kind of crazy time there are

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
other ways to improve one's Health which

100
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,439
is to focus on what you put in your

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,358
mouth what you breathe into your lungs

102
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,759
what you uh you know put into your mind

103
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,519
because consuming CNN all day isn't the

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,000
healthiest of things to do and uh yeah

105
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:30,079
just kind of figuring out other ways to

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,600
be healthy and happy and uh you know

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,800
kind kind of going down that pathway

108
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680

109

122

on that pole on that threatful day that

176
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,919
he would be known infamously as the

177
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,560
naked guy on the pole at the Bonita show

181
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,399
don't know I feel like he hung out with

182
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,240
Bear right before that show it it was

183
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,478
hotter than hell that day so there were

184
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,038
a lot of naked people in the audience

185
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,038
and just so that he got

186
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,838
right but there are there are hundreds

187
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,278
of naked people there that day I think

188
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm pretty sure there were 20,000 people

189
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,240
there that day and minimal cars in the

190
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,959
parking lot because everyone hitchhiked

191
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,039
out on buses to the country that year

192
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,838
because there was no the gas prices were

193
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,799
so Inc high they charged $3 to get into

194
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,040
the show and the crazy thing is that

195
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,799
there was no water so when we talked to

196
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,278
everybody who ran that show they were

197
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,838
trying to literally bring in Water by

198
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:12,519
gallon jugs it was jugs and it was like

199
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,839
over 105 degrees totally insane so yeah

200
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,320
naked people gay lore well and they were

201
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,480
supposed to be making money for the

202
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,959
Springfield creary which is Ken Key's

203
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,639
brother Chuck key who started the

204
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:25,919
Springfield crey the very first yogurt

205
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,919
with probiotics in America chuckes ny's

206
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,159
yogurt they were trying to to to do a a

207
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,439
benefit for the Springfield Creamery in

208
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,719
1972 that's what that show's about they

209
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,399
didn't make any money because they only

210
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,000
charged $3 a ticket but I'm pretty sure

211
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,839
the dead gave him $10,000 afterwards and

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,159
obviously the business is still still

213
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,480
going and everything but and I love that

214
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,480
the kids getting licked in the face by

215
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,639
the dog the dirty dirty ass kids getting

216
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,800
licked in the face by the dog we we also

217
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,519
those kids in the realm so lots of love

218
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,919
you they came back in 82 right they did

219
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,320
another one 10 years later in 82 didn't

220
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:08,958

221
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,200
good the yeah oh my God the I have the

222
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,359
songs playing in my head right now that

223
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,519
was out at Tower as well out at the

224
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,759
Oregon Country Fair so the

225
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,679
parking parking and then they tried to

226
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,439
do it again in 92 and we were all set

227
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,919
ready to do it and I was gonna help be

228
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,000
backstage manager and we had a whole

229
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,399
bunch of Oregon Country Fair running

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,799
that but then Jerry got got uh you know

231
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,039
he went into a coma so everything was

232
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:39,759
canell he got sick but there was also he

233
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:42,439
he heard his hand I think scuba

234
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,838
diving scuba diving but he also actually

235
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,680
was sick then too yeah he got really

236
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,000
sick he was super sick and then the

237
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:53,799
first show that he uh the Halloween show

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,360
at Oakland Jerry Garcia banned Oakland

239
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:58,838
Coliseum

240
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,159
1992 so he didn't smoke one cigarette

241
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,880
during the show yeah which has never

242
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,879
happened you know and it was just anyone

243
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,078
should go listen to that show but

244
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,078
basically tore the roof off and we were

245
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,759
roller skating in the parking lot right

246
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,919
because you roller skate from one side

247
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,078
to the other at the Oakland shows

248
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,240
because the base this is too much

249
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,439
information for everyone now but the guy

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,600
at the top between used to play wine

251
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,079
glasses with water in them and it

252
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,680
sounded like an organ because he would

253
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,399
put his hands on the on the wine glasses

254
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,479
with water at different levels and you

255
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,919
would play total total songs on the on

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,720

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,759
inspiration I gotta

327
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,440
say just a good dude all around I knew

328
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,759
it was his birthday like in the near

329
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,560
future because when I first met the guy

330
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,959
I met him in Amsterdam and he was like

331
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,838
and and I think I met him on his

332
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:51,078
birthday like today like in 2012 or

333
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,519
whatever and uh so yeah that's uh that's

334
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,799
awesome good that we can all kind of

335
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,720
celebrate Johnny B's birthday maybe with

336
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,120
a little dab I think we got all sorts of

337
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,800
good things here I'm going to load up

338
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,759
the Dustin Riv little TP

339
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,399
slurper uh hello everybody yeah this is

340
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,039
uh our 11th year deep kind of in tenure

341
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,078
with SC labs and so yeah I mean it's

342
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,120
never a dull moment it's been you know

343
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,519
one of the most educational it has been

344
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
by far the most educational experience

345
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,360
of my life um but yeah lots of

346
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,519
fascinating Trends I'm super stoked to

347
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,278
be part of this conversation today hope

348
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,278
everybody's doing really wonderful

349
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:40,198
so is it nice is it sort of a different

350
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:42,518
fall for SC Labs right now hey you

351
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,078
guys this is our this is our 10th

352
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,000
Harvest uh kind of season you know and

353
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,519
as a laboratory you know each Harvest

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,278
year really kind of puts a lab is a

355
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,039
lab's capabilities you know as far as

356
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:57,720
quality once things get busy you know

357
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,159
and so so you know 10 years incremental

358
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,839
progress you know each Harvest we've

359
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,399
been able to optimize a little bit more

360
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,360
and yeah I mean we've um we we we have

361
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,039
like lab staff that run seven days a

362
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,440
week you know five days a week we have

363
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,399
an overnight shift you know so we've

364
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,240
just kind of started we just moved our

365
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,639
entire system to like a two-day Rush

366
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,879
three-day standard turn around so you

367
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,720
know kind of just working on optimizing

368
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,600
standardizing yeah I was actually

369
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
talking about the emerald cup samples

370
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,519
just that you guys aren't over inundated

371
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,758
with that oh totally yeah that right now

372
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,240
for sure yeah well so we we um the

373
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,600
emerald cup kind of Entry window is is

374
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,959
the month of January um so that's when

375
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,040
samples uh entries will be entered for

376
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,359
the emerald cup and then we are also

377
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:44,679
kind of right in the middle of um doing

378
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,639
testing for the California State Fair um

379
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:49,758
so the California State Fair you know

380
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,318
from um November 1st to March 1st is um

381
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,519
there's an entry window open for flowers

382
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:58,519
um across categories from sungrown mixed

383
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,318
light to indoor and yeah essentially

384
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,399
everything is um really primarily based

385
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:05,558
off the data for testing this year

386
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,798
there's not um it's just such an ordeal

387
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,240
to run a contest and to have you know

388
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,119
judges that entries are distributed to

389
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,880
and so um the State Fair this year they

390
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,038
they originally going to do an indicia

391
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,319
category into sta category but they kind

392
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:18,759
of caught wind of this cool kind of

393
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,599
turpine classification work we've been

394
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:22,279
doing and you know with the emerald cup

395
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,838
and so essentially everything's going to

396
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,480
be tested and sorted into the primary

397
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,038
turpine archetypes and then judged head

398
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,400
up against each other so you know ja

399
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,160
train re Sage deran everything

400
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
terpinolene will Jud be judging against

401
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,240
terpinolene and then the things that

402
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,759
really weigh the winners are going to be

403
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,759
around total turpine content and the

404
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,400
canabo so really like celebrating the

405
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,160
diversity of what this plant represents

406
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,880
on a turpine level as well as you know

407
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,558
kind of helping to you know push and um

408
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,840
educate around these kind of other

409
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,119
metrics you know to help determine and

410
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,000
judge quality Beyond you know this THC

411
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,199
number that everybody so focused on but

412
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,880
you know I think of the future you know

413
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,519
kind of total tpine content then you

414
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,440
know what the canab to turpine ratio is

415
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,879
is really going to be one of the more

416
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,200
important metrics that you know people

417
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,600
use to understand both you know quality

418
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,080
as well as how well something you know

419
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,199
how how well Turpin have been preserved

420
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,079
in it and then also how well that

421
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,440
Entourage effect kind of influence is

422
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,558
going to happen from that ratio of

423
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,558
cannaboid at turine you

424
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,559
know are you guys going to be testing

425
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,519
for the new uh sulfur containing

426
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,038
compounds that were recently discovered

427
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,839
yeah I don't think they were new

428
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,359
personally just my statement people have

429
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,839
known about them for a long time Nick

430
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,079
zegler said he's known for 25 years he

431
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,439
sent me that paper and was like he was

432
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,759
like whoa that's like I we studied that

433
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,600
25 years ago he said the beer industry

434
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,599
has such a deep understanding of these

435
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,399
thol and thoits that it's not even funny

436
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,480
how much more we have to learn in

437
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,919
cannabis that's because they don't like

438
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:02,480
them well they study them big time I

439
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,880
mean they studi them to avoid no that's

440
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,038
not true not not not yakam ma Chief hops

441
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
anyway and not the work that Nick zler

442
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:13,319
did they they were the one company that

443
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:16,158
instead of trying to um avoid their

444
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,240
unique differences they decided to

445
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,039
celebrate them and so that's why Nick

446
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,000
did all the work he did with thol and

447
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:27,640
thoits and Esther 1440 th he discovered

448
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,960
alone in hops which I've invited him

449
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,360
here today because it would would be

450
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,840
amazing to have him here uh on this

451
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,240
conversation because we have kind of

452
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,439
been discussing lately about trying to

453
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,000
get a group together that can discuss

454
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,798
these things kind of maybe create a

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,079
shared lexicon and create this sort of

456
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,960
sensory evaluation program that we can

457
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,839
all kind of you know feed into to create

458
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,720
something that uh could take us away

459
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:57,480
from you know these these coas that are

460
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:02,440
basically simply THC and and and

461
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:05,640
tpin yeah hear sorry no no problem I'm

462
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,159
I'm really curious we've been studying

463
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,240
these for a long time we've been aware

464
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,240
of them of course for a very long time

465
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,400
but uh it it'll be very interesting to

466
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,120
see how many of them are founding

467
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,240
cannabis how many did you just say 200

468
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,519
or 400 in hops

469
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,279
1440 is what he said Jes

470
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:32,079
Christ if there's that many in cannabis

471
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:35,359
then think about it uh and especially if

472
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,519
they're they act synergistically with

473
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:41,519
the cannabinoids like

474
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,679
THC uh it's everything just got way more

475
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,759
complex way more complex and when you

476
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,120
think of like at least from what Nick

477
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,279
was saying he was suggesting that some

478
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,119
of these thols uh are responsible for

479
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,279
the shift in the modulation of the

480
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,038
profile and so most people aren't even

481
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,639
paying attention to these these

482
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,279
compounds right now we're sort of on the

483
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,000
surface with canabo and Turpin so it's

484
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,960
exciting that the rabbit hole goes

485
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
deeper and that there are people like

486
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,519
you guys on the panel who will jump

487
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,840
right in with both feet into that rabbit

488
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,839
hole so I appreciate you all for

489
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,599
that excuse me Alex for

490
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,200
interrupting

491
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,640
speaking sorry

492
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,400
sorry sorry I was just gonna say we've

493
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,919
been doing a ton of

494
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,919
decarbing uh in the house and just like

495
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,240
putting together this amazing Sav and uh

496
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,278
the decarbing has been really in the

497
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,120
upper floors of the house has been like

498
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:45,200
full on like turpine Haven and it's been

499
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,839
a really interesting experiment because

500
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,519
we've got two cats and the cats are

501
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,639
fully addicted to the third floor of the

502
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,759
house where the Turpin are the most

503
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,360
proom predominant col chamber it's like

504
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,759
the collection chamber and they're only

505
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:04,759
getting tpin and walking

506
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:08,158
around acting so totally

507
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:10,519
crazy on all of the Persian rugs they're

508
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,880
like differentiating all of the

509
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,918
different colors on the rug FR out on

510
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,600
the carpet they're getting fracted out

511
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,840
super high just on the tping so just

512
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,839
wanted

513
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,079
to that's awesome and one one thing I

514
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,039
was I was just going to add kind of um

515
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,558
um to to Sam Sam's question or original

516
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:35,480
question on the thol yeah so you know

517
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,678
we've known about thol for quite some

518
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,000
time really Nick Ziggler put put it that

519
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,120
much more on my map um from the work

520
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,359
that they've done in on hops with uh

521
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,000
testing thols um we we've been we've

522
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,079
been working on kind of a method to kind

523
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,079
of be able to start adding certain uh

524
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,278
sueric type compounds um so we are kind

525
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:58,639
of going to be developing to that

526
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:01,400
direction but um you know even without

527
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,080
kind of you know THS to help do the you

528
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,360
know really fine Nuance sorting uh

529
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,558
towards the end of all the different

530
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,240
subgroupings that happen um we have

531
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:12,158
found that you know tracking the primary

532
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,640
mono Andes turpins and using them as a

533
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,760
as a tool to sort kind of can really

534
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,640
capture for the most part all the

535
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,158
primary smells or groups um but yeah I

536
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,080
think once you start getting into thols

537
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,600
and some of these other Trace compounds

538
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,960
that really kind of Define some of the

539
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,959
Nuance of how the subgroupings kind of

540
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,278
open up um you know there's so much more

541
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,480
to be kind of uh to be learned from that

542
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:38,278
and I'm definitely really excited for

543
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,839
it they're extremely potent I mean the

544
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:44,119
the human ol Factory senses are very

545
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,759
tuned to these molecules at extremely

546
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:49,719
low concentrations so you know that they

547
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:51,679
put an odorant in natural gas because

548
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,000
natural gas has no odor at all and I

549
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,000
think what they're putting in natural

550
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,200
gas Captain yeah butane th and so you

551
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,119
can imagine that these things are are

552
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,159
basically sensitive at really I think

553
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,000
it's like almost part per trillion

554
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:11,520
levels right so that human olda Factory

555
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,079
is so uh sensitive to those that these

556
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,879
things could be in there in just very

557
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,199
very Trace quantities fleeting

558
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,120
quantities that essentially make them

559
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,278
not quantifiable or not measurable on a

560
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:28,759
GC but you could certainly taste the

561
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:32,640
difference when you when you consume it

562
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:36,398
does anybody know if these compounds act

563
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,360
do they modulate THC or act uh do they

564
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:42,000
potentiate THC anybody

565
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,798
know I have a feeling Nick knows but

566
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,759
he's not here yet and I have invited him

567
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,798
and welcome to wuce who is in the house

568
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,480
with girls in green

569
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,240
Booyaka Alice will be here

570
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,519
shortly I knew she would if she

571
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,919
wasn't yeah just handling some stuff

572
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,879
with the do

573
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,720
gearing up for Legends of

574
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,320
hash I am I'm waiting patiently for my

575
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,880
jars to get here so I can get everything

576
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,319
packed up and send it on down with the

577
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,360
homies to uh get the entries in and

578
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:17,720
stuff I'm I'm pretty excited it's gonna

579
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,918
be a good event dude I'm not even going

580
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,558
and I'm pretty excited I got to admit

581
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,240
the amount of energy that Addison and

582
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,240
Kevin have put into this and the stuff

583
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,159
that they've kind of organized around it

584
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,919
I mean getting Caleb

585
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:35,720
getting KX jars for Legends of hash was

586
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:39,679
like it's just so much different and

587
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,440
grown out from what we created it as and

588
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm uh and I'm pretty excited that

589
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,360
they've maintained the Integrity they've

590
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,440
said no to all sorts of companies that

591
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,759
tried to sponsor because Legends just

592
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,759
didn't line up with those companies and

593
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,319
I thought that was amazing as well so I

594
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,038
I kind of got to give those guys a shout

595
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:01,038
out for uh for really doing a great job

596
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:03,440
I can't wait for the event to to kind of

597
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,440
to get

598
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:08,480
here me too I'm can't wait to meet all

599
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,919
the hash makers that end up going

600
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,798
everyone that I've seen is going is

601
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,640
pretty amazing and it's gonna be a great

602
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:17,558
night I'm

603
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,559
excited hell yeah

604
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,359
absolutely I'm freezing up a little bit

605
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,479
so when when you guys Notice Me freeze

606
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,639
up just kind of keep talking as you as

607
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,278
you do I've got the uh the beta uh Elon

608
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,960
Musk starlink internet going on and we

609
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,720
we get a little cut out here and there

610
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,038
so have patience with me

611
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,038
everyone fair enough fair enough we'll

612
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,798
jump in that and Flynn I was just

613
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,640
wondering you you might be still be

614
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,398
around or not but I was just wonder what

615
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,960
and what some of stum strains you might

616
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:52,199
be putting in to the event or just you

617
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,960
know bringing some strains or how about

618
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,960
this Alec what are some uh new trends

619
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,798
and smells and flavors that you're

620
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,679
seeing see out of the Farms this year

621
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:03,599
that are kind of dominating or just kind

622
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,720
of going off this

623
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:09,119
year um well well well what's dominating

624
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,079
is definitely that carry offing lming

625
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,599
like pair like the co carry offline Ling

626
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,599
co- balance kind of all the desserts

627
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,240
that um you know in the emerald Cup last

628
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:22,678
year we saw that profile was about 54%

629
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,880
of all the entries across categories um

630
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,559
and and that and you know that the the

631
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,200
popularity of that profile hasn't really

632
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:33,918
slowed down and so I would you know

633
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,558
believe it to be close to 60 65% of the

634
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,600
Canabis grown in California um was

635
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,519
probably that profile or close to it so

636
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,519
you know you do

637
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,679
see homogenate of profiles that's kind

638
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,720
of happening as people are just like

639
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,480
kind of chasing the THC number you know

640
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,399
and kind of going for these Kling

641
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,558
dominant type um Carling lining combos

642
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,879
um you know it's an amazing profile but

643
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,000
you know it's also you know the most

644
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,240
over kind of grown profile at this point

645
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,359
so you know that's kind of where I'm

646
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
really excited for kind of the work we

647
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,439
do with the emerald cup and then what

648
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,519
we're doing this year with the state

649
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,159
fair which is kind of presenting

650
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,399
cannabis to a whole new audience of

651
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,519
cannabis you know novice people to kind

652
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,558
of really show the range of diversity of

653
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,079
what this plant offers and you know kind

654
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,119
of honor it in that way so that you know

655
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,960
kind of it's not just you know kind of

656
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,798
the you know popularity bias doesn't

657
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,159
just kind of sweep the cup and then have

658
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:30,119
a you know that much more of an effect

659
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,120
on homogenizing the herb in the market

660
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,278
very good our early our early research

661
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,840
showed that lolene definitely

662
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,119
potentiated

663
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:50,038
THC and modulated the

664
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:53,038
effects and with carry Al did not

665
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:53,038
particularly

666
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,519
yeah but that's a a different issue that

667
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm talking

668
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,159
about Sam I had a quick question on that

669
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,839
you know I'm curious as to like um you

670
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:16,559
know how you kind of controlled some of

671
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,199
those variables did you take strains

672
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,960
that were high in these you know tping

673
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,038
profiles or equal

674
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:31,759
like P we got pure

675
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:35,879
THC 25 milligrams put in a volcano every

676
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,720
time uh and then we spiked it with just

677
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,360
a single

678
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,919
turpy so uh when I did that experiment

679
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:47,240
at your house I did it through a rure

680
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,278
bong okay yeah well I used Roars a few

681
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:55,960
times you're right but ba mostly what we

682
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:58,240
used was both thick like Brill pad pad

683
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,919
things that were available with the

684
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,519
volcano and we measured it out with a

685
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,559
very precise scale and we Vaped them all

686
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:13,519
identically and uh P pure THC gets you

687
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:16,398
high but with the right tpes you get way

688
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:21,120
higher how much turine did you

689
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:23,719
add oh as small as we could add a a

690
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:28,199
really tiny SP I mean we were using

691
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:31,640
pipets the smallest ones we we had and

692
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:36,558
uh we made it so that they were really

693
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,559
really uh uh tiny tiny

694
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,278
amounts well you know and and and

695
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
something I would mention too that's

696
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:43,960
where I feel like in the future there's

697
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,519
you know such you know such value in

698
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,919
this idea of the canab turp ratio right

699
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,759
because because what we see you know

700
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,120
five of the six primary Turpin cannabis

701
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,519
or monot turpins you know which begin to

702
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:56,518
boil off a room temperature so there

703
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,319
therefore the biggest spoilage indicator

704
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,960
of you know kind of you know cannabis

705
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,398
that's lost its turpine content right

706
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,079
and you know in so much of what we see

707
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:05,038
in the state in California you know

708
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,240
farmer puts their best Foote forward you

709
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,079
know and has all the controls to

710
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,880
preserve tpin in their supply chain to

711
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,519
the point where they pass it off but

712
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,919
then it goes to a distributor and in the

713
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,759
possession of the distributor and their

714
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,679
chain of custody you know pretty much

715
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:21,480
loses 60 80% of the tping content that

716
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,080
was there and you know in a lot of ways

717
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,679
is indistinguishable to the eye you know

718
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:30,439
or sided coin boat Alex because for

719
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,440
examp example

720
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,679
tpin the most you're right the monot

721
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:40,558
Turpin can be incredibly volatile and uh

722
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,639
significant amounts can be lost between

723
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:47,200
a living plant at Harvest and two weeks

724
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:52,678
later or even a month later after curing

725
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:56,399
Etc but uh the truth of it is I found

726
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:59,038
that cannabis is fresh it's been dried

727
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:03,000
for two weeks it could the retically be

728
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:05,519
smoked but it's really super fresh that

729
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,440
uh I found some really high Turing

730
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,440
content stuff actually gives me

731
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:16,439
laryngitis well you know and I think you

732
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:20,119
yeah I'm sorry go no no I'm just saying

733
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,840
so I I think some of the more volatile

734
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:28,359
ones you have to be careful about

735
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:32,240
extreme amounts of uh and

736
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:34,558
I got laryngitis every year for like

737
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,359
five or six years in a row when I was

738
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,319
living in California growing herb and

739
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,319
then uh I moved over here and started

740
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:43,759
making dry sift and I never got

741
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,119
laryngitis

742
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,038
again well the one thing the one thing I

743
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:49,278
was going to mention and and Sam you're

744
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:51,879
very right I think and I think that's

745
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:55,519
where you know kind of

746
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,360
um translation from smell to flavor and

747
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,960
and uh and and and the character of a

748
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:02,079
profile how it kind of translates to

749
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,720
smoke I mean you know certain certain

750
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,480
examples of an awesome IND dominant

751
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,399
strain kind yeah burn your send your

752
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,278
throat you know and so I think you know

753
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:11,359
there's a lot there to what you're

754
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,278
saying but but my main point around this

755
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,759
canab turp ratio right because so you

756
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,519
know so much of what we see is um you

757
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,798
know the the average of Turing content

758
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,720
flour across everything we've ever

759
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:24,759
tested over 200,000 samples is is like

760
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,278
1.4% average whereas the potential of

761
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:28,759
what we see whenever it's done most

762
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,759
optimally is three to 5 and a half% in

763
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,759
dried flour so you know so from what we

764
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:37,119
see the market average of tpine content

765
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:40,240
flour is is 100% to 200% of that do you

766
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,398
think the majority of that low 1.5

767
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,159
percentage is driven by genetics or by

768
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:47,719
growing or processing or all three I

769
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,679
think all three yeah I think all three

770
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,960
for sure um you know but but but my but

771
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,320
but the big point that I was just going

772
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,159
to make right is you know if you had you

773
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,558
know a you know just speaking in terms

774
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,679
of this idea of the Entourage effect and

775
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:01,918
the nuanced uniqueness that strains have

776
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,639
to offer whenever they are preserved

777
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,880
right because you know if you had a a

778
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:09,358
strain that tested like legitimately 30

779
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,440
35% thca but it was dried and cured like

780
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,078
[ __ ] and it smells like hay and it has 0

781
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,200
2% turpine content that's like a 90 to1

782
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,720
canono DET turpine ratio right and in my

783
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,759
opinion that's in the future what really

784
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,878
defines biomass right there's no other

785
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,320
value for that to be represented as a

786
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:27,440
flow for connoisseur consumption

787
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,359
purposes handy isolating THC yeah

788
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,679
exactly exactly well yeah and so so and

789
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,918
so so yeah so in an instance where all

790
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,079
the turpine cont is gone and the 90 to1

791
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,358
T canab turp ratio is there you know

792
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,800
there's not really an Entourage effect

793
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:39,598
that's going to be present whether if if

794
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,679
the tpine was originally terpinolene to

795
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,000
make it more stimulating or creative or

796
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,200
if it was higher in Meine you know it

797
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,239
doesn't really matter anymore because

798
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,319
it's 90 to1 so it's kind of absent

799
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,078
Turing or Entourage and so really it's

800
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,679
just a very THC base effect you know so

801
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,919
it's like the most value for that would

802
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,920
be to distill it you know add Turpin or

803
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,000
something at the end but but from what

804
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,720
we see right like you know kind of you

805
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,039
could have a strain say you know that

806
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:06,879
test 15% THC but it was dried and cured

807
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,119
immaculately like with tpping

808
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,000
preservation and ultimate like kind of

809
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,760
focus you know and it might have three

810
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,960
to five and a half percent you know

811
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,200
tpping content dried flow that's a 3 to1

812
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,280
canopo DET turpine ratio right so

813
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,000
whether that turpine was loning whether

814
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,800
that tpine was terpinolene whether that

815
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
tpine was mirene right that the

816
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,720
significance and the uniqueness of that

817
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
entage effect is going to be pronounced

818
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:32,719
right as opposed to that

819
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,320
one other question with all this

820
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,078
analysis

821
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,559
edes that

822
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,480
with they hav't they're not damaged

823
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:44,440
samples but they're they're done

824
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,199
properly and they're really primarily

825
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,200
just one

826
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,838
turpy um I mean with on on certain on

827
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,400
the on the end spectrums of the rainbow

828
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:56,960
with turpening or with like miring you

829
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,880
you see you know so many examples where

830
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,639
it's just really primary amounts of that

831
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,519
one turp you know with very subsequent

832
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,799
you know secondary or tertiary kind of

833
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,719
tpping presence but you know you'll see

834
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,480
the vast majority of the representation

835
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:14,719
of that of that profile would be one a

836
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,480
singular TP tpine but um but you know so

837
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,159
so again though in this example you know

838
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,280
I think kind of uh

839
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,559
um you know the the yeah just the ratio

840
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,640
is I think going to be one of the most

841
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:26,078
important things I'm sorry I kind of

842
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,000
like slightly like missed missed the

843
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,599
point I was going to just hit on but

844
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,159
that's perfectly all right yeah no I I

845
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,800
can I can explain why the ratio is

846
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:39,759
important is because what you're

847
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:42,839
changing when you take freshly picked

848
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,920
cannabis to dried cannabis is the amount

849
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:46,960
of water that's in there and so the the

850
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,680
percentage of the relative percentage of

851
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,240
tpes to to overall mass of plant changes

852
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,000
drastically when you go from freshly

853
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,199
Frozen or freshly harvested cannabis to

854
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,079
dried can

855
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:04,000
and so because that Ratio or yes because

856
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,760
that ratio change is the percent tpes

857
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,639
which is the percent of the valal tpin

858
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,800
versus everything else that's in there

859
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,920
well remember you're wholesaling a whole

860
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,318
lot of water out of there so everything

861
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,358
else that's in there that denominator

862
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:19,079
changes that's why you have to pay

863
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,679
attention to the ratio that Alec is

864
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,760
talking about and and and that's thank

865
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,919
you for bringing that up actually

866
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,119
because that that totally triggered my

867
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,318
mind right and and so you know because

868
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,200
and Sam that's where I kind of was going

869
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,239
to bring up because I mean you know I

870
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,199
think the translation or carryover of

871
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,239
like what total tarpine content might

872
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,399
have been

873
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,318
present you know kind of is totally

874
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,280
dependent on you know all these

875
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:42,960
conditions right like you know time of

876
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,960
or temp you

877
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,719
know being harvested under you it's like

878
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,078
if it's in the middle of the day versus

879
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,358
the middle of the night you know there's

880
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,160
like 20% turpine content off the top

881
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:55,119
just because of the heat of the sun and

882
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,799
the temperatures you're you're

883
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,599
harvesting under you know so many people

884
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,720
that Harvest commercial cannabis then

885
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,039
like they harvest in the middle of the

886
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,159
day and then they load box trucks up

887
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,079
with masses of herb that then kind of

888
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,598
sit for like 45 minutes to hours until

889
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,880
they kind of get transported to a place

890
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,480
where they can be put under temperature

891
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,079
control conditions you know but in so

892
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,960
many ways so much of what we see because

893
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,000
of the volatilization of these you know

894
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,000
really precious monot turpins you know

895
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,679
it's like Cann ofis really in my in my

896
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,358
opinion believe it it it deserves a cold

897
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:24,199
supply chain continuous Cold Supply

898
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:25,960
Chain anywhere where it's going to be in

899
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,559
the chain of custody of somebody that's

900
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,280
caring for the this par able good you

901
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,318
know and and and in this record year of

902
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,960
harvest in California and over

903
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:36,279
production you know I think it's going

904
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,400
to be it's very reminiscent of what

905
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,880
happened in Oregon a couple years back

906
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,680
and what really in a big way happened is

907
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,880
you know once everything goes to a

908
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:46,118
standstill you know kind of it's really

909
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,880
it really becomes that much more

910
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,880
apparent who has infrastructure and who

911
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,000
doesn't have infrastructure to even have

912
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,318
you know do what is the carrying

913
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,960
capacity of your situation to preserve

914
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:57,480
Turing content and what you're holding

915
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,480
in your possession because if you don't

916
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,318
have that ability you know then you're

917
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,159
kind of going to get like dusted you

918
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:05,079
know because because in in the time of

919
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:07,039
the great flood you know kind of the

920
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,920
averages of the or the Extremes in

921
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,480
quality really start dividing because if

922
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,960
the average is about one and a half% of

923
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,199
the state you know everything sitting

924
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,559
around it kind of really goes down to

925
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,960
about 1% or less you know so then if

926
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,239
you're at three to five and a half

927
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,480
percent you know you're kind of dunking

928
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,279
on fols you know in a big way of just I

929
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,838
mean I think you it's always that thing

930
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,440
if it's really bomb and it's really tur

931
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:28,799
preserved and it's bombing a room you

932
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,240
know it's always going to have the

933
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,640
ability to fly but if it's anything less

934
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,439
than that you know it's this

935
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,480
commoditized kind avonoid race to the

936
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,838
bottom game you know so I think it's

937
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,039
like those are the separate kind of

938
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,400
sides of the market it's like the

939
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,679
commoditized canono market and then th

940
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,880
those that are on the ultra Ultra side

941
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,239
of you know the tpine preservation game

942
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,880
and you know just being able to

943
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,078
immaculately care for what's in their

944
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,200
possession dude you called it with the

945
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,880
supply chain needing to be cold from

946
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,799
start to finish when I saw the cryo can

947
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,880
come out I thought well that's it that

948
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,920
if the cryo can isn't it something

949
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,119
exactly like it needs to be it needs to

950
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,760
be uh be able to be rolled into the

951
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:12,440
fields it needs to be able to you know

952
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,640
very quickly and very cold REM remove

953
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,119
and and mitigate 90 or 85% of that

954
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:21,239
biomass and just preserve the the

955
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,599
glandular triome heads in which case now

956
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,159
that becomes your feed input for any

957
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,960
process you're doing whether you're

958
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,239
doing CO2 extraction or butane

959
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,599
extraction or water extraction you're

960
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:35,639
pouring in resin into your reactors not

961
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:38,720
plant matter and you've kept it cold

962
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,879
since you took it off the field that's

963
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,879
my

964
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,039
dream yeah I think that's really

965
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,359
nitrogen hopefully too underground

966
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:51,318
underground containers in California I

967
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:55,279
mean are the only way you can like do it

968
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:56,759
without using crazy grid you know issues

969
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,440
because anything above ground in

970
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,079
California is just subjected to you know

971
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,358
so much heat and so much movement and

972
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,440
everything that it's and then you know

973
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:09,559
to try and put a refrigerator or units

974
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,838
on there it just becomes like a wild

975
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:13,599
amount of electricity and and it just

976
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:16,039
and I don't know that that's what we're

977
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,960
going for is like ultimate electricity

978
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:22,199
use so there's like this weird balance

979
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,519
of like you know trying to find passive

980
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:27,719
systems to to to flow into these modern

981
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,719
needs you know because we do want high

982
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:31,000
grade yeah ancient meets future though

983
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,078
and that's what's funny is the old

984
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,440
school cats always knew all along you

985
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,200
bury your read you know it's like I mean

986
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,240
funny how much it's funny how much the

987
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,358
old kind of knowledge really is proving

988
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,239
that much more true today you know just

989
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,039
around Farmers like all wives tales are

990
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,799
in Harvest times around the full moon or

991
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,960
just like you know times where I they're

992
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,599
not harvesting in the middle of the day

993
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,559
I mean or I mean just there was just

994
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,800
there's always just there's so much deep

995
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,358
wisdom kind of in a lot of these older

996
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,119
practices that I think now we getting

997
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:01,279
that much more Val idated yeah and I

998
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,960
just wanted to make the bridge again to

999
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,599
the old practices is that all of the

1000
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,720
temperatures and the humidities that

1001
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,720
everybody is talking about to preserve

1002
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,679
these troms and also these plants and

1003
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,480
herbalism is exactly what the Earth you

1004
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,318
know below the Earth's surface and

1005
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:22,039
geothermal is what it holds constant and

1006
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:25,159
continuous so Mother Nature has a plan

1007
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:27,358
there's a deep understanding she has she

1008
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:29,440
has a knowing of how to preserve these

1009
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,039
plants and I think that all we have to

1010
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,240
do is very easily tap into it rather

1011
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:39,400
than try to overthink it so it

1012
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:42,479
is and we know that it's always the

1013
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,920
basements of our homes that have always

1014
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,400
dried the best flour and made the best

1015
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,800
uh concentrate and consistent

1016
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,559
temperatures to where the door is not

1017
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,559
opening and it's oh it's hot it's cold

1018
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:56,079
you know has to be consistent and then

1019
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:59,200
you sometimes will find some herb gets

1020
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,079
more potent in some cases after you know

1021
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,039
four six months of not being opened and

1022
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,640
whatnot totally big love to Mojave

1023
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:10,159
Richmond in the house hey yeah welcome

1024
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:13,118
Mojave brother hey everyone Thanks for

1025
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:16,519
uh thanks for the invite stok to be here

1026
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,800
yeah a good conversation I can't believe

1027
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:22,519
you're here moabi I know Sam it's good

1028
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,519
to see

1029
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:30,000
you hey um guys with with the cryo

1030
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,440
freezing you know I I've seen a lot of

1031
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,760
uh hemp flour dried with cryo and it

1032
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:38,519
kind of reminds me of

1033
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,400
Cheetos uh when it's dried um now I I I

1034
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,119
I understand the resin and I think we

1035
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,760
can we can think about that in a in a

1036
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,119
more methodical way but I I understand

1037
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,440
where everyone's coming from we need to

1038
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,119
preserve things but there is an optimal

1039
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,559
temperature in range in like the time

1040
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,680
that the flower will actually

1041
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:59,839
encapsulate some of these these monot

1042
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:02,519
Turpin and and really hold them in and

1043
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,318
and I think there is a perfect place for

1044
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,519
that to happen I I just think it's not

1045
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,000
talked enough about and studied enough

1046
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:11,239
as to when a varietal should and how

1047
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,239
long

1048
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:27,440
it found is that if you do a tpine

1049
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:31,519
profile say the top 50 tpin of uh a

1050
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,720
fresh skunk number one for example and

1051
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,358
then you dry it for two weeks test it

1052
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:41,519
again

1053
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:44,400
then box it cure it for a month or so uh

1054
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:47,920
test it again and then finally turine

1055
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:52,160
test the resin after it's been extracted

1056
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:55,240
from that same clone the you see a

1057
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:58,480
decrease in the profile of

1058
00:44:55,239 --> 00:45:01,439
monoterpenes and uh you know the more

1059
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,079
it's been handled processed and hung

1060
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,200
around the more volatile ones are gone

1061
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:08,480
yep yeah we see that exact same thing

1062
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,558
you know and that's where I think really

1063
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,920
that simple yeah and I think that's

1064
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,760
where it's so much of the like

1065
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,680
uh long-term preservation that people

1066
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,400
have in for build building out their

1067
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,838
business model you know instead of um

1068
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,760
people kind of you know racing to grow

1069
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,119
as much as the neighbor you know being

1070
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,440
able to just preserve as as the highest

1071
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:31,039
potential and quality you know cuz you

1072
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,240
know even yields you know it's like if

1073
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,199
you you know Harvest and kind of are

1074
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,519
able to control temperatures you know

1075
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,078
from the entirety from you know kind of

1076
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,480
what time temperatures were being plants

1077
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,079
were being harvested under how quickly

1078
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,440
those plants were able to get below

1079
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,800
temperature control conditions how

1080
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,599
quickly or how long you know kind of

1081
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,640
those temperatures able to be maintained

1082
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,760
you know because that was one of the big

1083
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,558
failed kind of uh experiments around

1084
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,559
nitrogen packaging you know people with

1085
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,280
nitrogen pack everybody seemed to bail

1086
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,000
on that all at the same time you know

1087
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,359
but it was kind of failed experiment

1088
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,519
because everybody nitrogen packag their

1089
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,759
herb but then just let it sit in

1090
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:04,440
warehouses you know to like fluctuating

1091
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,160
day-to-day temperature humidity all

1092
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,760
these things you know and a year later

1093
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,159
sure you open it up and you know it's

1094
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,640
bomb but then it catches up in five

1095
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,279
minutes you know but there was no there

1096
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,679
was no continuity in the you know that

1097
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,160
that temperature humidity you know

1098
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:19,719
tained custody and so you know I think

1099
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,279
that one added variable would have

1100
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:24,759
actually probably you know given that

1101
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,119
technology a lot of props and Alex like

1102
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,359
what you're kind of alluding to is like

1103
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,640
there is an amount that is too much

1104
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:35,159
right that you right so I think that

1105
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:35,159
that's something

1106
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,039
that's a cold chain event all the way to

1107
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,559
a consumer right and that's that's

1108
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,239
something as this moves forward I I'm

1109
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:01,599
starting to think about a whole lot in

1110
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:03,358
terms of just resin right but at the

1111
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,760
same time on the flip side of it the

1112
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,880
flour is a is super problematic because

1113
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,880
you know it's just old like you don't

1114
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,280
want old you don't want old herb you

1115
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,480
want fresh herb so what is that time

1116
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,119
frame I guess is what I'm asking and and

1117
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,639
uh you know because I've never really

1118
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,640
looked into it I've just kind of you

1119
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,558
know my bioassay tells me like oh this

1120
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,039
is this is fresh this is you're right

1121
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:29,640
like there's no beyond that I have

1122
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:33,079
looked into it a bit never had pot that

1123
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:36,639
I froze for more than a year or two so I

1124
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:39,920
can't really speak on herb but resin

1125
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:43,558
heads both cleaned and uncleaned so

1126
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:47,280
farmers grade has it's about 30% THC

1127
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:50,240
it's just resin heads but with other uh

1128
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,960
trash in with it and then there's a

1129
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:56,118
cleaned up resin that's you know in the

1130
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,039
low 80s and it's just resin heads

1131
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,920
nothing else

1132
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:04,440
and for a decade Frozen minus

1133
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,358
30 and you can either flush it with

1134
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,838
nitrogen or not and uh it doesn't really

1135
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:12,480
change not at

1136
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,318
all that makes sense to me Sam but but

1137
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,880
now we we bring bring in plant you know

1138
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:19,719
we bring in a living breathing organism

1139
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,119
right that's

1140
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:25,719
drying and that it's decaying at a

1141
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,440
faster rate than the resin toer point so

1142
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:32,239
what is the you know I guess I'm just

1143
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:35,440
asking that's why secret is to get it to

1144
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,919
the point of resin I mean that is the

1145
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,760
active whether it's recreational or

1146
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:47,159
medical or whatever that is what you're

1147
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:47,160
after so uh if you if you have any

1148
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,798
way we lost you Sam least I did yeah

1149
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,519
that's why that's why get it as cold as

1150
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,679
possible like you said Colin we don't

1151
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:01,039
want old weed we want fresh weed it's

1152
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:02,919
like exactly get it as fresh as possible

1153
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,119
do these processes so you preserve

1154
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,358
everything and then only then make the

1155
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,798
decision through your bioassay where you

1156
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:12,039
know you have everything where you enjoy

1157
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:13,880
it at different rates and because here's

1158
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:16,199
the thing like someone said earlier oh

1159
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,240
sometimes there's it's too much yeah too

1160
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:22,000
much of a specific ratio but a different

1161
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:24,039
ratio may not be too much so we can't

1162
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,318
get into these generalizations of like

1163
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:28,079
well I had 9% tpin one time and it was

1164
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,119
way too too much well yeah it might have

1165
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,200
been super high in delimine or another

1166
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,599
costic tpine that you know osine burned

1167
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,159
the throat or

1168
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,160
whatever what do you got there

1169
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:53,358
Mojave forgot about them Botanical tpin

1170
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,240
non-cannabis derived and when I pulled

1171
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,440
them out it was pretty far out they were

1172
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:59,759
all the same amount inside each

1173
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,119
container for the most part and a lot of

1174
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,839
it volatilized you know there's

1175
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,119
definitely it's a gummy kind of resin

1176
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:08,519
left over but some of the tops were

1177
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,838
completely corroded versus other this is

1178
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:14,358
aamine and this is

1179
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:16,480
lenol um and all the way across some of

1180
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:18,318
them were just like here's terpinolene

1181
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,480
which is a little bit more

1182
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:24,639
corroded um here's alha pinene Which is

1183
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,798
less corroded anyway I just think it's a

1184
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,639
really interesting conversation about

1185
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:32,358
packaging longevity you know as as our

1186
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,960
good buddy Rob Clark always said not all

1187
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:38,000
Tarpin are good tpen that they're I

1188
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,559
think there is something with fresh weed

1189
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,480
that is a little bit like there's this

1190
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,519
anthropological concept of cultural

1191
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,079
relativism which says like if a culture

1192
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:49,280
decides to do something whether it's

1193
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:52,200
batshit crazy or not they did it for a

1194
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:55,119
reason and people traditionally really

1195
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:58,159
went through a lot of effort to age

1196
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,358
cannabis and to kind of De TP the flower

1197
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,598
before they consumed it and I think that

1198
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:03,039
that was you know definitely it was a

1199
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,599
different world a different Market a

1200
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,000
different ver different types of

1201
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:08,160
products that are being consumed but I

1202
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,798
think it's really interesting I think

1203
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,039
that there are certain profiles that

1204
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:14,679
improve more with age and certain

1205
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:18,400
products that are more stable i' I've

1206
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:19,639
froze flour for gez probably 10 years

1207
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,880
and pulled it out of the freezer and

1208
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:23,598
it's still pretty damn fresh like I've

1209
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,119
seen stuff that was you know on the

1210
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,519
market that was a few months old that

1211
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,240
had been abused and abused is and the

1212
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,759
tur profile definitely changes even in

1213
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:32,598
the freezer you know and it's hard to

1214
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,119
keep it you know completely Frozen and

1215
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:36,440
sealed for that long but I think it's an

1216
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,079
interesting conversation like right now

1217
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,798
in California we've got this big blut

1218
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:43,680
and all this flour from last year that

1219
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:45,039
no one could sell and it expired and you

1220
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,239
know they had to you have to turn it

1221
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,719
into distillate and get a new COA on it

1222
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:51,439
to extend its life and I think that

1223
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:53,358
there's there's no reason why we can't

1224
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,559
store flour for a long time and I think

1225
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:58,598
that there's you know quite possibly a

1226
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:00,240
good reason to not smoke fresh flour for

1227
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:03,280
certain varieties and for certain you

1228
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,318
know it's it's kind of like the Aged

1229
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,400
wine aged cheese thing it definitely

1230
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:11,400
turn it it changes in a profound way but

1231
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:15,200
for some some varieties I've just

1232
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,440
noticed you know like these these um you

1233
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,639
know like high terpinolene varieties

1234
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,119
seem to be more stable for instance and

1235
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:25,318
then maybe that's just because the

1236
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:27,480
effect of tpine on aged flour seems to

1237
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,759
not diminish as much

1238
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,639
um as these other higher carry offine

1239
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,119
higher Mir scene varieties and stuff

1240
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:36,159
that seem to like you get no effect

1241
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:38,079
after a while or the effect is

1242
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,679
completely diminished anyway I just

1243
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,480
think it's an interesting conversation I

1244
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:43,358
posted this thing on on Instagram and I

1245
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,639
rarely do memes and it got a number of

1246
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:48,159
people freaked out like you know you

1247
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:50,279
know what's it doing to our packages and

1248
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,399
and since Sam dude what's it doing to

1249
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,280
your throat like when you held that up I

1250
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,480
was like whoa that's what my throat

1251
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,720
looks like when I take a dab of osam

1252
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,760
well I've always Haven you always

1253
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:05,039
noticed that like when you

1254
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:07,359
dab residue is it's creating a corrosion

1255
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:11,639
like what's well so these are also pure

1256
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:14,400
tpin right okay I don't know it's this

1257
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:17,920
but most Turpin are good solvents a lot

1258
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,480
of those rubbers are are plasticized

1259
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,000
with things called plasticizers and a

1260
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,159
lot of times what happens is the turpine

1261
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,760
gets into the rubber leeches out the

1262
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:30,719
plasticizer there PL izers or nasty

1263
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,480
compounds are like dioctyl phalate and

1264
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,838
phalates and [ __ ] like that but what you

1265
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,599
might be seeing there is just the

1266
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:41,039
precipitation of the phet plasticizer

1267
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:43,160
from the rubber so what what what I mean

1268
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,000
to say is that it's nothing inherent in

1269
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:47,358
the tpine it's just the tpine

1270
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,039
interacting with this rubber that's not

1271
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:54,119
suited for for but why would some tures

1272
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,599
react that way the way osam is reacting

1273
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:57,519
and others wouldn't it's just

1274
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,760
interesting because osine is literally

1275
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,480
one of the harshest turps on the throat

1276
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,640
and it looks like it has the most

1277
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,880
breakdown whatever it's breaking down

1278
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:08,318
solent for the plasticizer and it's able

1279
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,240
to draw it out or something I I I don't

1280
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:14,318
know Mark it's weird interesting hey

1281
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:16,000
welcome to Debbie Debbie's in the house

1282
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,199
good morning everyone whoa really

1283
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,880
interesting stuff to wander into talking

1284
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:23,798
about this uh tpine plastic interaction

1285
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,680
did not know that little sensory

1286
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:30,400
evaluation at 955 am. Pacific Central

1287
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,798
Time Pacific Standard Time Mojave can

1288
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,280
you scrape off like is it like a powder

1289
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:37,759
or a white residue or something or does

1290
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,280
it is it like you say there's corrosion

1291
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,839
like what is the material what does it

1292
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,760
look like no it is kind of feels like

1293
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:48,480
it's just gummy almost like it

1294
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,400
precipitated like almost it feels like

1295
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:56,519
it like it pass through the

1296
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,519
Rubber and then

1297
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,318
yeah and I can hardly open the

1298
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,240
containers oh this one opened yeah it

1299
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,920
would be interesting to see over a

1300
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,279
prolonged period of time if the rubber

1301
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,599
becomes brittle then that tells you it's

1302
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:11,480
leeching out the plasticizer a a rubber

1303
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,400
without a plasticizer in there will turn

1304
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:16,719
brittle it'll it'll turn brittle and

1305
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,720
it'll break

1306
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,598
one no I'm saying if you've ever seen

1307
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,639
the ball jars on certain varieties the

1308
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,400
ball jars the Rubber seal on ball jars

1309
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:29,879
starts to crack and I seem to remember

1310
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,760
this from a tip from I don't know Sam I

1311
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,920
don't know if I got this from you but

1312
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,440
this is something way back in Amsterdam

1313
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,920
I think I learned but was to throw the

1314
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,760
rubber band in a in a jar of

1315
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,599
flour and then pull a month later pull

1316
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,599
it out it's the right variety like a

1317
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:49,280
high Haze variety uh yes I've seen them

1318
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:51,240
melt those rubber bands easily

1319
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,640
yeah well and that's the one thing I was

1320
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:55,679
going to say real quick on the test side

1321
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:58,078
because we um you know um around 2018 we

1322
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,118
we invested in like a smoking robot as

1323
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,280
well so that that could kind of um te

1324
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:05,200
you know basically pull the aerosol Vape

1325
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,359
from a vape Partridge that's already

1326
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:10,519
been aerosolized and then is capturing

1327
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:12,279
that aerosol and then we're running

1328
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:13,679
further testing on it so we're working

1329
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,720
with the groups to help in like just

1330
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,480
long-term shelf life type studies if

1331
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:20,318
they're either using kind of natural

1332
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,400
kind of derived cannabis turbines kind

1333
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,480
of Blended at whatever proportions or

1334
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,760
ratios um or or and or kind of groups

1335
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,599
that are kind of just adding these

1336
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,680
different Botanical or otherwise T other

1337
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,960
type of turbines but we we definitely

1338
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,558
you know I mean we have seen some really

1339
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,318
interesting things on the corrosion side

1340
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:39,960
of things with like in with with with

1341
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:41,679
regard to releasing and increasing high

1342
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,440
levels of heavy metals kind of over time

1343
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:44,639
you know kind of from cartridges various

1344
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,079
cartridges I mean there's there's all

1345
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,519
these unknown variables about what is

1346
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:51,000
actually you know in the hardware that's

1347
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,920
leading to that but it's also this

1348
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,880
combination of okay at what high you

1349
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,480
know what concentration of turpine are

1350
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,318
in these you know if you have kind of

1351
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,960
10% lyine in there you know kind of over

1352
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,519
time you know is it going to be leading

1353
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,720
to more corrosion than others um you

1354
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:07,358
know especially with certain types of

1355
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:08,879
Hardware but these are definitely all

1356
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:10,880
really fascinating questions that I

1357
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,559
think people need to you know just take

1358
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,200
into consideration especially if they're

1359
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,119
formulating products and putting them

1360
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:19,159
out you you might be familiar with Amber

1361
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,960
Weiss's study that was recently

1362
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:23,679
published so Amber Weiss I think is a

1363
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:27,199
professor up in up in Washington and she

1364
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:29,598
studied an uh a a Well published the

1365
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,960
results of a study of something that

1366
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:36,838
you're exactly addressing which is the

1367
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:40,838
leeching of heavy metals in through Vape

1368
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:43,838
Hardware into the uh Vape cartridge

1369
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:46,558
fluid and and what impact that could

1370
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:49,440
have on human safety is this actually

1371
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,920
putting lead and cadmium and tin and all

1372
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,720
these other nasty metals because you got

1373
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,680
to think of any shiny metal product most

1374
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:57,078
likely coming from the same Factory in

1375
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,798
China

1376
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:02,039
uh any shiny metal could be contaminated

1377
00:57:59,798 --> 00:58:05,199
with these other metals which you

1378
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:06,960
probably don't want to have in Vape

1379
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,439
cartridges where you're inhaling the

1380
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,480
stuff into your into your lungs and so

1381
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,000
Amber Weiss just recently published

1382
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,760
paper maybe what I could do is post a

1383
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,760
link to it

1384
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:24,480
in also brings back you know again the

1385
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:26,119
need to really have uh not only

1386
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,599
oversight but the analytical method

1387
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:32,798
methods like ICP and whatnot so you can

1388
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,920
look at you know maybe what storing

1389
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:39,159
cartridge fluid in these tanks for

1390
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,639
prolonged periods of time does in terms

1391
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:43,879
of introducing metal content to the

1392
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:46,879
fluid themselves because vape pens

1393
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,480
aren't going away anytime soon so the

1394
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,720
real question is is what's the best way

1395
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,838
to manufacture that to make sure that

1396
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:58,279
not only the thing works but it works in

1397
00:58:54,838 --> 00:59:00,639
a way that doesn't leech heavy metals

1398
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,680
into what you're inhaling because God

1399
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,440
knows what the long-term impact of that

1400
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:07,038
could

1401
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,200
be I think not getting so tricky with

1402
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,440
everything you know with the old old

1403
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:14,078
school apothecaries you know have have

1404
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,760
been dealing with essential oils for you

1405
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,839
know hundreds thousands of years and and

1406
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,400
they also volatize you know and and

1407
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:25,480
people have used glass and glass

1408
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:29,480
syringes and glass jars with glass lids

1409
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:31,798
and copper and silver and these metals

1410
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:35,079
are proven to be good for us and gold in

1411
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:37,599
some cases you know um so we we continue

1412
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:39,920
to get these new products from

1413
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,559
modernization and then wow we found out

1414
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,159
they're all tainted and then now all of

1415
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,798
a sudden they're well what a shocker you

1416
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:50,440
know they all these new new items coming

1417
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:54,079
that are cheap and stuff are now toxic

1418
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:57,440
so I think that we look towards again

1419
00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:00,318
you know let's not we we this the way we

1420
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,318
get educated

1421
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,838
nowadays forget about the past and think

1422
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:09,200
that we you know we're only learning now

1423
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:12,759
and there's ways that we can build from

1424
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:14,598
the past and bring that into our future

1425
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,280
packaging and stuff so you know let's

1426
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:19,359
just it's pretty cool if you look at old

1427
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:22,400
school Apothecary um you know boxes the

1428
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:25,838
one the herbs that had the volatile oil

1429
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:28,680
in it that were very aromatic also had

1430
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:31,480
um um each one of those drawers was a

1431
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:32,798
glass and they were kept inside glass

1432
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,798
and then the ones that were less

1433
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,079
volatile were kept inside of the wooden

1434
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,920
drawers so and certain hers were kept in

1435
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,440
the basement that they had to go down

1436
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,838
into the basement to get it you know

1437
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,639
depending on what it was so you know I

1438
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:47,679
think it's important for us to just

1439
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:50,598
remember that and also that you know um

1440
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:53,279
regenerative and organically grown

1441
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:58,119
cannabis and Earth grown cannabis tends

1442
01:00:53,280 --> 01:01:00,480
to keep its it's it's trines longer you

1443
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:03,160
know than things that are aeroponically

1444
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,199
or or hydroponically grown in some cases

1445
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:07,480
maybe Alec you you you could maybe

1446
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:10,519
dispute that and I I would be open you

1447
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,119
know but I you find that a lot of times

1448
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:14,679
that you know the soil grown cannabis

1449
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:16,640
tends to keep its its flavor has more

1450
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:18,318
Integrity in it longer and then the

1451
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,558
medicine out of it you know can be and

1452
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,119
that's only because of mic more

1453
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:24,039
microbiology may be present and I think

1454
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:26,640
that that's going to be the real bridge

1455
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:29,400
that you know us as regenerative farmers

1456
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:32,318
and as regenerative medicine makers are

1457
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:35,559
really interested to see the science of

1458
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:40,119
you know tpine all uh secondary

1459
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:42,680
metabolites that are profound inside of

1460
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:45,400
the plant and then what is profound

1461
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:48,118
inside of the soil and what's profound

1462
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,079
inside of the plant's endophytic system

1463
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:53,559
and you know its own microbiome so

1464
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:56,359
that's going our biome and our brain

1465
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:57,680
blood brain barrier and the way that it

1466
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:00,078
well that's one thing I've been really

1467
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:00,078
really

1468
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,118
FAS you know because with all things

1469
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,679
equal you know like you grow the same

1470
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:11,160
strain same plant different conditions

1471
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:14,038
hydroponically versus regenerative

1472
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:15,920
organic you know like with Elaine ing's

1473
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,599
you know soil food web research and all

1474
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,880
the stuff she's shown you know whenever

1475
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,798
you do that side by-side study you can

1476
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,920
track whenever the microbiome of the

1477
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:26,440
soil is balanced to what the plant wants

1478
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,039
you know you can track the doubling of

1479
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,960
the secondary metabolite that that F

1480
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:31,720
produces and you see that with lopen and

1481
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,639
tomatoes you see that with various

1482
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:35,439
vitamins and berries and you know with

1483
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:37,480
cannibis turpins are the secondary

1484
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,079
metabolite so you know that would go to

1485
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,240
you know suggest that you know there's

1486
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:44,160
the potential for you know regenerating

1487
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:46,159
Organic Grown you know kind of optimally

1488
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,838
organic grown cannabis potentially being

1489
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:49,719
able to produce doubling of the you know

1490
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:52,038
secondary metabolites you know that's

1491
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:53,318
like you know there needs you know some

1492
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:55,000
you know a lot of side by side to kind

1493
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:56,639
of be able to demonstrate but that that

1494
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,278
but that's really really fascinating to

1495
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,199
me because you know from you know

1496
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:02,880
there's everything you could do as a

1497
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:04,679
farmer to grow the plant most optimally

1498
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,440
and then from that point on then it's

1499
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:08,078
okay then it's all about you know post

1500
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,039
Harvest handling temperatures all these

1501
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,760
things that you do to kind of lock in

1502
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:15,520
and preserve like you know what you were

1503
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:17,319
able to kind of produce you know um and

1504
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:19,038
everything's working against you you

1505
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:21,038
know kind of if you're working with you

1506
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,240
know harvesting and higher temperatures

1507
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,000
versus you know because we we've seen

1508
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:27,318
groups that will kind of you know

1509
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,400
Harvest you know kind of Frozen material

1510
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:30,960
in the field you know in the middle of

1511
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,798
the day kind of an 80 plus degree

1512
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,278
temperatures and then you know do the

1513
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:35,880
same thing at in the middle of the night

1514
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:38,400
you know zombie Harvest and kind of do

1515
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,838
that and track kind of the you know a

1516
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:44,160
resin um essential oil return off the

1517
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,798
off the extract in the yield and you see

1518
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,639
substantial kind of difference you know

1519
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:50,880
20 plus percent you know is you know up

1520
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:52,798
to 20% or more kind of turb content loss

1521
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,680
just in that you know kind of decision

1522
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,679
of harvest time temperature so here's a

1523
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:59,838
question here's a question question some

1524
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:02,838
of the turpi and most ridiculous hash

1525
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:05,639
I've ever made in my life has been in

1526
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:08,199
Jamaica where it's like literally like a

1527
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:10,239
100 degrees in the field I can't even go

1528
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:12,480
in the field for more than like 20 or 30

1529
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:15,038
minutes at a time or my P pasty white

1530
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,599
ass just turns Lobster red and then I

1531
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,559
then I can't you know enjoy myself

1532
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:21,119
anymore so I'm like going in and out of

1533
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,559
the fields every 15 to 20 minutes and

1534
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,599
and I'm just looking at these plants and

1535
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,960
they're so stinky and the field is so

1536
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:28,640
stinky and I'm just thinking like like

1537
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:32,000
holy [ __ ] like these things are off

1538
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:35,239
gassing an insane amount of Tarpin right

1539
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,639
now is it because of that process that

1540
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:40,519
it's producing more because at the end

1541
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,679
of it when I like Harve when we

1542
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:44,400
harvested that [ __ ] and then ran it

1543
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:46,838
through the bags and trust me we were

1544
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,639
not keeping it cold all the way to till

1545
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:51,038
they got into the bags they just they

1546
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:54,078
were in like warm plastic bags or

1547
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:56,119
whatever it was so turpy and I mean dude

1548
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,400
Sam even you can acknowledge because

1549
01:04:56,119 --> 01:05:00,519
this was at a time where this was the

1550
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,000
first time Sam ever smoked anything I

1551
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:05,400
had okay prior to that because we were

1552
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,239
in Jamaica together prior to that he

1553
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:12,240
only smoked his own [ __ ] like it just it

1554
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,879
was it was that good and I I'm not like

1555
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,719
saying that he shouldn't have because

1556
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,880
truly like that [ __ ] was from another

1557
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:21,399
planet but this stuff in Jamaica was

1558
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,119
like I want to say it was almost on

1559
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,838
point wouldn't you agree Sam do you

1560
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,318
remember the stuff we made from well

1561
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:28,719
there was two points

1562
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:33,400
number one I didn't have enough to keep

1563
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:37,038
smoking just mine so but number two the

1564
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:40,119
stuff we made was outrageously

1565
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:45,400
good agreed it was really good I still

1566
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:49,599
have pictures of it no it it was really

1567
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:52,639
it it was also a a darker redder color

1568
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:57,720
than the stuff grown in my Greenhouse

1569
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:59,879
for example H so I I I you know Marcus I

1570
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:01,598
have some thoughts on that I mean you

1571
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,318
know Alec was bringing up like

1572
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,519
biotransformation through enzimatic

1573
01:06:03,318 --> 01:06:09,480
uptake and all these things that can

1574
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:11,719
happen through you know Target feedings

1575
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:15,838
and kind of you know there's there's the

1576
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:17,358
term you know uh just driving crop crop

1577
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,960
steering right but you can do crop

1578
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,278
steering with in many different ways and

1579
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,519
it's just an ideology and then there's

1580
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:25,719
the stress responses right you have

1581
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,679
stress response that plant's giving off

1582
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:29,879
in combating the environment that it's

1583
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:33,000
in in most cases that is going to

1584
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:35,079
directly result in the resin and that

1585
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,440
could go good or bad that could go both

1586
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:39,240
sides right you could have AET response

1587
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,358
that stresses the plan out so bad that

1588
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:42,679
it just like goes the wrong direction or

1589
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:45,598
it stress response in the right

1590
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:47,598
direction and it allows it to express a

1591
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,278
profile that it hasn't really expressed

1592
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:54,079
before um and I've seen that firsthand

1593
01:06:50,278 --> 01:06:55,880
over the years a lot um so you know I

1594
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,079
think there's there's two ways to go

1595
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,559
about this and there's two ideologies

1596
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:04,039
here but they all kind of end up the

1597
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,760
same place if you do the right things um

1598
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:07,200
so that I think there's there's that to

1599
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,000
think about so I don't know if anyone

1600
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:12,558
has any thoughts on that as well but I

1601
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,599
think that's you know from my experience

1602
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,640
targeting and then also going the other

1603
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:19,640
way and stressing them out um you get

1604
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:21,318
some equally amazing results yeah I

1605
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:22,838
frankly I agree with that and you know

1606
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:24,679
one thing i' would say too is you know

1607
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:26,358
kind of Marcus to the point you were

1608
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:28,358
just bringing up you know know I mean

1609
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:30,239
certain strains genetics have the

1610
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:32,920
potential to put out certain amounts you

1611
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:35,239
know just inherently like before the you

1612
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,880
know optimal feeding and you know kind

1613
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:38,759
of cultivation side of things happen you

1614
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,920
know I mean you could have certain

1615
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,880
strains that sure are really really high

1616
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,440
and can aloid content but they might not

1617
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,920
ever have the potential to put out more

1618
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:49,200
than two to 3% tpine content in the

1619
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,440
dried flour you know as opposed to other

1620
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,558
kind of strains that might be you know

1621
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:57,039
lower overall in canabo content or or

1622
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,359
overall THC but you know might you know

1623
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,400
kind of be able to readily pump out five

1624
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:02,838
plus potential percent you know and

1625
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,599
that's where I'm really fascinated too

1626
01:08:02,838 --> 01:08:07,038
about um what Colin was just bringing up

1627
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,278
you know I think there's all these you

1628
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,799
know like uh I don't know if hormesis

1629
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:12,639
environmental hormesis or something but

1630
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:15,239
just like the the plant's ability to

1631
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:16,920
kind of adapt um to the kind of given

1632
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,119
you know kind of stress responses that

1633
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:22,000
that environment GR in provides you know

1634
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:23,679
um and so you I think there's all these

1635
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,238
different fascinating things to track

1636
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,119
but and then you know but you know but

1637
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:28,519
you

1638
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:30,358
all things given you know each unique

1639
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,319
cultivar has its potential of what it

1640
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:35,400
can put out and you know who knows maybe

1641
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,400
the potential or

1642
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,199
the might be environments across the

1643
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,199
world where it might be more optimally

1644
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:44,719
you know uh able to be expressed in

1645
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,158
certain areas but all things considered

1646
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,719
you know strain has the potential you

1647
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,119
know to put out a certain amount and

1648
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:50,798
then like I think there's a future study

1649
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:52,599
to understand okay well if it's you know

1650
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:54,198
one to one so you know fungal bacterial

1651
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,640
ratio and microbes in the soil and kind

1652
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:57,759
of optimally kind of regenerate

1653
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:00,600
organically grown versus hydroponic you

1654
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:02,479
know can can there be this increase or

1655
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,480
doubling of secondary metabolites you

1656
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,479
know because then from there it's okay

1657
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:08,079
the the plant is able to produce its

1658
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,639
potential you know maybe through

1659
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:11,399
cultivation methods it can be

1660
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,359
drastically doubled or increased ver is

1661
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:16,198
not but then from that point it's like

1662
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:18,759
post Harvest handling is where kind of

1663
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:21,318
you know we see 60 to 80% of the like

1664
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:22,520
devaluation or you know kind of Step you

1665
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:24,440
know and and that's what just what's

1666
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,279
really fascinating to see you know when

1667
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:27,759
we we've been on kind of bit of a not

1668
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:29,440
Public Service Announcement like

1669
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,560
sometimes I feel like chick and little

1670
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,838
but not screaming about the skies

1671
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,080
falling but about the turps are

1672
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:35,960
volatilizing you know and you know

1673
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,359
trying to kind of help just Empower

1674
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,480
those we work with on this understanding

1675
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:41,679
of how how like how much they need to

1676
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:43,639
vet their their supply chain partners

1677
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,600
because they could be putting the most

1678
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:49,560
premium bomb herb forward you know that

1679
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,679
they preserved 5% tping content in it

1680
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,279
but then the time it gets the

1681
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:54,440
distributor sits around a month before

1682
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:57,360
it goes to be packaged you know

1683
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:59,198
processed put into jars and then driven

1684
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,319
in non-refrigerated kind of

1685
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:03,079
transportation to a dispensary well now

1686
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:05,079
it's at a dispensary getting rejected

1687
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:06,960
because it might have like 70% less

1688
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:08,559
Turing content and now now the

1689
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,198
distributor is going back to the farmer

1690
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,039
to try to renegotiate price you know if

1691
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:15,319
it's not going if it's if it's not

1692
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:18,560
getting sent back it's going into a

1693
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:20,960
non-cooled vault yeah exactly into a

1694
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,360
non-cooled vault I'm in the same boat

1695
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,319
with you and I think in the future I

1696
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:27,238
think the farmers and the the and

1697
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,960
consumers are going to be most outraged

1698
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:32,119
by how lacking T you know because people

1699
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,158
are paying me paying premium prices for

1700
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:35,880
like top you know top shelf quality herb

1701
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,439
but if you actually look at it you know

1702
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,400
on the you know kind of phytochemical

1703
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:43,399
standpoint it's like you know 60 70%

1704
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:45,639
less actually bomb than when it was uh

1705
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:47,639
able to be preserved or yeah and what

1706
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:50,039
does that do what does that do to not

1707
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,079
bomb herb the stuff that the majority of

1708
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:53,920
people are actually growing how about

1709
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:56,519
that now now put that into that

1710
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:01,239
non-cooled Supply chain and you end up

1711
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:02,640
with done be way below mediocre welcome

1712
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:04,479
I like that's not a good place to

1713
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,119
compete in right now you know really

1714
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:09,639
quickly I just wanted to bring up um

1715
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:12,920
just the definition of secondary

1716
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:15,360
metabolites it has the word metabolism

1717
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,359
in it so when we're talking about

1718
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,920
secondary metabolites we're actually

1719
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:22,839
talking about the metabolism of the

1720
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:26,000
plant and when we compare the metabolism

1721
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:28,199
of a human being in warm weather warm

1722
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,920
climates or we actually look at the

1723
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:34,839
metabolism of soil when we have year

1724
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:39,279
round warmth we have very high

1725
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:41,480
metabolism rates the soil is constantly

1726
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:43,920
metabolizing we've got tremendous

1727
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:47,158
amounts of microbiology that's

1728
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,840
tremendously metabolizing so the actual

1729
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:51,960
endophytic system of the plant is going

1730
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,000
to be at a much higher rate a much

1731
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:56,920
higher metabolism and those people

1732
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
understand and who are coming from the

1733
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,679
north where it isn't sunny all of the

1734
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,800
time that we have slower metabolism in

1735
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,279
our soil we have slower growth cycles

1736
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,400
and when we go to the warm weather our

1737
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:12,319
metabolism kicks up and a lot of people

1738
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:15,399
say hey I actually lost a lot of weight

1739
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:18,000
when I went to warmer weather well that

1740
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:19,279
reaction is your metabolism which is

1741
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,719
your

1742
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:24,599
microbiome so of course we're going to

1743
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:26,800
have higher secondary metabolites

1744
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,960
because when we go to warmer weather

1745
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,560
where it's warm year round and sunny

1746
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,239
year round we're going to have

1747
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:36,520
continuous metabolizing so I just wanted

1748
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:39,319
to add that damn nailed it that's

1749
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:42,360
awesome thank you Alex what was the

1750
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:45,960
highest T content that You' guys

1751
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:48,279
found um we we see in a very small

1752
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:50,480
percentage of the data for dried flour

1753
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:52,759
three to five and a half% is really kind

1754
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:56,039
of the the the range in that really

1755
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:58,239
unique subset of data you know again one

1756
01:12:56,039 --> 01:13:00,399
about one and a half percent is the

1757
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,000
average of every everything you tested

1758
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:04,198
you know three to five and a half

1759
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,158
percent is this in this other league we

1760
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:08,559
see in the data this like really high

1761
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:12,119
percentile of dried flower I'm pretty

1762
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:15,600
sure that uh the folks at Neo showed me

1763
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:17,000
something that was eight or 10 Jesus

1764
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,400
I've definitely had that conversation

1765
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,439
with Mark as well not I didn't see it

1766
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:25,359
but he was like yeah yeah 8 to 10 I was

1767
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:28,039
8 to 10 I I wouldn't want to concentrate

1768
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:33,279
that is that r or dried plant

1769
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:36,560
material dried plant material wow

1770
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:38,439
dried Ella a quick question for you and

1771
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:41,600
I'm happy to see you

1772
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:43,839
hey good to see you here um what about

1773
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,600
the difference in the turpine profiles

1774
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:51,880
of Trikes and

1775
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,880
rosin do you see much difference

1776
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:58,638
um I well I mean I I don't think

1777
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,760
I I'd be able to really speak to I mean

1778
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:02,719
because we see kind of um concentrates

1779
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,679
across you know not I haven't been able

1780
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,480
to see kind of the divide in kind of

1781
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:09,079
types you know because like a lot of

1782
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:10,839
people you know submit as just a name

1783
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:12,559
you know of the strain not kind of

1784
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,360
differentiating what type of kind of

1785
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:18,639
extraction it is um but okay we see it

1786
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:20,880
we see that at Embark because we get

1787
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:23,880
when we buy if we buy if we make flower

1788
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:26,319
rosin for instance we'll get a COA from

1789
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:30,760
the flower before we can bring it into

1790
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:30,759
our facility oh I

1791
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:37,198
froze an amount of heat for an amount of

1792
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:40,839
time there is going to be amount of

1793
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:43,158
alization that happens um you know but

1794
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:45,520
so each each step through kind of you

1795
01:14:43,158 --> 01:14:47,638
know the the process of whether you're

1796
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,280
doing solvent list or kind solvent you

1797
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:50,960
know there's all these things internally

1798
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:53,880
best practices that can be done to kind

1799
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,319
of just try to optimize or minimize

1800
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:58,159
optimize kind of preservation or

1801
01:14:55,319 --> 01:14:59,639
minimize kind of loss um but but yeah I

1802
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:01,479
would wouldn't know much more about that

1803
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:03,000
Marcus you had froze up if you you're

1804
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:04,959
back yeah I'm not sure if I'm going to

1805
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,560
end up freezing up again but at Embark

1806
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,399
we have to get coas for the flower then

1807
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,760
we make the bubble we have to get a COA

1808
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:13,238
for the bubble if we want to make the

1809
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:16,560
Rosen then we'll get a COA for the rosin

1810
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:18,519
so we have seen we've seen all sorts of

1811
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,880
different things from cultivars that

1812
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:23,040
change very little to cultivars that

1813
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,359
change a lot and that Tarpin that

1814
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:27,479
weren't there in the beginning are there

1815
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:31,000
in the end especially from like non

1816
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:35,359
rosin to rosin heating them up I guess

1817
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,399
changes them uh in in ways but um yeah

1818
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:39,679
nothing that's been shocking one thing I

1819
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,799
would say to that real quick where you

1820
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,800
were just mentioning Marcus and you know

1821
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:47,000
U I might have mentioned this before

1822
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,840
kind of on hash church but um you know

1823
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,079
from what we see you know kind of in the

1824
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,119
in the you know ranking of most present

1825
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:55,000
to least present and you know over 40

1826
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:57,719
tpin were we're actively testing for

1827
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,039
every time we do a test um you know

1828
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:05,119
really it's these five to six primary

1829
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:08,000
monot Turpin you know then there's a few

1830
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:11,359
sasquat turpins like beta carene and

1831
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,238
humulene um you know um you know some

1832
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:16,880
some of these other um type compounds um

1833
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:19,359
but but you know essentially what we see

1834
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,920
is you know in in the total potential of

1835
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:24,799
the plant whenever it's ripe or kind of

1836
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,560
not nothing's volatilized you know kind

1837
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:30,600
of it'll show in the rank order these

1838
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:33,039
monot Turpin eses Turpin you know on but

1839
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:35,480
but whenever all the primary monot

1840
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,920
Turpin boil off as well as the sesat

1841
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:39,399
Turpin boil off you know we see that you

1842
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,199
know there basically there's a a

1843
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:43,638
concentration of these really small

1844
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:45,279
present turpins that were there that are

1845
01:16:43,639 --> 01:16:47,199
all of a sudden the the primary things

1846
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:48,759
on the on the profile you know and

1847
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:53,439
they're the higher boiling point tpin

1848
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:56,000
that end in an O like neurol bolol guol

1849
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:58,000
phol you know and so these profile these

1850
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,880
turpins became become the profile

1851
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,960
whenever there's an absence of the

1852
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:05,279
primary compounds that are now

1853
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:09,079
gone TP noids right they're not tpes

1854
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:10,479
anymore sure sure yeah yeah yeah that

1855
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:12,439
yeah I appreciate that yeah they're like

1856
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:15,039
higher alcohol kind of based type

1857
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:17,519
compounds right or you know and so but

1858
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:19,679
but we we we deem this this artifact

1859
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,840
kind of tpine profile as the swag we

1860
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,199
call it the swag flag and the swag flag

1861
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,800
is essentially anytime that there's you

1862
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:30,919
know like about 75% total tpine content

1863
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,920
or less and all the mono incestual tpin

1864
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,480
are gone and the only tpin that remain

1865
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,760
in the profile like bis blol mol gu and

1866
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:42,638
phol that's pretty much the artifact

1867
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,639
swag and the hay smell from what we can

1868
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:50,158
gather swag that's wild dude that's wild

1869
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:52,000
that is absolutely is that what what

1870
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,599
you're testing due to the anerobic

1871
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,279
decomposition that's happening whatever

1872
01:17:54,600 --> 01:18:00,760
the cannabis is put in is right yeah

1873
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:02,880
it's it's the it's it's the artifact of

1874
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:05,239
uh Pro it's the artifact Turing profile

1875
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,400
that remains whenever you know the the

1876
01:18:05,238 --> 01:18:09,959
lacking uh kind of prep or the lacking

1877
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:12,559
quality and kind of how it was dried and

1878
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,719
cured stored kind of you know is you

1879
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,320
know it's it yeah it's what you know

1880
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:18,399
whenever it goes flat everything else is

1881
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:21,039
boiled off and volatilized kind of those

1882
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,559
kind of very repeatedly stay behind and

1883
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:25,519
now and how we kind of came across that

1884
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,320
is we had this outlier flag you know

1885
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,800
that you know anytime there was a unique

1886
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:30,799
turine profile that didn't kind

1887
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:37,399
of that we we see with really high

1888
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:39,839
accuracy and predictability it would get

1889
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:39,839
flagged

1890
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:45,039
for was going through all that data and

1891
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,000
was really fast going through all that

1892
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:47,760
data because I was like oh these are

1893
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,039
where all the really unique land race

1894
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,639
like super rare profiles are going to be

1895
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:53,679
and albe it though there was you know

1896
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:55,000
very unique rare amounts of profiles in

1897
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,679
there there was a very small amount the

1898
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,238
data and a vast majority of the data in

1899
01:18:56,679 --> 01:19:00,880
that outlying data set was this artifact

1900
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:02,919
of schwag and you just see it so

1901
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,239
repeatedly across thousands of samples

1902
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,359
you know you're like oh yeah that's for

1903
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:09,039
sure what that is you know so you you

1904
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:11,279
literally have a profile for a cannabis

1905
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:14,319
corpse yeah

1906
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:17,599
totally what not to

1907
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:20,319
do I if it's related but anecdotally I

1908
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,840
have a story where a friend of mine um

1909
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:25,880
resurrected some seeds that his parents

1910
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,119
took away from him like 30 years ago and

1911
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,239
he found them after his his dad had

1912
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:31,319
passed away because they were going

1913
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:34,119
through his stuff and he found this old

1914
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:36,439
bag of weed that his dad had took from

1915
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:38,960
like 30 years ago so he popped some of

1916
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:44,279
these beans and yeah it was actually a

1917
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:46,719
Panama Red uh variety and um this older

1918
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:50,039
cat uh that we hang out with who doesn't

1919
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,039
really like

1920
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:08,760
you know back in the 70s and 80s before

1921
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:12,559
Grateful Dead tour brought kind bud from

1922
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:14,520
NorCal across the country so um I think

1923
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,679
there is something to that to that

1924
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:21,600
profile that you were talking about Alec

1925
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:23,840
that that um uh uh what the mostly most

1926
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:26,400
of those compounds again are turine

1927
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,639
alcohols so so again maybe there was

1928
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:31,519
something about the Aging of that and

1929
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,719
maybe again about the way that you know

1930
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:36,760
cannabis back in the 70s and 80s were

1931
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:39,960
smuggled up from Mexico or wherever up

1932
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:44,199
into you know where we lived in in in

1933
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:46,239
Northeast and some way that flavor that

1934
01:20:44,198 --> 01:20:49,039
Essence that swag flag you're talking

1935
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:51,839
about took this guy right back to the

1936
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:56,158
60s oh man that's how we used to taste

1937
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,159
you know he loved it

1938
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,238
I don't miss the taste of dirt remember

1939
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,679
when all the Cannabis just actually

1940
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:06,359
tasted like dirt that was crazy or like

1941
01:21:02,679 --> 01:21:07,920
mold right yeah exactly with with hints

1942
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:10,719
of diesel

1943
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:17,239
fuel right because sometimes it packed

1944
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:19,960
in in cartons inside gas tanks right and

1945
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:21,959
parat yeah you know when talking when

1946
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,880
talking about these tarpine profiles

1947
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:26,719
that repeat over and over again that

1948
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:29,600
Alec was me I just wonder how much the

1949
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:31,960
impact of prohibition and the mentality

1950
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:35,239
of how much can I get and how fast can I

1951
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:37,880
get it bottlenecked us into these

1952
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:40,399
particular dominant tpin what do you

1953
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,560
guys have to think about that well I

1954
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:45,559
mean it's also been subjective of the

1955
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:48,199
farmer himself or herself because even

1956
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:50,760
Sam has stated time and time again how

1957
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:53,359
he selected certain phenotypes based on

1958
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:56,000
the flavor profiles that he liked

1959
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:58,238
specifically so there's also other types

1960
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,238
of genetics that were also lost due to

1961
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:03,119
our propagators who are actually

1962
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,959
perpetrating the genetics based on what

1963
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:07,760
they liked also based off of the growing

1964
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:10,198
environments that they were successful

1965
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,000
in they were so much more rare than the

1966
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:14,839
how much can I get and how fast can I

1967
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,840
get IT Crowd

1968
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:20,000
though also people were consuming large

1969
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:22,480
amounts you know if you think about the

1970
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,479
volume that they were smoking in a big

1971
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:28,919
giant cone or a big giant ball of hash

1972
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:30,279
so the turpine to cannaboid ratios were

1973
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,359
you know completely different than what

1974
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:34,079
you're getting in a joint right and

1975
01:22:32,359 --> 01:22:36,198
maybe that had to do with one of the

1976
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,559
reasons why they were kind of actively

1977
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:40,678
seeking to volatilize a lot of those

1978
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:43,239
monot turps was because they were going

1979
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:44,359
to get a a certain volume in there and

1980
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:47,158
then they're going to even higher

1981
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:48,679
because they had extra THC so it's I

1982
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:50,759
think it's a really interesting question

1983
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:53,079
and and why they selected those

1984
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:56,199
varieties for their own particular you

1985
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:58,238
know their own particular needs versus

1986
01:22:56,198 --> 01:23:01,879
why we select varieties for our the

1987
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:05,439
market um well if if you look at several

1988
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:08,960
hundred years ago Mojave they were

1989
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:11,638
selecting just by smoking and saving the

1990
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:14,319
seeds of the varieties that got them the

1991
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:17,560
highest or they like the effects or the

1992
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:20,198
taste or the smell of and uh they were

1993
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:23,560
incredibly successful actually if you

1994
01:23:20,198 --> 01:23:25,079
think about it all kinds of recreational

1995
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:28,880
varieties are really

1996
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:32,158
just THC only until the CBD craze

1997
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:35,359
started uh it was really common to find

1998
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:38,719
th only varieties especially in

1999
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:41,439
Equatorial tropical varieties it was was

2000
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:44,600
really extremely

2001
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:46,919
common you know it's it's fascinating to

2002
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:49,440
kind of you know think about the ancient

2003
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:52,079
practices and selection and how you know

2004
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:53,359
kind of how much I guess Brilliance of

2005
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:55,319
there there was kind of through the

2006
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:57,559
plant that was cultivated by the people

2007
01:23:55,319 --> 01:24:00,238
you know and then so much was lost in a

2008
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,760
lot of ways from the global kind of

2009
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:03,319
prohibition against this plant and

2010
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,119
persecution against this plant and kind

2011
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:07,920
of paraqua and kind of just uh you know

2012
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:09,960
I'm really curious on you know what that

2013
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,600
those eradication efforts did to you

2014
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:14,079
know the the Rarity kind of of of

2015
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,880
cannabis certain profiles that might

2016
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:17,880
have kind of been lost forever that you

2017
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,480
know could have potentially provided

2018
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,039
medicine for the future of you know

2019
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:23,119
needs that we don't even know we need

2020
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,760
yet you know and so it's really crazy to

2021
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:28,039
see how much that prohibition and kind

2022
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:32,440
of uh you know um to be honest Alex to

2023
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:34,238
be truly honest I think we've lost more

2024
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:38,238
by

2025
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:41,039
D types who think they're doing a favor

2026
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:46,198
by taking equatorial seeds to

2027
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:48,359
Afghanistan or Afghani SE genetics to uh

2028
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:52,359
tropical

2029
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:52,359
equator BAS

2030
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:09,319
although neither one of them canis any

2031
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:11,679
good right well I guess I guess it's

2032
01:25:09,319 --> 01:25:13,359
kind of like planting like eucalyptus

2033
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,920
and random areas and it becoming an

2034
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:16,079
invasive species kind of thing is that

2035
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:18,800
what you're saying it's tainting the

2036
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:23,519
gene pools of the

2037
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,520
unique now because under

2038
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:38,920
supposed to share it with the government

2039
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:41,880
there the the same government for the

2040
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:45,199
last 50 years is have been Prosecuting

2041
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:48,359
cannabis Growers and destroying cannabis

2042
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,519
so I mean what is the world I really

2043
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:51,639
don't know

2044
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,800
anymore and I think that that really

2045
01:25:51,639 --> 01:25:57,039
could be bringing in the conversation of

2046
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:59,560
like what's invasive and what's being

2047
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:02,840
traveled and what you know like there's

2048
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,840
certain areas and

2049
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:09,440
region species because a bird brought it

2050
01:26:06,279 --> 01:26:11,639
there and because the soil and the area

2051
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:14,238
and the environment were perfect and

2052
01:26:11,639 --> 01:26:17,118
because the nature called that

2053
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:18,959
particular plant to that area and Zone

2054
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:21,799
and it just so happens that a lot of the

2055
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,679
hippie types from the 60s and 70s that

2056
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:27,119
were trading the seeds were the ones

2057
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:29,520
that were in and humans have always

2058
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:32,799
traveled and we've always had

2059
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:35,800
relationships with seeds and especially

2060
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:38,600
especially with psychoactive plants so

2061
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:41,079
whenever something Sparks us then of

2062
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,079
course we want to share it it's part of

2063
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:45,679
our Collective Consciousness as human

2064
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:48,319
beings so I think it would be hard to

2065
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:50,600
say just the hippie types if we look at

2066
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:52,479
all of humanity because then we're

2067
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,400
looking at the cannabis plant having

2068
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:57,519
changed multiple times into multiple

2069
01:26:55,399 --> 01:27:00,238
different facets for multiple different

2070
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,320
reasons that are unbeknownst to us

2071
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:06,198
because it wasn't even scribed at that

2072
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:07,719
time so I think just to pick aside just

2073
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:10,839
one

2074
01:27:07,719 --> 01:27:13,679
particular generation of the plant

2075
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:18,000
really isn't giving the plant its full

2076
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:21,399
volume million years understanding of of

2077
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,880
its full potential I appreciate that I

2078
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:24,000
just real quick I just wanted to say I

2079
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,239
really appreciate that and I was gonna

2080
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,158
say God bless Terence M for bringing the

2081
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:32,879
iosa vine bopis CA to Hawaii and how

2082
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:34,920
much that uh that plant loves growing in

2083
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,560
that environment and how much it's now

2084
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:38,639
really helping in the kind of global

2085
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,360
kind of re replanting and kind of you

2086
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,760
know kind of and just the idea of

2087
01:27:40,359 --> 01:27:43,359
sustainably how we kind of are able to

2088
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,480
grow these plants you know without

2089
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:49,238
depleting you know um various regions of

2090
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:51,799
the world and the Amazon and um but just

2091
01:27:49,238 --> 01:27:54,879
uh from a biocultural conservational uh

2092
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,279
effort you know how you know be you know

2093
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,118
yeah I appreciate that perspective well

2094
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:00,399
I think you know we're stewards of the

2095
01:27:59,118 --> 01:28:03,079
plants you know helping the plants

2096
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:05,638
spread it's it's

2097
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:07,439
maybe sorry I say it's maybe not it's

2098
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:08,920
not the hippies it's what the other

2099
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:10,238
thing Sam mentioned it's the airplanes

2100
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,600
we can blame it on the

2101
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:16,519
airplanes airplanes right and also I'm

2102
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:20,440
not sure cannabis is 400 million years

2103
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:24,320
old I mean it may be it's possible but

2104
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:27,559
uh iors are scientific proof for that

2105
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:30,599
400 million year old age the endoc

2106
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:32,520
canabo system is older than the the

2107
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:36,000
endoc canabo system came before the

2108
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,760
cannabis plant right but another point I

2109
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,279
just wanted to make on on this whole

2110
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,159
hybridization is that um it's the

2111
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:45,000
Natural Evolution of organisms to want

2112
01:28:43,158 --> 01:28:47,679
to spread themselves and disperse

2113
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,760
themselves as far as they can to be as

2114
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:53,359
as as successful and but at the same

2115
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:56,239
time it's the isolation that creates

2116
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:58,759
diversity you know they had this right

2117
01:28:56,238 --> 01:29:02,079
and you want to try to preserve that

2118
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:04,800
diversity if possible exactly there's a

2119
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:07,519
really great movie or documentary and

2120
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:10,800
book called the um the Journey of man

2121
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,159
about 10 years ago or so and it was

2122
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,760
about collecting you know the the data

2123
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:17,000
on the human genome and the the point

2124
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,119
that was really interesting at the end

2125
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,639
of this documentary they they kind of

2126
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:23,118
you know they they went around the world

2127
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:27,079
and they found all these points where

2128
01:29:23,118 --> 01:29:31,799
where um human populations would diverge

2129
01:29:27,079 --> 01:29:34,319
and and and um come together and they

2130
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:36,199
they they literally found the story of

2131
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:37,599
how our genetics moved around the earth

2132
01:29:36,198 --> 01:29:40,000
right we now know that we know we came

2133
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:43,320
from Africa into Central Asia Europe

2134
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,479
blah blah blah in North America but they

2135
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:48,479
couldn't have gotten that

2136
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:51,000
data any later than when they did

2137
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:54,198
because all those populations had all

2138
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,439
Blended and there was no original

2139
01:29:54,198 --> 01:30:00,198
pockets of all these different um

2140
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:02,559
genes and and that's what happened with

2141
01:30:00,198 --> 01:30:03,960
cannabis you know we we spread out but

2142
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,840
then all of a sudden we spread out and

2143
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:10,118
we we isolated and became um unique but

2144
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:12,920
then we all Blended up again you know

2145
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:17,079
and it's kind of like the and you best

2146
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:19,840
examples of that is Mexico Jamaica and

2147
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:23,679
Morocco there are no land races left in

2148
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,360
those dogs right dogs we have we have

2149
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:28,520
all these muts in the world running

2150
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:30,559
around right right it's nice to have

2151
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,320
Afghans and

2152
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,440
Chihuahua yeah and it's important to

2153
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:37,639
think about for culture and for just uh

2154
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,399
you know diversity in our own biology

2155
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:41,880
how important it was for us to stay

2156
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:44,719
separate for so long before we started

2157
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:47,239
blending you know and the blending part

2158
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:49,079
is kind of inevitable because of the

2159
01:30:47,238 --> 01:30:51,118
airplanes and because of the way our

2160
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:53,399
culture is connected and stuff like that

2161
01:30:51,118 --> 01:30:56,559
but were we ever separate if we were

2162
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:56,559
supposedly all from

2163
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:08,600
Africa back together and now we're

2164
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:11,000
mixing again because Evolution needs it

2165
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,840
I think it doesn't work to be isolated

2166
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,920
that's the whole entire point of

2167
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:20,039
isolation like

2168
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:22,639
isolation is not life even in the case

2169
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:24,479
of well I mean you know cultures living

2170
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:26,400
in certain areas for thousands

2171
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:30,079
obviously that's successful and

2172
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:32,359
beautiful but then you know

2173
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:34,639
modernization happens people travel they

2174
01:31:32,359 --> 01:31:36,439
move the world changes so I think that

2175
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:39,359
you know bringing right now we're at a

2176
01:31:36,439 --> 01:31:42,359
point of you know needing biodiversity

2177
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,599
and cultural polyculture and you know I

2178
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:46,839
guarantee a bunch of the Afghanistan

2179
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:50,039
families that came over you know in this

2180
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:52,079
last flux probably have maybe some ganja

2181
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:54,359
seeds on them and you know what I

2182
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:57,238
wouldn't say we're mad about it

2183
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:59,158
I'm not sure that the Neanderthal people

2184
01:31:57,238 --> 01:32:02,279
would agree with

2185
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:04,799
you well I don't know you

2186
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:07,519
know I think that I think that the

2187
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,639
intuition here is that we are trying to

2188
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:14,840
explain something that a plant has been

2189
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:19,800
doing so we are trying to take this

2190
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:23,079
human idea of what is best for the plant

2191
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,520
through our own experiences of what is

2192
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:27,399
best for the plant

2193
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:30,840
and it's just very interesting of our

2194
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:33,920
explanations of Natural Science and what

2195
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:36,119
we think is best in our own relationship

2196
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:39,399
with this plant and that's really what

2197
01:32:36,118 --> 01:32:41,920
it comes down to because so many of us

2198
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:46,198
have these different relationships with

2199
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:49,399
the plant whether it be only science or

2200
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:53,158
whether it be only nature and it's like

2201
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:57,000
this human brain expansion that is us

2202
01:32:53,158 --> 01:33:00,839
trying to explain it in our language so

2203
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,639
that we can have a good experience with

2204
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:05,000
it so prop it so we can have a good

2205
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:06,480
experience with it and it's all just

2206
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,399
really interesting and I just wanted to

2207
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:10,879
say that all of it is so incredibly

2208
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:14,158
valid because our brain is like the

2209
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:16,000
filtration system of how it's all going

2210
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:19,960
to be spit out and how we're all going

2211
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,880
to understand this great microcosm of uh

2212
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:26,719
nature basically and how it interacts

2213
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:30,159
with us definitely in favor of saving

2214
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:33,439
biodiversity both in plants animals

2215
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:37,719
people I mean I I I can think of nothing

2216
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:39,599
more boring as us all being the same

2217
01:33:37,719 --> 01:33:42,639
there's even a song I think it goes

2218
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,520
wouldn't it be real drag if we were all

2219
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,039
the

2220
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:48,280
same dude now that's an episode where

2221
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:50,479
both skunkman Sam and I have

2222
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:52,479
sung you don't get that every hash

2223
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:56,198
church I also have one other thing to

2224
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:58,599
say um shout out to Terence McKenna I

2225
01:33:56,198 --> 01:34:00,439
heard Alec drop his name earlier I was

2226
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:03,280
in the other room cutting my kids some

2227
01:34:00,439 --> 01:34:05,279
apples and cucumbers but it was just uh

2228
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:07,519
terence's would have just been terence's

2229
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:11,359
75th birthday on November

2230
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:14,040
16th uh huge inspiration in my life you

2231
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:15,759
know like really set me off on a path

2232
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:17,960
and I always drop this whenever

2233
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,280
terrence's name gets brought up my

2234
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:23,520
all-time favorite lecture by him uh is

2235
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:25,639
called psilocybin in the sands of time

2236
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,639
uh I'll put it into the description link

2237
01:34:25,639 --> 01:34:32,440
so uh anyone that wants to go check that

2238
01:34:27,639 --> 01:34:33,960
out can it is uh a doozy oh I I was

2239
01:34:32,439 --> 01:34:36,079
hoping to get a screenshot of that

2240
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:37,760
picture you shared I I'll send it to you

2241
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:40,479
bro thank you that's really rad I

2242
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:43,079
appreciate that it I wanted say

2243
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:45,359
something to uh Sam you were saying that

2244
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:47,399
you know that we're all the same I think

2245
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,719
that it's pretty interesting just a

2246
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:51,479
little fact is that when you look at our

2247
01:34:49,719 --> 01:34:54,439
DNA we're like

2248
01:34:51,479 --> 01:34:56,399
99.9% all the same when you look at our

2249
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:59,519
microbiome we're

2250
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:01,679
99.9% different so I think as long as

2251
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,080
microbiology is going to be alive on the

2252
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:06,359
planet there's always going to be you

2253
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:10,319
know incredible amounts of

2254
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:13,960
divers I agree V love

2255
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:15,920
differance Viv differ hey if you all

2256

2257
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,880
light on the subject that is the passing

2258
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:22,719
of Antonio Scot I don't know if you all

2259
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,920
know who he is but he was one of my

2260
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:28,079
favorite drug researches he wrote the

2261
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:30,840
history of the the the general history

2262
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:32,679
of drugs he was a philosopher a Spanish

2263
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,719
philosopher and he just passed away I

2264
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:36,359
just read the news he was 80 so if you

2265
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,639
could all just like send some love to

2266
01:35:36,359 --> 01:35:40,519
him he was one of the people and when I

2267
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:43,239
read his book that I realized that I

2268
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:46,360
wanted to study drugs I'm not kidding so

2269
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:50,479
if you could just share some love to the

2270
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:53,719
guy he was one of the first well-known

2271
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:56,238
anti- prohibitionists that really spread

2272
01:35:53,719 --> 01:35:56,239
words about

2273
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:05,040
it all right thank you for

2274
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:08,479
that what was his name again Antonio

2275
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:10,920
escohotado he wrote a book on the 80s

2276
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:12,678
and 70s about the general history of

2277
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:15,520
drugs like I remember that I used a

2278
01:36:12,679 --> 01:36:18,079
bunch of my in my thesis and it's very

2279
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:20,800
nice like it's ve it's very nice to read

2280
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:23,079
it like it's a very good flow of on all

2281
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,159
the substances and definitely he did one

2282
01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:28,238
of the big Publications on anti-

2283
01:36:25,158 --> 01:36:30,799
prohibitionism so he was was a real

2284
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:34,000
fighter and he passed away with 80 today

2285
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:35,800
so we're very thankful for his existence

2286
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,279
I'm sure that without him a bunch of

2287
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:40,199
other people wouldn't have been fighting

2288
01:36:38,279 --> 01:36:43,759
against prohibitionism

2289
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:46,359
our our condolences as a collective to

2290
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:50,000

2302
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:20,799
inspired you it's just a great uh source

2303
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:25,520
of information for people and sorry

2304
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:25,520
whoever was about to go can speak now

2305
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:30,520
all good all good I was wondering what

2306
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:33,639
varietal uh you will be bringing down

2307
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:36,280
that you really liked this year uh Flynn

2308
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:37,679
and Alice to the legends of hash and

2309
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:40,158
also I was wondering what you thought

2310
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:42,440
about the five degree shelf temp on the

2311
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:46,118
freeze dryer and if you guys have gone

2312
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:46,118
for that or or you

2313
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:53,800
seen FN talk about the freeze

2314
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:55,480
Dryer no I I don't usually go that low

2315
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:57,639
on the freeze dryer I don't know I like

2316
01:37:55,479 --> 01:38:00,118
to keep my Cycles so that they're done

2317
01:37:57,639 --> 01:38:03,719
in like about 24 hours because usually

2318
01:38:00,118 --> 01:38:05,439
we got more trays to put in there and

2319
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:07,679
how much can you max out on a freeze

2320
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:09,198
dryer like that in 24 hours what will

2321
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,279
you pull out of the freeze dryer in

2322
01:38:09,198 --> 01:38:12,279
total

2323
01:38:10,279 --> 01:38:15,880
weight uh I mean it depends on the

2324
01:38:12,279 --> 01:38:17,599
freeze dryer like the XL Pharmaceuticals

2325
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:19,719
actually take a little bit longer than

2326
01:38:17,599 --> 01:38:23,279
24 hours sometimes they're a little bit

2327
01:38:19,719 --> 01:38:26,158
more like 30 but uh usually you can get

2328
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:28,198
like 8 to 1200 grams in there pretty

2329
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:29,920
well and get it all dry kind of depends

2330
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:31,319
on the strain though too if you're going

2331
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,960
to get it dry in that amount of time

2332
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:36,319
some things take a bit

2333
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:38,079
longer or if you don't load it perfectly

2334
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:40,238
and you get a little thickness in one

2335
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:42,039
corner because your trays aren't even on

2336
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:44,359
the thing or they're not level and then

2337
01:38:42,039 --> 01:38:46,920
it takes longer to all that type of

2338
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:49,839
stuff totally I always found I couldn't

2339
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,199
get much more than a kilo uh into those

2340
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:54,760
freeze dryers lab conco a little bit

2341
01:38:52,198 --> 01:38:57,079
more but lab conco is not really a

2342
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,920
freeze dryer you want to leave overnight

2343
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:01,559
because once it Cycles it dries much

2344
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:03,880
much faster than the other ones but it

2345
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:07,119
doesn't hold a cold temperature like uh

2346
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:08,800
Harvest RS and freeze dry Co and uh you

2347
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:10,679
know those other those other units it's

2348
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,199
an interesting game the freeze dryer

2349
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:14,000
game because I thought initially I

2350
01:39:12,198 --> 01:39:16,598
wanted big freeze dryers and then I

2351
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,319
realized no I want to be specific to

2352
01:39:16,599 --> 01:39:22,039
cultivars the regulations in Canada I

2353
01:39:19,319 --> 01:39:23,920
can't mix cultivars I could never wash

2354
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:26,639
two different things and put in the same

2355
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:29,118
freeze dryer so suddenly it became

2356
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:31,560
really not that valuable of having a

2357
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:34,479
giant mil Rock freeze dryer that I could

2358
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:36,520
fit 50 kilos of bubble into because I'm

2359
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:39,879
not going to be making 50 kilos of any

2360
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:42,239
one variety any anytime soon so it's

2361
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:44,520
kind of what I found at home we never

2362
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:46,319
ever feel the whole fridge I feel like

2363
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:49,239
it at least because what we wash in the

2364
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:52,399
house is different than like in a up up

2365
01:39:49,238 --> 01:39:53,839
in Humble when we watch like 15 to in a

2366
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:57,039
day we'll watch 40

2367
01:39:53,840 --> 01:40:01,480
kilos of wet material so that ends up

2368
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:04,719
being a hash on a you know three to 5%

2369
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:07,198
yield so yep yeah we do the same thing

2370
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:10,319
with I mean we're getting now into fresh

2371
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:12,319
frozen but the same equivalent amount of

2372
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:15,000
of cured and dried flour which would

2373
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:17,639
probably be you know eight or

2374
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,520
nine and Josh asked about the variety

2375
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:21,440
we're taking down I don't know I don't

2376
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:24,320
know if we can speak about it can we

2377
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:25,919
yeah I don't know I guess say so we can

2378
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:26,920
I mean I think we're okay okay that

2379
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,840
makes

2380
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:32,679
sense I'm not sure can we tell you one

2381
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,920
thing we're definitely not bringing

2382
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:38,480
rosin and anyone who does hey you're

2383
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,520
gonna hear from me I'll tell you

2384
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:42,479
that we make fun of it because it's

2385
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:44,080
Legends of Hesh right I'm like it's

2386
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:46,158
funny when people bring Ros into a

2387
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:47,800
Legends of hes it's better to well you

2388
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:50,598
know what we just have to create

2389
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:52,760
division no matter how good and anything

2390
01:40:50,599 --> 01:40:56,360
is we have to create division where

2391
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:58,520
human beings it's impossible not to do

2392
01:40:56,359 --> 01:41:00,158
and so if we didn't if we didn't build a

2393
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:02,159
fence and then look over and be like

2394
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:03,559
your grass is different than my grass we

2395
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:06,719
wouldn't be human

2396
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:07,639
beings that's true that's true it's all

2397
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:10,560
in good

2398
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:12,639
fun oh yeah trust me it's not it

2399
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,679
actually gets violent and insane and

2400
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:18,480
some people have made it their mission

2401
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:20,079
to make that a big deal like believe it

2402
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:22,359
or not there's there's some people that

2403
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:25,319
are absolutely not just in good fun

2404
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:28,880
they're actually up sat and and

2405
01:41:25,319 --> 01:41:31,799
borderline uh raging uh Karen Style no

2406

01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:44,319
can let you know that that particular

2411

to to it I'm just letting you know I I

2413
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:51,920
personally what I said to Addison when

2414
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:54,519
he was telling me about a couple of

2415
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,279
people who were quite upset about it uh

2416
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:58,760
because they you know people love to

2417
01:41:56,279 --> 01:42:00,880
think they know what Legends of hash is

2418
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:02,880
about but there's only two people in

2419
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,639
this room that actually founded the

2420
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,199
legends of hash dinner so there's really

2421
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:08,960
only two people that know what it's

2422
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:13,079
about and it can be about whatever we

2423
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:15,840
want it to be about because it's our

2424
01:42:13,079 --> 01:42:18,198
event and we'll miss you you won't be

2425
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,039
there well I'll be there on video only

2426
01:42:18,198 --> 01:42:25,519
and I'm hoping Sam's going to appear as

2427
01:42:20,039 --> 01:42:25,519
well well at least uh uh Sam I am

2428
01:42:25,599 --> 01:42:30,079
there yeah we're so sad that we're not

2429
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:32,879
going to be down to and I just wanted to

2430
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:35,039
say like because you know the the the

2431
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,000
word division was brought up and I felt

2432
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:38,880
like it was an opportunity to jump in

2433
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,118
and I feel like if we're going to be

2434
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,760
bringing uh you know the word cannabis

2435
01:42:42,118 --> 01:42:46,559
into this and we're going to be

2436
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:51,800
partaking in cannabis and you know we

2437
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:51,800
talk about poly culture and we talk

2438
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:10,639
with this plant Med medicine to evolve

2439
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:13,559
out of separatism to evolve out of this

2440
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:15,719
Division and diversity I I just think

2441
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,639
that we can be done with that and I

2442
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:22,679
think that no no not a reflection at all

2443
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:25,960
to what talked about just a just an idea

2444
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:29,118
that humanity is using division so much

2445
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:32,439
right now and I just felt like a good

2446
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:36,399
opportunity to come in and say that

2447
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:39,359
polyculture and inclusion with diversity

2448
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:43,719
is absolutely important on this planet

2449
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:45,880
and we see that in in beautiful farms

2450
01:43:43,719 --> 01:43:49,520
and we see that where plants just don't

2451
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:52,239
have any maladies or any sicknesses we

2452
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,920
see it where there's full health and

2453
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:56,799
balance and I feel like that's where all

2454
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:58,960
of humanity needs to head to and when we

2455
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:00,840
look at nature that's what's happening

2456
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,639
and I think that we can do away with

2457
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:07,960
that diversity and we can start division

2458
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:09,920
do away with the div division diversity

2459
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:12,679
sorry do away with the division and I I

2460
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:15,118
would just like to add like I we've seen

2461
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:17,359
natural people and herbalists and people

2462
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:20,399
that do herbal medicine that are really

2463
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:23,719
really healthy

2464
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:27,039
and you don't really get to be that

2465
01:44:23,719 --> 01:44:30,880
person and go in society in certain

2466
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:33,679
places right now I find that hard to

2467
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:36,679
understand but I give thanks for the

2468
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:39,079
journey yeah and we're just anyway just

2469
01:44:36,679 --> 01:44:41,279
let's let's let's let's come together

2470
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:43,039
people that's the next Evolution the

2471
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,399
plant has Evolution we talk about the

2472
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:47,238
plants Evolution all the time and we

2473
01:44:45,399 --> 01:44:49,559
need to talk about our human evolution

2474
01:44:47,238 --> 01:44:51,799
in this time as well love y'all very

2475
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:53,639
well put Kelly thank you and I certainly

2476
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:56,719
didn't mean any offense to Flynn or

2477
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:59,279
Alice I just uh that that joke does have

2478
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:01,560
more depth to it than most will know and

2479
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,118
I let I say that to people just so they

2480
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,520
can know that there are people kind of

2481
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:08,639
behind the scenes in anything and

2482
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:12,760
everything that just want to stir [ __ ]

2483
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:14,520
up and so yeah do with that as you will

2484
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:18,159
I'm uh going to enjoy a

2485
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:21,560
dab of some beautiful hash Rosen I hope

2486
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:24,238
that uh it's uh I hope that it'll be

2487
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:26,480
accepted here on hash Church even though

2488
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:29,158
it's not rosin you got to

2489
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:34,279
remember you got to remember that you

2490
01:45:29,158 --> 01:45:39,439
can make rosin out of both dry sift

2491
01:45:34,279 --> 01:45:42,719
hash or dry sift resin or water sifted

2492
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:45,678
resin and you can make rosin out of that

2493
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:49,279
so I guess we've got two categories dry

2494
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:52,639
sift rosin and water shift rosin and

2495
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:54,920
fresh frozen rosin and and fresh plant

2496
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:58,480
rosin you can just take it off and wish

2497
01:45:54,920 --> 01:46:01,359
it I thought he was you can make rosin

2498
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:03,899
out of hash but you can't make hash out

2499
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:06,759
of Ros

2500
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:11,319
[Laughter]

2501
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:13,520
oh Dr Mark with the mic drop nailed it

2502
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:15,000
well if Frenchie was here he would find

2503
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:20,400
a way for

2504
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,399
you uh very much in accent

2505
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:32,198
much love Kim much love Frenchie we miss

2506
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:34,839
you we miss you a lot indeed I was

2507
01:46:32,198 --> 01:46:36,638
actually um when we when you were all

2508
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:38,279
discussing the turps and I was asking if

2509
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,800
there was a difference between the

2510
01:46:38,279 --> 01:46:43,238
rousing the turs in rousing and the

2511
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:45,000
turps in hash I was thinking of what

2512
01:46:43,238 --> 01:46:47,439
Frenchie was always saying about press

2513
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,479
to activate and going back to the

2514
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:52,479
history of hash that everyone presses

2515
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:53,879
hash before they smoke like everyone

2516
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:56,759
just like making that little ball in

2517
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,679
their hand or creating calluses in their

2518
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:00,599
hand just like pressing the hash before

2519
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:02,880
smoke before putting it in a Chillum

2520
01:47:00,599 --> 01:47:05,560
before putting it in a pipe and US

2521
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:09,440
pressing Flags nowadays like before we

2522
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:12,239
dab so this culture was still lingers

2523
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:13,919
and I was wondering if you could test

2524
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:16,519
that like if you could just test the

2525
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:20,279
sample like the fresh sample and then

2526
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:21,960
after the hand press what is the brief

2527
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:24,198
change that that would happen I would

2528
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:28,319
love to know that like I I could tell

2529
01:47:24,198 --> 01:47:30,879
you this much that both uh and I'm

2530
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:36,039
speaking for Marcus but I think I'm

2531
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:36,039
speaking correctly both Marcus and I

2532
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:54,719
like can avonoid

2533
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:56,840
content and it increase the surface

2534
01:47:54,719 --> 01:48:01,039
vaporization

2535
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:04,159
area one thing I would add to um just uh

2536
01:48:01,039 --> 01:48:08,279
as a thought you know um something that

2537
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:11,158
we see in fresh plant material before

2538
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:13,039
it's gone through drying and curing um

2539
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:15,679
you there's actually some like there's

2540
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:18,359
almost like a very Trace signature of

2541
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:21,279
various residual solvents that are

2542
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:23,920
endogenously produced solvents that the

2543
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:27,158
plant kind of puts out um kind of things

2544
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:31,158
like even acetone at very Trace levels

2545
01:48:27,158 --> 01:48:34,039
but um you know I I you know we've we've

2546
01:48:31,158 --> 01:48:36,279
been um we've been we've been internally

2547
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:41,118
discussing kind creating kind of like a

2548
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:42,599
a live resin live Rin type um you know

2549
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:44,439
kind of uh you know you know

2550
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:47,480
certification type I not certification

2551
01:48:44,439 --> 01:48:47,479
just almost like stamp you

2552
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:53,559
[Music]

2553
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:56,599
know people are trying to you know I the

2554
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:57,599
whole the whole Market is is um yeah

2555
01:48:56,599 --> 01:48:59,119
there's just people that want to

2556
01:48:57,599 --> 01:49:01,440
authenticate basically whenever

2557
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:03,238
something's been live or fresh extracted

2558
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,559
from the plant and so we've been we've

2559
01:49:03,238 --> 01:49:06,799
been like looking at we're starting to

2560
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:09,440
kind of look at side by sides of um and

2561
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,400
and doing trials with various groups of

2562
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:14,238
um basically measuring kind of tpine

2563
01:49:11,399 --> 01:49:17,319
content and residual solvent content um

2564
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:20,919
across um various extraction and harvest

2565
01:49:17,319 --> 01:49:23,118
batches to measure um you know basically

2566
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:24,199
what kind of happens and and what what

2567
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,839
kind of certain things are being

2568
01:49:24,198 --> 01:49:29,000
expressed in live plant as opposed to

2569
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:30,520
once the drying process happens because

2570
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,719
even though in the drying process if you

2571
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:35,320
optimally do it you know you very much

2572
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:38,439
minimalize and lock in the total you

2573
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:40,079
know tarpine preservation or profile but

2574
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:42,559
there are these other things that you

2575
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:45,158
know seem to be happening like the these

2576
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:47,199
Trace solvent levels ball flies to go

2577
01:49:45,158 --> 01:49:49,719
away you know kind of in this drwing

2578
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:52,198
process and so you know trying to

2579
01:49:49,719 --> 01:49:55,198
understand more about that you know what

2580
01:49:52,198 --> 01:50:00,158
part of plant is actually producing is

2581
01:49:55,198 --> 01:50:02,319
it is it the uh the uh tricomes that are

2582
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:03,479
producing them or is it other parts of

2583
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:06,279
the

2584
01:50:03,479 --> 01:50:07,839
plant it's a really good question um but

2585
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:10,198
you know it does seem like uh you know

2586
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:13,199
kind of even human body kind of we we

2587
01:50:10,198 --> 01:50:15,118
you know I mean just a natural you know

2588
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:17,039
physiological process within the plant

2589
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:18,359
or process with human to kind of you

2590
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:19,960
know generating these various kind of

2591
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:23,759
Trace kind of

2592
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:27,520
solvents I'm not a scientist sorry

2593
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:30,560
malbergs work says that uh triome

2594
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:32,760
accumulation is after it's synthesized

2595
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:35,520
in the in the triome itself so he kind

2596
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:37,960
of broke down where the cells are that

2597
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:40,199
the the tpes are made where the cells

2598
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:42,198
are that the phenols are made and how

2599
01:50:40,198 --> 01:50:44,158
they come together in the cannaboid

2600
01:50:42,198 --> 01:50:48,000
biosynthetic pathways I think most of

2601
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:48,000
that is actually pretty well worked

2602
01:50:48,439 --> 01:50:54,638
out as as far as I know that's true it

2603
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:57,400
was Kim and malberg who did that work

2604
01:50:54,639 --> 01:51:00,520
yep yeah Professor Kim that's right

2605
01:50:57,399 --> 01:51:02,238
that's right and I think Markus re or

2606
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:03,760
mentioned an interesting little

2607
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:06,638
structure in there these things called

2608
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:09,840
vacul which are basically little storage

2609
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:13,118
vesicles within the cell that uh that

2610
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:16,319
migrate to the surface of the triome are

2611
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:19,439
are Plastics and vacols both not

2612
01:51:16,319 --> 01:51:21,000
organel uh no I believe they are yeah

2613
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:23,279
that's what I thought so one produces

2614
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,520
phenols one produces the hydrocarbons

2615
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:28,359
the Tarpin these are the building blocks

2616
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:30,360
for cannaboid

2617
01:51:28,359 --> 01:51:33,759
production right well it's again the

2618
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:36,719
isoprenoid pathway is endogenous in most

2619
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,719
plants it's it's how the plant builds

2620
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:41,359
cell walls there's so many different

2621
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:44,078
other structures that it uses it just

2622
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:46,319
you know it's it's an economy of carbon

2623
01:51:44,078 --> 01:51:49,000
that you know the plant has figured out

2624
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:51,599
over the time course of evolution how to

2625
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:56,599
make exactly all the structures that it

2626
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:58,800
needs to survive thve tank J for that Al

2627
01:51:56,599 --> 01:52:02,560
in terms like cure going from hash to

2628
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:04,599
rosin to to cured Rosen you know I would

2629
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:08,000
I would say that there's a there's a

2630
01:52:04,599 --> 01:52:10,000
distinct difference from one another

2631
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,800
however they resemble one another at the

2632
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,279
same time and it's not only in texture

2633
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,159
but also the chemical properties that

2634
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:18,679
are present because of the curing that's

2635
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:20,638
happening and whatever path you choose

2636
01:52:18,679 --> 01:52:23,359
on that curing process whether you you

2637
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,319
choose to add heat or not will also

2638
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:30,000
contribute to those things so I think

2639
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:31,559
there is Nuance however like art it's uh

2640
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,399
you know these these mediums are are

2641
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:36,239
very similar to one another they just

2642
01:52:33,399 --> 01:52:38,198
it's on how you approach it awesome I

2643
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:40,718
want to say this about pressing hash in

2644
01:52:38,198 --> 01:52:42,238
your hand it's so fun you guys to have a

2645
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:44,039
little bit of hash and to be able to

2646
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:46,638
press it in a ball and squeeze it and

2647
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:49,279
feel it and smell it I think that that

2648
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:51,159
Joy of doing that gets me more high when

2649
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:53,399
I smoke it you know what I mean I become

2650
01:52:51,158 --> 01:52:55,920
intimate with my product and I start to

2651
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:57,679
really get excited so I think I yeah I

2652
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:59,000
think I just surf off that so maybe

2653
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:01,560
that's why people do it because we like

2654
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,760
it it's fun I'm more like did you wash

2655
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:04,760
your hands did

2656
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:24,679
you endoc canabo system that when we

2657
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:27,078
chew our food the saliva is the very

2658
01:53:24,679 --> 01:53:30,480
first parts of absorbing it and when

2659
01:53:27,078 --> 01:53:33,238
we're working with our our herb and

2660
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:37,118
we're touching it and we're putting our

2661
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:39,399
DNA into it and maybe we're softening it

2662
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:42,158
not even only intentions you know who

2663
01:53:39,399 --> 01:53:45,118
knows what science will do but of course

2664
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:48,319
it's the first part of

2665
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:52,319
metabolizing that particular plant and

2666
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:52,319
that the that

2667
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:09,719
gonna like devote a couple of big trees

2668
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:12,799
to just Charing all

2669
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:14,639
day he like you know it's a lot of work

2670
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:18,760
and we were talking about for a while

2671
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:21,920
and just you know really cherishing

2672
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:24,400
that that hash and that resin that you

2673
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:26,158
get after so you know in your you know

2674
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:27,638
Endeavor there's a lot of really special

2675
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:29,238
things you can do to keep the Cannabis

2676
01:54:27,639 --> 01:54:33,760
medicine sacred for you in your

2677
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:36,959
community I will say this about that um

2678
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:38,960
hashtag never touched I'll never forget

2679
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:41,399
being at a Legends of hash dinner and

2680
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,198
this guy before the dinner came up to my

2681
01:54:41,399 --> 01:54:46,359
booth and showed me this beautiful piece

2682
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:47,799
of like glistening caramel I was just

2683
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:51,279
like oh my God it looked like full melt

2684
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:53,400
he had hand rubbed it right so he I'm

2685
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:54,920
like dude with that you get in you get

2686
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:56,598
to buy a ticket so he ended up at

2687
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:58,520
Legends I never knew this guy he was a

2688
01:54:56,599 --> 01:55:00,199
total random stranger I met and just was

2689
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:02,159
like this guy needs to be at Legends he

2690
01:55:00,198 --> 01:55:04,839
hand rubbed like 10 grams of [ __ ]

2691
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:07,920
hash so we go to Legends I'm sitting

2692
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:10,239
with Todd McCormick and his buddy amelo

2693
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:13,359
who owns the Trippy Stick company the

2694
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:14,919
vaporizer company so these guys are like

2695
01:55:13,359 --> 01:55:16,598
they meet him right away because he sits

2696
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:19,118
at our table he doesn't know anyone else

2697
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:20,639
there except me and he's like hey guys

2698
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:22,639
try some of this and so they put a

2699
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:25,719
little bit in their Trippy Stick and and

2700
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:27,359
I also tasted it and I have to admit

2701
01:55:25,719 --> 01:55:30,399
like I don't know if he was warm and

2702
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:32,679
sweaty but it tasted like feet like it

2703
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:35,879
was the we laugh about it to this day

2704
01:55:32,679 --> 01:55:37,800
like it was so bad I was just like oh my

2705
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:39,840
God like you probably might have been

2706
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:41,920
there and you you if not you definitely

2707
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:44,639
have heard this story but well I've I've

2708
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:47,920
heard the story of it tasting like

2709
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:49,679
absolute human dude trust me and I am

2710
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,520
not like making this up I was like

2711
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:55,000
stoked for the guy the hash looked

2712
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:57,400
beautiful it was completely void of any

2713
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:02,078
plant matter contaminant but I'm telling

2714
01:55:57,399 --> 01:56:05,118
you this was not a turpine profile like

2715
01:56:02,078 --> 01:56:08,599
this was this was some human interaction

2716
01:56:05,118 --> 01:56:12,158
low in tpin but it was low in THC yeah

2717
01:56:08,599 --> 01:56:12,159
but it was high in uh

2718
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:21,198
bo well I'd like to take my and my ke

2719
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:22,800
together and smoke them together so I

2720
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:27,118
kind of like why not

2721
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:29,360
both you know what I I can appreciate

2722
01:56:27,118 --> 01:56:31,078
Debbie's making the hash I used to love

2723
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:33,399
playing with hash and you know that's a

2724
01:56:31,078 --> 01:56:36,118
great way to sort of put nervous energy

2725
01:56:33,399 --> 01:56:38,359
into just rolling up a piece of hash but

2726
01:56:36,118 --> 01:56:41,479
I'll tell you that guy at that Legends

2727
01:56:38,359 --> 01:56:44,799
ruined it for me now I'm just like o

2728
01:56:41,479 --> 01:56:46,479
don't touch the hash like hashtag never

2729
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:49,239
touch don't touch it oh can I touch that

2730
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:51,519
no you can't touch the hash that's just

2731
01:56:49,238 --> 01:56:54,479
me I appreciate what Jos and Kelly were

2732
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:58,599
saying too I I don't know when you were

2733
01:56:54,479 --> 01:57:00,959
in India Marcus if the Indian police

2734
01:56:58,599 --> 01:57:03,360
were checking we were up in the

2735
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:06,359
Himalayas and they were checking the

2736
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:09,319
sadu hands to see if they had hash

2737
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:12,039
calluses on them if you've been rubbing

2738
01:57:09,319 --> 01:57:14,559
hash and you had a horseshoe shaped

2739
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:18,198
callus on both your hands then they

2740
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:20,760
would uh uh hassle you and maybe

2741
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:24,678
threaten to arrest you or you know

2742
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:26,480
brutal use the well and I had one for I

2743
01:57:24,679 --> 01:57:29,199
don't know six

2744
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:31,000
months growing up in rural Louisiana

2745
01:57:29,198 --> 01:57:32,919
when I was a kid we' get pulled over by

2746
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:35,198
the cops and they would ask to smell our

2747
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:36,960
fingers I didn't know why because I

2748
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:39,078
didn't smoke pot because it was all

2749
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,800
joints back in the day turns out they

2750
01:57:39,078 --> 01:57:42,439
were smelling our fingers to smell if we

2751
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,360
were out in the cane field smoking

2752
01:57:42,439 --> 01:57:48,000
joints

2753
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:51,359
damn guys living under and

2754
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,679
big to not love well two things about

2755
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:55,479
India I mean they repealed the farm bill

2756
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:57,679
in India which is really huge the

2757
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:59,759
farmers have been fighting for their

2758
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,880
rights as farmers and food producers in

2759
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,880
India for well over a year now and it's

2760
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:06,239
it's a

2761
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:08,599
phenomenal um movement of hu of human

2762
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:11,238
power to and vanana Shiva and all the

2763
01:58:08,599 --> 01:58:13,760
work that that's gone into you know

2764
01:58:11,238 --> 01:58:15,598
small farmers producing better quality

2765
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:17,199
stuff at a at a larger rate you know

2766
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:19,279
there's a lot of really good teachings

2767
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:21,519
in there um so that's really important

2768
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:23,158
but also on the Cannabis front in India

2769
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:25,960
it's really bad right now and they're

2770
01:58:23,158 --> 01:58:29,000
just mowing down Fields all over India

2771
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:31,399
right now and trapping people and um the

2772
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,439
the laws are really really bad in India

2773
01:58:31,399 --> 01:58:34,960
and we're we're goingon to have a

2774
01:58:32,439 --> 01:58:36,439
conversation with hemp FTI um later on

2775
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:38,840
tonight or in the next couple days she

2776
01:58:36,439 --> 01:58:41,238
lives in Milana she's been in Milana for

2777
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:43,760
the last two years uh beautiful woman

2778
01:58:41,238 --> 01:58:45,399
you know doing incredible work and uh

2779
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:47,440
you know she's just been really wanting

2780
01:58:45,399 --> 01:58:49,879
to get people's attention on to you know

2781
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:52,118
what's happening in India is pretty

2782
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:54,480
severe on the Cannabis front right now

2783
01:58:52,118 --> 01:58:56,118
so everyone heads up if there's anything

2784
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:58,399
you can do out there you know to make

2785
01:58:56,118 --> 01:59:00,880
some change or someone you know in the

2786
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:02,319
realm you know it's it's an important

2787
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:04,078
thing right now because we're talking

2788
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:06,279
about Origins and we're talking about

2789
01:59:04,078 --> 01:59:08,519
respecting your elders and and cultures

2790
01:59:06,279 --> 01:59:11,238
of where it came from and now some of

2791
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:13,760
those places are Under Fire and they're

2792
01:59:11,238 --> 01:59:15,959
just taking brush Cutters and just

2793
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:19,719
mowing down giant fields and stuff and

2794
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:19,719
it's pretty hardcore

2795
01:59:20,439 --> 01:59:24,799
so sorry there they're targeting Indian

2796
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:26,359
uh celebrities too I see that they're

2797
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,880
taking down all these people at the high

2798
01:59:26,359 --> 01:59:29,598
levels to just scare the crap out of

2799
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:30,920
everyone in India it makes no sense when

2800
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:33,599
the rest of the globe is moving in

2801
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:35,440
another Direction yet here one of our

2802
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,920
places of origin for the cannabis plant

2803
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:39,799
is behaving like that it's

2804
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:42,599
anti-scientific anical as far as I'm

2805
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:43,840
concerned and Germany this week let mean

2806
01:59:42,599 --> 01:59:45,719
look at Germany Germany's going to

2807
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:49,159
legalize cannabis which is a huge

2808
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:51,920
signifier for the EU uh but at the same

2809
01:59:49,158 --> 01:59:53,598
time going back to what uh Michael crowz

2810
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:55,679
and and a group I'm working with that

2811
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:58,279
the United Nations are doing I mean we

2812
01:59:55,679 --> 02:00:00,760
already uh got uh cannabis removed from

2813
01:59:58,279 --> 02:00:03,198
schedule 4 so actually medical cannabis

2814
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:06,400
is legal and Indians could be fighting

2815
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:09,638
at the UN regarding International uh

2816
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:10,719
specifically and medical cannabis groups

2817
02:00:09,639 --> 02:00:13,560
in

2818
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:16,319
India and we will also be back in Vienna

2819
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:17,639
in March uh working on drug policy as

2820
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:19,479
well we're going to have a group of us

2821
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:22,199
in New York and a group of us in Vienna

2822
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:23,638
so we're working on

2823
02:00:22,198 --> 02:00:25,839
that other country that we hear about in

2824
02:00:23,639 --> 02:00:29,239
the news a lot these days China do you

2825
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:32,480
know what China's policy is towards

2826
02:00:29,238 --> 02:00:35,919
cannabis not friendly don't get don't

2827
02:00:32,479 --> 02:00:38,519
get caught with it yeah they they got in

2828
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:41,239
touch with Canada's government and said

2829
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:44,040
we don't want our citizens using medical

2830
02:00:41,238 --> 02:00:46,439
marijuana using recreational marijuana

2831
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:50,479
like made a statement government to

2832
02:00:46,439 --> 02:00:52,359
government about Chinese kids okay for

2833
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:55,359
the synthetic Labs over there there to

2834
02:00:52,359 --> 02:00:58,000
basically be making fentel and dumping

2835
02:00:55,359 --> 02:01:00,359
it in Mexico where it basically comes

2836
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:03,479
through the border and ends up in in

2837
02:01:00,359 --> 02:01:05,000
basic well yeah it it there's a lot of

2838
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:07,198
things that don't make sense like when

2839
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,039
we were had that Chinese or the Japanese

2840
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:12,000
fella there who was looking at what like

2841
02:01:10,039 --> 02:01:15,078
30 years for smoking a joint or

2842
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:17,560
something like that makes no sense at

2843
02:01:15,078 --> 02:01:19,679
all when you consider all of the

2844
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:22,280
business the picks and shovels

2845
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:25,639
businesses that are in China and that

2846
02:01:22,279 --> 02:01:28,000
are in Japan that are greatly benefiting

2847
02:01:25,639 --> 02:01:29,279
from what's happening with can cannabis

2848
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,599
across the

2849
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:34,279
globe 30 years for a joint it's a good

2850
02:01:32,599 --> 02:01:36,880
thing he wasn't smoken a bong they would

2851
02:01:34,279 --> 02:01:36,880
have given him

2852
02:01:37,118 --> 02:01:42,759
50 and and

2853
02:01:39,238 --> 02:01:46,279
it's in Singapore just got two I think a

2854
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:48,880
a death penalty for two pounds of weed

2855
02:01:46,279 --> 02:01:52,118
just just

2856
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:54,199
recently that's fascinating that China

2857
02:01:52,118 --> 02:01:55,319
right don't you think that I think

2858
02:01:54,198 --> 02:01:56,960
that's really fascinating that China

2859
02:01:55,319 --> 02:01:59,238
took that approach as as such a like

2860
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:01,599
autocratic in control kind of you know

2861
02:01:59,238 --> 02:02:03,799
the I mean because cannabis and I would

2862
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:06,400
imagine all the other psychoactive

2863
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:08,400
entheogenic plants and plant medicines

2864
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:12,078
of the of you know around the world are

2865
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:15,000
so subversive to their narrative

2866
02:02:12,078 --> 02:02:18,078
and see how

2867
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,399
much in an autocracy they need to

2868
02:02:18,078 --> 02:02:22,679
control the way people think and if

2869
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:25,198
people can basically grow own medicine

2870
02:02:22,679 --> 02:02:28,239
and think for themselves and autocracy

2871
02:02:25,198 --> 02:02:29,719
can't exist so it does get political but

2872
02:02:28,238 --> 02:02:31,919
what makes you like when you're just

2873
02:02:29,719 --> 02:02:33,399
kind of looking at the world cannabis

2874
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:34,760
economy right you're looking at the

2875
02:02:33,399 --> 02:02:36,319
world cannabis economy you're like I

2876
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:38,119
need to make a bit of money what makes

2877
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:40,359
you think like you know what I'm going

2878
02:02:38,118 --> 02:02:42,960
for Singapore it's the biggest bang for

2879
02:02:40,359 --> 02:02:44,960
my buck it's like no listen just not

2880

wouldn't even go renew my Visa there

2885
02:02:57,158 --> 02:03:00,039
when I was in Thailand people were like

2886
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:01,719
we're all going down to Singapore to

2887

or 30 years so I never fcking Mar the

2894
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:22,118
whole world is changing who knows before

2895
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,760
long even Malaysia might be growing

2896
02:03:22,118 --> 02:03:26,078
marijuana for people as medicine

2897
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:29,199
anything's

2898
02:03:26,078 --> 02:03:32,078
possible at at the at the MJ biscon in

2899
02:03:29,198 --> 02:03:35,439
Vegas a couple weeks ago I did meet a

2900
02:03:32,078 --> 02:03:38,639
couple uh folks from mainland China who

2901
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:41,519
are mostly over looking at uh CBD and

2902
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:44,239
CBD type products but they were

2903
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:47,320
absolutely floored I don't think they

2904
02:03:44,238 --> 02:03:50,399
expected to see the level of THC

2905
02:03:47,319 --> 02:03:52,759
products that there are available and so

2906
02:03:50,399 --> 02:03:55,399
these guys I I think think if I had them

2907
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:58,360
characterized right they own a bunch of

2908
02:03:55,399 --> 02:04:00,598
bodegas in in New York City the New York

2909
02:03:58,359 --> 02:04:03,158
City area I think mostly like queens and

2910
02:04:00,599 --> 02:04:07,119
Brooklyn and these bodegas are basically

2911
02:04:03,158 --> 02:04:11,439
you know small little uh you know uh

2912
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:13,118
shops to get sandwiches you know sodas

2913
02:04:11,439 --> 02:04:15,039
you know bags of chips and stuff like

2914
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:17,078
that but they sell everything they sell

2915
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:18,840
newspapers they sell all kinds of stuff

2916
02:04:17,078 --> 02:04:22,078
and so now they want to basically start

2917
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:25,319
selling CBD but they were totally Adam

2918
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:28,920
it like it's been put into their head

2919
02:04:25,319 --> 02:04:31,118
that you know any THC associated with

2920
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:32,760
these products is totally bad and I

2921
02:04:31,118 --> 02:04:34,719
think it's because of their culture and

2922
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:37,400
it's because of where they come from but

2923
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:40,439
I think now they recognize the financial

2924
02:04:37,399 --> 02:04:42,078
opportunity that exists and now they're

2925
02:04:40,439 --> 02:04:45,319
probably going to go back to their folks

2926
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:48,920
and say hey man we can make CBD and or

2927
02:04:45,319 --> 02:04:52,359
sell CBD products but ultimately people

2928
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:54,440
see let's you know people want

2929
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:58,519
and so they were really interested in

2930
02:04:54,439 --> 02:05:02,279
hhc and Delta 8 and all these other you

2931
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:04,480
know non THC canabo but as soon as you

2932
02:05:02,279 --> 02:05:06,679
mention THC it's like oh put the brakes

2933
02:05:04,479 --> 02:05:08,919
on that we're not into can't no no no no

2934
02:05:06,679 --> 02:05:12,039
can't do that no full spectrum anything

2935
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:13,319
only these other things so well that's

2936
02:05:12,039 --> 02:05:15,479
that's what's so magical about this

2937
02:05:13,319 --> 02:05:17,920
plant too it's so subversive just by its

2938
02:05:15,479 --> 02:05:20,000
nature you know and and so are luring

2939
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:22,319
for all these ways that you know all you

2940
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,559
know are you know ultimately kind

2941
02:05:22,319 --> 02:05:26,118
persuade one one group or another but

2942
02:05:24,559 --> 02:05:27,719
you know I think like whenever it really

2943
02:05:26,118 --> 02:05:29,279
comes to so much of the potential of

2944
02:05:27,719 --> 02:05:31,480
this plant the greatness really comes in

2945
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:34,439
the phyto remediation that this plant

2946
02:05:31,479 --> 02:05:36,598
can do and and and and potentiate and

2947
02:05:34,439 --> 02:05:38,598
accelerate and and I think as a

2948
02:05:36,599 --> 02:05:41,039
strategic National resource and

2949
02:05:38,599 --> 02:05:43,078
strategic Global Resource as you know as

2950
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:44,840
this you know just information comes

2951
02:05:43,078 --> 02:05:47,118
more and more I mean just the you know

2952
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:49,960
the necessity that every country you

2953
02:05:47,118 --> 02:05:51,399
know for their own sustainability has to

2954
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:54,039
kind of clean up and you know restore

2955
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:56,158
their soil is you know I mean you know

2956
02:05:54,039 --> 02:05:59,078
ultimately hemp's going to

2957
02:05:56,158 --> 02:06:01,879
win and hopefully help subvert the whole

2958
02:05:59,078 --> 02:06:04,719
kind of brainwash out there free a free

2959
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:07,118
enterprise itself these are Chinese

2960
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:09,198
businessmen they just want to make money

2961
02:06:07,118 --> 02:06:11,920
that's all they care about is return on

2962
02:06:09,198 --> 02:06:13,439
investment return on and so I think in

2963
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:15,880
their mind they're re-educating

2964
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:18,799
themselves based on what they see in the

2965
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:22,039
US market they have people walking into

2966
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:25,360
those stores asking for Delta a products

2967
02:06:22,039 --> 02:06:27,319
asking for CBD products so all they know

2968
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:29,279
is that there's a market we better go to

2969
02:06:27,319 --> 02:06:31,078
this trade show line up some supply

2970
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:34,359
chain agreement start getting those

2971
02:06:31,078 --> 02:06:37,319
products into our 150 bodegas that we

2972
02:06:34,359 --> 02:06:39,279
have in around the New York City area

2973
02:06:37,319 --> 02:06:41,759
because this is just going to be like

2974
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:43,599
this isn't going away right and the

2975
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:45,119
interesting thing again is that if you

2976
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:47,880
look at what's happening with some of

2977
02:06:45,118 --> 02:06:50,839
the minor cannaboids it's really it's

2978
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:54,520
taking a different route in every state

2979
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:57,719
because some states are outright Banning

2980
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:59,239
you know Delta 8 and and and banning hhc

2981
02:06:57,719 --> 02:07:01,840
and all these other things that you can

2982
02:06:59,238 --> 02:07:04,598
make but other states are are choosing

2983
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,760
to regulate those underneath their Delta

2984
02:07:04,599 --> 02:07:08,279
n licenses and so it'll be interesting

2985
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:10,079
to see how that shakes out because it's

2986
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:12,679
almost like there's a different program

2987
02:07:10,078 --> 02:07:15,880
a different regulatory structure in in

2988
02:07:12,679 --> 02:07:18,840
every state hey Dr Mark um since you

2989
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:20,840
know so we we hung out at mjbiz and I I

2990
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:23,599
wanted to ask you because I knew that

2991
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:25,039
that the Del to8 was going to come down

2992
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:27,039
in the federal ruling and they were

2993
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:28,719
going to start to allow this and we we

2994
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:30,760
both kind of share the same ideology it

2995
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:34,439
seems that it's extremely dangerous to

2996
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:38,320
do things like that um how do you

2997
02:07:34,439 --> 02:07:41,039
feel that ruling affects where you know

2998
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:44,000
the hemp industry is at today allowing

2999
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:46,479
Delta a to be now now in the the supply

3000
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,198
chain well first of all it's only made

3001
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:50,399
possible through the Ridiculousness of

3002
02:07:48,198 --> 02:07:52,238
prohibition itself right so if Delta 9

3003
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:54,759
wasn't prohibited there would be no

3004
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:57,158
market for Delta eight y Delta eight is

3005
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:58,159
just because well okay people want to

3006
02:07:57,158 --> 02:08:01,078
get

3007
02:07:58,158 --> 02:08:02,839
high CBD but these people could

3008
02:08:01,078 --> 02:08:04,679
basically make CBD like there's no

3009
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:07,559
tomorrow finding out that there's no

3010
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:09,920
market for it they convert it now to THC

3011
02:08:07,559 --> 02:08:12,000
in this case Delta 8 and now you can get

3012
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:13,760
people high here's an interesting Trend

3013
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,840
you're starting to see people making

3014
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:20,599
Delta 9 from hemp and they think it's

3015
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:22,520
legal but in in in my mind and again

3016
02:08:20,599 --> 02:08:25,199
maybe not just my mind but I think the

3017
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:29,040
way the the law works is that you know

3018
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:31,439
the exclusion of THC in the uh

3019
02:08:29,039 --> 02:08:34,399
controlled dangerous substance act has

3020
02:08:31,439 --> 02:08:37,479
tetrahydro canabidol including Delta 8

3021
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:39,839
including dronabinol including Delta 9

3022
02:08:37,479 --> 02:08:43,439
they're all categorized under code

3023
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:46,039
7370 and while I don't agree with first

3024
02:08:43,439 --> 02:08:47,960
or schedule one listing of of THC

3025
02:08:46,039 --> 02:08:49,960
because it's not dangerous so it doesn't

3026
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:51,840
need to be controlled that's where the

3027
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:54,118
government has it like it or not and

3028
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:58,078
until they move it out of there you need

3029
02:08:54,118 --> 02:09:01,000
a THC license to sell these products

3030
02:08:58,078 --> 02:09:03,639
legally now the the conundrum is is that

3031
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,559
they're all being made from hemp derived

3032
02:09:03,639 --> 02:09:09,118
starting material so you have hemp

3033
02:09:05,559 --> 02:09:11,920
processors largely operating in an

3034
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:15,759
unregulated environment with no

3035
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:19,039
regulatory oversight whatsoever in the

3036
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:21,599
most cannabis unfriendly States like

3037
02:09:19,039 --> 02:09:23,679
Tennessee and Alabama and Mississippi

3038
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:26,239
but even in cannabis friendly States in

3039
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:28,599
Colorado for example there are a lot of

3040
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:30,718
hemp processors now who are making these

3041
02:09:28,599 --> 02:09:35,480
other can avonoids because there's a

3042
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:35,480
market for but a lot of that market

3043
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:54,239
again I don't think it was ever the

3044
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:57,639
attention of Congress when they passed

3045
02:09:54,238 --> 02:09:59,718
the farm bill to enable the production

3046
02:09:57,639 --> 02:10:02,359
of a psychoactive substance that's why

3047
02:09:59,719 --> 02:10:04,920
they put the whole thing about THC it

3048
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:07,359
had to be 3% I don't think the

3049
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:10,078
intellectual furnaces were burning hot

3050
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:11,960
enough to understand that mulam and

3051
02:10:10,078 --> 02:10:14,319
Adams and all these other people well

3052
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:17,000
they figured out you could convert CBT

3053
02:10:14,319 --> 02:10:18,840
to THC we knew that because we knew the

3054
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:21,399
literature and I was like well this is

3055
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:24,520
just waiting to happen I started seeing

3056
02:10:21,399 --> 02:10:26,960
then hhc and everybody started bringing

3057
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:29,960
my phone off the hook saying hey aren't

3058
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:32,639
you the guy that patented hydrogenation

3059
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:34,599
how could these guys be hydr you know

3060
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:36,480
how so what they were doing is they're

3061
02:10:34,599 --> 02:10:39,760
now converting their Delta 8 which again

3062
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:41,439
remember is code 7370 on control

3063
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:44,199
dangerous substance it says you need a

3064
02:10:41,439 --> 02:10:46,879
license the license of those those

3065
02:10:44,198 --> 02:10:51,879
businesses is all under mostly

3066
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:51,880
vertically integrated Delta 9 B

3067
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:08,880
Delta Eight's probably fine and hhc is

3068
02:11:06,279 --> 02:11:11,800
probably fine too but the way it's being

3069
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:15,118
produced right now is probably not the

3070
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:17,480
safest for for human consumption I think

3071
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:20,839
that things are moving along pretty

3072
02:11:17,479 --> 02:11:24,638
quickly but we we have a patent on hhca

3073
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:26,760
not on hhc and so all these hhc

3074
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:29,359
producers I think are just taking their

3075
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:31,159
Delta 8 which again is listed in the

3076
02:11:29,359 --> 02:11:33,479
control danger substance act

3077
02:11:31,158 --> 02:11:36,960
hydrogenating it converting it to

3078
02:11:33,479 --> 02:11:39,959
hhc and people seem to really like hhc

3079
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:42,480
the hhc introduction at least across the

3080
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:44,880
hemp markets have been pretty successful

3081
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:48,718
these guys are making a lot of money

3082
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:50,400
selling it and um yeah that's it well

3083
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:52,559
out here we're not seeing a in the Bay

3084
02:11:50,399 --> 02:11:53,920
Area at least those CBD shops all around

3085
02:11:52,559 --> 02:11:56,000
like I've seen other places when I've

3086
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:58,880
left town um because we got dispensaries

3087
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,359
everywhere and they just changed the uh

3088
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:04,239
state law that's going to say now we can

3089
02:12:01,359 --> 02:12:08,920
sell at dispensaries the hemp derived

3090
02:12:04,238 --> 02:12:10,439
CBD and uh T what what's other Delta 8

3091
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:11,880
um but they haven't finished putting the

3092
02:12:10,439 --> 02:12:13,039
regulations in but I'm pretty sure

3093
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:14,960
that's just because they want to take

3094
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:17,559
the tax off the top of that but that's

3095
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:20,039
pretty big that's a pretty big decision

3096
02:12:17,559 --> 02:12:21,639
right Debby that's kind of like I think

3097
02:12:20,039 --> 02:12:27,039
from what I understand tell me if I'm

3098
02:12:21,639 --> 02:12:29,760
correct here so the thing that the um

3099
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:33,800
the charlott's web people tried to do

3100
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:36,679
federally with the FDA in allowing

3101
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:40,719
CBD from Industrial Hemp to be allowed

3102
02:12:36,679 --> 02:12:45,118
as a new dietary ingredient

3103
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:47,319
or no I think Gavin new said [ __ ] you

3104
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:50,839
yeah

3105
02:12:47,319 --> 02:12:54,118
that in California to get these minor

3106
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:56,319
con avonoids uh to Market is is that

3107
02:12:54,118 --> 02:12:58,118
right yeah I think that is right they

3108
02:12:56,319 --> 02:12:59,238
just haven't put the regulatory scheme

3109
02:12:58,118 --> 02:13:00,319
together yet so we don't know what it's

3110
02:12:59,238 --> 02:13:01,919
going to look like when they start

3111
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:03,359
showing up at our shops or how we're

3112
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,840
going to be able to sell it or anything

3113
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:07,000
like that yet but yeah I think

3114
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:09,400
California is doing the smart decision

3115
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,399
um bucking sort of that Federal Trend

3116
02:13:09,399 --> 02:13:12,799
and just doing what needs to be done so

3117
02:13:11,399 --> 02:13:14,519
we were I didn't even know it was

3118
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,840
happening so just one day the ruling

3119
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:19,480
came out yeah you know and a little

3120
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:21,400
background on that too and before get

3121
02:13:19,479 --> 02:13:22,558
into that like Mark one point you were

3122
02:13:21,399 --> 02:13:24,359
me bringing up though because there's

3123
02:13:22,559 --> 02:13:27,679
all the CBD shops you know kind of that

3124
02:13:24,359 --> 02:13:29,839
are everywhere but like Delta 8

3125
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:31,679
cartridges and hhc CES and stuff you

3126
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:33,279
could go into most head shops kind of

3127
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:36,599
just like random kind

3128
02:13:33,279 --> 02:13:38,960
of style kind of like some vape shops or

3129
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:41,400
head shops and you find them pretty

3130
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:43,559
accessibly Way Beyond kind of just the

3131
02:13:41,399 --> 02:13:45,679
centralized CBD shops that pop up just

3132
02:13:43,559 --> 02:13:46,960
really selling CBD type products you

3133
02:13:45,679 --> 02:13:49,679
know so that's that's a whole

3134
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:51,158
fascinating issue and dilemma um that's

3135
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:53,039
that's you know going to play out

3136
02:13:51,158 --> 02:13:55,558
interesting ways but but on the hemp

3137
02:13:53,039 --> 02:13:57,719
bill um you know it's been really

3138
02:13:55,559 --> 02:14:01,079
fascinating because you know for the

3139
02:13:57,719 --> 02:14:03,198
last you know um many years now two

3140
02:14:01,078 --> 02:14:05,279
three years there's um you know been

3141
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:07,598
basically the hemp bill that tried to

3142
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:09,800
get pushed through you know kind of

3143
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:11,279
really without any regard to public

3144
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:13,520
health and safety under the guise of

3145
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:16,319
industrial hemp kind of just kind of

3146
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,760
having testing regulations around TC

3147
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:21,479
which seemed really as a Trippy kind of

3148
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:23,119
big a subversion type of the whole Space

3149
02:14:21,479 --> 02:14:25,118
and uh California farmers in the

3150
02:14:23,118 --> 02:14:28,558
licensed space were like Homie don't

3151
02:14:25,118 --> 02:14:31,759
play that and um basically shot it down

3152
02:14:28,559 --> 02:14:35,119
each year you know because you know how

3153
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:36,199
why do people growing the same plant you

3154
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:37,719
know because most people who growing

3155
02:14:36,198 --> 02:14:39,879
Industrial Hemp aren't gr are not

3156
02:14:37,719 --> 02:14:43,000
growing industrial H 95% of those people

3157
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:46,000
are going type three drug cultivars of

3158
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,760
cannabis you know and under the guise of

3159
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,039
industrial hemp but are growing it that

3160
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:51,639
much more in industrial agricultural

3161
02:14:50,039 --> 02:14:54,000
areas where there's that much more

3162
02:14:51,639 --> 02:14:56,159
contamination potential of pesticides

3163
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,559
and metals and all these things and so

3164
02:14:56,158 --> 02:15:00,759
you know kind of there's this wildly

3165
02:14:57,559 --> 02:15:02,840
kind of unregulated use of the word hemp

3166
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:05,239
and what it's actually being used for

3167
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:06,880
whether it's medicine drug supply chain

3168
02:15:05,238 --> 02:15:08,879
or whether it's like actual industrial

3169
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:11,679
fiber for you know processing into all

3170
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:14,480
these other things um and so California

3171
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:17,760
kind of this year passed you know AB 45

3172
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:21,118
to establish um uh you know kind of For

3173
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:23,679
the First Time Cannabis you know or hemp

3174
02:15:21,118 --> 02:15:26,158
um products in the licensed supply chain

3175
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:28,480
and kind of essentially allowing for you

3176
02:15:26,158 --> 02:15:30,759
know kind of other states to get you

3177
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:33,479
know kind of CBD products into the state

3178
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:35,520
but they put in place a level of parity

3179
02:15:33,479 --> 02:15:38,158
with the can you know Cannabis Testing

3180
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:39,599
regulations for licensed cannabis you

3181
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:42,279
know with regard to all these points on

3182
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:44,480
public health and safety um you know and

3183
02:15:42,279 --> 02:15:45,880
so so it's a huge step forward and there

3184
02:15:44,479 --> 02:15:46,959
you know that's going to be you know

3185
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:48,679
playing out and I think that's really

3186
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:52,198
going to help set a national standard

3187
02:15:48,679 --> 02:15:53,920
for at which hemp should be tested um

3188
02:15:52,198 --> 02:15:56,558
you know um especially if it's going to

3189
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:58,279
be making you know made into like

3190
02:15:56,559 --> 02:16:00,360
medicine supply chain for Pediatric

3191
02:15:58,279 --> 02:16:02,559
epilepsy kids cancer patients dietary

3192
02:16:00,359 --> 02:16:05,319
supplement world of you know kind of you

3193
02:16:02,559 --> 02:16:07,360
know this canabo these cannaboids but um

3194
02:16:05,319 --> 02:16:09,039
but the you know it's it's it's it's

3195
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:10,839
it's hardly kind of on the same playing

3196
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:13,559
field or level with regard to you know

3197
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:15,279
kind of um you know batch a requirement

3198
02:16:13,559 --> 02:16:16,800
I mean there's there's um you know kind

3199
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:19,118
of testing requirements in place but

3200
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:21,400
there's not really a you know supply

3201
02:16:19,118 --> 02:16:22,679
chain regulated supply chain you know in

3202
02:16:21,399 --> 02:16:25,000
any way for

3203
02:16:22,679 --> 02:16:27,078
him do you guys have an analytical

3204
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:30,679
standard for hhc

3205
02:16:27,078 --> 02:16:33,558
Alec no um I would love would love to

3206
02:16:30,679 --> 02:16:36,239
talk with you more about that really

3207
02:16:33,558 --> 02:16:39,358
apprciate I appreciate your Insight also

3208
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:41,039
you you you have a very very nuanced

3209
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:43,960
very specific understanding of this

3210
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:45,280
whole thing that is really far beyond

3211
02:16:43,959 --> 02:16:48,039
I've been running around the internet

3212
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:52,479
basically correcting all these bogus

3213
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:52,479
articles that people are writing on

3214
02:17:20,478 --> 02:17:24,438
right hopefully it'll set the ground

3215
02:17:22,359 --> 02:17:26,280
straight and you know people will will

3216
02:17:24,439 --> 02:17:28,519
say okay yeah this guy knows what he's

3217
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:31,239
talking about here's here here's what

3218
02:17:28,519 --> 02:17:33,398
this is right because there's all kinds

3219
02:17:31,239 --> 02:17:36,159
of speculation on what it is out there

3220
02:17:33,398 --> 02:17:37,718
and people just don't know one thing I

3221
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:40,519
wanted to say real quick um and I'm

3222
02:17:37,718 --> 02:17:43,079
sorry Colin if you were about to speak

3223
02:17:40,519 --> 02:17:44,679
speak up but um you know it's it's funny

3224
02:17:43,079 --> 02:17:47,039
this whole conversation around these

3225
02:17:44,679 --> 02:17:49,159
conversions um you know you know we from

3226
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:51,679
the whole community of of extract

3227
02:17:49,159 --> 02:17:53,599
artists you know we we we we've been

3228
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:55,840
catching a lot of [ __ ] for a long time

3229
02:17:53,599 --> 02:17:58,120
and losing a lot of really good business

3230
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:00,000
for PE with people that you know kind of

3231
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:02,760
uh you know we you know we would show a

3232
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,439
test result with accuracy chro accurate

3233
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:07,880
chromatography and and and show people

3234
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:10,120
at like 40% delta9 and their distillate

3235
02:18:07,879 --> 02:18:12,679
or you know kind of whatever but you see

3236
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:14,880
these huge peaks of these PS Beyond

3237
02:18:12,679 --> 02:18:16,679
Delta eight because we identify delta8

3238
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:18,598
but you know Delta 10 all these other

3239
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:22,760
kind of you know what other you know

3240
02:18:18,599 --> 02:18:22,760
state-ofthe-art isomer that there are

3241
02:18:23,478 --> 02:18:27,879
but now there's a

3242
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:29,120
whole no I was just going to say now

3243
02:18:27,879 --> 02:18:30,959
there's a like I mean we're catching

3244
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:32,479
[ __ ] about like you know not doing it

3245
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:34,239
right and people kind of you know just

3246
02:18:32,478 --> 02:18:36,799
going to Labs that would misidentify

3247
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:38,239
those Peaks as Delta 9 you know but now

3248
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:40,318
like it's just funny because now there's

3249
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:42,000
this like starting to be widespread

3250
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:43,638
understanding of oh you could actually

3251
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,959
through distillation process create all

3252
02:18:43,638 --> 02:18:48,879
these iers and now there's these

3253
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:48,879
widespread like

3254
02:18:51,159 --> 02:18:54,039
you know these other you

3255
02:18:55,558 --> 02:18:59,920
know yeah I I I was just going to say

3256
02:18:58,159 --> 02:19:02,519
the funny thing is that you hear

3257
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,439
fear-mongering in the in the blogs of

3258
02:19:02,519 --> 02:19:05,359
people who don't know what they're

3259
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:07,719
talking about talking about all these

3260
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:10,079
unknowns in there all unknowns unknowns

3261
02:19:07,718 --> 02:19:11,839
unknowns it's like well if you read the

3262
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:14,000
chemical Literature Like I Do I can tell

3263
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:16,159
you that they're not unknown at all in

3264
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,959
fact they're quite known it's known

3265
02:19:16,159 --> 02:19:21,439
exactly what's made in this reaction and

3266
02:19:18,959 --> 02:19:25,398
so like when you do this conversion of

3267
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:27,920
CBD to THC it generates non-natural

3268
02:19:25,398 --> 02:19:29,519
isomers that aren't formed in the plant

3269
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:33,719
they all have the same molecular weight

3270
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:35,398
314 and certainly in the the the testing

3271
02:19:33,718 --> 02:19:37,199
Labs that I've talked to about this and

3272
02:19:35,398 --> 02:19:39,920
the samples that I've seen those

3273
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:41,920
compounds are in every they're they're

3274
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,679
unless you have this figured out they're

3275
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:45,638
in they're in all of these mixtures and

3276
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:49,879
we really don't know what their

3277
02:19:45,638 --> 02:19:51,599
long-term impact is uh to human safety

3278
02:19:49,879 --> 02:19:53,639
so we we just don't know because they're

3279
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:56,280
not made by the plant and this is the

3280
02:19:53,639 --> 02:19:58,199
first time they're being made for human

3281
02:19:56,280 --> 02:20:01,600
consumption and so it'll be interesting

3282
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:04,399
to see if um folks who are producing

3283
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:06,960
this are able to not only quantify what

3284
02:20:04,398 --> 02:20:09,439
those isomers are but basically set

3285
02:20:06,959 --> 02:20:13,119
product specification limits so you know

3286
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:15,800
that if a batch has got 2% well 2% is no

3287
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:18,000
good but we need to be down at05 or what

3288
02:20:15,799 --> 02:20:19,920
whatever the cut off is on some of these

3289
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,920
but they until they do the safety

3290
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:26,000
assessments on these compounds this is

3291
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:28,680
just a guessing game so that was kind of

3292
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:31,439
my my question to Alec I guess was was

3293
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:33,840
do we have the ability to even test for

3294
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:35,960
these these isomers and and

3295
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:38,159
differentiate them from one another to

3296
02:20:35,959 --> 02:20:40,759
then call them out right say okay well

3297
02:20:38,159 --> 02:20:44,000
this is now present so this is this is

3298
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:44,000
most likely

3299
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:04,559
um so so you know it's um I think the

3300
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:06,479
burden of proving these compounds is on

3301
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:09,039
the manufacturers creating them more

3302
02:21:06,478 --> 02:21:11,519
than it's on the lab to like identify

3303
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:13,120
these novel compounds and Chase see like

3304
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:15,159
the you know kind of the trends of where

3305
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:17,319
the Market's creating isomer be able to

3306
02:21:15,159 --> 02:21:20,119
quantify you know I think that requires

3307
02:21:17,318 --> 02:21:22,840
a lot of R&amp;D work in you know with a

3308
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:24,560
laboratory to help you know be able to

3309
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:28,439
you know identify what the compounds are

3310
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:28,439
that the group's creating you

3311
02:21:40,318 --> 02:21:45,439
know then like what you know we Labs can

3312
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:47,239
kind of you know stay up to date on kind

3313
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:50,040
of having these compounds added into

3314
02:21:47,239 --> 02:21:52,239
their their methods and validated um you

3315
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:53,880
know but but again I think you know it's

3316
02:21:52,239 --> 02:21:56,239
funny because in in the past we've kind

3317
02:21:53,879 --> 02:21:58,839
of caught so much [ __ ] from clients you

3318
02:21:56,239 --> 02:22:02,600
know that that that basically are like

3319
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:05,200
my this distillate is 40% THC you know

3320
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:07,640
you're wrong you know why what is this

3321
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:09,479
other 60% and it's like dude it's a it's

3322
02:22:07,639 --> 02:22:11,799
a novel compound it's like this ghost

3323
02:22:09,478 --> 02:22:13,039
canabo isomer that you've created I have

3324
02:22:11,799 --> 02:22:15,599
no idea what it is there's not a

3325
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:18,000
standard for it um like I can show you a

3326
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:20,280
chromatogram that it's clearly that and

3327
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:21,760
it's not built in nine you know but but

3328
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:23,399
we're testing for these compounds like

3329
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:25,559
Delta 9 that we have validated and

3330
02:22:23,398 --> 02:22:27,159
tested hundreds of thousands of times

3331
02:22:25,559 --> 02:22:28,879
you know and so so I think that work

3332
02:22:27,159 --> 02:22:30,879
there's like you know novel work that

3333
02:22:28,879 --> 02:22:32,119
needs to be done with kind of

3334
02:22:30,879 --> 02:22:35,239
Manufacturers that are making these

3335
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:37,720
compounds to be able to kind of you know

3336
02:22:35,239 --> 02:22:41,119
again do that stage when they've just

3337
02:22:37,719 --> 02:22:44,478
made 20 kilos of this stuff they want it

3338
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:47,079
to be 40 or 80% or they want it to be

3339
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:48,559
exactly it's some ungodly low percent

3340
02:22:47,079 --> 02:22:51,039
and it's got all this other crap in

3341
02:22:48,559 --> 02:22:53,199
there like oh let's just you know white

3342
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:57,240
film distill it and put it in gummies

3343
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:59,079
you know and and I I think again I'd

3344
02:22:57,239 --> 02:23:03,840
like to think that there's a place for

3345
02:22:59,079 --> 02:23:03,840
chemists to play inry and I

3346
02:23:10,439 --> 02:23:16,120
think it's like if your process doesn't

3347
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:18,800
make something that's greater than 90%

3348
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:21,720
yield it ain't ready for Prime Time

3349
02:23:18,799 --> 02:23:24,438
unless you know what that other 10% is

3350
02:23:21,719 --> 02:23:26,679
and you could ascribe that other 10% to

3351
02:23:24,439 --> 02:23:29,318
known compounds or brid to known

3352
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:31,040
compounds of known safety then you don't

3353
02:23:29,318 --> 02:23:34,639
have a safe product there so whether

3354
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:37,200
it's Delta 8 or whether it's hhc these

3355
02:23:34,639 --> 02:23:40,000
are no longer naturally occurring in a

3356
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:42,880
plant and you can't refine a plant

3357
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,000
extract to get those compounds you're

3358
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:47,679
talking about a reaction product of a

3359
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:50,439
chemical reaction and I don't know about

3360
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:52,200
you I hope that it's a chemist like me

3361
02:23:50,439 --> 02:23:54,520
running that chemical reaction that

3362
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:57,319
knows what the hell it is they're doing

3363
02:23:54,520 --> 02:24:00,279
yeah truth truth

3364
02:23:57,318 --> 02:24:02,840
yeah yeah I think sort of the hilarity

3365
02:24:00,279 --> 02:24:05,359
of all of this and if we look at it from

3366
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:08,799
you know a you know an outward

3367
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:12,640
standpoint of how you know the brains of

3368
02:24:08,799 --> 02:24:16,039
human beings we've fractal this medicine

3369
02:24:12,639 --> 02:24:18,278
so much we've created so many different

3370
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:20,720
laws and so many different regulations

3371
02:24:18,279 --> 02:24:22,520
and because humans are adaptogens then

3372
02:24:20,719 --> 02:24:25,079
we're always trying to jump through the

3373
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:27,800
Hoops of the regulations and I just

3374
02:24:25,079 --> 02:24:31,200
think it's so hilarious that this plant

3375
02:24:27,799 --> 02:24:33,079
continues to be fractal out in all of

3376
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,680
these different ways so we can jump

3377
02:24:33,079 --> 02:24:36,840
through all the Hoops that we're

3378
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:38,760
creating so that we can even create

3379
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:41,200
Hoops that we can't jump through anymore

3380
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:44,600
I just think that it's pretty funny that

3381
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:46,479
this plant is so adaptogenic in the way

3382
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:48,840
that we are in our thinking that we've

3383
02:24:46,478 --> 02:24:50,879
come up with all these different ways

3384
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:53,960
that just really don't make any sense

3385
02:24:50,879 --> 02:24:55,159
but hey they got through a hoop I I

3386
02:24:53,959 --> 02:24:57,599
really appreciate that thought you know

3387
02:24:55,159 --> 02:24:59,439
it reminds me um of I was at an

3388
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:01,800
international canid research Society

3389
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:03,600
conference one year and um you know

3390
02:25:01,799 --> 02:25:05,639
there's all these amazing you know you

3391
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:07,439
know presentations and knowledge

3392
02:25:05,639 --> 02:25:09,959
transfer and all this and then and then

3393
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:12,880
there was this like you know PhD like

3394
02:25:09,959 --> 02:25:15,318
super tenur DEA like chemist that was

3395
02:25:12,879 --> 02:25:17,519
presenting about this like cat and mouse

3396
02:25:15,318 --> 02:25:20,398
game that the DEA is having and this

3397
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:22,079
really big problem that there all these

3398
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:24,239
synthetic cannaboids that are hitting

3399
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:25,920
the market and like they'll you know

3400
02:25:24,239 --> 02:25:28,318
spice and K2 and all these things and

3401
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:29,760
then like the you know the only way

3402
02:25:28,318 --> 02:25:31,959
they'll even kind of find out about them

3403
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:34,279
is through some widespread kind of

3404
02:25:31,959 --> 02:25:36,000
outbreak of like some really adverse

3405
02:25:34,279 --> 02:25:38,800
reaction and then they all of a sudden

3406
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:42,639
kind of test that Supply identify this

3407
02:25:38,799 --> 02:25:45,119
way crazy new compound sythetic canono

3408
02:25:42,639 --> 02:25:46,639
and then they schedule it and then it

3409
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:48,600
and then by the time they've scheduled

3410
02:25:46,639 --> 02:25:50,680
it then there's new compounds on the

3411
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:52,200
market and it's and and it's this whole

3412
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:53,880
cat and they're like presenting this

3413
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:55,840
dilemma this cat and mouse game that

3414
02:25:53,879 --> 02:25:57,199
they're having and so hard and it's like

3415
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:58,559
in the whole time the whole kind of

3416
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:00,560
people everybody in the audience is just

3417
02:25:58,559 --> 02:26:02,318
like staring at him like pissed because

3418
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:04,318
it's like it's the prohibition on this

3419
02:26:02,318 --> 02:26:07,159
plant that's creating the market for all

3420
02:26:04,318 --> 02:26:10,199
these super fractal kind of like you

3421
02:26:07,159 --> 02:26:13,398
know almost like um dystopian like just

3422
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:15,760
like off way off the plants kind of path

3423
02:26:13,398 --> 02:26:17,439
of of what this you know of cannaboids

3424
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:19,159
to hit the market but you know they're

3425
02:26:17,439 --> 02:26:21,359
doing it anyway and it's making it out

3426
02:26:19,159 --> 02:26:23,359
there you know some a lot some of

3427
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:25,559
synthetic ones are like really gnarly

3428
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:27,720
you know I you know I'd be curious about

3429
02:26:25,559 --> 02:26:29,278
like long-term efficacy for Delta 8 or

3430
02:26:27,719 --> 02:26:30,318
hhc and all that you know and it's

3431
02:26:29,279 --> 02:26:32,359
probably it's probably good it's

3432
02:26:30,318 --> 02:26:35,639
probably fine you know compared to some

3433
02:26:32,359 --> 02:26:37,920
of these crazy synthetic canavs but um

3434
02:26:35,639 --> 02:26:38,799
but again yes like it's just so trippy

3435
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:40,920
because it's the prohibition on this

3436
02:26:38,799 --> 02:26:42,959
plant that's like leading to all this

3437
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:44,159
Divergence from the path you know

3438
02:26:42,959 --> 02:26:46,119
instead of you know being able to

3439
02:26:44,159 --> 02:26:48,359
actually cherish the like magic that the

3440
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:50,640
plant actually presents if you just give

3441
02:26:48,359 --> 02:26:52,800
it the chance yeah but the feds have

3442
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:54,398
that law the blanket law the analog law

3443
02:26:52,799 --> 02:26:57,519
that says that anything that is a

3444
02:26:54,398 --> 02:26:59,439
spin-off from a drug schedule one is a

3445
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:01,640
schedule one drug but the thing is is

3446
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:03,040
it's like that uh toothpaste out of the

3447
02:27:01,639 --> 02:27:04,840
tube thing what are they going to do

3448
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:06,840
come after everyone at this point that

3449
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:08,478
like we've literally outnumbered the DEA

3450
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:10,239
and the Fed so hardcore they can never

3451
02:27:08,478 --> 02:27:12,719
get it back in the toothpaste will never

3452
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:15,520
ever go back in tube at this point never

3453
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:18,599
it's over I think this is just all part

3454
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:21,960
of the movement to deschedule the plant

3455
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:24,239
and to take THC off the list you know

3456
02:27:21,959 --> 02:27:26,639
again it it flies in the face of

3457
02:27:24,239 --> 02:27:29,840
conventional knowledge that there are

3458
02:27:26,639 --> 02:27:32,398
several FDA approved drugs where canabo

3459
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:35,200
that are from the plant are the active

3460
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:37,840
ingredients in those drugs they have a

3461
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:40,000
good therapeutic index they have low

3462
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:43,120
toxicity yet the plant from which

3463
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,760
they're derived has no medical value

3464
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:47,359
come

3465
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:50,719
on and that's been happening since you

3466
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:52,318
know even LSD and and Hoffman and and

3467
02:27:50,719 --> 02:27:56,840
lley

3468
02:27:52,318 --> 02:28:00,639
Stanley and Nick sand who were making

3469
02:27:56,840 --> 02:28:01,680
LSD and the Tim Scully and Tim Scully a

3470
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:03,879
lot of people don't know about Tim

3471
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:06,239
Scully which is not rock

3472
02:28:03,879 --> 02:28:08,920
Scully and uh you know just talking

3473
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:11,279
about how you know there's early um

3474
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:13,000
Crystal that was made you know during a

3475
02:28:11,279 --> 02:28:15,640
time when it was legal and then they the

3476
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:18,239
FDA or the government started going

3477
02:28:15,639 --> 02:28:21,318
after it and then they said oh we were

3478
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:23,760
trying to produce a what was it

3479
02:28:21,318 --> 02:28:27,039
al52 you know and they're like hey hey

3480
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:29,000
come on this was LSD 25 you know so you

3481
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:31,000
know and these people went on to like do

3482
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,040
other amazing Labs all over the place so

3483
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,879
for sure you know that's that's the the

3484
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:37,200
chemist you know you just just heat it

3485
02:28:34,879 --> 02:28:37,199
up

3486
02:28:40,359 --> 02:28:45,680
and realm and it's also that's been a

3487
02:28:43,478 --> 02:28:48,358
very

3488
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:50,559
area I just gonna I just gonna say it's

3489
02:28:48,359 --> 02:28:54,120
been a very fruitful area

3490
02:28:50,559 --> 02:28:56,439
in in general to look at inspiration

3491
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:59,479
from biology so when you look at the

3492
02:28:56,439 --> 02:29:01,318
compounds that biology produces that's

3493
02:28:59,478 --> 02:29:03,438
where a lot of our Pharmaceuticals and

3494
02:29:01,318 --> 02:29:07,799
drugs are discovered they're discovered

3495
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:10,398
by making analoges around those

3496
02:29:07,799 --> 02:29:12,000
pharmaceutical or th those what what we

3497
02:29:10,398 --> 02:29:14,358
what typically in drug Discovery they

3498
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:17,079
call privileged platforms so a

3499
02:29:14,359 --> 02:29:19,640
privileged platform is just a molecule

3500
02:29:17,079 --> 02:29:21,398
like a canono that no matter what group

3501
02:29:19,639 --> 02:29:23,559
you decorate on it it's going to have

3502
02:29:21,398 --> 02:29:25,559
some level of activity the great thing

3503
02:29:23,559 --> 02:29:27,559
about canono just in terms of their

3504
02:29:25,559 --> 02:29:30,278
therapeutic index is that they're

3505
02:29:27,559 --> 02:29:32,039
ultimately not toxic so a lot of these

3506
02:29:30,279 --> 02:29:34,120
compounds especially the compounds that

3507
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:36,000
were developed by pharmaceutical

3508
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:38,720
companies to act on the cannabinoid

3509
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:41,040
receptors not only are they toxic as

3510
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:43,719
hell but they have a a lot of

3511
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:45,800
non-specific interactions they interact

3512
02:29:43,719 --> 02:29:47,920
not just with the cannaboid receptors

3513
02:29:45,799 --> 02:29:51,199
but with every receptor in the body and

3514
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:53,600
so you can't just throw a mon wrench

3515
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:56,800
into the engine of your body and expect

3516
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:58,600
it not to have any deleterious impact

3517
02:29:56,799 --> 02:30:01,438
that's the great thing about the phyto

3518
02:29:58,600 --> 02:30:05,399
canabidol in general is that you know

3519
02:30:01,439 --> 02:30:07,760
it's very lipid soluble and so because

3520
02:30:05,398 --> 02:30:11,799
our bodies have a lot of fat especially

3521
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:14,800
my body um th those those that fat is

3522
02:30:11,799 --> 02:30:18,119
basically reservoirs to hold just like a

3523
02:30:14,799 --> 02:30:20,920
dirty bong those canabo inside your body

3524
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:23,600
as long as we possibly can so our body

3525
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:25,559
has actually evolved mechanisms to hold

3526
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,640
on to these compounds because they're so

3527
02:30:25,559 --> 02:30:30,760
beneficial and the last thing I'll say

3528
02:30:27,639 --> 02:30:34,199
is that unlike most antioxidants in our

3529
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:36,478
diet like the polyphenols and coffee and

3530
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:38,040
grape juice and [ __ ] like that unlike

3531
02:30:36,478 --> 02:30:40,840
those types of

3532
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:43,960
antioxidants those are water soluble

3533
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:47,200
canono are not water soluble so in

3534
02:30:43,959 --> 02:30:50,000
definitely they they protect the fatty

3535
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:53,040
tissues of your body from oxidative d

3536
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,719
damage caused by free radicals so again

3537
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:57,680
it's been said many times before

3538
02:30:54,719 --> 02:31:00,000
cannabis use all use is medical because

3539
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:02,359
you're protecting the fatty tissues of

3540
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:04,799
your body including your pancreas your

3541
02:31:02,359 --> 02:31:07,479
brain and your kidneys against from

3542
02:31:04,799 --> 02:31:10,840
radical mediated oxidative damage so

3543
02:31:07,478 --> 02:31:14,119
these things are going to be looked as a

3544
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:17,680
new supplement in the future because

3545
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:17,680
it's going to lead to healthier

3546
02:31:17,879 --> 02:31:23,559
humans jump in about you said uh

3547
02:31:21,279 --> 02:31:25,239
something about a monkey wrench and I

3548
02:31:23,559 --> 02:31:27,600
just wanted to say that when we're

3549
02:31:25,239 --> 02:31:30,279
talking about pharmaceuticals and them

3550
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:32,079
extracting certain compounds and those

3551
02:31:30,279 --> 02:31:34,600
compounds that have been maybe isolated

3552
02:31:32,079 --> 02:31:37,120
and studied and then that's what's being

3553
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:40,279
put inside of the human well that lacks

3554
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:42,399
the full spectrum that lacks the full

3555
02:31:40,279 --> 02:31:44,079
thing so what we're also finding is when

3556
02:31:42,398 --> 02:31:46,840
we're synthesizing and when we're

3557
02:31:44,079 --> 02:31:50,520
isolating that like that without the

3558
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:52,960
full absorption of the full plant we're

3559
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:55,399
actually creating more maladies and more

3560
02:31:52,959 --> 02:31:58,959
side effects with these drugs because we

3561
02:31:55,398 --> 02:32:01,959
failed to look at the whole

3562
02:31:58,959 --> 02:32:03,959
integration of all of the different

3563
02:32:01,959 --> 02:32:07,478
compounds within the drugs and that's

3564
02:32:03,959 --> 02:32:10,358
just pointing out you know more Hoops

3565
02:32:07,478 --> 02:32:13,719
that we like to put up for ourselves and

3566
02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:13,720
how funny that is and how

3567
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:19,520
it I'm sorry um yeah I actually wanted

3568
02:32:17,398 --> 02:32:21,760
to follow up on both both of those great

3569
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:24,680
points um you know like

3570
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:26,800
um you know and and and a big shout out

3571
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:29,040
to ethnobotany and the legendary

3572
02:32:26,799 --> 02:32:31,159
ethnobotanists of the past you know that

3573
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:33,960
have kind of really helped to carry the

3574
02:32:31,159 --> 02:32:35,520
these this this coveted wisdom about the

3575
02:32:33,959 --> 02:32:37,398
medicinal properties of plants to

3576
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:39,079
Western World which has kind of been the

3577
02:32:37,398 --> 02:32:41,199
foundation of so much of the modern

3578
02:32:39,079 --> 02:32:43,000
pharmaceutical kind of compounds created

3579
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:45,680
you so many of the anti-histamines that

3580
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,719
we use and around really kind of

3581
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:51,439
foundationally kind of tied to like

3582
02:32:47,719 --> 02:32:53,318
datura and toi and Ania and kind of

3583
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:54,960
Scopolamine kind of related type

3584
02:32:53,318 --> 02:32:57,199
compounds and stuff and there's and it

3585
02:32:54,959 --> 02:32:59,438
goes so far beyond that you know aspirin

3586
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:01,120
and you know just and just the root of

3587
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:03,600
so much of the medicines that

3588
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:06,479
pharmaceutical uses is pretty much all

3589
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:09,439
is is you know found in in plant you

3590
02:33:06,478 --> 02:33:11,478
know foundations and so you know I

3591
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:13,840
there's this really amazing podcast I

3592
02:33:11,478 --> 02:33:16,398
would highly recommend from um the great

3593
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:18,559
ethnobotanist Dr Mark Plotkin um called

3594
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:21,439
plants of the Gods you know kind of name

3595
02:33:18,559 --> 02:33:23,039
and tribute to you great uh Albert

3596
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:25,398
Hoffman and Richard Evan schulties that

3597
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:27,520
wrote the book together the back in the

3598
02:33:25,398 --> 02:33:29,398
day but there's a podcast um called

3599
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:30,880
plants of the gods that kind of you know

3600
02:33:29,398 --> 02:33:33,039
from a really amazing kind of

3601
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:35,879
biocultural conservational aspect kind

3602
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:37,960
of tributes plants and the people where

3603
02:33:35,879 --> 02:33:40,358
these plants kind of uh you know kind of

3604
02:33:37,959 --> 02:33:44,199
come from um and and you know and just

3605
02:33:40,359 --> 02:33:44,200
really really beautiful narrative

3606
02:33:56,478 --> 02:34:03,199
is over time and you know a lot more uh

3607
02:33:59,959 --> 02:34:05,278
in in in uh Allin and in service to that

3608
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,920
path than you know the pharmaceutical

3609
02:34:05,279 --> 02:34:08,239
Discovery path you know to start just

3610
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:10,559
like randomly kind of start plugging out

3611
02:34:08,239 --> 02:34:12,039
receptors you know in that way of of

3612
02:34:10,559 --> 02:34:14,478
hacking into the systems that are

3613
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:18,000
already perfectly figured out um but

3614
02:34:14,478 --> 02:34:20,159
anyway just wanted to share

3615
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,760
that I'm glad you did just went and

3616
02:34:20,159 --> 02:34:22,760
followed that

3617
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:29,600
podcast it's an amazing podcast it

3618
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:32,439
really is and if you ever get a chance I

3619
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:35,559
think he's he's either got a TED talk or

3620
02:34:32,439 --> 02:34:38,720
there's a YouTube of a talk that he gave

3621
02:34:35,559 --> 02:34:41,199
his photographs are [ __ ]

3622
02:34:38,719 --> 02:34:43,199
amazing he he has some of the most

3623
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:45,479
amazing photographs of the Amazon that

3624
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:45,479
I've ever

3625
02:34:45,639 --> 02:34:54,000
seen sweet it's just sort of cool too to

3626
02:34:50,279 --> 02:34:57,319
remind ourselves that no matter what we

3627
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:00,159
have created in the name of science or

3628
02:34:57,318 --> 02:35:03,039
whatever we have manipulated as far as

3629
02:35:00,159 --> 02:35:05,920
carbon or as far as any kind of

3630
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:08,359
compounds it's all of the

3631
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:11,840
earth everything that we have

3632
02:35:08,359 --> 02:35:15,200
manipulated and it's all come from the

3633
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:18,478
earth even like the Plastics yes they're

3634
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:20,600
not naturally occurring but everything

3635
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:23,000
as of the Earth and I just think that

3636
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:25,920
that's just a really interesting thing

3637
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:28,318
that of course all of our medicinals

3638
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:30,600
would would come from the plants because

3639
02:35:28,318 --> 02:35:33,239
they're of the earth everything would be

3640
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:36,520
coming of the earth so of course we've

3641
02:35:33,239 --> 02:35:40,239
figured out ways to synthesize it and

3642
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:42,359
make it unhealthy for us and that's been

3643
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:44,199
um really

3644
02:35:42,359 --> 02:35:47,120
awesome in

3645
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:51,479
pharmacopia you're blowing my my secret

3646
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:55,640
ingredients Stardust right

3647
02:35:51,478 --> 02:35:55,639
who put Stardust in the really special

3648
02:35:56,639 --> 02:36:03,318
stuff right we're not importing feed

3649
02:35:59,478 --> 02:36:03,318
stocks from Mars not yet

3650
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:11,600
right not yet although who knows right

3651
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:13,960
and I love the work of Alexander Sasha

3652
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:16,720
shulan and all of the compounds

3653
02:36:13,959 --> 02:36:18,318
blessings all for sure yeah blessings on

3654
02:36:16,719 --> 02:36:22,239
him of course you if you're G to talk

3655
02:36:18,318 --> 02:36:24,239
about psychoactive drugs and different

3656
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:26,199
you know I mean how many did he make and

3657
02:36:24,239 --> 02:36:27,799
I think he was into you know trying them

3658
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:31,040
all and just really

3659
02:36:27,799 --> 02:36:33,199
supporting all of the doctors throughout

3660
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:36,120
all these years you don't know it but

3661
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:40,560
like Alexander schan is just right there

3662
02:36:36,120 --> 02:36:42,920
you know in court cases and uh um

3663
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:44,199
studies and stuff and you know give

3664
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:46,799
thanks for some of the medicines that

3665
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:48,960
you know were created there for sure he

3666
02:36:46,799 --> 02:36:52,119
wasn't there's still a whole lot of work

3667
02:36:48,959 --> 02:36:54,959
to do there really there is

3668
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:57,399
right his two textbooks right

3669
02:36:54,959 --> 02:36:59,519
tryptamines and and phenethylamines

3670
02:36:57,398 --> 02:37:01,680
these are again privileged platforms

3671
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:04,040
that you could decorate with just about

3672
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:06,639
any molecular spinach you want you're

3673
02:37:04,040 --> 02:37:08,840
only limited by the imagination of the

3674
02:37:06,639 --> 02:37:10,760
chemist right and so you could put a

3675
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:13,079
group over here see what it does take a

3676
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:15,318
few pills oh that makes me feel tired

3677
02:37:13,079 --> 02:37:19,920
and he did put another group over here

3678
02:37:15,318 --> 02:37:19,920
you know really do your own s

3679
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:24,760
yep pcal and tal um you know and that

3680
02:37:23,559 --> 02:37:26,879
you know what's fascinating is I think

3681
02:37:24,760 --> 02:37:28,680
those are the two Divergent paths really

3682
02:37:26,879 --> 02:37:30,920
with the plants you know it's like this

3683
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:32,318
ethnobotanical like biocultural

3684
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:33,719
conservation like supporting the

3685
02:37:32,318 --> 02:37:34,959
communities where medicines come from

3686
02:37:33,719 --> 02:37:37,559
and understanding how to use them most

3687
02:37:34,959 --> 02:37:39,799
effectively in reverence to the to the

3688
02:37:37,559 --> 02:37:42,159
plant to the people where they come from

3689
02:37:39,799 --> 02:37:43,879
and then also this this world of

3690
02:37:42,159 --> 02:37:45,760
Discovery and kind of like being able to

3691
02:37:43,879 --> 02:37:47,799
kind of you know create these novel

3692
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:50,239
compounds in this shulan kind of uh

3693
02:37:47,799 --> 02:37:53,159
tribute and path you know and and some

3694
02:37:50,239 --> 02:37:55,159
of my favorite you know medicin like 2cv

3695
02:37:53,159 --> 02:37:58,799
you know kind of our our sh gun

3696
02:37:55,159 --> 02:38:01,200
compounds um and and um you know and I

3697
02:37:58,799 --> 02:38:03,358
think I think in the in this other kind

3698
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:04,439
of side of this compound you know which

3699
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:06,399
is relevant to our conversations

3700
02:38:04,439 --> 02:38:08,720
synthetic cannabinoids and all these hhc

3701
02:38:06,398 --> 02:38:10,398
kind of Delta 8 Delta 10 kind of stuff

3702
02:38:08,719 --> 02:38:12,519
you know it's you know kind of there's

3703
02:38:10,398 --> 02:38:14,159
this and this this creation you

3704
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:16,760
potential of you know kind of being able

3705
02:38:14,159 --> 02:38:19,799
to you know hack the you know kind of

3706
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:21,920
the you the molecular you know kind of

3707
02:38:19,799 --> 02:38:23,358
understanding of the endoc avonoid

3708
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:24,920
system and tryptamines and you know

3709
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:26,720
dopamine system and all this and be able

3710
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:29,359
to create compounds that can fit into

3711
02:38:26,719 --> 02:38:30,840
these Pathways but I do also believe

3712
02:38:29,359 --> 02:38:33,880
that very strongly that there's an

3713
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:35,760
incredible again burden of proof that is

3714
02:38:33,879 --> 02:38:37,278
on those people that are making these

3715
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:38,960
compounds and especially if they're

3716
02:38:37,279 --> 02:38:40,720
going to be made them making them

3717
02:38:38,959 --> 02:38:44,079
readily and ra you know accessibly

3718
02:38:40,719 --> 02:38:46,318
available to to prove efficacy and qual

3719
02:38:44,079 --> 02:38:48,439
and and efficacy and safety you know

3720
02:38:46,318 --> 02:38:50,318
first and foremost um before kind of

3721
02:38:48,439 --> 02:38:52,600
there's this just as rapid release you

3722
02:38:50,318 --> 02:38:52,600
know

3723
02:38:54,318 --> 02:38:58,398
because you I think you know there's you

3724
02:38:56,920 --> 02:39:00,359
know Shan's really the only dude that

3725
02:38:58,398 --> 02:39:02,599
did it really right you know I think in

3726
02:39:00,359 --> 02:39:04,600
in in in his world and I think people

3727
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:06,000
that took kind of shulan kind of paths

3728
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:07,520
with the endoc cannaboid system to

3729
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,959
create all these novel you know kind of

3730
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:10,399
synthetic canids that have kind of gone

3731
02:39:08,959 --> 02:39:12,199
to lead to all these outbreaks of just

3732
02:39:10,398 --> 02:39:14,879
public health issues you know kind of

3733
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:16,840
did shulan a disservice you know kind of

3734
02:39:14,879 --> 02:39:18,278
in in that because they were just they

3735
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:19,920
they weren't they weren't creating the

3736
02:39:18,279 --> 02:39:21,840
molecule and dosing them eles and

3737
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:24,079
figuring out the thing and then like

3738
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:25,799
putting that out very responsibly they

3739
02:39:24,079 --> 02:39:27,959
were just like critting batches and like

3740
02:39:25,799 --> 02:39:30,318
dosing the population you know and

3741
02:39:27,959 --> 02:39:32,199
that's the other thing the other thing

3742
02:39:30,318 --> 02:39:34,239
is is that uh we don't look at the

3743
02:39:32,200 --> 02:39:36,359
long-term effects of this you know what

3744
02:39:34,239 --> 02:39:39,680
shogan put out is you definitely had

3745
02:39:36,359 --> 02:39:42,359
Mass peer studies but he's just one man

3746
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:44,559
in an adult life creating pretty

3747
02:39:42,359 --> 02:39:48,359
phenomenal things and massive peer

3748
02:39:44,559 --> 02:39:51,278
review studies that were on his own and

3749
02:39:48,359 --> 02:39:53,520
I just feel like like here it is again

3750
02:39:51,279 --> 02:39:55,680
that we're putting Shackles on the

3751
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:58,760
possibility and the educational

3752
02:39:55,680 --> 02:40:02,120
attributes of plant medicine when we

3753
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:03,960
continuously try to regulate them

3754
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:06,920
because what would it be like what kind

3755
02:40:03,959 --> 02:40:10,759
of a society would we be if we were

3756
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:14,239
readily able to use cocoa leaves every

3757
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:17,079
day in our teas that would help uh you

3758
02:40:14,239 --> 02:40:20,119
know Lift us for our days rather than

3759
02:40:17,079 --> 02:40:23,639
have to party on the weekends with this

3760
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:26,479
super sythetic extract and we don't look

3761
02:40:23,639 --> 02:40:29,159
at the longevity of that if we were able

3762
02:40:26,478 --> 02:40:32,599
to totally free that up I feel like it

3763
02:40:29,159 --> 02:40:35,520
would lessen the the need for us to

3764
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:38,559
continue to synthesize these things that

3765
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:41,159
would be more normalized in our own tea

3766
02:40:38,559 --> 02:40:44,359
cabinet that we would have you know

3767
02:40:41,159 --> 02:40:46,439
concentrated sassafras bark that we were

3768
02:40:44,359 --> 02:40:49,920
taking every day especially for the

3769
02:40:46,439 --> 02:40:52,800
rainy days that you know MDMA is made

3770
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:55,719
out of that we could get that maybe in a

3771
02:40:52,799 --> 02:40:57,478
chewing canary grass or San Pedro

3772
02:40:55,719 --> 02:40:59,438
cactuses I you know what I mean like

3773
02:40:57,478 --> 02:41:01,959
there's it's just interesting straight

3774
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:04,159
to the te straight to the old world you

3775
02:41:01,959 --> 02:41:07,398
know what I mean that's and I think that

3776
02:41:04,159 --> 02:41:09,719
that creates more regevity yeah that's

3777
02:41:07,398 --> 02:41:13,000
the longevity that's the Blue Zone you

3778
02:41:09,719 --> 02:41:14,879
know that's the that's the the ultimate

3779
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:19,318
you

3780
02:41:14,879 --> 02:41:21,358
know lift of the spirit I think C leaf

3781
02:41:19,318 --> 02:41:24,079
cocaine is such a good example you know

3782
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:26,800
COC leaf that is revered for thousands

3783
02:41:24,079 --> 02:41:28,879
of years as one of the highest pray upon

3784
02:41:26,799 --> 02:41:31,318
appreciated plants across the Andes you

3785
02:41:28,879 --> 02:41:34,000
know is the Divine Leaf of immortality

3786
02:41:31,318 --> 02:41:37,318
you know and kind of the the longevity

3787
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:39,799
of that is real you know and and and how

3788
02:41:37,318 --> 02:41:42,639
and how you know how much that medicine

3789
02:41:39,799 --> 02:41:45,559
of a of a of a plant it is you know as

3790
02:41:42,639 --> 02:41:48,478
opposed to the cursed kind of extracted

3791
02:41:45,559 --> 02:41:51,079
way overused way overly kind of

3792
02:41:48,478 --> 02:41:53,438
self-gratifying way like ego building I

3793
02:41:51,079 --> 02:41:55,520
mean it's it's totally different it's a

3794
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:58,960
totally different days those are not the

3795
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:01,040
same things at all yeah it's like um

3796
02:41:58,959 --> 02:42:06,639
they what like I've heard it described

3797
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:10,399
as um Coca is to potato as cocaine is to

3798
02:42:06,639 --> 02:42:12,278
vodka right that's about right when I

3799
02:42:10,398 --> 02:42:14,318
was uh married which was long ago I was

3800
02:42:12,279 --> 02:42:16,760
married to an andian man he was Peruvian

3801
02:42:14,318 --> 02:42:18,799
and and coko is actually symbiotic with

3802
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:21,200
their bodies they they're one the plant

3803
02:42:18,799 --> 02:42:23,639
and their body are the same and lately

3804
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:25,120
I've been thinking about um for example

3805
02:42:23,639 --> 02:42:27,799
mushrooms because here I live in Oakland

3806
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:30,640
it's it's legalized here locally and

3807
02:42:27,799 --> 02:42:32,879
I've been doing micro does so great but

3808
02:42:30,639 --> 02:42:34,439
I did a micro do and I didn't take time

3809
02:42:32,879 --> 02:42:35,719
to develop my set and setting and my

3810
02:42:34,439 --> 02:42:37,000
mindset because I've been doing it

3811
02:42:35,719 --> 02:42:38,559
regular right and I was like oh I'll

3812
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:41,520
just do a micro do and I did it on the

3813
02:42:38,559 --> 02:42:43,840
fly it bit me in the butt so hard

3814
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:45,920
because that is a sacred plant and you

3815
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:47,760
really have to watch your head space and

3816
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:50,920
you have to use it in a certain way so

3817
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:52,239
I'm curious as we unveil these things

3818
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:54,359
how are people how how many people are

3819
02:42:52,239 --> 02:42:56,318
going to get in trouble sort of

3820
02:42:54,359 --> 02:42:58,040
physically or mentally not treating

3821
02:42:56,318 --> 02:43:00,039
these plants with the kind of respect

3822
02:42:58,040 --> 02:43:02,560
like the andian peruvians do where

3823
02:43:00,040 --> 02:43:03,800
they're symbiotic with the Coca plant

3824
02:43:02,559 --> 02:43:05,600
it's part of their body and their whole

3825
02:43:03,799 --> 02:43:07,639
life View and the same with mushrooms

3826
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:09,159
that's a sacred plant that's that's not

3827
02:43:07,639 --> 02:43:10,760
something you take just like aspirin

3828
02:43:09,159 --> 02:43:13,680
that is different

3829
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:15,559
soach of us finds out in our own way

3830
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:18,159
right you found out in your way oh I got

3831
02:43:15,559 --> 02:43:20,119
my but it's been a while believe way the

3832
02:43:18,159 --> 02:43:22,520
same way as they find find out by eating

3833
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:24,640
cannabis you know start off small and

3834
02:43:22,520 --> 02:43:25,560
work your way up it's not something

3835
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:27,799
where you

3836
02:43:25,559 --> 02:43:29,239
just I couldn't believe it novice

3837
02:43:27,799 --> 02:43:31,318
mistake I was thinking I'm a

3838
02:43:29,239 --> 02:43:33,398
professional 30 years doing this what

3839
02:43:31,318 --> 02:43:35,079
the hell and it got me but yeah it did

3840
02:43:33,398 --> 02:43:37,439
it did get my brain wrapped around this

3841
02:43:35,079 --> 02:43:39,079
kind of sacred plant um set and setting

3842
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:41,239
thing a lot clearer so I was very

3843
02:43:39,079 --> 02:43:44,879
appreciative for the lesson I think

3844
02:43:41,239 --> 02:43:48,600
people's definitions of a micro do is is

3845
02:43:44,879 --> 02:43:50,398
is not all on the same cuz like to me I

3846
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:53,559
hear people going well a micro do is

3847
02:43:50,398 --> 02:43:55,959
like 0.1 and I'm like 0.1 hey like

3848
02:43:53,559 --> 02:43:58,159
that's okay I guess I think you could

3849
02:43:55,959 --> 02:43:59,879
catch a buzz off that though like and

3850
02:43:58,159 --> 02:44:02,760
other people are doing much smaller

3851
02:43:59,879 --> 02:44:04,639
amounts so I think uh I think that data

3852
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:06,439
needs to get put together so people can

3853
02:44:04,639 --> 02:44:08,439
kind of all be on the same page what is

3854
02:44:06,439 --> 02:44:11,159
an accurate micro do because to me a

3855
02:44:08,439 --> 02:44:13,880
micro do is there's no psychedelic

3856
02:44:11,159 --> 02:44:15,760
effect there's no like butterflies in

3857
02:44:13,879 --> 02:44:17,879
your stomach there's no nothing you

3858
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:20,639
could literally like honestly just go

3859
02:44:17,879 --> 02:44:23,438
about your day but what you're talking

3860
02:44:20,639 --> 02:44:25,519
about is like something different the

3861
02:44:23,439 --> 02:44:27,559
the old uh I thought I was a

3862
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:30,640
professional and now I'm like how long

3863
02:44:27,559 --> 02:44:32,079
is this gonna be for again you know no I

3864
02:44:30,639 --> 02:44:33,398
app I really appreciate that thought

3865
02:44:32,079 --> 02:44:35,279
actually too because that's one of you

3866
02:44:33,398 --> 02:44:37,439
know with with in the with within the

3867
02:44:35,279 --> 02:44:39,079
world of cannabis you know kind of when

3868
02:44:37,439 --> 02:44:40,600
testing came along the biggest thing it

3869
02:44:39,079 --> 02:44:42,639
really helped to change and level the

3870
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:44,439
game up on was being able to start to

3871
02:44:42,639 --> 02:44:45,398
get towards a standardized dose

3872
02:44:44,439 --> 02:44:47,200
especially when you're making

3873
02:44:45,398 --> 02:44:49,478
manufactured products or edibles or

3874
02:44:47,200 --> 02:44:51,000
micro doing things you know because

3875
02:44:49,478 --> 02:44:53,799
that's such a great point you know kind

3876
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:55,959
of you know was it a 0.1 or point two

3877
02:44:53,799 --> 02:44:58,079
was it you know kind of albino penis

3878
02:44:55,959 --> 02:45:00,358
envy or was it this other type variety

3879
02:44:58,079 --> 02:45:02,318
you know and and so I think you know the

3880
02:45:00,359 --> 02:45:05,040
the identification of what even might I

3881
02:45:02,318 --> 02:45:07,559
mean or just you know if there's an

3882
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:08,960
agreeance on micro do is 0.1 you know

3883
02:45:07,559 --> 02:45:10,639
it's like there's that you know there's

3884
02:45:08,959 --> 02:45:13,519
that could vary very much between

3885
02:45:10,639 --> 02:45:15,879
varieties you know and so so kind of you

3886
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:17,800
I think um you know cannabis in such a

3887
02:45:15,879 --> 02:45:19,398
way you know it's what's really cool

3888
02:45:17,799 --> 02:45:20,920
just a random thought I've been working

3889
02:45:19,398 --> 02:45:21,760
on for a minute is you know everybody's

3890
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:23,960
freaking out like we're in the

3891
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:25,639
apocalypse you know and and in the

3892
02:45:23,959 --> 02:45:27,959
apocalypse the literal definition of the

3893
02:45:25,639 --> 02:45:30,159
word is time of Revelation or the great

3894
02:45:27,959 --> 02:45:31,919
unveiling you know and and so many ways

3895
02:45:30,159 --> 02:45:34,119
I can't help but feel the plants are the

3896
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:35,920
horsemen of this apocalypse you know

3897
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:37,240
with cannabis and hemp at the lead you

3898
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:38,760
know that are helping set the path

3899
02:45:37,239 --> 02:45:42,039
forward you know because you just see

3900
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:43,639
this rapid path of these other compounds

3901
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:46,359
and these other plants and fungi kind of

3902
02:45:43,639 --> 02:45:47,959
following lead in an accelerated way you

3903
02:45:46,359 --> 02:45:50,800
know but there you know these plants and

3904
02:45:47,959 --> 02:45:52,879
compounds and you know kind of companion

3905
02:45:50,799 --> 02:45:54,478
partner teacher plants you know that are

3906
02:45:52,879 --> 02:45:55,879
helping to empower us with all the tools

3907
02:45:54,478 --> 02:45:57,478
we need to make it through this time of

3908
02:45:55,879 --> 02:45:59,639
Revelation you know in the most

3909
02:45:57,478 --> 02:46:02,239
empowered and lifted way towards this

3910
02:45:59,639 --> 02:46:04,719
Ascension path you know well Alec you

3911
02:46:02,239 --> 02:46:06,159
really that that that's really important

3912
02:46:04,719 --> 02:46:07,840
and thank you for bringing that up

3913
02:46:06,159 --> 02:46:09,680
because I think that there's something

3914
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:11,760
you know we're trying to unwrap in the

3915
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:14,000
Cannabis industry this discussion around

3916
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:15,639
potency you know that we we all know

3917
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:18,040
it's not just THC we know there's a

3918
02:46:15,639 --> 02:46:19,478
whole synergistic thing going but I feel

3919
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:22,439
like the the the

3920
02:46:19,478 --> 02:46:25,478
the missing conversation there is the

3921
02:46:22,439 --> 02:46:28,680
set and setting is endogenous

3922
02:46:25,478 --> 02:46:29,879
count setting means we think of set and

3923
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:31,880
setting as all these things that are

3924
02:46:29,879 --> 02:46:34,039
around us but it's how the things around

3925
02:46:31,879 --> 02:46:40,039
US influence our own internal chemistry

3926
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:41,600
right and certain certain certain um

3927
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:43,240
certain cannabinoids and certain

3928
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:45,720
compounds certain psychedelics and stuff

3929
02:46:43,239 --> 02:46:47,959
really stimulate our own I mean anyone

3930
02:46:45,719 --> 02:46:51,000
who's taken psychedelics knows that as

3931
02:46:47,959 --> 02:46:53,438
soon as you it already starts right you

3932
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:55,159
start building that up because you that

3933
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:56,318
anticipation and the same thing with

3934
02:46:55,159 --> 02:46:59,239
cannabis there's certain cannabis

3935
02:46:56,318 --> 02:47:02,959
varieties that stimulate your

3936
02:46:59,239 --> 02:47:04,478
endogenous chemical Factory and they

3937
02:47:02,959 --> 02:47:07,639
interact like I feel like there's these

3938
02:47:04,478 --> 02:47:10,438
three intersecting lines of cannaboids

3939
02:47:07,639 --> 02:47:13,680
tpes and endogenous compounds and where

3940
02:47:10,439 --> 02:47:16,079
they intersect is where the potency lies

3941
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:18,040
and a big part of that is knowing like

3942
02:47:16,079 --> 02:47:20,120
hey there's a certain set and setting

3943
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:22,080
that is going to react to these

3944
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:25,600
particular chemicals and create this

3945
02:47:22,079 --> 02:47:27,959
other high and now that we're in the the

3946
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:31,079
pandemic the set and setting has changed

3947
02:47:27,959 --> 02:47:32,599
so much and for me in my life my set and

3948
02:47:31,079 --> 02:47:34,239
setting around cannabis completely

3949
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:36,880
shifted because for one I'm not with my

3950
02:47:34,239 --> 02:47:38,359
homies anymore I'm in my home office

3951
02:47:36,879 --> 02:47:40,599
with my family on the other side of the

3952
02:47:38,359 --> 02:47:43,559
wall you know it's a totally different

3953
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:44,840
relationship with the same plant and I

3954
02:47:43,559 --> 02:47:46,799
think that there's something there that

3955
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:49,680
there's certain varieties that really

3956
02:47:46,799 --> 02:47:52,000
trigger anxiety and C certain people if

3957
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:53,680
their set and setting isn't right you

3958
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,959
know but at the same time those same

3959
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:57,398
varieties are the ones that are

3960
02:47:54,959 --> 02:47:59,398
stimulate that intense psychoactive

3961
02:47:57,398 --> 02:48:01,680
experience if your set and setting is

3962
02:47:59,398 --> 02:48:04,119
right and people have kind of steered

3963
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:06,479
away from those varieties because they

3964
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:09,399
don't want to take the chance of having

3965
02:48:06,478 --> 02:48:11,358
a adverse reaction where they need to

3966
02:48:09,398 --> 02:48:14,358
really you know that's like riding that

3967
02:48:11,359 --> 02:48:16,079
Razor's Edge of where you're the

3968
02:48:14,359 --> 02:48:18,880
chemicals outside and the chemicals

3969
02:48:16,079 --> 02:48:21,398
inside are in complete Harmony that's

3970
02:48:18,879 --> 02:48:24,318
that whole human plant

3971
02:48:21,398 --> 02:48:27,478
experience that's really brilant honest

3972
02:48:24,318 --> 02:48:32,159
to be honest there is no one

3973
02:48:27,478 --> 02:48:35,679
potency because some people some people

3974
02:48:32,159 --> 02:48:38,719
old world oh sorry some people think

3975
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:42,680
potency is physical some people think

3976
02:48:38,719 --> 02:48:45,519
it's mental so there there is no one

3977
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:49,120
potency anymore than there's one

3978
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:51,680
cannabis for everybody there isn't it's

3979
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:55,359
I mean there can be things that people

3980
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:58,760
prefer and uh a lot of people prefer

3981
02:48:55,359 --> 02:49:02,359
very different things the most misc

3982
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:05,079
commmon ask people reach out to me for

3983
02:49:02,359 --> 02:49:07,120
specifically when looking for something

3984
02:49:05,079 --> 02:49:09,159
medically is they're looking for a

3985
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:12,040
cannabis that works specifically for

3986
02:49:09,159 --> 02:49:15,000
their issue it is still a dominant

3987
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:16,920
misinformation that's being perpetuated

3988
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:19,318
because when I make them aware that it's

3989
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:21,040
completely subjective and what if you

3990
02:49:19,318 --> 02:49:23,199
and I can have the same condition what

3991
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:25,840
works for you won't work for me and vice

3992
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:27,359
versa that's mindblowing to them they

3993
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:29,398
can't understand that we have to go

3994
02:49:27,359 --> 02:49:32,200
along the same process of trial and

3995
02:49:29,398 --> 02:49:37,519
error for you to find out what works for

3996
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:39,359
you there's no magic one of Sam and all

3997
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:42,159
those guys have not created that one

3998
02:49:39,359 --> 02:49:43,680
magic asthma Bud the one cancer can

3999
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:46,079
that's the one they what's specifically

4000
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:47,800
for this cancer that I could use and the

4001
02:49:46,079 --> 02:49:50,680
most frustrating thing that I have to

4002
02:49:47,799 --> 02:49:52,398
tell them is don't know we don't

4003
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:54,559
understand you're going to have to try

4004
02:49:52,398 --> 02:49:56,159
it by trial and error document and I

4005
02:49:54,559 --> 02:49:58,879
have them definitely write it down in a

4006
02:49:56,159 --> 02:50:01,920
notebook and you know document how they

4007
02:49:58,879 --> 02:50:04,238
feel when they take it you know uh what

4008
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:06,478
did they eat what were they feeling when

4009
02:50:04,238 --> 02:50:08,559
was on set and when did it finish so

4010
02:50:06,478 --> 02:50:11,478
that later on they can get

4011
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:13,439
an because they're in the experience

4012
02:50:11,478 --> 02:50:15,799
later they need to understand or their

4013
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:18,318
caretaker or person working with them or

4014
02:50:15,799 --> 02:50:20,959
their doctor is very helpful to take

4015
02:50:18,318 --> 02:50:23,079
that information so they can show what

4016
02:50:20,959 --> 02:50:26,719
you're using how much you're using what

4017
02:50:23,079 --> 02:50:29,039
you're using it for how much dosage and

4018
02:50:26,719 --> 02:50:31,519
uh how much is and how long is it

4019
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:34,160
lasting for those are all very helpful

4020
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:37,880
and all decision makers that you find in

4021
02:50:34,159 --> 02:50:40,719
what works for you so I I agree that

4022
02:50:37,879 --> 02:50:43,238
psycho dos are just as subjective as

4023
02:50:40,719 --> 02:50:45,760
cannabis and what would work for Debbie

4024
02:50:43,238 --> 02:50:48,238
for a micro do could be a potential

4025
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:50,359
heroic dose for someone else and a micro

4026
02:50:48,238 --> 02:50:52,760
do from turns out to be a heroic dose

4027
02:50:50,359 --> 02:50:54,279
for Debbie so you know it's it's still

4028
02:50:52,760 --> 02:50:56,760
rather fascinating but the most

4029
02:50:54,279 --> 02:51:00,439
frustrating thing to say is even after

4030
02:50:56,760 --> 02:51:03,238
all this and honestly is we don't know

4031
02:51:00,439 --> 02:51:06,720
and I think that Mo you were just saying

4032
02:51:03,238 --> 02:51:09,398
and also Alec is that this has always

4033
02:51:06,719 --> 02:51:11,519
been known because even when you go to

4034
02:51:09,398 --> 02:51:13,680
traditional people that dish out the

4035
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:17,359
medicine that prepare the medicine for

4036
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:21,318
you they hold the space they clear the

4037
02:51:17,359 --> 02:51:24,120
energy they CL they cast the spell all

4038
02:51:21,318 --> 02:51:26,959
of that is protection for your spirit

4039
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:26,960
it's protection

4040
02:51:27,159 --> 02:51:33,760
for organism with this plant so they're

4041
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:36,398
they're creating a space for you to be

4042
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:38,359
able to have a safe relationship you

4043
02:51:36,398 --> 02:51:42,559
know for lack of better words they're

4044
02:51:38,359 --> 02:51:45,359
creating soft padding so that your

4045
02:51:42,559 --> 02:51:48,680
relationship and and and they create a

4046
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:50,800
mediation so the epigenetics and and the

4047
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:53,800
situation and the cast and and the set

4048
02:51:50,799 --> 02:51:55,599
and setting is just all a part of that

4049
02:51:53,799 --> 02:51:58,079
same thing that we talk about with the

4050
02:51:55,600 --> 02:52:01,640
ancient settings of casting a spell and

4051
02:51:58,079 --> 02:52:04,478
Maria Sabina Mexico can look up Maria

4052
02:52:01,639 --> 02:52:08,599
Sabina for as one person who's done a

4053
02:52:04,478 --> 02:52:11,358
amazing work with uh with you know cubus

4054
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:13,120
and and pan in that whole Zone um also

4055
02:52:11,359 --> 02:52:15,279
just you know compounding medicines is

4056
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:17,760
really crucial and I think with with

4057
02:52:15,279 --> 02:52:20,800
micro doing especially you know it's the

4058
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:23,079
it's the compound in uh psychedelic you

4059
02:52:20,799 --> 02:52:26,599
know the mushrooms with other supportive

4060
02:52:23,079 --> 02:52:28,520
herbs in a capsule form you know so you

4061
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:30,720
can kind of say oh I'm going to take the

4062
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:33,279
same amount of capsule with all these

4063
02:52:30,719 --> 02:52:35,119
other supportive herbs so that my liver

4064
02:52:33,279 --> 02:52:37,680
is not too tuxed out if I'm going to

4065
02:52:35,120 --> 02:52:40,439
take it you know for a whole year or you

4066
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:40,439
know the kidneys

4067
02:52:40,559 --> 02:52:45,478
don't setting which is the is the

4068
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:48,640
protection as well you want to be able

4069
02:52:45,478 --> 02:52:50,959
to look towards not only the elders who

4070
02:52:48,639 --> 02:52:54,439
have held the medicine but also the

4071
02:52:50,959 --> 02:52:57,358
Elder the Elder herbs who have also been

4072
02:52:54,439 --> 02:52:59,880
compounded together forever and ever

4073
02:52:57,359 --> 02:53:01,840
they also help hold the set and setting

4074
02:52:59,879 --> 02:53:03,519
of what you're taking to create more of

4075
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:05,520
a protection of you having a

4076
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:08,079
relationship with that

4077
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:09,800
plan I I really appreciate that um you

4078
02:53:08,079 --> 02:53:12,520
know something I'd love to add in kind

4079
02:53:09,799 --> 02:53:14,679
of which it's a good conversation you

4080
02:53:12,520 --> 02:53:16,359
know kind of ties both of these topics

4081
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:18,520
in with what you were bringing up Mojave

4082
02:53:16,359 --> 02:53:20,479
kind of about that like the endogenous

4083
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:23,439
lead up to the kind of overall potency

4084
02:53:20,478 --> 02:53:25,840
of an experience you know CU it's so

4085
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:27,960
true across kind of plants and kind of

4086
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:29,680
the you know the Traditions were using

4087
02:53:27,959 --> 02:53:31,599
these context of they were using these

4088
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:33,439
plants and and you know to Debbie your

4089
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:35,680
point of kind of the you know just this

4090
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:37,159
that experience you know kind of uh you

4091
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:38,559
know it's you know just using cannabis

4092
02:53:37,159 --> 02:53:42,398
as an example you know it's fascinating

4093
02:53:38,559 --> 02:53:44,039
because um um you know like you know I'm

4094
02:53:42,398 --> 02:53:46,398
veteran in the Navy at T I know you're a

4095
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:47,800
veteran too as your soul um you know

4096
02:53:46,398 --> 02:53:49,760
I've worked with a lot of veterans over

4097
02:53:47,799 --> 02:53:51,318
the years to help kind of reframe their

4098
02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:52,840
experience with cannabis you know

4099
02:53:51,318 --> 02:53:54,639
because you know there's this thing that

4100
02:53:52,840 --> 02:53:57,600
can happen if you don't come to cannabis

4101
02:53:54,639 --> 02:54:00,719
correct it can slap you in a way that

4102
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:02,479
you'll creates such a Negative response

4103
02:54:00,719 --> 02:54:03,679
that you might not ever do it again and

4104
02:54:02,478 --> 02:54:06,119
so there's a lot of people that are

4105
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:08,720
first-time users that you know take some

4106
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:10,439
long break in between that start back uh

4107
02:54:08,719 --> 02:54:12,199
or people that kind of one day it just

4108
02:54:10,439 --> 02:54:13,720
shifts from taking way too big of a dose

4109
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:15,840
but it's kind of a respect and kind of

4110
02:54:13,719 --> 02:54:17,920
set and setting type Factor but it'll

4111
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:19,840
create this super negative reaction that

4112
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:22,000
you you know kind of leads to this oh

4113
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:23,318
it's maybe it's not for me anymore you

4114
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:25,159
know and and you hear all these

4115
02:54:23,318 --> 02:54:28,119
different people say oh the Canabis D is

4116
02:54:25,159 --> 02:54:28,119
so strong it's

4117
02:54:40,398 --> 02:54:45,959
it's and part of it is you know kind of

4118
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:47,799
immediately start micro doing THC and

4119
02:54:45,959 --> 02:54:51,079
you know having really elevated levels

4120
02:54:47,799 --> 02:54:53,639
of CBD or say CBG or something but then

4121
02:54:51,079 --> 02:54:56,959
it's it's the whole kind of the the the

4122
02:54:53,639 --> 02:54:59,199
ritual of like taking a bud and grinding

4123
02:54:56,959 --> 02:55:00,919
it up and you know kind of you know

4124
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:02,640
going through the process of rolling it

4125
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:05,200
you know and starting kind of almost set

4126
02:55:02,639 --> 02:55:07,639
your endogenous path kind of forward

4127
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:09,479
with it and you know kind of then you

4128
02:55:07,639 --> 02:55:11,639
know kind of taking that you know that

4129
02:55:09,478 --> 02:55:13,358
you rolled ritually in that way or

4130
02:55:11,639 --> 02:55:15,238
whatever the ritual is that you do with

4131
02:55:13,359 --> 02:55:17,318
it but it's putting attention into it in

4132
02:55:15,238 --> 02:55:19,318
that way and then it's doing something

4133
02:55:17,318 --> 02:55:21,799
that's associated with vable you know

4134
02:55:19,318 --> 02:55:23,119
like going and eating uh your favorite

4135
02:55:21,799 --> 02:55:25,599
dessert or going on a walk with your

4136
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:27,520
sweetie or going kind of you know out in

4137
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:28,920
the water or whatever it is that you

4138
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:31,560
know you would like but you know and

4139
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:33,799
then over time with cannabis you know

4140
02:55:31,559 --> 02:55:35,680
kind of from this protocol you know you

4141
02:55:33,799 --> 02:55:38,000
can kind of over time you know like

4142
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:40,600
keeping this ritual going you know this

4143
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:42,920
same process you know kind of over time

4144
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:45,600
you can start eventually titrating

4145
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:47,920
slowly titrating up your THC that's in

4146
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:50,680
that blend um and then all of a sudden

4147
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:52,520
you're bble to Puff tough with the best

4148
02:55:50,680 --> 02:55:54,279
of them you know like and start to

4149
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:56,800
really reshift your experience with

4150
02:55:54,279 --> 02:55:59,000
cannabis to appreciate and enjoy THC and

4151
02:55:56,799 --> 02:56:00,519
all the medicine it brings you know and

4152
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:02,359
and so I think kind of there's that's

4153
02:56:00,520 --> 02:56:03,920
such a big process with you know how

4154
02:56:02,359 --> 02:56:05,359
we're you know it's like like I used to

4155
02:56:03,920 --> 02:56:07,120
do a lot of Bud tedar educational

4156
02:56:05,359 --> 02:56:08,559
seminars at retail dispensaries and I

4157
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:10,880
would almost like I try to lecture them

4158
02:56:08,559 --> 02:56:13,199
about like you know how how sacred of a

4159
02:56:10,879 --> 02:56:14,679
role and acted is to be able to be this

4160
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:16,319
person to help share this experience

4161
02:56:14,680 --> 02:56:18,760
with somebody that's new that's never

4162
02:56:16,318 --> 02:56:20,920
done it before and how if you do that

4163
02:56:18,760 --> 02:56:22,439
wrong that could be on your karma you

4164
02:56:20,920 --> 02:56:24,960
know because you might have like just

4165
02:56:22,439 --> 02:56:27,520
dabbed out that old lady or like just

4166
02:56:24,959 --> 02:56:29,639
blasted them on that like chibu thousand

4167
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:31,520
milligram edible you know that they

4168
02:56:29,639 --> 02:56:32,760
might not ever smoke cannabis because

4169
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:34,560
again even though it might have been in

4170
02:56:32,760 --> 02:56:37,159
their Destiny to heal their cancer with

4171
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:39,719
this plant that you just did that dude

4172
02:56:37,159 --> 02:56:41,159
you know so take that responsibly and so

4173
02:56:39,719 --> 02:56:43,719
so just like kind of that understanding

4174
02:56:41,159 --> 02:56:45,478
with canvas I think goes triple so with

4175
02:56:43,719 --> 02:56:48,959
kind of all these like new kind of

4176
02:56:45,478 --> 02:56:48,959
emerging in

4177
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:16,000
is plants and and yeah just not taking

4178
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:17,840
it I mean taking it not taking for

4179
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:19,120
granted and taking it seriously just in

4180
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:21,359
you know how we do it and just the

4181
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:24,120
reverence we do it in and just knowing

4182
02:57:21,359 --> 02:57:26,159
you know what we're doing it hey happy

4183
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:27,680
belated Armistice Day to you I don't

4184
02:57:26,159 --> 02:57:29,439
considered Veterans Day because that's

4185
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:32,520
more propaganda for the industrial

4186
02:57:29,439 --> 02:57:34,398
military complex but having day belated

4187
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:36,880
and respect but with the veterans that

4188
02:57:34,398 --> 02:57:39,439
we're working with uh we all consider

4189
02:57:36,879 --> 02:57:41,519
cannabis our daily pallative because you

4190
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:43,880
know we have a daily acclimation to it

4191
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:46,238
and after 30 days arriving at regular

4192
02:57:43,879 --> 02:57:48,278
cognitive levels whereas we see

4193
02:57:46,238 --> 02:57:51,000
psychedelics and mushroom as the next

4194
02:57:48,279 --> 02:57:53,800
front for our veterans to really hit at

4195
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:56,318
the Deep issues even micro doing and

4196
02:57:53,799 --> 02:57:57,840
working with therapists and psychologist

4197
02:57:56,318 --> 02:58:01,039
to work through their post-traumatic

4198
02:57:57,840 --> 02:58:03,000
stress injury it's no longer PTSD people

4199
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:06,279
it's that's considered post-traumatic

4200
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:09,398
stress damage it is an injury so that's

4201
02:58:06,279 --> 02:58:11,920
why it's called ptsi now so that we can

4202
02:58:09,398 --> 02:58:14,680
realize that we can heal past these

4203
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:17,120
injuries um once we have the proper

4204
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:19,159
tools and tool sets in mind and we're

4205
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:22,399
finding a lot of Psych colle is willing

4206
02:58:19,159 --> 02:58:24,478
to now step over that line to work with

4207
02:58:22,398 --> 02:58:27,079
psychedelics to help a lot of these

4208
02:58:24,478 --> 02:58:30,039
people access their deeper traumas

4209
02:58:27,079 --> 02:58:32,159
through psychedelics so it's a new and

4210
02:58:30,040 --> 02:58:34,160
beautiful Frontier so if you're out

4211
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:36,920
there in Psychology now look into this

4212
02:58:34,159 --> 02:58:38,879
new uh front so that you can educate

4213
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:41,200
yourself and become one of those

4214
02:58:38,879 --> 02:58:43,278
therapists because there's millions of

4215
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:44,960
people who need psychedelic healing not

4216
02:58:43,279 --> 02:58:47,600
just our veterans we're just a small

4217
02:58:44,959 --> 02:58:49,278
subset are trying to prove fact as the

4218
02:58:47,600 --> 02:58:51,479
culture that we are and we are

4219
02:58:49,279 --> 02:58:53,479
establishing that and we're doing so so

4220
02:58:51,478 --> 02:58:57,039
that the larger society at General can

4221
