00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:42,159
yeah we'll be back go to the

10
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:46,439
corner going down so we don't shake

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:48,640
right the glasss here that's right a

12
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:53,280
little T glass after right perfect yeah

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
beautiful hey what we lose we lose

14
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,759

00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,359
got that I sure do

22
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,559
buddy might do something different but I

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,840
think it's going to

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,080
work just get it on there just smooth

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,520
side out yeah look at that

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,840
made glass yes now the glass is that's

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,480
the face up okay so this is down right

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,800
that's up cuz the bud just set it face

29
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,280
up it doesn't matter it's where all the

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,959
hash is just listen because I can't hold

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,560
this up any longer so you just have to

32
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,840
execute what I'm taking now that's no I

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,239
want you to put it up face up yes the

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,878
face up that way is face up okay all the

35
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
house no it's not you're oh right cuz

36
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,199
the B was

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,680
underne thank you for not like sometimes

38
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,878
you don't have to understand you just

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,239
have to cuz this is real heavy for me

40
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,799
I'm having a hard time holding it in

41
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,480
fact okay we oh there we go what do you

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,400
think there is like 5 6 7even lbs of

43
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:52,518
wheat on there Jesus no I don't think

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,760
two two well this that looks like at

45
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,719
least

46
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,318
two still it's a lot of weed should we

47
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,919
take these out uh no leave them there

48
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:03,318
for a second second we don't need the

49
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,199
anymore I'm going to figure this out

50
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,119
this is my 200 no this is my 300 so this

51
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,199
is a

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,719
screen that we'll put aside okay I can

53
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:17,839
make in here no that's not a good spot

54
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm thinking maybe and possibly right

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,878
here okay move bit Yeah can move these

56
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,598
guys a little bit yeah this is

57
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,840
perfect put this guy this is a 50 Micron

58
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,438
screen nothing follows through it

59
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,959
exactly okay it's very tight so that'll

60
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,519
be safe there you want to put these

61
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,239
blocks underneath this one I think it'll

62
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,039
be a good idea yeah just what you follow

63
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,599
you so yeah if you lift this screen up a

64
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,840
bit you'll see that that the majority of

65
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,959
that resin this resin right here is

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,400
right there okay oh yeah KN I had

67
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,598
already felt with my fingers on the

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,120
other side the side that had the herb

69
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,039
that's not where the resin was really

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,319
that's is no movement I oh when it was

71
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,598
wet I moved it but otherwise I haven't

72
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,359
touched it absolutely great hopefully

73
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,878
hopefully it works good what else could

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,079
we use we could use put this look at

75
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,078
that right

76
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,760
there I'll wa for that for well this is

77
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,760
just something that we can put resir the

78
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,759
buds in okay the Finish What is that in

79
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,478
there right now it's it's just a

80
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,279
leftover residue from I'm going to rinse

81
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,360
it out real quick

82
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,519
first okay I'm going to take this off

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,720
cuz I'll get one off all right

84
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:34,560
so we've got a couple of pounds of herb

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:39,000
on our 200 lines per in screen this

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,160
is 140 Micron 140 mic on this screen

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,360
it's all buds popcorn buds this is

88
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,199
definitely like people would buy this

89
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,680
this is 100% like sellable

90
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,478
herb but uh we're not going to be doing

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,879
that with it we're going to be

92
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:54,240
extracting the resin off of it we've

93
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,879
also got some of this stuff which is

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,840
herb that was run through the spin Pro

95
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,439
the I'm not sure if you guys are

96
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,239
familiar with the little spin Pro one of

97
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:06,560
the trimming machines but that is what

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,478
that was run through with these are just

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,600
little popcorn buds bottoms of the

100
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,240
plants that never really you know

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,039
there's still some substantial nugs and

102
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,439
they

103
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:19,918
are perfectly dried

104
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,918
so should be

105
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,680
good so I've got a piece of glass here

106
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,560
that I'm using as the

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,639
base I

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,639
usually go right onto a

109
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,120
a 70

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,680
Micron

111
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,439
but I've

112
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:46,918
got the glass here it should make for

113
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:49,759
nice photographic and

114
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:54,000
video there's already a tiny bit of dry

115
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
sip on this just

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,280
from oh this looks like it's been really

117
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,280
dried properly Ron huh it looks like

118
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,279
it's been well well dried it's the resin

119
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,638
is very um just out in the room orange

120
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,198
no nothing else just going on it

121
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,759
excellent well let's don't heat it all

122
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,759
set up our

123
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,639
screen do I get in the way of the camera

124
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,800
if I go over there if you stand right in

125
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,639
front of it you'll be in the way but

126
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,960
only there otherwise you can go stand

127
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,840
over there problem a second yeah

128
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,959
yeah all right

129
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:33,000
so almost did you bring that thin in

130
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:36,399
right there all right so water I think

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,519
what a good idea will be is to for us to

132
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,318
put some of this Herb in this

133
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,519
bin and make make some room off of our

134
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,520
table the

135
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:53,038
flaw yeah it's not like you can't dry

136
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,038
sift with this much material on a

137
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
screen but I find it's nice to just make

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,759
a little bit of

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,720
room this is a lot of material I know

140
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,000
you you don't think so but please this

141
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,240
is a couple of

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,959
pounds okay there that's good so we'll

143
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,160
put this right

144
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,719
here right next to your element there or

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,039
your little

146
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,240
thermometer try to keep clean I try to

147
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:20,519
keep a nice

148
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,319
clean we don't

149
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,000
want well yeah right and if you end it

150
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,960
up on right here it's going to end up

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,560
going how was it supp glass had some cut

152
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,198
glass pretty good not it's it's great

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,439
great I love it you cut the glass too

154
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,560
yeah very nice cool I had Di and double

155
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,038
the Ed I mean it's it's nice to have you

156
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,759
know it'll be nice to see see the res I

157
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,279
took the H with me and showed him it at

158
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,120
the glass Speedy Glass I said this is

159
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,839
cash I want it to be perfect size so a

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,139
little

161
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,239
bigger that's

162
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,079
[Music]

163
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,360
awesome nothing you get that through

164
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,878
that screen I said yeah that's funny no

165
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,800
no that's how it works so I'm just

166
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,479
gently sort of gently remove removing

167
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,199
the buds can you check the back of the

168
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,560
camera screen and see if my head's cut

169
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,079
off at all Rong it's right in there but

170
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,839
but is my head out of the camera shot

171
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,478
perfect cool I always like to know I

172
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,478
hate to do videos for you guys and then

173
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,199
have be like halfway out of the camera

174
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,878
or something so yeah so yeah this is

175
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,158
nice if you look under here Ron while

176
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm moving this around you can see the

177
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:25,519
resin falling yeah you see it yeah isn't

178
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
that nice now the more the more

179
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,758
aggressive I am the more contaminant

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,200
will go through now of course it's

181
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,759
always easy making hash with half a

182
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,320
pound of bone dry bud that's covered in

183
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,519
resin this isn't a

184
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,360
real difficult thing we're going to get

185
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,120
a good amount just because we're using a

186
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,039
good

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,080
amount so I'll gently move these buds

188
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,958
around and then what I'll do is we'll

189
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,920
lift the screen up and we'll check the

190
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,239
resin we'll pile it all up with the card

191
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,078
into my first pile and from there I'll

192
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,759
Dr dry sift probably more with this

193
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,879
particular M uh material and I'll put

194
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,759
the second wash of this material over

195
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,200
here not that it's a wash but the second

196
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,039
sift and I sort of do that with each

197
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,560
material when I'm done this I'll put it

198
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:15,679
in another bucket and we'll take the

199
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,719
fresh out of here and we'll sift that

200
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,039
and that first sift will go into the

201
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,000
pile next to the pile of this first sift

202
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,759
once I get those piles then I'm going to

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,360
clean each one individually through the

204
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,600
tighter screen which is sitting over

205
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,360
here I'll doing I'll be doing cing

206
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,040
techniques and uh you know it's funny

207
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,440
right now we're in a room it's not super

208
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,759
warm in here but I can easily be outside

209
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,079
doing this right now I think when we do

210
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,519
the cleaning on the second screen we'll

211
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,199
go outside and do that part we got the

212
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,519
cold why not we'll probably show you

213
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,680
that guys that tomorrow uh tomorrow

214
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,360
morning so all right

215
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,519
so what was that a couple that wasn't

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,519
much rubbing at all eh 4

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,879
minutes okay okay so got a little bit of

218
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,160
powpow

219
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,519
there I'm going to be gentle though you

220
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:11,679
see how stuff somehow managed to get

221
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,078
through it was probably there

222
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,679
before I thought I had cleaned the glass

223
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,639
super good but it's very easy for little

224
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:23,879
pieces it's also what I

225
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,439
cleaned um underneath the glass cuz

226
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,000
sometimes if a leaf is under the glass

227
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,399
and you think you know you think it's

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,200
over the glass you kind of try to clean

229
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,200
it a little harder

230
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,359
[Applause]

231
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,519
than really loving the color on nice

232
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,480
yeah it's a really you know when you're

233
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,799
making dry sift I know people think it's

234
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,360
great to see this golden or this white

235
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,439
almost clear hash you know those are

236
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,800
immature heads that have not been cured

237
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,440
this is Hash that fresh frozen basically

238
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,159
right you take the fresh frozen bud and

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,839
you run it it makes beautiful bubble but

240
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:14,078
it it doesn't have that same like dry

241
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,440
cured look that you get from from the

242
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:16,439
dry

243
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:23,439
sift what do you think of that little

244
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:26,078
pile Ron not bad eh not too bad you know

245
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,880
it was very gentle the quality looks

246
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,958
like it's

247
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:33,200
there and the of course I'll need to

248
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:35,518
clean it sh yeah we're dry sifting here

249
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
Darren we're just doing our dry sift we

250
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,320
got it going on we're making a little

251
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,799
video for YouTube so we've done our

252
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,480
first screening we'll probably go back

253
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,639
to doing much more of the same thing and

254
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,879
once I've got a bunch more piles of this

255
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,560
we're going to come back and we're going

256
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:53,120
to do our secondary screen so we'll see

257
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,119
you in just a

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,159
bit okay I have since doubled my

259
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,159
producing abilities I've got my second

260
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:09,159
set of screens here on this one I have U

261
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,958
my 110 is the 140 microns and then

262
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:14,639
underneath that I've got a 70 Micron and

263
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,399
I've got cardboard under that we're not

264
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,839
going to be carding anything right here

265
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,720
but I thought at least it would be a

266
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,519
good idea to get this

267
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,160
material some of it out on the

268
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,159
screen I'm thinking if I can get most of

269
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,159
it

270
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,320
there I'll be able to use this

271
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,720
container to pick up some of this

272
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,958
material we've already

273
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,440
run

274
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,439
so easy

275
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,560
enough scoop it right into the

276
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,480
bucket doesn't matter if I get all 100%

277
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,679
of it basically I just this is material

278
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,120
I've run

279
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,359
once and so I'll putting it over to the

280
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,120
side for

281
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,159
now right here

282
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,440
actually and

283
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:13,519
then get some of this

284
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,320
guy over clean the screen a little bit

285
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,360
you always want to make sure you're over

286
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,440
glass if you don't have your cardboard

287
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
that's the nice thing about having the

288
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,680
cardboard piece taped under the other

289
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,319
screen now keep in mind I have two

290
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,679
screens and the resin is only going to

291
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,800
fall onto the second screen that second

292
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,799
screen is not going going to be

293
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,078
releasing anything

294
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,519
readily uh through it that's really

295
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,120
where you have to do the carting work

296
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,240
and that doesn't happen just easily

297
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,480
so we're

298
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,360
okay very tough work I I would like to

299
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,600
not have the space that I have between

300
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,480
these two screens right now I'm getting

301
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,199
a lot of uh

302
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,320
contaminant so what I think I'm going to

303
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:59,639
do is lift this up push it right to the

304
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,360
end I don't want that contaminant

305
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,278
falling through it's cleanliness is

306
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Godliness in this you really want to

307
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:08,639
keep a nice clean area you don't want to

308
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,278
be too violent of course this work can

309
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,959
be done with a tumbler you don't need to

310
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,159
do this the way I'm doing it I like the

311
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,599
Hands-On feeling I like the Hands-On

312
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,399
approach it lets me know the resin that

313
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,720
I'm working with how sticky it is how

314
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,799
much is present just from doing a quick

315
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,759
little bounce like this and of course

316
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,319
we'll probably bubble all of this

317
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,720
material when we're done so I'm going to

318
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,120
be doing this for a short bit longer and

319
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,600
we'll show you what we

320
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,720
got all right so we've

321
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,159
gently gently rub the buds over the top

322
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,120
of the screen and we're going to sort of

323
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,078
lift it up real gently here and see what

324
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,078
we've what we've

325
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,958
acquired really nice

326
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:05,000
color right right texture it's very

327
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:09,879
grainy I'd say we

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,879
uh we got a real nice material out of

329
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,639
this all

330
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:30,958
right time to make some dry

331
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,959
sift it's cold night out there boys

332
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,439
that's nice and

333
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,040
cold nice and cold

334
00:15:49,799 --> 00:16:01,529
[Applause]

335
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:07,678
[Applause]

336
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,800
all right so this bud is cold it just

337
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:37,240
came out of I don't know minus

338
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:37,240
10 so I can feel the cold in this

339
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,720
Bud nice material to be dry sifting and

340
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,879
I'm putting quite a bit of material on

341
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,800
there

342
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:53,838
but why not we

343
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,838
can we'll just do some nice

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,519
gentle I've

345
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,519
uh yeah I'm going to be in this material

346
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,560
that's how I'm going to go about

347
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,480
cleaning

348
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,958
it um I do have a variety of ways I can

349
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,078
go about cleaning it the way I'm going

350
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:14,279
to go about cleaning it is a cting

351
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:18,318
technique and it's easier if I'm gentle

352
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:20,558
with the resin rather than extreme so

353
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,759
you don't want to really like be super

354
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,519
violent with it you can if you want but

355
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,400
you're going to be spending more time

356
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,078
cleaning that resin it's not really

357
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,759
worth the feeling of like oh yeah I got

358
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,399
so much it's like yeah you got so much

359
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,919
contaminant I just really want the Hees

360
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,120
so I will start grinding down some of

361
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,240
the popcorn nugs to access those this is

362
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,599
extremely dry material which is great

363
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,599
for dry sifting people ask me all the

364
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,678
time hey does it need to be dry pretty

365
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:51,439
much it's right in the name first word

366
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,880
dry dry sifting dry material it's a good

367
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,038
idea to make it dry it's not a misnomer

368
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,440
it's really it's it's dry we want it dry

369
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:01,480
and uh

370
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,279
really some of the most successful

371
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,960
stuff is

372
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:10,839
um move this doesn't need to sit there

373
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,840
in the light like

374
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,759
that all

375
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:27,759
right okay so like to keep a nice clean

376
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,918
Zone when I'm dry

377
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,798
sifting I don't mind if the leaf goes on

378
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,360
the ground but I really hate it being on

379
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:36,639
my underlining glass I hate it being on

380
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,359
the glass anywhere actually I would have

381
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,880
normally if you are going to cut glass

382
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,119
for the bottom of your screen I would

383
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,080
cut it the same size as the frame of

384
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,879
your screen not bigger that way when

385
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:50,839
leaves go over the the frame that you

386
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,400
won't be in a situation where uh it's it

387
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,119
ends up falling on the glass and then I

388
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,880
walk by and I blow it under and then

389
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,319
when I lift up the screen and look you

390
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
know you end up finding buds like

391
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,399
that

392
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:09,400
so let's check and see what we've

393
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:14,519
got this gently put here nice and

394
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,519
gent and we'll see what we've got

395
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,618
[Applause]

396
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,798
great color on this

397
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,480
resin not sure how

398
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:49,759
well all of you can see

399
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:53,759
but it is really nice

400
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,759
color resing

401
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:05,480
so not an ginormous amount by anyone's

402
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:08,400
standers but you know another nice

403
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,400
secondary pile

404
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,000
of sometimes I'll

405
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,480
just I guess we can pull out

406
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,158
the actual metal card that I have for

407
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,679
the glass it'll

408
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:35,760
probably work pretty

409
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,759
good oh yeah it does look at that

410
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,200
oops using a V Syndicate nice little

411
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:49,798
glass bubbleman card got a couple of

412
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,798
piles

413
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:02,639
there all right so there's our

414
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:06,720
material got a little hair in there and

415
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:10,640
some other things it's by no means pure

416
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:14,679
heads I would say that it's

417
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,880
um probably a good 70%

418
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:23,000
contaminant but that's not to be really

419
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:27,559
that's not a huge surprise I was uh

420
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,558
making it quite roughly

421
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,159
all right and there's our other little

422
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,480
pile doing

423
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,700
[Applause]

424
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,159
great all right so we've done a bunch of

425
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,440
dry

426
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,400
sifting not a Bunch but a little bit and

427
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,558
we're going to take this

428
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,720
screen and just place it gently over

429
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,720
here um never a bad idea to have these

430
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,038
little guys helping you out as well I

431
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,400
don't actually have them over here but

432
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,599
it's a good idea if you do have them

433
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,200
how's it going Ron good great excellent

434
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,839
just got out of the garden did you yeah

435
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,319
done all right so check it

436
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,038
out that's a good P but that's got to be

437
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,480
still clean day yeah yeah I'm going to

438
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,919
clean it pretty nice well that's what

439
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm saying all I know is I want I want

440
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,720
us to have it's a great coloror nice

441
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,720
color we should have um this is properly

442
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,360
cured resin and I was trying to explain

443
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,120
to the people out there that you know

444
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,399
nowadays it's a young group of people

445
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:49,038
making this uh making water hash and

446
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,600
they're all really stoked on fresh

447
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:55,038
frozen so the resin glands never really

448
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,839
have any time to to dry properly to to

449
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,679
cure properly and when I mean cure I

450
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,480
mean the difference

451
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,480
between the

452
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,120
resin M the wax membrane drying and

453
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,120
shriveling up you can really see it in

454
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,239
macro photography I can show you the

455
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,879
pictures and um the difference between a

456
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,480
swollen full head that's got moisture in

457
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,640
it clearly still and one that doesn't so

458
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,599
we got a couple of nice piles there how

459
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,840
much fluffy more than sticky though I

460
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,639
well because it's still going to be

461
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:29,439
contaminated by uh you know I'd say at

462
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,080
least 70% maybe 60 yeah but that doesn't

463
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,038
mean I won't get like out of these two

464
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,558
piles out of this pile here I make it a

465
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,480
pile like that of pure

466
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:40,639
heads worth your time that's I listen

467
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,079
it's going to be great it's always worth

468
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,440
the time so cuz it's always that's nice

469
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,038
it's it's nice you can if you can use

470
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,440
material that you don't really want to

471
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:55,679
put in uh you know for any other use

472
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,679
exactly nice have use

473
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:04,920
[Applause]

474
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,920
[Music]

475
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,960
all right so we've got into the next

476
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,720
step here we had the10 line per in

477
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,720
screens which

478
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:24,558
are 140 Micron those 140 Micron screens

479
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,679
that I was bouncing the 3 to 4 lbs over

480
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,678
um I was bouncing gently at first got a

481
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,278
little more rough uh later on I'm not

482
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,519
trying to get a ton I'm trying to get

483
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,839
quality uh I managed to get these two

484
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,038
piles here this pile actually looks

485
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:38,519
quite decent even as you see as I broke

486
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,480
it you can see the whole thing moved as

487
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:45,038
a pile that's a good sign um still

488
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,519
probably 60% contaminant and then over

489
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:52,679
here uh on my screen on my 70 Micron

490
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:56,200
screen this is a 200 lines per inch and

491
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,519
the 200 lines per in screen 70 microns

492
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,440
is the screen that we'll work with to do

493
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:05,558
our carding so I have a piece of

494
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,558
cardboard like

495
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,319
this taped to the bottom of this screen

496
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,839
it's not really going to put a lot of

497
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:16,839
material through but

498
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:19,158
um I'll actually uh end up working on

499
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:23,798
this screen the other way I'm going to

500
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,799
get all this resin off put it on the

501
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,320
glass and then I'm going to flip this

502
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,319
screen over

503
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:36,398
over and I'll actually work on the glass

504
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,240
with the cardboard off cuz I like to

505
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:40,918
work on the top of the screen when I'm

506
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,558
doing this part I don't like to be in

507
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,840
the screen you know it like the way it

508
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:49,278
works out with the herb that's great but

509
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:52,558
this was a little bit

510
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:55,960
different all right

511
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:59,149
so real quick

512
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,150
[Applause]

513
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,398
all right clean off the resin off of

514
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,640
that

515
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:17,959
screen then we

516
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,960
will take the tape off the

517
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,880
sides all

518
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,880
right that one

519
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,038
I just came over today on the plane

520
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,038
that's why I originally tap these up I'm

521
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,240
always nervous with my screens oops that

522
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,919
they're going to be

523
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,440
punctured don't really want them to

524
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,880
be punctured so when you travel with

525
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,440
them it's a good idea to have them uh

526
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
protected like this and this is just a

527
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,960
nice thick corrugated

528
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,519
plywood um it'll protect your

529
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,480
screens and I'm sure that some ice wax

530
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,079
guy out there is going to say hey you

531
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,480
can just use parchment paper trust me

532
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,558
parchment paper is not thick enough to

533
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,679
protect your screen you're going to want

534
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:14,759
a nice thick cardboard for

535
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:17,759
sure all right so we got this

536
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:20,079
guy I'll kind of get this so

537
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:24,599
ready got a little bit of resin on this

538
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,599
screen so we might as well save it

539
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,079
all

540
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,839
Hees we make a nice picture probably do

541
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:38,000
it

542
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,398
tomorrow but yeah getting a picture of

543
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,798
just the heads on the glass would be

544
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:41,798
nice I'm

545
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,080
certain all right so let's

546
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:53,079
see bring these guys all the way over

547
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,079
here

548
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,890
[Applause]

549
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,759
all

550
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:31,319
right a nice working space for our

551
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,720
screen because we've got a great size

552
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:35,759
screen you can understand that you don't

553
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:41,038
need to

554
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:44,480
have um a pound of resin to work with to

555
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,480
Warrant this size

556
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,559
screen it's

557
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,159
doable

558
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:55,038
with a smaller amount you can keep your

559
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,799
separate grades here at the bottom and

560
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:01,679
then slowly work your carded resin

561
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,720
in the middle now some of you might not

562
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,880
understand what I mean by carded I'm

563
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,759
going to show some photos in this

564
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,640
tutorial of

565
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,000
tricomes and right now I'm going to be

566
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,320
showing one so when you look at this

567
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,679
Tricom you'll see that it has a long

568
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:19,759
capitate stock that's its body it grows

569
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,640
out of a leaf it's the cannabis plant

570
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,798
and then on top there's a nice bulbous

571
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,720
head and inside that head are all the

572
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,240
wonderful medicinal benefits that we get

573
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,839
from Cannabis uh as well as the tpin and

574
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,038
the terpenoids the flavors and the

575
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:37,959
tastes they're all in this glandular

576
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:40,398
drom head and so when we make a dry sift

577
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,278
single screen extraction what we get are

578
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,439
tricomes we get the glandular head we

579
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,919
get the capitate stock we get the cyth

580
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,399
hair which is a non- glandular material

581
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,159
that looks like a capitate stock but it

582
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:53,639
has no it has no head and it kind of

583
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,679
points out at the end I'll show one of

584
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,600
those as well and what these things are

585
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,960
is they're gold to look at to the naked

586
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,079
eye when they're mixed with heads they

587
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,720
look gold you think you might have gold

588
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:04,278
I can guarantee you this is massively

589
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,079
contaminated because we've only run it

590
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:08,839
through the one screen and we weren't

591
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,240
Uber Uber gentle um what I'm going to do

592
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,359
now is I'm going to take this um

593
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,079
actually I think we should do this

594
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:18,000
outside so I'll set this up outside and

595
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:21,119
we'll be right back hey how's it going

596
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,919
everybody bubble man here I'm out in the

597
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,319
cies in some beautiful - 10 or so

598
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,640
weather a little bit of a chilly night

599
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,519
there's a lot of snow all around me

600
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,519
um Ron's been so gracious as to light me

601
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,519
up with the T5 so we've got some good

602
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:37,120
light I figured it was a good idea to

603
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,480
come out here to do the final part of

604
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,000
the process and what that is we've

605
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,240
already single screen sifted our our dry

606
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,679
sift uh we've got three decent piles

607
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,038
right here got a couple of different

608
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,840
cards I'm going to be playing around

609
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,440
with different thicknesses of plastic um

610
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,439
My Buddy Darren talks about having some

611
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,960
good luck with the iTunes plastic car it

612
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,919
says he's collecting a lot of uh

613
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,960
contaminant on one side and heads on the

614
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,399
other so that's great

615
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,759
um we can experiment with a little bit

616
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,558
of that but mostly what I want to do

617
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,480
today is show you um the simple process

618
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:10,398
of cing the material I can already feel

619
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,240
the resins cold and I love that I love

620
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:16,839
that it's cold this is a great

621
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,278
environment for dry sifting so um we're

622
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:22,319
going to spread our our resin across the

623
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:27,000
screen nice and

624
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,000
gently get it nicely spread

625
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,879
you know much the way I tell people when

626
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:37,599
they're drawing bubble the

627
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:41,159
thinner spread you can get it the better

628
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,158
few little pieces of contaminant

629
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,480
there and just

630
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:50,000
gently carding it over now this screen

631
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,240
is quite light or this card I should say

632
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
we' got a thicker card here I'm used to

633
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,200
a card more along this lines I can

634
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,119
really press it through I don't want to

635
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,360
be too hard hard when I'm pressing but

636
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,879
definitely want to do some of that

637
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:07,439
pressing keep in mind this dry sift is

638
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,480
probably 70%

639
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,960
contaminant um it's great to be dry

640
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,639
sifting in the winter it's great to be

641
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,919
surrounded by snow I hope tomorrow to

642
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:19,359
make some bubble hash using snow uh to

643
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,320
cool our water now we'll still use some

644
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:25,519
ice to um actually break the heads off

645
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:28,038
of their bodies but we're going to use

646
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,038
snow

647
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:33,119
uh to cool the water and yes when we

648
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,558
cool the water with the snow we will

649
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,719
filter that water through a 25 micron

650
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,398
bag and remove any dust debris rocks any

651
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,399
dirt that would be in the snow we're

652
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:43,759
using pretty clean snow that we find

653
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,119
just up the mountain behind my buddy's

654
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,398
place here

655
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,839
but it still can have some dirt in it so

656
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,319
it's good to clean

657
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:55,558
out so this process is a very slow

658
00:32:53,319 --> 00:33:00,158
process it's not one that you're going

659
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:02,720
to um do quickly um it's

660
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,720
counterintuitive the faster you try the

661
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,200
slower your work will

662
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,798
become uh I can't say enough about the

663
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,798
cold it's really making the resin feel

664
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,439
great and so just gently I've also

665
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,840
should mention I have a piece of

666
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:24,480
cardboard that I've placed underneath

667
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:27,038
this screen so it's the same size as the

668
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,720
um screen frame and so not that it's

669
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,200
going to capture a lot of valuable

670
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,360
things but any heads that are smaller

671
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,000
than 70 Micron and a lot of capitate

672
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:36,119
stocks and cyith hairs will eventually

673
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,119
be pushed through this screen and so of

674
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,359
course it's a good idea to have

675
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,398
something to capture that and so that's

676
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,359
what we have we have uh you know you can

677
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,759
use glass you can use plexiglass you can

678
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:47,199
you can use whatever you want I used

679
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,319
cardboard in this instance because it

680
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,159
was easy to bring it outside glass is a

681
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:54,038
little bit more dangerous to to move and

682
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,240
it makes things heavier this table is a

683
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:58,558
little bit uh uh shaky as well so I

684
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,919
didn't want heavy glass on it so the

685
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,720
cardboard works great for that it's just

686
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:07,399
collecting resin that I'm mostly using

687
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,199
in metales so so um for a small pile of

688
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:14,039
dry sift like this you can easily work

689
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:17,078
it for 20 30 even 40 minutes and in that

690
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:21,079
time you would clean this pile down

691
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,079
to you know anywhere

692
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,838
from down to 20% of what's here to even

693
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,320
down as far as

694
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,639
5 to

695
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,599
10% so it's pretty incredible how much

696
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,599
you can lose I'm noticing uh in the cold

697
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,000
here that the resin's not sticking to my

698
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:44,200
card that's really

699
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,199
nice um I'm really quite happy with

700
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,119
that so I won't be filming the whole

701
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,880
time I carred all these resins out but

702
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,680
I'll end up showing you some photos of

703
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,800
the

704
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:03,719
before uh the sum during and the

705
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,960
eventual after of the product that I

706
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:09,039
make and uh yeah just thought I'd show

707
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,119
you a cool simple way to do some dry

708
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,320
sifting you've got your first screen if

709
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,280
you're buying a mesh screen please

710
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,519
understand that it's uh it's marked

711
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,560
lines per inch uh that's silk if you buy

712
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:22,599
silk screen it's always going to be in

713
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,358
lines per inch don't go asking for

714
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,400
micron sizes okay I'm going to give you

715
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,039
a quick explanation right now the two

716
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,800
screens that I promote for my dry

717
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:36,480
sifting are a 110 line per inch okay a

718
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,119
110 is actually a 140 Micron okay the

719
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,000
secondary screen that I'm using is a 200

720
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,559
lines per inch screen this screen is

721
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,599
actually 70 microns you see with lines

722
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,599
per inch as the number gets higher the

723
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,359
hole actually gets smaller this is very

724
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,480
confusing to a lot of people they don't

725
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,400
understand the differences between the

726
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,000
lines per inch in the Micron there are

727
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,240
simple conversion charts that you can

728
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,719
google and find online you can also buy

729
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,519
the book hashish by Robert conell Clark

730
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,639
he has a wonderful uh conversion chart

731
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,880
in there as well as um incredible

732
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:10,118
information both historically and um the

733
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,400
technical aspects of making hash and

734
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:15,039
even the science behind the Tricom so I

735
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,559
urge you to pick that book up of course

736
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,159
Amazon and all these places have it and

737
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,639
uh we sell it as well at fresh.com

738
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,358
so yeah I'm going to keep on doing a

739
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,879
little bit of dry sifting out here it's

740
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,880
2:00 in the morning I'm in the cies I'm

741
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,960
having a great time time we'll talk to

742
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,960
you guys soon in bubble Man's World

743
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Peace

744
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,719
f
