00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,640
somewhere heady to smoke this

47
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,478
oh there's a nice bench we can find

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
sound will probably be messed up

49
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,759
yeah yeah exactly we'll do it we'll do

50

i'm here with dom from up and smoke aka

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,520
the meme dealer what's going on

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
and you know what you do with your hash

54
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,399
that's not dabbable

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
you [ __ ] roll hazel's with it so we

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
are look at that

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,879
boom there's a hazel right there this is

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
how it comes

59
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,239
got a little thc symbol on it i haven't

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
even seen this yet nope

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,759
we'll get to uh unwrap it here together

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,759
so we're just gonna smoke our own for

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,318
covid's safety probably not the safest

64
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,159
thing to do

65
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,919
pass joints around right now maybe a

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,000
little bit uh

67
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,679
uh irresponsible if you will so we're

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
gonna we've each bought our own

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
i was pretty stoked on the price i think

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
i paid

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,319
would you say about 27 bucks yeah yeah

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,840
so 27 bucks each this is this is within

73
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,679
the range in fact it's a little bit

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,759
cheaper than the price that these were

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
back in the day when they were available

76
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,439
through compassion clubs and legacy

77
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,159
markets you can confirm or not confirm

78
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,919
with me

79
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,079
in the comments section of this video to

80
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,919
let me know what you what you see

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,959
and i guess uh i'm gonna try and open

82
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:03,119
this bad boy up you had like the

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:08,480
just kind of wrapped up and these little

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,080
little tubes almost the tubers

85
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,598
all right now we gotta open up the

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
packaging it looks like where you push

87
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,039
the sides right

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,640
yeah these ones are really tough to open

89
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,079
i can do that for if you want well i

90
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,559
remembered you have to

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
pinch all three sides all right make

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,479
sure that's broken and then

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
yeah pinch the sides really hard for any

94
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,759
lps watching this

95
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
these are literally the worst containers

96
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,479
that you can use

97
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,479
uh gage i'm looking at you

98
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,639
these are not very friendly to people

99
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,039
with oops and issues

100
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,639
oops you know what for us this was

101
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,079
chosen to try and get the product to

102
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,679
market but i agree with dom

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
it's not the best best ideal packaging

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
but

105
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,759
it has secured the hash joint in a way

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,519
that the hash joint is not broken and so

107
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,759
that's kind of the key

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
and so i guess uh yeah you light yours

109
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,438
up shout out to

110
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,560
hayward and cheryl the creators of the

111
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,639
hazel

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
i'm uh really proud of you guys and

113
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,798
stoked to see you

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,280
having this product come to market it's

115
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,959
uh

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,840
pretty darn cool all right so we'll just

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
slide that one

118
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,959
out

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
really easy to light these just kind of

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,839
start

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,280
heating them up the lighter and they'll

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,198
just catch themselves and it looks like

123
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,000
it's just going to keep itself going

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,840
it's got a real nice nice cedrine how

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,879
about that for a terpene

126
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,359
beta caryophyllene beta-mercine

127
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,918
alpha said dream and beta that's

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
obviously

129
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,359
terpenes but it does smell good you

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,479
don't speak terpenes damn

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,120
dom i thought you were like legit

132
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,839
so there we go there's one for me the

133
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,399
cultivar

134
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,560
is the death bubba and i'm gonna borrow

135
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,959
your lighter

136
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,240
we do ask that you hold it in your hand

137
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,599
and light it just the way dom was

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,680
mentioning it holding in your mouth and

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
lighting it it is a fairly big hole down

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
the center

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
and if you hold it in your mouth and

142
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,959
light it you could suck the flame in and

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,720
it's not the most

144
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,680
ideal situation so i'm really excited i

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,320
don't

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:13,360
smoke joints very often but when i do

147
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,360
they are pure hash

148
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
no smoke nice

149
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,839
maybe a half gram is a lot for one

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
person but i think it's the perfect

151
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,319
amount for me and marcus here

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
full gram it's a full grammy it's a full

153
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,000
gram we're gonna we're gonna smoke the

154
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,240
whole

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
gram that's that's what's up right there

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
we're we're down in these things we

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,038
gotta sit here for at least 20 more

158
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,519
minutes and smoke this joint while

159
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,879
people honk while construction is going

160
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,240
on when people are trying to back into

161
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,159
their parking spots

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,918
right in the core of the city here good

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,560
idea on the shades dom

164
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,560
that's smoke

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,639
i like it it smells good yeah it's uh

166
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,959
it's doing the job i suspect by the end

167
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,478
of it will be pretty high

168
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,758
that's the mission right it's definitely

169
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,839
the mission but i'm more impressed with

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,680
just like the integrity of the actual

171
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,839
hash tube you know you'd think with the

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,160
heat passing through it it might soften

173
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,799
up

174
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,560
or start melting at the end but this

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,639
stays really nice and firm

176
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
and it smokes really well there's no

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
runs

178
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
oh yeah and although you may think the

179
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,599
majority of the

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,199
the hash is burning off on this joint

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
it's really not the case

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
uh when you smoke them you really get

183
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,839
the idea that you are indeed

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,840
inhaling a lot of it

185
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,680
for anyone who loves that old school

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,519
taste of hash and a joint this is this

187
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,319
is the way absolutely

188
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,359
with no paper and no glue and no

189
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,919
cannabis

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,919
i call it um pizza without the box

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
got that closed again it's as hard to

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,038
close as it was to open

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,639
they're tough they're tough

194
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,159
we're cannabis people and we did spend

195
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
enough time in the legacy

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,919
that of course we're going to be

197
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,360
critical this is just the natural way if

198
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,879
you've ever looked at new people who are

199
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
coming into the industry who are just so

200
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,319
gung-ho and excited and god bless their

201
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,720
hearts for that

202
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
we've lived for some decades in the

203
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,599
industry

204
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,439
and you get you get a little bit a bit

205
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,959
critical when you do that so we're going

206
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,719
to be honest with you you know like dom

207
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,799
said the packaging just isn't the best

208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
packaging it did get us to market but

209
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
let's be a little bit more conscious in

210
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
the future

211
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
of people who have difficulty opening

212
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,120
things um and hopefully um

213
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,360
you know change things up a little bit

214
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
but yeah that is just burning

215
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,878
lovely i'll have to get this shirt

216
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,919
changed my hash melts

217
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,919
except when it's hazel

218
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,719
i always really enjoyed these at

219
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,800
concerts yeah

220
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,479
man i'll tell you when i stopped smoking

221
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,319
joints and it was like okay

222
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:08,719
like am i gonna do a vape

223
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
a pen yeah i'm like you know a pen's not

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
gonna hit you like a dab and then it's

225
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,719
like well am i gonna sneak in my torch

226
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,400
and my rig and my and all my dab i

227
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
remember actually i went to a michael

228
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,318
frontier concert

229
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
in uh stanley park at nalton bowl and i

230
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,720
had a big like at the time it was red

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
eye because

232
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
it was not heady at all i've just gone

233
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,199
out of high school i'm pretty sure was

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
this 2005

235
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
i think so yeah it was like it was

236
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,440
launched who opened up for them uh

237
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,559
the reggaetonius i believe i believe a

238
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,399
spanish reggae band

239
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,838
yeah um anyway i went there and i

240
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
brought my my like my two

241
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,000
two foot like red eye glass bong with me

242
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,440
through security

243
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
and then had to like bargain with them

244
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
to let me keep it as long as i didn't

245
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
smoke it inside

246
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,360
but you know that was that's who i was i

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
was bringing my bond to the concert i

248
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,800
was supposed to be at that concert

249
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,519
but i got the call the night before

250
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,199
that my father and his wife were killed

251
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
in a motorcycle accident

252
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
very suddenly it was one of the worst

253
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,479
moments of my life

254
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,319
and in fact the day that that concert

255
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,879
happened i ended up on a plane to go

256
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
back to winnipeg to deal with

257
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,200
you know the things that you have to

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,120
deal with as you get older when your

259
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
parents are dying or siblings or

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,799
you know heavy [ __ ] sometimes happens in

261
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,639
life but i knew the minute he mentioned

262
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,439
that michael frante concert i was like i

263
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,278
would have been there

264
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
i go to michael frante no matter where

265
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,559
he is whether it's whistler whether it's

266
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,720
at malcolm bowl whether it's in

267
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,159
in an indoor venue in in vancouver i

268
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,399
would be at that show

269
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,439
um that's the only one i missed it was a

270
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,360
powerful show

271
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
i heard i remember it was beautiful

272
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,959
sunny afternoon and

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,399
it started pouring down rain in the

274
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,439
middle of the set and they just started

275
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,720
covering up all the

276
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
all the electronics and everyone just

277
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
started dancing harder and he started

278
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,799
singing harder and it was just like it

279
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,360
was this

280
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,120
crazy crazy vibe like there's not many

281
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
concerts that had so many people really

282
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,000
all on the same level

283
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
what a great venue too like not very

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,278
many people know malcolm bowle

285
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,439
in stanley park if you've visited

286
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,958
stanley park you for sure won't know it

287
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,480
you could live in this city for many

288
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,559
many many years and not know that

289
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,320
malcolm bowle is literally smack dab in

290
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,879
the middle of this park and it's this

291
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,040
really cool kind of amphitheater

292
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,879
little field you know it's just that

293
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,919
when you walk in there you know that

294
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,600
like something special

295
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,439
could possibly happen it's just like

296
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
it's a great great spot for a venue

297
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,640
you're just like they're one with nature

298
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,480
it's a nice outdoor concert

299
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,639
wow i've been doing good on this i have

300
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
smoked this much faster than i normally

301
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
do

302
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,879
we're not even at 10 minutes dom i'm

303
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
pretty impressed they taste good you

304
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,759
know what i'm gonna be like honest like

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
i'm super super critical like if there's

306
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,399
anything that i can taste on the

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
on the inhale whether it's bitterness or

308
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,360
anything like i'll i'll be the first to

309
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,839
tell you and i

310
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,919
don't get much negative taste out of

311
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,240
this it's like a death bubba

312
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,278
it's smooth at the end i suggest not

313
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,879
squeezing it too hard

314
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,559
because you'll do what i just did yeah

315
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,879
yeah but but you can puff it back

316
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,958
throw it into a pipe and and hit it it

317
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,919
is now towards a roach mine is actually

318
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,879
still

319
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,879
completely perfect in every way it

320
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,399
hasn't uh it hasn't crushed out but that

321
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,879
right there happens a lot when you pass

322
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,559
them

323
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,480
if you get that one guy trust the

324
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,958
integrity don't squeeze it it's true

325
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,639
um but this is nice it tastes good you

326
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,000
know like it's got a clean burn like i'm

327
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,519
not really getting any bitterness

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
like there's nothing kind of foul there

329
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,240
like the input material

330
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,360
was decently clean for this bubble and

331
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,039
dry sift

332
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
yeah like you know what it's not it's

333
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,759
not melty because it doesn't need to be

334
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,119
